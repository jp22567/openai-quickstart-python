The purpose was to add a China extension period, in order to extend Chinese enrollment bey ond the global study period to achieve the locall y required sample size. (Note: Editorial changes were made to original rationale.) 030-02 18- SEP-18 Based on the results of a study conducted in participants with severe renal impairment and moderate renal impairment, the expected increas e in exposure to MK -7264 in participants with moderate renal impairment is not anticipated to lead to an increased risk of clinicall y relevant adverse events. Therefore, another major update included in this amendment is that of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) criterion for participant exclusion; updated from a cut -off of <50 mL /min/1.73 m2to cut -off of <30 mL /min/1.73 m2.Participants with an eGFR of≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2at Screening with unstable renal function (define d as a ≥50% increase of serum creatinine compared to a value obtained at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit) were also excluded. Clarifications of certain sections and procedures, as detailed below, were also made in the protocol during the creat ion of this amendment. 030-01 13- DEC -17 Removal of special characters in inclusion and exclusion criteria to support study database.

The importance of cough as a clinical problem globally has led to multiple societies publishing guidelines on the dia gnosis and management of cough [Morice, A. H., et al 2004] [Chung, K. F., et al 2006] [Morice, A. H., et al 2006] [The committee for The Japanese Respiratory Society guidelines 20 06] [Kardos, P., et al 2010] . In these clinical guidelines, cough is categorized based upon the duration of t he cough; within each category acute, sub-acute, and chronic are likely diagnostic possibilities [Irwin, R. S., et al 2006] . Acute c ough is present for less than 3 weeks and most often due to acute viral upper respiratory tract infection. A cough thathas been present longer than 3 weeks is either sub- acute (3 to 8 weeks) or chronic (>8weeks). Chronic cough may affect up to approximately 12% of the adu lt population [Chamberlain, S. A., et al 2015] . For approximately two-thirds of these patients, a potential co- morbid condition can be identified and the cough effectively managed b y optimizing therap y for the condition. A minority of patients with a potential co -morbid condition cannot be effectivel y manag ed by optimizing therap y for the condition and are considered to have refractory chronic cough. Also, the cause of chronic cough remains unexplained in 5% to 10% of patients seeking medical attention specific to their cough [Gibson, P., et al 2016] . This protocol aims to study participants with either refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough. Professional guidelines describe s ystematic approaches to the evaluation and management of chronic cough. The se guidelines are based largel y on consensus opinion and observational data from the medical literature. There are currently no treatments approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of chronic cough. Given the prolonged nature, significant morbidity , and lack of effective treatment, unexplained or refractory chronic cough is a major unmet medical need. Mechanism of Cough Each cough occurs through the stimulation of a complex reflex arc. Cough is initiated following activation of airway sensory nerves in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Airway sensory nerves are tailored to detect changes in the phy sical and chemical environment, and if required, elicit protective reflex events such as cough. These reflexes are normally protective; however, in disease, airway reflexes can become h yper responsive, leading to an increase in sy mptoms and a pathologic cough. P2X3 receptors are ligand -gated ion channels that respond to adenosine triph osphate (ATP) and are almost exclusively localized on C -fiber sensory neurons, which innervate the upper and lower airway s and are the main nerve fibers responsible for cough. Adenosine triphosphate is released by damaged, stressed, and inflamed tissues. The action of ATP at sensory neurons in the periphery and spinal cord contributes to neural excitability and may cause h yper responsiveness through binding to P2X3 containing receptors and stimulating of C-fiber neurons [North, R. A. 2004] [Khakh, B. S. 2006] . Antagonism of P2X3 -containing 0575PQ 06F80P"
28,page_28,"PRODUCT: MK-7264 28 PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:030-04 MK-7264 -030-04 FI NAL PROTOCOL 26-APR -2019 receptors is predicted to normalize sensory neuron sensitivity , based on data from P2X3 knock- out mice and the effects of small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) knock -down and pharmacological antagonists [Barclay , J., et al 2002] [Cockay ne, D. A., et al 2000] [Souslova, V., et al 2000] . Adenosine triphosphate and P2X3 -containing receptors have been shown to be in volved in airway s sensitization and their involvement provides a rationale for P2X3 antagonism in the treatment of cough. Cough Hypersensitivity Syndrome Recently , the term cough hy persensitivity syndrome has been proposed to describe a group of patients with chronic cough and si milar clinical characteristics [Chung, K. F. 2014] . These similar clinical characteristics include irritation in the throat or upper chest, cough triggered by stimuli that do not normall y cause cough , increased cough sensitivity to inhaled stimuli, and cough parox ysms. A potential biologic explanation for cough h ypersensitivity syndrome suggests an associated sensory neuropathy characterized by sensory nerve hyper-sensitization. Sensory nerves are susceptible to sensitization by neuroactive mediators and altered expression of ion channels which regulate sensory nerve excitability to man y chemical stimuli. As described above, the action of ATP at sensory neurons may cause h yper responsivene ssthrough binding to P2X3 containing receptors and contribute to the pathophy siology of patients with chronic cough. As described elsewhere in the protocol, the data from Protocol 012 support the role of P2X3 antagonism in the treatment of patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. MK-7264 Development Program MK-7264, a P2X3 receptor antagonist, is a clinical agent being developed for the treatment of cough. The current MK -7264 cough development plan consists of two 12 -month Phase 3 studies in participants with refractory o r unexplained chronic cough: 1 study (Protocol 027) with a 12-week Main study period and a 40 -week Extension study period, and a second study (Protocol 030) with a 24 -week Main stud y period and a 28 -week Extension study period. 2.1 Study Rationale The purpose of this stud y is to evaluat e the efficacy and safet y of MK -7264, an orall y available P2X3 antagonist, in participants, at least 18 y ears of age, who have either refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Current therapies for a cute and sub-acute cough (narcotic, non -narcotic, and over -the-counter medications) have limited and/or unproven efficacy and an undesirable side effect profile. There are currently no approved therapies for chronic cough. Previous Phase 2 studies have de monstrated dose -related efficacy and an acceptable safet y and tolerability profile for MK -7264 in participants with refractory or un explained chronic cough (see MK -7264 Investigat or’s Brochure [IB]). This Phase 3 study will evaluat e the efficacy and safet yof MK -7264 in participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. 0575PQ 06F80P"

MK -7264 has also been evaluated in an extensive nonclinical program. MK-7264 is an oral treatment provided as a film coated tablet. The MK -7264 tablets provided f or this study contain either MK -7264 4 5mg or 15 mg. The placebo tablets provided in this study are indistinguishable from the MK -7264 tablets, respectivel y, in appearance. The placebo tablets contain no MK -7264, but contain the same inactive excipients as those included in the active tablets. 2.2.2 Phase 3 Studies in Adults The Sponsor in tends to conduct a second Phase 3 study of MK -7264 (Protocol 027) in adult participants with refractory or unexplained chroni c cough. The design of Protocol 027 will, in most aspects, be similar to Protocol 030. The main difference between the 2 studies will be the length of the Main study period which will be a total of 12 weeks in Protocol 027 compared to 24 weeks in Protocol 030. 2.3 Benefit/Risk Asse ssment It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit from treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information about the safet y and effectiveness of an investigational medicine. MK-7264 has been evaluated in an extensive nonclinical program. To date, there is little evidence f rom nonclinical studies that MK -7264 has an y direct cellular or direct target organ toxicity . In the completed and ongoing clinical studies, no major safet y concerns have been noted. Across studies, taste -related AEs were the most frequent reported AEs. The rationale for taste disturbance exists with P2X2/3 antagonism because of the putative participation of ATP, acting via this receptor, in transducing taste signals from taste buds cells to gustatory sensory nerves . The taste -related AEs are considered mechanism based non serious adverse drug reactions and are expected for MK -7264. To date, they have been full y and rapidly reversible after discontinuation of the drug. Overall, based on growing clinical evidenc e supporting the efficacy of MK-7264 in participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough described in other sections of the protocol and the lack of significant safet y findings in completed and ongoing nonclinical and clinical studies, the ben efit risk balance of MK-7264 is assessed as positive. 0575PQ 06F80P"

Study site staff or mobile research nurse services may be utilized (if locally available and approved for use), so participants have the opportunity totravel to the study site on 1 day instead of tra veling to the study site for 2 consecutive day s. Individual participation is expected to be approximately 56 weeks from Screening through the Follow -up period. Specific procedures to be performed during the study , as well as their prescribed times and associated visit windows, are outlined in the SoA in Section 1.3. Details of each procedure are provided in Section 8. This study will use an adaptive design based on pre -specified criteria, using an independent, external Data Monitor ing Committee (DMC) to monitor safet y and efficacy. There will be 1planned interim efficacy anal ysis when approximately 40% of the total randomized participants have completed, or discontinued prior to completion of the Main study period. The study may bestopped for futility according to the results of the interim anal ysis. Results of the interim analy sis will be reviewed by the external DMC, which will make recommendations to the Executive Oversight Committee (EOC) of the Sponsor to continue, modify or stop the study according to the plan described in Section 9. An initial database lock will occur after all participants have completed, or discontinued prior to completion of the Main study period, and a full anal ysis will be conducted. The final database lock will be conducted when all participants have completed, or discontinued prior to the completion of, the Extension study period. Details of the blinding are in Section 9.2. 4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design 4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoint s 4.2.1.1 Efficacy Endpoints The primary efficacy endpoint is the 24 -hour coughs per hour (ie, average hourly cough frequency based on 24 -hour sound recordings) at Week 24. Cough counts will be measured using a digital recording device (VitaloJAK™, Vitalograph, Bu ckingham, United Kingdom ; 0575PQ 06F80P"
34,page_34,"PRODUCT: MK-7264 34 PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:030-04 MK-7264 -030-04 FI NAL PROTOCOL 26-APR -2019 hereafter referred to as cough monitor ). Worn similar to a Holter monitor, with microphones affixed to the participant’s chest wall and attached to the participant’s clothing, the cough monitor provides high fidelity recordings an d facilitates signal processing to accuratel y identify and quantify cough. Digital recordings will be processed in Vitalograph’s centralized reading center, where recordings are condensed using a computer algorithm before human analysts identify and tag in dividual coughs. The output of this process is a count of coughs for each 24 hour recording period, as well as cough counts for portions of the day when the participant is awake and asleep. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that MK -7264 is effective in the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough, as evidenced b y a change (r eduction) from baseline at Week 24 in 24- hour coughs per hour in MK-7264 relative to placebo. Utilizing 2 -hour coughs per hour as the primary endpoint is further supported with succes sful data from MK-7264 Protocol 012 (see MK -7264 IB). Results from MK -7264 Protocol 012 demonstrated statistically significant reduction , in change from baseline in 24 -hour coughs per hour, with 50 mg MK-7264 BID compared to placebo at Week 12. The first secondary endpoint of this study is awake coughs per hour at Week 24. As described above, the 24- hour period can be divided into periods of awake and asleep. In MK-7264 Protocol 012, awake baseline cough rates were numerically higher th an 24 -hour baseline cough rates and significantl y higher than sleep cough rates. Based on these data, awake time may be a meaningful time period for participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Therefore ,awake coughs per hour will be evaluat ed as a secondary endpoint in this study . The impact of chronic cough on health -related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed by the LCQ is included as the second secondary endpoint. The goal is to demonstrate that a greater proportion of participants treate d with MK -7264 relative to placebo achieve a clinically meaningful improvement from base line in HRQoL defined as a ≥1.3- point increase in the LCQ total sc ore at Week 24. The L CQ is a 19 -item cough- specific HRQoL questionnaire which contains 3 domains (phy sical, psy chological and social), calculated as a mean score for each domain ranging from 1 to 7 and total score ranging from 3 to 21. Each item on the LCQ assesses s ymptoms or the impact of s ymptoms on HRQoL over the past 2 weeks using a 7-point L ikert sca le ranging from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL. Data obtained from the LCQ will provide information on the impact of chronic cough on patients’ daily lives, bey ond objective cough counts and severity , which is valuable information for assessin g the full benefit of effective cough control. 0575PQ CCI 06F80P"

The CSD is a 7-item, disease -specific PRO measure with a recall period of “today ”. The measure evaluates frequency of cough (3 items), inte nsity ofcough (2 items) and disruption (2items); each item is rated on an 11- point scale ranging from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating greater se verity . A CSD total score and 3 domain scores (frequency , intensit y, disruption) can be calculated. TheCough Severity VAS is a single -item question asking the participant to rate t he severit y of their cough “today ” using a 100 mm VAS anchored with “No Cough” at 0 and “Extremely Severe Cough” at 10 0. Similar to the well -established use of VAS scores in chronic pain, the Cough Severit y VAS measure pro vides a quick, valid and easil y-interpreted subjective assessment useful for clinicians to monitor improvement of their chronic cough patients following treatment. consistent with the provisional benchmarks outlined by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessm ent in Clinical Trials which recommends that an improvement of approximately 30% on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale can be considered clinically meaningful [Dwork in, R. H., et al 2009] . 4.2.1.2 Safety Endpoints The safet y data for MK-7264 to date has bee n described in detail in the MK -7264 IB. In support of the safet y objective to evaluate the safet yand tolerability profile of MK-7264, the safet y and tolerability endpoints will be assessed by clinical evaluatio n of AEs and inspection of other stud y parameters including vital signs, physical examination, and standard laboratory safety tests at timepoints specified in the SoA.

Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses will be condu cted to understand the exposure -response relationships between MK-7264 and e fficacy and safety data. 4.2.1.4 Pharmacodynamic Endpoints No pharmacod ynamic biomarkers that will require modeling are planned for this study. 4.2.1.5 Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research 4.2.1.5.1 Planned Genetic Analysis Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to therap y, susceptibility to, severit y, and progression of disease. Variable response to therap y ma y be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/ or molecular subty pe of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and I RB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA anal ysis from consenting participants. DNA samples will be used for research related to the study intervention(s), t he disease under study , and related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assay s including diagnostic tests related to the disease under study, related diseases, and study intervention(s). Genetic research may consist of the analy sis of 1 or mor e candidate genes or the anal ysis of genetic markers throughout the genome [or anal ysis of the entire genome] (as appropriate). DNA samples will be analy zed for variation across the entire genome. Analy ses may be conducted if it is hy pothesized that this m ay help furthe r understand the clinical data. The samples may be analy zed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to understand study disease or related conditions. 4.2.1.6 Future Biomedical Research The Sponsor will conduct future biomedical research on DNA spe cimens for which consent was pr ovided during this clinical study . Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere in the protocol (as part of the main study ) and will only be conducted on specimens from appropriatel y consented participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for future biomedical research is to explore and identify biomarkers that inform the scientific understanding of dis eases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that participants receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct time.

Partic ipants may discontinue the study intervention at an y time. Given that there is no approved treatment for chronic cough, use of a placebo is justified. 4.3 Justification for Dose 4.3.1 Dose sfor This Study The dose f or this study will be either MK-7264 15 mg BID or MK- 7264 45 mg BID as determined b y the individual allocation per the assigne d treatment group (see Sec tion6). The known mechanism of action of MK -7264 and related clinical study results support that the efficacy of MK-7264 in decreasing cough, and the prevalence of the most common AE, dysgeusia, are both dose related. In order to allow patients and prescribers appropriate flexibility based upon in dividual clinical needs, the MK-7264 deve lopment program has targeted 2 differ ent doses to study in the Phase 3 program. 4.3.2 Maximum Dose/Exposure for This Study The maximum dose/exposure for this study will be at 45mg BID. Par ticipants who are administered MK-7264 (either 15 mg BID or 45 mg BID) will be exposed to MK -7264 for approximately 365 days (see Sec tion6). 4.3.3 Rationale for Dose Interval and Study Design In this stud y, MK-7264 will be orally administered as MK-7264 45 mg BID and 15 mg BID based on the safet y and PK efficacy results observed to date. Based on PK studies, MK-7264 is rapidl y absorbed with a median ti me to reach maximum plasma concentration of 1.0 to 2.0 hours. I n addition, the half -life of MK-7264 is approximately 7 to 10 hours and consistent with a BID dosing schedule. For this study , 24weeks duration of intervention for the Main study period was s elected based on regulatory guidance regarding duration of therap y for s ymptomatic treatment in chronic diseases. The study includes an extension for a total duration of intervention of up to 1 year, in order to provide a more robust assessment of the long er-term safet y, tolerability and efficacy of MK-7264 in the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. 4.4 Beginning and End ofStudy Definition The overall study begins when the first participant signs the ICF. The overall study ends when the last participant completes the last study -related telephone -call or visit, withdraws from the study , or is lost to follow -up (ie, the participant is unable to be contacted b y the investigator). 0575PQ 06F80P"

Any AE data from the participant comment card will be entered into the eCRF with appropriate assessments made b y the investigator. Any concomitant therapy data from the partici pant comment card will be entered as appropriate into the eCRF. 8.1.7 Assignment of Screening Numb er All consented participants will be given a unique screening number that will be used to identify the participant for all procedures that occur prior to randomiza tion.Each participant will be assigned onl y 1 screening number. Screening numbers must not be re -used for different participants. Any participant who is screened multiple times will retain the original screening number assigned at the initial screening vi sit. Specific details on the screening /rescreening visit requirements are provided in Section 8.10.1. 8.1.8 Assignment of Treatment/Randomization Numb er All eligible participants will be randomly allocated and will receive a treatment /randomization number. The treatment /randomization number identifies the participant for all procedures occurring after treatment allocation/randomization. Once a treatment /randomization number is assigned to a participant, it can never be re -assigned to another participant. A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 treatment /randomization number. 8.1.9 Study Intervention Administrati on The distribution of study intervention will be witnessed b y the investigator and/or study staff at the study site visits. Since MK-7264 45 mg and 15 mg will differ in appearance and have corresponding matching placebos, participants will receive 2 study intervention bottles (ie, either MK -7264 45 mg and placebo matched to MK-7264 15 mg ORMK-7264 15mg and placebo matched to MK -7264 45 mg ORplacebos matched to MK-7264 45 mg and 15 mg).

In this situation, the reques t for specimen withdrawal cannot be processed. 8.1.11 Participant Blinding/Unblindi ng STUDY INTERVENT ION IDENT IFICATION INFORMAT ION IS TO BE UNMASKED ONLY IF NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PARTICIPANT. EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE NOT TO UNBLIND THE PARTI CIPANT UNLESS NECESSARY. For emergency situations where the investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) needs to identify the study intervention used b y a participant and /or the dosage administered , he/she will contact the e mergency unblinding call center by telephone and make a request for emergency unblinding. As requested b y the investigator or medically qualified designee, the emergency unblinding call center will provide the information to him/her promptly and report unb linding to the Sponsor. Prior to contacting the emergency unblinding call center to request unblinding of a participant’s intervention assignment, the investigator who is a qualified physician should make reasonable attempts to enter the intensit yof the A Es observed, the relation to study intervention, the reason thereof , etc., in the medical chart. If it is not possible to record this assessment in the chart prior to the unblinding, the unblinding should not be delayed. In the event that unblinding has oc curred, the circumstances around the unblinding (eg, date, reason, and person performing the unblinding) must be documented promptly, and the Sponsor Clinical Director notified as soon as possible. Once an emergency unblinding has taken place, the principa l investigator, site personnel, and Sponsor personnel may be unblinded so that the appropriate follow -up medical care can be provided to the participant . Participants whose trea tment assignment has been unblinded by the investigator or medicall y qualified designee and/or nonstudy treating ph ysician must be discontinued from study intervention, but should continue to be monitored in the study.

If a participant has confirmed MK -7264 crystals, it will be known that t he partic ipant was receiving MK -7264, but not which dose . In this circumstance, formal non -emergency unblinding should not be performed . 8.1.12 Calibration of Equipme nt The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinica l study that provides information about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained is reliable and/or reproducible. Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documentation at the study site. 8.2 Efficacy Assessmen ts Compliance with the efficacy and safety assessments (along with study intervention use) is essential, and an y non -complia nce noted b y the investigator or designee should result in consultation with the participant on corrective measures needed to ensure compliance. 8.2.1 Objective Cough Counts The assessment of 24 -hour coughs per hour (ie, average hourl y cough frequency based on 24-hour sound recordings) will be evaluated using the VitaloJAK™ cough monitor, a 510k approved device (Premarket Notification per the US Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act) that has been implemented successfully in clinical studies of potential cough therapies, i ncluding 2Phase 2 studies of MK-7264. The VitaloJAK™ cough monitor is a digit al recording device that uses 2 input channels: biometric sensor and air microphone. The first records sounds from the lungs and trachea through a chest contact biometric sensor, which is attached to the skin at the top of the sternum. The second channel captures ambient sounds through a lapel air microphone. The device will be carried in a cloth belt bag worn around the participants’ waist, and all sounds the participant makes du ring cough monitoring will be recorded on the compact flash (CF) card. The CF card contains the full, raw, sound recording data that is the output from the validated cough monitor and is the source for the recording data. The sound recordings on the CF car ds are uploaded to the Vitalograph Web Portal for storage and anal ysis to generate cough data per Vitalograph standard operating procedures , and the Web Portal is the source for the cough counts data. Sites will be uploading the CF card recording s to the V italograph Web Portal; however, if after troubleshooting the sites are unsuccessful, the site will securel y ship the CF card to 0575PQ 06F80P"

Long -term storage of the CF cards may be done by Vitalograph for those sites unable to provide long- term storage of the cards. When the digital recording arrives at the central reading center, a human analyst uses standardized criteria to identify transitions between awake and asleep states . To reduce review time, the 24- hour recordings are processed th rough a computerized algorithm that removes periods of silen ce and a high proportion of non -cough sounds. A cough anal yst then evaluates the abbreviated recording b y listening to both audio channels and inspecting the visual wave form of potential cough so unds. The anal yst tags the explosive portion of each cough using software built for anal ysis and annotation of sound recordings (Vitalograph Web Portal). Cough counts are then t allied automatically for the 24 -hour period from the annotated audio file. Awake cough counts are tallied only during the time the participant is determined to be awake for the awake coughs per hour assessment. The cough monitor will be attac hed to the participant at Visit 2 and the day before for Visits 4-9andDiscontinuation, during the Main study period (see Section 1.3). Attachment should occur before approximately 11 AM and the cough monitor should be worn for 24 hours (see VitaloJAK™ site manual for further details). The participant should not remove the cough monitor duri ng the 24 -hour period; the monitor will be removed during the actual visit, at the clinic, by site staff the next day . The f irst dose of study intervention admin istered is at V isit3 after the cough monitor is removed, after the pre -dose PK sample collecti on, and before approximately 11AM. Attachment of the cough monitor may be managed by study site staff or mobile nurses if available and approved. On the day of a study site visit after Visit 3 (or mobile nurse visit where applicable) when the cough monito r will be attached, study intervention dosing should occur prior to the cough monitor being turned on. Therefore, the cough monitor should first be attached, the participant should then be dosed, and then the cough monitor should immediately be turned on ( see Figure 2). V =Visit .

On the day of a study site visit when the cough monitor will be removed, the morning dose should not be taken at home and instead will be given as a witnessed dose at the study site. Therefore, dosing will occur after the co ugh monitor is removed (once 24- hour recording has completed), after the pre -dose PK sample collection, and before approximately 11 AM (see Figure 3). PK=Pharmacok inetic; V =Visit . Figure 3Cough Monitoring: Removal Procedure It is recommended that the monitor first be removed (once the 24 -hour recording has completed) to avoid an y interference. Pre -dose PK should then be collected, prior to study intervention dosing. All visits, where the cough monitor will be attached/removed, should be scheduled p rior to 11AM to meet the attachment/removal timeframes as well as the PK sample collection(s), and study site dosing requirements. If cough data is not usable and patient is required to return to the clinic to repeat , it should only be repeated upon Sponsor approval . Participants who discontinue study intervention early will continue to be monitored in the study and should be encouraged to con tinue t o complete the assessment of 24 -hour coughs per hour for the remaining visits (as outlined in the SoA) through the end of the study. 8.2.2 Electronic Patient -reported Outcomes At Screening (Visit 1), each participant will be properly trained and instructe d on the use of an electronic diary (eDiary ) for completing the ePRO measures.

A score of ≥40mm on the Cough Severi ty VAS, at both the Screening and Baseline visits is required for randomization into the study . During the Extension study period, completion of the Cough Severity VAS will be required daily , atapproximately the same time for a 1week period beginning 1 week prior to Visit 11 and beginning 1 week prior to Visit 13. Participants should be contacted (eg, by telephone or text) during the Extension study period to remind them to complete the Cough Severity VAS during these weeks. 8.2.2.4 12-item Short Form Survey The SF-12 is a validated, 1 2-item questionnaire de signed to assess general health- related quality of life. It is a widely used instrument that has been shown to be responsive to changes in disease severity following intervention. Th e SF-12 is scored such that a total score and 8domain scores can be calculated with higher scores indicating better function ing: Phy sical Functioning, Role -Physical, Role -Emotional, Bodily Pain, General Health, Social 0575PQ 06F80P"

Data obtained from the SF-12 will be us ed in health economic anal yses. 8.2.2.5 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire The WPAI questionnaire y ields four ty pes of scores as follows: (1) absenteeism (work time missed); (2) presenteeism (impairm ent at work / reduced on -the-job effectiveness); (3) work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism); and (4) activity impairment. The WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less pr oductivity , ie, worse outcomes. Participants will be asked to indicate if they are currentl y emplo yed and to respond to the following questions referring to “the past 7 days”: work hours missed due to health problems, work hours missed for other reasons, hours actually worked, the degree to which their health has affected productivity while working, and the degree to which their health affected productivity in regular unpaid activities. 8.2.2.6 EuroQoL 5L Dimensions Questionnaire The EQ5D -5L is a standardized inst rument for measuring generic health status used for estimating preference weights for that health status. By combining the weight with time, quality adjusted life years can be computed. The EQ5D- 5L descriptive s ystem comprises t he following 5 dimensions: m obility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression. Each dimension has 5 levels and the participant will be asked to indica te their health state using a 5- level rating scale. The EQ VAS records the part icipant’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS where the endpoints are labeled ‘best imaginable health state’ and “worst imaginable health state”. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual participant. 8.2.2.7 Patient Global Impressio n of Change Questionnaire Participants will be asked to rate the change in their chronic cough compared to the start of the study using the PGIC with response options ranging from “ very much improved” to “very much worse”. 8.2.2.8 Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire Unlike the other cough questionnaires used in this study (ie, LCQ, CSD, and Cough Severit y VAS), the HARQ was designed as an aid to diagnosis rather than assess quality of life impacts or cough severity. The HARQ has demonstrated good psychometric properties and no redundant items. The HARQ consists of 14 questions with responses on a numeric scale from 0 to 5. A score of ‘‘0’’ means that no problems are caused b y the cough s ymptom and ‘‘5’’ means severe/frequent problems. The HARQ will be used to more completely characterize the patient population. 0575PQ 06F80P"

The total amount of blood/tissue to be drawn/collected over the course of the stud y (from prestud y to poststudy visits), including approximate blood/tissue volumes drawn/collected by visit and by sample type per particip ant, can be found in Section 8. Planned timepoints for all safet y assessments are provided in the SoA. 8.3.1 Ches t Radiography/Computed Tomography Thorax Scan A chest radiograph or computer tomograph y scan of the thorax should be performed locall y for participants, at Screening, if this has not been done within the last 5 years and after the onset of chronic cough. T he chest radiograph or computer tomograph y scan of the thorax should not demonstrate any abnormality considered to be significantly contributing to the chronic cough or an y other clinicall y significant lung disease in the opinion of the principal investiga tor (or sub- investigator, see inclusion criterion 1, Section 5.1 ). 8.3.2 Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination will include assessments of the following: general appearance; skin and ly mphatic; ey es, ears, nose, throat; cardiovascular s ystem; res piratory system; abdomen/gastrointestinal sy stem; urological sy stem; musculoskeletal and neurological s ystems. Other body systems may be examined. Any clinically significant abnormalities in phy sical examinations noted after Visit 1 will be recorded as AEs in the eCRF . A brief directed ph ysical exam may be performed at any study site visit that does not alread y include a ph ysical exam if deemed necessary by the investigator due to signs/sy mptoms. A physical exam (complete or directed) can be performed at a ny unscheduled visit if deemed necessary by the investigator. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses . 8.3.3 Vital Signs and Weight and Height Measurements Vital sign measurements, including s ystolic blo od pressure (mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), heart rate (beats per minute), respiratory rate (breaths per minute), and body temperature (in centigrade) will be collected as outlined in the SoA. All blood pressure measurements should be performed on the same arm, preferabl y by the same person. Height (cm) and weight (kg) will also be collected as per the SoA.

Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded in the AE eCRF. 8.3.5 Spirometry A spirometry assessment will be performed locally at Screening using a calibrated spirometer. Assess ments will include FEV 1, FVC, and FEV 1/FVC ratio. Spirometry should be performed in accordance with guidelines established by the ATS/ERS (Available from: http://www.thoracic.org/statements/). For safet y reasons, spirometry should be performed with the par ticipant sitting, using a chair with arms and without wheels; however, if necessary to undertake the testing with the participant standing or in another position, this should be noted in the participant’s study file. Spirometry performed within the past y ear of screening is acceptable if the investigator confirms that spirometry was done during a period where the participant was clinically stable (eg, not during an upper respiratory infection). 8.3.6 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments •Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency . •The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) must review the laboratory repor t, document this review, and record an y clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the case report form (CRF). The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findi ngs are those which are not associated with the underly ing disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. •All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA . •If laboratory values from nonprotocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SL AB). •For an y laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or wi thin7days after the last dose of study intervention , every attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator . 0575PQ 06F80P"

Participants will be monitored for hematuria using urinary dipstick (performed at the stud y site) and ur inary crystals and hematuria through urinaly sis (performed at the central laboratory ).Dipstick and urinaly ses (including microscop y) will be collected as outlined in the SoA. If during screening, a participant has cry stalluria and/or unexplained hematuria (defined as , for example , participants without a history of recent menses, urinary tract infection, or recent procedure/instrumentation that would explain the hematuria ; Note: An y other explanation for hematuria finding must be reviewed with the Sponsor. ), the investigator should : Review and confirm if the finding is a new finding or a previousl y documented finding . Evaluate the participant’s medical history to identify conditions (ie,prior renal disease, prior history of kidney stones, medications, gastrointestinal conditions) and make a clinical determination if the participant is at high or low risk of potential complications/worsening due to an associated renal/urinary condition or its treatment, or requires a change in therap y for that condition that may interfere with interpretation of safet y data collected during the study . If high risk, the participant should notbe enrolled and should be considered for further evaluation. If low risk, the participant may continue with screening. If after rando mization, the participant has confirmed, unexplained hematuria and/or urinary crystals per the central laboratory , an additional urine sample will need to be collected. One half of the sample will be sent to the central laboratory for reconfirmation of une xplained hematuria and/or urinary crystals. The other half of the sample will be collected via a specialized filter and shipped to Sponsor or designee andassessed for the presence of MK-7264 urinary crystals via Raman spectroscopy . Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to the chemical s tructure of the molecule and MK -7264 has a unique chemical structure compared to common urinary crystals. See vendor’s site manual for further procedural details. Ifa participant has confirmed MK-7264 urinary crystals, the S ponsor will inform the investigator and require discontinuation of the participant from study intervention with the recommendation to follow -up at approximately 2-week intervals with additional specialized urine anal yses perfo rmed until resolution of the MK -7264 urinary crystals.Once a participant has confirmed MK -7264 cry stals, it will be known that the participant was receiving MK-7264 (formal unblinding should not be performed [see Section 8.1.11]). 0575PQ 06F80P"

Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legall y authorized representative). The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safet y events. Investigators remain responsible for following up AE, SAEs, and other reportable safety events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3. The investigator, who is a qualified ph ysician, will assess events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safet y events with respect to seriousness, intensity /toxicity and causality . 8.4.1 Time Pe riod and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/randomization must be reported b y the inv estigator if the participant is receiving placebo run -in or other run -in treatment, if the event cause the participant to be excluded from the study , or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinua tion of usual therap y, diet, or a procedure. From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through last stud y-related intervention safet y follow -up telephone call, all AEs, SAEs and other reportable safet y events must be reported b y the investigator; however, for those participants who discontinued from the stud y intervention but continuing to be monitored onl y the adverse events and other reportable safet y events as shown in Table 3 need to be reported from completion of the safet y follow - up telephone call/visit following cessation of intervention to the last study -related off - intervention telephone call/visit . Additionally , any SAE brought to the attention of an inve stigator at an y time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph must be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the event is considered drug -related. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AE or SAE or other reportable safet y events in former stud y participants. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 0575PQ 06F80P"

Previously reported pregnancies/lactations exposure need to be followed for co mpletion/termination; report outcome. 8.4.2 Method of Detecting AE s, SAE s,and Other Reportable Safety Events Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE and other reportable safet y events. Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE, SAE, and other reportable safet y events including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, events of clinical interest (ECI), cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). In addition, the investigator will make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in randomized participants for outcome. Further information on follow -upprocedures is given in Appendix 3. 8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of particip ants and the safety of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation are met. The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y intervention under clinical inv estigation. All AEs will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs, and investigators in accordance with all applicable global laws and regul ations (ie, per ICH Topic E6 (R2 ) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice [GCP] ). Investigator safety reports m ust be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR s) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . 0575PQ 06F80P"

All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy . Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign h ydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and s tillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 8.4.6 Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AEs or SAEs There ar e no disease -related events and/or disease -related outcomes not qualify ing as AEs or SAEs. 8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest (ECI s) Selected nonserious and SAEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the Sponsor. Events of clinical interest for this stud y include: An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* *Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The stud y site guidance for assessment and follow- up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent). 8.5 Treatment of Overdose In this stud y, an overdose is any dose higher than the amount of study intervention taken outside the intervention assignment (Section 4.3.2 ).Study intervention should be taken once in the morning and once in the eve ning. If more than the protocol -specified intervention is taken within a 1- dayperiod (ie , >2tablets/day from either bottle ) this is regarded as an overdose. 0575PQ 06F80P"

If an y participant fails to meet the study entry criteria, screening procedures may be repeated once based on investigator judgment after initial screening, and after consultation with the Sponsor. However, participants will not be permitted to rescreen if inclusion criteria for the Cough Sev erity VAS was not met at Visit 1. Participants who are consented and then are considered for washout of prohibited therap y (see Section 6.5), should complete the washout prior to completing other screening procedures. For these individuals, t he screening period would begin after the completion of washout and when the participant returns to the clinic. Participants who washout of prohibited therap y should return to the clinic after washout to complete the remaining Visit 1 procedures. Participants who are consented may , at the investigator’s discret ion, consider beg inning the completion of daily ePROs (CSD and VAS) on the day of Visit 1 prior to completing other screening procedures (in order to first determine if the participant meets the Visit 1 VAS entry criterion). For participants who meet the V isit 1 VAS criterion, t he screening period is noted as starting when the participant has provided consent. Participants who meet the Visit 1 VAS inclusion criterion should return to the clinic as soon as possible (within the recommended scheduling windows) after availability of the Visit 1 VAS score to complete the remaining Visit 1 procedures. 0575PQ 06F80P"

The cough monitor should be attached before approximate ly 11 AM and worn for 24hours. 8.10.3 Main Study Period Participants will be required to be seen in the clinic at Visit 3 to have the cough monitor removed that was attached at Visit 2. Additionally , 1day prior to Visits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 9, and Discontinuation (fr om the Main study period) participants should return to the clinic to have the cough monitor attached. Attachment of the cough monitor at these visits, may be managed b y stud y site staff or mobile nurses (if locally available and approved for use), who will attach the cough monitor at the home of the participant. Cough monitors will be removed at study site Visits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and Discontinuation (from the Main study period). Refer to the vendor’s site manual for additional details. For all stud y site visits, participants are to be reminded to bring their eDiary device with them to the visit. 8.10.4 Extension Study Period Participants will continue their assigned treatments during the 28 -week Extension study period. Cough counts will not be collected during this period. Electronic PRO measures will continue to be completed as outlined in the SoA. 8.10.5 Discontinued Participants Continuing to be Monitored in the Study If a participant is discontinued from the stud y intervention early, the Discontinuation Visit assessm ents are to be performed at the final study site visit. It is intended that all participants should be followed through completion of the study, regardless of premature discontinuation of intervention , unless the participant withdraws consent. Thus, parti cipants who discontinue from study intervention prior to completion of the study should continue to be monitored to obtain relevant information through the end of the study . Study site visits/ telephone calls should be made at timepoints that correspond to each remaining study visit. Such contacts will allow collection of follow -up information, limited to AEs, concomitant medication use, objective cough counting and eDiary assessments as outlined in Section 1.3. Concomitant therapies specifically prohibited (see Section 6.5) while the patient was on study intervention are no longer prohibited after discontinuation of study intervention. 0575PQ 06F80P"

Primary Endpoint 24-hour c oughs per hour at Week 24 Statistical Methods for Key Efficacy AnalysesThe primary anal ysis will be based on the FAS population. The primary anal ysis approach will be conducted ut ilizing the longitudinal anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. I n this model, the response vector consists of the change from baseline in log -transformed 24- hour coughs per hour at each post-Baseline visit. The model will include factors for treatment group, visit, the interaction of treatment group by visit, gender, and region; and the log -transformed baseline value and the interaction of log -transformed baseline value by visit as covariates. The model will use all available 24 -hour coughs per hour data at Baseline and on Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Contrasts will be constructed to compare each of the 2MK-7264 treatment groups to the placebo group at each post-Baseline visit. The least squares mean change from baseline (in log scale) with the associated standard errors will be display ed for each treatment group. Esti mated treatment differences ( MK-7264 − placebo) along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI s) wil l also be presented for each MK-7264 treatment group. I n addition, the geometric mean of the 24 -hour coughs per hour will be presented b y treatment group and b yvisit. The percent differe nce in the change from baseline between MK-7264 and placebo will be estimated by 100*(ediff-1), where diff is the difference provi ded by the analysis of the log -transformed variable. 0575PQ 06F80P"

A separate, blinded Sponsor team (ie, blinded to participant -level intervention assignment) will then be assigned to continue the conduct of the Extension study period. All personnel who are unblinded for the Main study period will be excluded from any future data review at the individual participant level. At the end of the Extension study period, the CSR from the Main study period will be updated to include analy ses of the additional data acquired from the completion of the Extension study period. The investigator site personnel and the participants will be blinded to intervention assignment until the entire study completion. The Clinical Biostatistics department will generate the randomized allocation schedule(s) for study intervention assignment. Unblinding for Interim Efficacy and Safety Analyses Planned interim anal yses are described in Section 9.7. Study enrollment is likely to be ongoing at the time of any interim analy ses. Blinding to intervention assignment will be maintained at all investigational sites. The results of interim anal yses will n ot be shared with the investigators prior to the completion of the study. Results of the interim efficacy and safet y analyses will be provided by the external unblinded statistician to the DMC. Limited additional Sponsor personnel ma y be unblinded to the treatment -level results of the interim anal yses, if required, in order to act on the recommendations of the DMC. The extent to which individuals are unblinded with respect to results of interim anal yses will be documented b y the unblinded statistician. The DMC will serve as the primary reviewer of the results of the interim efficacy and safety analyses and will make recommendations for discontinuation of the study or modification to an EOC of the Sponsor. If the DMC recommends modifications to the design of the protocol or discontinuation of the study , the EOC may be unblinded to the results at the treatment -level in order to act on these recommendations. Additional logistical details will be provided in the DMC Charter. Key aspects of the interim anal yses ar e described in Section 9.7. The external unblinded statistician will not be involved in any discussions regarding modifications to the protocol, statistical methods, identification of protocol deviations, or data validation efforts after the interim anal yses. 9.3 Hypotheses/Estimation The primary and secondary hypotheses for this stud y are stated in Section 3. 9.4 Analysis Endpoints Efficacy and safety endpoints for evaluation are listed below, followed b y the descriptions of the derivations of selected endpoints. 0575PQ 06F80P"

If a participant did not have a sleep time available before the end of the recording session, it will be considered that the participant was awake during the entire session. The last monitoring period of a session will be censored after the end time of the session.

Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy data, regardless of participant exposure to study intervention , will be included in efficacy analy ses. Primary Efficacy Analysis Cough monitoring is conducted for base line and 24 hours after administration of the study intervention on Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. The primary effica cy endpoint of this study is 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 24. As the change from baseline in 24 -hour coughs per hour may have a skewed and wide distribution, the data will be log -transformed prior to analysis for the primary approach. The primary analy sis of the primary endpoint will be on the na tural log scale of the cough rate data. The variable of change from baseline in log-transforme d 24-hour coughs per hour will be used in the anal ysis of the primary endpoint. A negative result indicates a decrease in cough rate, while a positive result indicates an increase in cough rate. The primary anal ysis approach will be conducted utilizing the longitudinal ANCOVA model.

(MSD) Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials I. Introduction A.Purpose MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant s inclinical trials is the overriding concern in the design of clinical trials . In all cases, M SD clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations (eg, International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice [ICH - GCP]) and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. B.Scope Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed f or their execution (eg, contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials , which are not under the full control of M SD. II.Scientific Issues A.Trial Conduct 1.Trial Design Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of M SD or comparator products. Alternatively, M SDmay conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine patient preferences, etc. The design (ie, participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial. P articipants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 2.Site Selection MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access t o appropriate participants, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by M SD personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial. 3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity Investigative t rial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per M SD policies and procedures, if fraud, scientific/research misc onduct, or serious GCP -noncompliance is suspected, the issues 0575PQ 06F80P"

When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified . B. Publication and Authorship Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish primary and secondary results o f its registered trials of marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the prespecified plans for data analysis. To the extent scientifically appropriate, M SDseeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing , in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity. MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the re commendations published by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contri bution to the design and conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. M SD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications. III.Participant Protection A. Ethics Committee Review (Institutiona lReview Board [IRB ]/Independent Ethics Committee [ IEC]) All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before being initiated at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the ethics committee prior to implementation, except changes required urgently to prot ect participant safety that may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval. For each site, the ethics committee and M SDwill approve the participant informed consent form. B. Safety The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials i s that participant welfare is of primary importance. Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local stand ard of care. All p articipation in M SD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is obtained . Participants may withdraw from a n MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them. C. Confidentiality MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or representative), ethics committee, and/or regulator y authorities will have access to confidential medical records t hat might identify the participant by name. D. Genomic Research Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an ethics c ommittee. IV. Financial Considerations A. Paym ents to Investigators Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is M SD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of M SD trials. M SD does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts. MSD does not pay for participant referrals. Howeve r, MSDmay compensate referring physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially eligible participants. 0575PQ 06F80P"

However, the local ethics committee may wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, all publications resulting from M SD trials will indicate M SD as a source of funding. C. Funding for Travel and Other Requests Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices . V. Investigator Commit ment Investigators will be expected to review M SD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. 10.1.2 Financial Disclosure Financial Disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration Regulations, Financial Disclosure b y Clinical I nvestigators (21 CFR Part 54). I t is the Sponsor's responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whet her a request for Financial Disclosure information is required. It is the investigator's/subinvestigator's responsibility to comply with any such request. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by the Sponsor in accordance with 21 CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor to allow for the submission of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further agree to provide this information on a Certification/Disclosure Form, commonly known as a financial disclosure form, provided by the Sponsor. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this information to the Sponsor in the United States for these purposes. This may involve the transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data. 10.1.3 Data Protection Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. An y participant records or datasets that are transferred to the Sp onsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or an y information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred. The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the Sponsor in acco rdance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the participant. The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel ap pointed by the S ponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and b y inspectors from regulatory authorities. 0575PQ 06F80P"

Events meeting the AE definition •Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry, or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. •Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. •New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . •Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. •Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. •For al l reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the AE term should reflect the clinical s ymptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose without any associated clinical sy mptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” •Any new cancer or progression of existing cancer. 0575PQ 06F80P"

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening • The term “ life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which h ypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization •Hospitalizat ion is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre -existing condition that has not worsen ed is not an SAE. A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s medical history . d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity •The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 0575PQ 06F80P"

I n such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/ SAE. Assessment of i ntensity •An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe. •The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE a nd SAE (and other reportable safet y event) reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: -Mild: An event that is easily tolerated b y the participant, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with every day activities (for p ediatric studies, awareness of symptoms, but easily tolerated). -Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal every day activities (for pediatric studies, definitely acting like something is wrong). -Severe: An event that prev ents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe (for pediatric studies, extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities). Assessment of c ausality •Did the Sponsor ’s product cause the AE? •The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor ’s product caused the AE will be provided b y an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investiga tor’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causalit y noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causalit y was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test product and the AE based upon the available information. •The following components are to be used to as sess the relationship between the Sponsor ’s product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity ), the more likel y the Sponsor ’s product caused the AE: 0575PQ 06F80P"

Informed consent for future biomedical r esearch should be presented to the participants on the visit designated in the SoA. If delay ed, present consent at next possible Participant Visit. Consent forms signed by the participant will be kept at the clinical study site under secure storage for regulatory reasons. A template of each stud y site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the Sponsor’s clinical document repository . c.eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens Documentat ion of participant consent for future biomedical r esearch will be captured in the eCRFs . Any specimens for which such an informe d consent cannot be verified will be destroyed. d.Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s) Collection of specimens for future biomedical r esearch will be performed as outlined in the SoA. I n general, if additional blood specimens ar e being collected for future biomedical r esearch, these will usually be obtained at a time when the participant is having blood drawn for other stud y purposes. 4.Confidential Participant Information for Future Biomedical Research In order to optimize the resea rch that can be conducted with future biomedical research specimens, it is critical to link participant' clinical information with future test results. I n fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to the specimen. The clinical data allow specific anal yses to be conducted. Knowing participant characteristics like gender, age, medical history and treatment outcomes are critical to understanding clinical context of analytical results. To maintain privacy of information collect ed from specime ns obtained for future biomedical r esearch, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All specimens will be single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below. At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the future biomedical research specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any 0575PQ 06F80P"

The link (or key ) between participant identifiers and this unique code will be held at the stud y site. No personal ident ifiers will appear on the specimen tube. 5.Biorepository Specimen Usage Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for anal yses using good scientific practices. Anal yses utilizing the future biomedical r esearch specimens may be performed b y the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a universit y investigator) designated by the Sponsor. The investigator conducting the anal ysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the sp ecific scope of analy sis outlined in this substudy . Future biomedical r esearch specimens remaining with the third party after specific analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor. 6.Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research Participants may withdr aw their consent for future biomedical r esearch and ask that their biospecimens not be used for future biomedical r esearch. Participants may withdraw consent at an y time by contacting the principal investigator for the main study . If medical records for th e main study are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently, the participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main stud y use only . If specimens were collected from stud yparticipants specificall y for future biomedical research, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and destroy ed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. I t is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or alread y performe d prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research study data and results. No new analyses would be generated after the request is received. In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the investigator is no longer required b y regulatory authorities to retain the main study records) or the specimens have been completely anony mized, there will no longer be a link between the participant’s personal informat ion and their specimens. In this situation, the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed. 7.Retention of Specimens Future biomedical r esearch specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential analysis for up to 20 y ears from the end of the main study .

The Phase 3 studies are designed as randomized, parallel treatment for 1 year with either placebo or 1 of 2 MK- 7264 dose levels (15 mg BID, 45 mg BID). However, it is currentl y unknown how participants will respond to cessation of treatment with MK -7264 after 1 y ear of therap y. Though limited, short- term data from Protocol 012 (the phase 2b dose ranging study with MK -7264) suggests that participants treated with MK -7264 for 12 weeks and observed 14 day s after discontinuation of treatment showed a mean cough frequency off-treatment that did not increase compared to baseline (Week 0) , suggesting no evidence of immediate rebound cough. The addition of the Off -treatment Durabilit y Study Period via the proposed amendment is intended to explore the impact of withdrawing MK -7264 therap y in RCC/UCC patients who have been treated for 1 year. 3 Hypothesis, Objectives, and Endpoints Objectives Endpoints Exploratory Objective: To evaluate the off -treatment durability after 1 y ear of treatment with MK-7264, over the course of 3 months off treatment Cough Severit y VAS LCQ CSD PGIC EQ5D -5L Objective: To evaluate the time to“loss of response” in on- treatment responders over the course of 3 months off treatmentTime to loss of response based on VAS Time to loss of response based on CSD Time to first use of a medication for cough 4.1 Overall Design Approximately 150 total participants , in either this study or P027 at selected sites and countries, will enter an Off -treatment Durabilit y Study Period at their last visit of the Extension Study Period (V13).

Participants will be instructed to complete the daily ePRO measures (CSD and Cough Sever ity VAS) at approximately the same time each day , from the evening of Visit 13 (ie, the last visit of the Extension Period) until the evening before Visit 17 (ie, last visit of the Off - treatment Durability Study Period) or Discontinuation Visit. I f a parti cipant fails to complete the CSD and/or Cough Severit y VAS ePRO measure(s), the eDiary will allow the participant, based on recall, to complete the measures at an y time in the next 24 hours. Participants will also be asked to complete the visit ePRO measur es (LCQ, EQ5D 5L, and/or PGIC) on the day of the telephone visits as outlined in the SoA. I f a participant fails to complete an y of the visit ePRO measure(s), the eDiary will allow the participant, based on recall, to complete these measures at an y time in the next 48 hours. If these visit e PROs are not completed, site personnel may be asked to reactivate visit questionnaires for the participant and the participant may be asked to complete them at a later date . Electronic PRO measures must be activated as outlined in the SoA.

Selected members of the Sponsor study team may be unblinded to review the data from the Main Study Period and author a CSR for facilitating regulatory submission. A final database lock will occur after all participants have completed the Extension Study Period. This database lock will occur independent of enrollment into the Off -treatment Durability Study Period. The data from the Off -treatment Durability Study Period will be summarized in a separate report from the Main and Extension Study Period data. The investigator site personnel and the participants will be blinded to intervention assignment until the entire study is completed. 9.3 Hypotheses/Estimation No hy pothesis will be tested for the Off -treatment Durability Study Period . Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (as appropriate) will be provided for the efficacy and safety endpoints. 9.4 Analysis Endpoints The main anal yses will be performed in all subjects who enter the Off-treatment Durability Study Period. It is acknowledged that this population will include participants with vary ing measures of cough impact and severit y as assessed by the ePROs both at the end of the 1- yeartreatment (ie, Week 52), as well as compared to prestudy baseline (ie, Week 0). The primary metric of treatment durability will compare the ePRO measurement after 12 weeks off -treatment, to the measurement at Week 52 (ie, immediately prior to treatment discontinuation), and will specificall y seek to des cribe the proportion of participants who either fail to maintain their treatment response, or who maintain treatment response. One way to describe “failure to maintain the response” for a given ePRO, as an example, is that either the 12 weeks off -treatme nt measurement is decreased b y at least X% of the Week 52 response, or the participant needs treatment for cough. The actual threshold would be based on considerations about clinically important differences and real-world data experiences. The definition w ill be specific to each ePRO. 0575PQ 06F80P"

Specificall y, the on -treatment measurement (defined as the difference in the Week 52 me asurement compared to Week 0) will be categorized using different threshold definitions of “response”, and the subsequent off - treatment ePRO measurement in the Off-treatment Durability Study Period will be explored as a function of the on- treatment response. One way to describe the “on -treatment response” for VAS, as an example, is that a participant has a Week 52 measurement at least X -mm lower than the Week 0 measurement. The definition will be specific to each ePRO. The final details about the anal ysis endpoints, as well as other aspects of the anal yses, will be documented in a nOff-treatment Durability Study Period memo, separate from the treatment period supplemental SAP, to be finalized before the completion of the Off-treatment Durability Study Period . 9.5 Analysis Populations Analy ses will generally be based on All Subjects Enrolled. 9.6.1 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses For each e PRO separately , the proportion of participants who maintain treatment response during the 12 -week off-treatment period will be estimated and the associated 95% CI will be calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method. Time -to-event endpoints will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier estimates. 9.6.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses In the beginning of the Off -treatment Durabilit y Study Period, up to 14 days after the last dose of study intervention, AE collection will follow the same process as in the Main and Extension Study Periods and will be anal yzed with the AEs from the Main an d Extension Study Periods in the CSR. For the Off-treatment Durability Study Period, post 14 day s after the last dose of study intervention, only drug -related SAEs, SAEs considered to be study participation related, drug-related NSAEs, and any pregnancy that is brought to the attention of the investigator will be collected. While such events will not be considered treatment emergent, they will be summarized in a separate report . 0575PQ 06F80P"
