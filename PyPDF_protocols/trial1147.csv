The medical and societal impacts are considerable and obesit y is one of the most significant public health challenges wo rldwide1-7. Obesit y is associated with increased risk o f a variety of com orbidities, affects physical and mental healt h and reduces hea lth related quali ty of life8, 9. The ri sk of obesit y-related com plicati ons and comorbi dities increases wi th increasing body mass index (BMI), and a weight loss of 5- 10% have significant health benefits in terms of slowing progression to T2D10-13. Furthermore, a weight loss of 5 -10% improves many other obesit y related comorbidi ties as well as physical symptom s and qualit y of life14-21. Finally , studi es suggest a beneficial impact of weight loss on cardiovascular risk and mortalit y in both peopl e with diabetes and obesit y22-24. Subjects with T2D often have mult iple unmet medical needs related to cardiovascular risks, including hypertensio n and dyslipidaemia. It has been consistent ly demo nstrated that weight loss in subje cts wi th T2D has a beneficial impact not only on glycaemic control, but also on other cardi ovascular risk markers25. The tri al popul ation will c onsist of East Asian subjects with overweight or obesit y and weight - related com orbidities including T2D in a subset of the population. Pharmacotherapy may serve as a valuable adjunct to lifest yle intervent ion for individuals with obesit y in order to achiev e and sustain a clinically relevant wei ght loss, to improve com orbid condit ions and to facilitate a healthier lifest yle. The present trial is a 68 -week tri al designed to show the reducti on in body weight and compare the effect and safety of semaglutide sub cutaneous (s.c.) once weekly versus plac ebo as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical act ivity in East Asian subjects with overwei ght or obesi ty both wi th and wi thout T2D. Objectives and endpoints Primary objective To com pare the effe ct of semaglut ide s.c. 2.4 m g once -weekly versus semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical act ivity in subj ects wi th overweight or obesit y on body weight.

To com pare the effect of semaglut ide s.c. 1.7 mg once -weekly versus semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical act ivity in subjects with overweight or obesit yon body weight . To com pare the effect of semaglut ide s.c. 1.7 mg once -weekly versus semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to a reduced calori e diet and increased physical act ivity in subj ects wi th overweight or obesit y on: Cardi ovascular ri sk factors Glucose m etabo lism To com pare the safet y and tol erabilit y of semaglut ide s.c. 1.7 mg once -weekly versus semaglut ide placebo as an adjunct to a red uced calorie diet and increased physical activit y in subjects wi th overwei ght or obesi ty. Primary estimand The est imand will quantify the average treatment effect of semaglut ide relat ive to semaglutide placebo after 68 weeks, as an adjunct to a reduced cal orie diet and increased physical act ivity, in all rando mised subjects regardless of adherence to treatment and regardless of starting rescue intervent ions (weight management drugs or bariatric surgery) (“effect iveness”/“treatment policy” estimand). The est imand will cover all effect -related object ives.

The m edical and soci etal impacts are considerable and obesit y is one of the most significant public health challenges worldwide1-7. Obesit y is associated with increased risk o f a variety of com orbidities including hyperglycaemia, T2D, hy pertensio n, dy slipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, atherosclerosis, osteoarthrit is, urinary incont inence, non -alcoho lic steatohepat itis, cardiovascular diseases, certain ty pes of cancer, and risk of early death28-42. Moreover, obesit y adversely affects physical and mental healt h and reduces healt h related qualit y of life8, 9. Obesit y is also associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, which also increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and all -cause m ortali ty43. The ri sk of obesit y-related com plicati ons and comorbi dities increases wi th increasing BMI, and a weight loss of 5−10 % have significant health benefits in terms of slowing progression to T2D10-13. Furtherm ore, a wei ght loss of 5−10% improves ma ny other obesit y related com orbidi ties as well as physical symptoms and qualit y of life14-21. Finally, studies suggest a beneficial impact of weight loss on cardi ovascular risk and mortalit y in both people wit h diabetes and obesit y22-24. Subjects with T2D often have mult iple unmet medical needs related to cardiovascular risks, including hypertensio n and dyslipidaemia. It has been consistent ly demo nstrated that weight loss in subje cts wi th T2D has a beneficial impact not only on glycaemic control, but also on other cardi ovascular risk markers25. The present trial has been designed to show the effects of semaglutide in inducing weight loss in subjects with overweight or obesit y both with and wi thout T2D, while potentially improving markers of cardiovascular risk, clinical outcome assessments and glycaemic control. Lifest yle intervent ion in the form o f diet and exercise is first line treatment for obesit y, but most peopl e with obesi ty struggle to achi eve and maintain their weight loss44-53. Surgi cal treatm ents offer an effective alternat ive for som e people wi th severe obesi ty, but surgery carries a ri sk in connection with the procedure and is not without com plicati ons. Furtherm ore, surgery requi res cl ose f ollow-up of the individual which can be cumbersome and costly44-49, 54, 55. Pharmacotherapy may therefore serve as a valuable adjunct to lifest yle intervent ion for individuals wit h obesit y in order to achieve and sustain a clinically relevant wei ght loss, to improve com orbid condi tions and to facilitate a healt hier lifest yle.Few ant i-obesit y medicat ions are currently available and there is a need for more safe and effective therapeut ic options for treatment of obesit y, especially treatm ents that al so target weight maintenance, prevent ion and treatment of comorbidit ies44-48, 56, 57.

Semaglut ide has been optimised result ing in a longer half -life of approximately 160 hours, ma king it suitable f or once -weekly dosing58. GLP -1 is a physio logical regulator of appetite and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain invo lved in appet ite regulation59. In subjects with T2D, treatment with semaglut ide s.c. 1 .0 mg once -weekly has shown a body weight loss of up to 7.0% of baseline body weight (and reducti ons in HbA1c of up to 1.85 percentage - point) after 30 weeks with a safet y and tol erabili ty profile com parable to other GLP -1 RA60-64. In the trials investi gating semagl utide s.c. 1.0 mg, subjects with diabetes were exposed to a lower dose of semaglut ide for a shorter period a nd di d not receive any dedicated lifestyle intervent ion. Consequent ly, body weight l oss is expected to be greater in a populat ion of subjects with T2D receiving a dedicated lifest yle interventi on and a higher semaglut ide dose. A 52 -week phase 2 dose -findin g trial within weight m anagement (NN9536 -4153) has recent ly been completed. A total of 957 randomised subjects with obesit y (without di abetes) were exposed to semaglutide (n=718), liraglutide 3.0 mg (n=103) or placebo (n=136). In this trial, an overall monotone dose -dependent weight loss was observed across the 5 semaglutide doses tested (0.05 to 0.4 m g once -daily). The est imated weight loss at week 52 was 13.8 % at the highest dose tested (0.4 mg once -daily) co mpared to the weight loss o f 2.3% achieved by diet, exerci se and placebo al one65. Clinical60-64, 66and non -clinical67data indicate that the body weight-reducing effect of semaglut ide is mainly mediated by a reduced energy intake. No unexpected safet y findings were identified and the tolerabilit y and safety profile was overall consistent with previous findings in the T2D development programme and the GLP- 1 RA class in general. A co mprehensive review of resul ts from the non -clinical and clinical studies of semaglut ide can be found in the current edit ion of the invest igator’s brochure (IB)65and any updates hereo f. 3.2.2 Trial population The tri al popul ation will consist of East Asian subjects with overweight or obesit y and wei ght- related com orbidities. These subjects represent a clinically relevant popul ation for pharmacotherapeutic weight management as they are at si gnificant ri sk for wei ght-related morbidities and m ortali ty, and are likely to benefit fro m weight reducti on. T2D as well as hypertensio n and dyslipidaemia are important and relevant obesit y related com orbidities26thus, in addition to hy pertensio n or dy slipidaemia as primary com orbidi ty to overwei ght or obesi ty, a Japanese subgroup with T2D will be included in the trial if treated with 0 -3 oral antidiabet icdrugs (OADs), but not on insulin treatment.

Japanese subjects with overweight or obesit y with and wi thout T2D are al so included in the global phase 3a programme ( NN953 6-4373 and NN9536 -4374). East Asian subjects experience co morbidities at a l ower BMI than what i s observed in people of other ethnic origin. In particular cardiovascular risk factors seem to increase with BMI ≥ 27kg/m2in Japanese adults with obesit y68, 69. The m ortali ty increases in East Asian subjects with a BMI ≥ 27kg/m2 70, in accordance wit h the overseas population71. Thus even though the BMI cut off for diagnosis of obesit y is ≥ 25 kg/m2in many East Asian countries26, 72, a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2is a relevant level for invest igating pharmacotherapeutic weight management. First line treatment in weight management should always be lifest yle modificat ion through a reduced cal orie diet and increased physical act ivity. Thus only subjects who have tried but failed a dietary weight loss intervent ion will be included in accordance with regulatory and clinical guidelines26,73,74. 3.3 Benefit -risk assessment 3.3.1 Benefits Subjects will be treated with a regimen ant icipated to be better than or equal to the weight management they receive at the time of entry into the trial. Results fro m the phase 2 tri al (NN9536 - 4153) demonstrated that semaglut ide once- daily as an adjunct to a reduced ca lorie di et and increased physical activit y was effect ive for wei ght loss in subjects wi th obesi ty, while displaying a satisfactory tolerabilit y profile. Overall, a monotone dose -dependent weight loss was observed across all tested doses of semaglut ide (0.0 5 to 0.4 mg once -daily). The weight loss was 11.55 percentage points larger for the 0.4 mg group compared with placebo. Weight loss was accompanied by a consistent improvement in the weight -related comorbidit ies, indicated by cardi ovascular risk factors, l ipid profile and glycaemic factors, as well as improvements in clinical outcom e assessments. In addit ion, it is expected that all subjects will benefit from participation through close contact with the trial site and counselling by a diet ician or a similar qualified healthcare professional, all o f which will most likely resul t in intensified weight management. 3.3.2 Risks and precautions The sect ions below describe identified and potential risks associated with semaglut ide treatment. For cl assificat ion and furthe r details of the risks, please refer to the current versio n of the IB65or any updates hereo f. The i dentified/potential risks are based on findings in non -clinical studies and clinical trials wit h semaglut ide as well as other GLP -1 RAs. For each of these risks, mit igating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Protocol v 2.0 | NN9536 -4382 . CONFIDENTIAL"
18,page_18,"Protocol CONFIDENTIALDate: 08 August 2018 Novo Nordisk Trial ID: NN9536 -4382 Version: 2.0 Status: Final Page: 17of 108 Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP -1 RAs, the most frequent ly reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials wit h semaglut ide wer e gastrointestinal (GI) AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalat ion steps will be implemented in the trial to mit igate the risk of GI AEs. Cholelithiasis Events of cho lelithiasis were the most frequently reported gallbladder events in the phase 2 weight m anagement tri al (NN9536 -4153) and were in a few instances co- reported with the event adj udicat ion committee (EAC) confirmed acute pancreatit is. As a precaution, if cholelithiasis is suspected, appropriate clinical fo llow-up is to be init iated at the investigator’s discret ion. Acute pancreat itis Acute pancreat itis has been observed wit h the use of GLP -1 RA drug class. As a precauti on, subjects wi th a history of chronic pancreatit is or recent acute pancreatit is will not be enro lled in the trial. In addit ion, trial product shoul d be discont inued in case of suspicio n of acute pancreat itis in accordance to S ection 8.1. Hypoglycaemia (in co mbinat ion with sulphonylurea (SU) and/or insulin) (identified for T2D subjects (Japan only)) There i s a low ri sk of hypoglycaemic episodes when semaglut ide is used as mo notherapy . Subjects treated with semaglut ide in combinat ion with aSU or i nsulin has an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia can be lowered by reducing the dose of SU when init iating treatment with semaglut ide (or insulin if subjects have been allowed to use insulin as rescue therapy ). Diabetic reti nopathy com plicat ion (identified for T2D subjects (Japan only)) The cardiovascular outcome trial in the semaglut ide T2D development programme showed an increased risk of events related to diabet ic retinopathy co mplications in subjects treated with semaglut ide co mpared to placebo, albeit the proportion of subjects with an event of diabetic retinopathy co mplications was low. The imbalance was driven by subjects with a history of diabet ic retinopathy at randomisat ion and subjects who were treated with insulin. As a precaution, subjects with a history of uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabet ic retinopathy or m aculopathy will be excluded from the trial, and fundus photography or sli t- lamp bio microscopy examinat ion with pharmaco logically dilated pupils will be perform ed according to flowchart (Section 2and 9.4.7 ). Medullary thy roid cancer (MTC) (based on non -clinical data) Expected proliferative thy roid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicit y studi es after daily exposure to semaglut ide for 2 years. No hy perplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up to 13 -fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials wit h semaglut ide, there have been no clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C -cell changes in rodents are m ediated by the GLP -1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid. Accordingly, the risk Protocol v 2.0 | NN9536 -4382 . CONFIDENTIAL"

However, as a precauti on, exclusio n and discont inuat ion criteria related to m edical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia t ype 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels o f calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) have been implemented in the trial. Pancreat ic cancer There i s currently no support from non -clinical studi es, clinical tri als or post -marketing data that GLP -1 RA -based therapies increase the risk of pancreat ic cancer, but pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP -1 RAs by European Medicines Agency (EMA). As a precaution, subjects with a history of malignant neo plasms wit hin the past 5 years prior to screening will be excluded fro m the trial. Allergic reactions As is the case wit h all protein -based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide are at risk of developing immunogenic and allergic reactions. As a precauti on, subjects wi th known or suspected hy persensit ivity to semagl utide or rel ated products will not be enrolled in this tri al. Pregnancy and fertilit y (based on non- clinical data) Studi es in animals have shown reproductive toxicit y. There are limit ed data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglut ide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusio n and discont inuat ion criteria rel ated to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 3.3.3 Conclusion on benefit -risk profile Necessary precaut ions have been implemented in the design and planned conduct of the trial in order to minimise the risks and inconveniences of participat ion in the trial. The safet y profile for semaglutide generated fro m the clinical and non- clinical development pr ogramme has not revealed any safet y issues that would prohibit administration of semaglut ide s.c. 2.4 mg once -weekly . The resul ts of the phase 2 trial (NN9536 -4153) indicate that semaglutide will provide a clinically meaningful weight loss. In conclusio n, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and outweighed by the anticipated benefits that semaglutide would provide subjects included in the trial.

Randomisat ion will be stratified according to T2D diagnosis at screening and planned CT scan. 5.5 Justification for dose Results fro m the phase 2 dose -finding trial (NN9536 -4153) showed th at the semaglutide 0.4 mg once -daily dose was m ost effect ive in term s of weight loss while displaying an acceptable tolerabilit y profile. Using populat ion pharmacokinetic (Pop -PK) modelling, it was estimated that a once -weekly maintenance dose of 2.4 mg se maglutide will result in similar C maxat steady -state as that obtained by the once -daily 0.4 m g semaglutide dose in trial NN9536 -4153. A maintenance dose of 2.4 mg semaglut ide once- weekly has been chosen for the phase 3 weight management development progra mme. The once -weekly dosing is anticipated to ease the burden of drug administration in clinical pract ice. Subj ects will be initiated at a once -weekly dose of 0.25 m g and fo llow a fixed- dose escalat ion regimen, with dose increases every 4 weeks (to doses o f 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg/week), until the target dose is reached after 16 weeks. Results fro m the semaglutide s.c. programme in T2D subjects showed, that the 1.0 mg dose did not exhaust body weight l oss potential of semaglutide in a global and the Japane se popul ation, and therefore semaglut ide 1.7 mg has been selected as the additional dose in this trial. Semaglutide 1.7 mg once -weekly is expected to provide addit ional weight loss com pared to 1.0 m g. Furtherm ore, 1.7 m g is the l ast dose escal ation step to 2.4 mg. It is well known that to mi tigate gastrointest inal (GI) side effects with GLP -1 RA treatment, dose escalat ion to the target dose is required.

However all efforts should be made to have the subject attend at least the ‘end of treatment’ clinic visit containing the final data collect ion of primary and confirmatory secondary efficacy endpoints, a nd the ‘end of trial’ visit. If the subject refuses to attend the ‘end of treatment’ and/or ‘end of trial’ visit, informat ion about the attempts to fo llow up wi th the subject must be documented in the subject’s medical record. The subject must be discont inued from trial product, if any of the following applies: 1.Safety concern as judged by the invest igator 2.Calcitonin ≥ 100 ng/L (see Appendix 9 ) 3.Suspi cion of pancreat itis 4.Pregnancy 5.Intention o f becoming pregnant 6.Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial of an approved or non -approved investi gational medicinal product If acute pancreat itis is suspected appropriate actions should be init iated, including local measurement of amylase and lipase (see Appendix 4 for reporti ng). Subjects m eeting discont inuat ion of tri al product cri terion no. 3 are allowed to resume trial product if the Atlanta criteria76are not fulfilled and thus, the suspicio n of acute pancreatit is is not confirmed. Trial product may be resumed for subjects with a gallstone -induced pancreat itis in case of cholecystec tomy. Subjects m eeting discont inuat ion of tri al product cri teria no. 1, 4 and 5 are allowed to resume trial product, if the criteria are no longer met (see Section 8.1.1). The primary reason for di scont inuat ion of tri al product m ust be specified in the source data at the time of discont inuat ion, and subject should continue to fo llow the visit and assessment schedule.

Each missed dose should be recorded in the CRF, as per subject’s reco llection. If a ‘treatment status’ session previously has been made in IWRS, to indicate discont inuat ion of tri al produ ct, a new ‘treatment status’ sessio n must be made to resume trial product. 8.1.2 Rescue criteria For subject with T2D at screening (Japan only): Subjects with persistent and unacceptable hyperglycaemia should be offered rescue medicat ion. If any of the FPG value s (incl uding protocol scheduled fast ing self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG )) exceed 15 mmo l/L (270 m g/dL) and no intercurrent cause of the hyperglycaemia can be ident ified, a confirmatory FPG (at central laboratory) should be obtained by calling the subjec t for a re-test. If the confirmatory measurement al so exceeds 15 mmo l/L (270 m g/dL) the subject must be offered rescue medicat ion, at the discretion o f the investigator, according to local guidelines (excluding GLP -1 RAs, DPP -4 inhibitors and amylin analog ues). For a descript ion of rescue medicat ion, please refer to Secti on 7.7.1 . 8.2 Withdrawal from the trial A subject m ay withdraw consent at any time at his/her own request. If a subject withdraws consent, the invest igator must ask the subject if he/she is willing, as soon as possible, to have assessment performed according to the ‘end of treatment’ visit. See the flowchart for data to be collected. Final drug accountabilit y must be performed even if the subject is not able to come to the trial site. The investigator must make a ‘treatment status’ sessio n in IWRS to discont inue trial product. If a subject withdraws fro m the trial, he/she m ay request destruc tion of any samples taken and not tested, and the invest igator must document this in the medical record. If the subject withdraws consent, Novo Nordisk may retain and cont inue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal o f consent. Although a subjec t is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing, the invest igator must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject's ri ghts.

Note, this is done per assessment and per subject; subjects may be a different type for different assessments (a subject may have “available on rando mised treatment (AT)” for body weight but “missing on randomised treatment (MT)” for waist circumference). Table 10-1 Taxonomy for subjects based on week 68 assessments Assessment at week 68Subjects on randomised treatment at week 68Type description Type Abbreviation Available Yes Available on randomised treatment : Subjects who complete the trial on randomised treatment with an assessment at week 68: Includes those that stop and restart trial product.AT No Available but discontinued Subjects who discontinued randomised treatment prematurely but returned to have an assessment at week 68.

These are also called non -retrieved subjectsMD 10.1 Sample size determination The sample size and thereby the power for this trial is primarily defined to support safet y. However, no form al stati stical inference is planned based on number of adverse events. Given the trial sample size, the power of statistical tests for effec t endpoints i s described below. The tests of superiorit y of semagluti de 2.4 m g to sem aglut ide placeb o or sem aglut ide 1.7 mg to semaglutide placebo for the primary and confi rmatory secondary endpoints are perform ed using the fixed -sequence statist ical strategy . This strategy tests the endpoints using a predefined hierarchical order, all at the significanc e level of 5%, m oving to test the next endpoint only after a stati stically significant superi ority resul t (p-value < 5%) on the previous endpo int. The test hierarchy is given in Table 10-2 with underlying assumpt ions, m arginal power and effect ive power. The effect ive power is calculated under the assumpt ion of independence of endpo ints by multiplying the respective marginal powers successively. As the two primary endpo ints are included in the statist ical test ing hierarchy , significant superiori ty of semaglut ide 2.4 mg vs. semaglut ide placebo must be demonstrated for each of the primary endpoints.

These data are also used to impute missing measurements at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD). The imputation is done separately wit hin each treatment arm (see descript ion below). However, for t he power calculations missing values (MT and MD), regardless of treatm ent arm , are assumed to be similar to semaglut ide placebo subjects. These assumpt ions are likely conservat ive with respect to the power, and correspond to the jump to reference sensit ivity analysis planned below. Assumptions The commo n assumptions for the power calculations are: The significance level is 5% The rando misat ion rati o is 4:1:2:1 For continuous endpo ints the t -test on the mean difference assuming equal variances is used For binary endpoints the Pearson chi -square test for two independent proportions is used Based on data from NN9536 -4153 20% of subjects discont inue permanent ly and 60% of these are retrieved (AD) at week 68 100 subjects have T2D All subjects in the semagl utide placebo arm are assumed to have same effect as subjects who complete the tri al on semagl utide placebo (AT) Retri eved subjects (AD) in the semaglut ide 2.4 mg (or semaglut ide 1.7 mg) arm are assumed to have an effect corresponding to half the treatment difference (compared to semaglut ide placebo) of subjects who complete the trial on semaglutide 2.4 mg (or semaglut ide 1.7 mg) (AT) Non-retrieved subjects (MD) in the semaglut ide 2.4 mg (or semaglut ide 1.7 mg) arm are assumed to have an effect corresponding to semaglutide placebo Further assumptions made to calculate the power for each of the primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints are based on findings from other projects conducted by Novo Nordi sk (NN8022 (SCALE), NN9535 (SUSTAIN), NN9924 (PIONEER) and trial NN9536 -4153 and are presented in Table 10-2. Given these assumpt ions, the sample size o f 400 subjects (200 in the semaglut ide s.c. 2.4 mg once - weekly, 100 in the semaglut ide s.c. 1.7 mg once -weekly and 100 (50+50) in the semaglut ide placebo arm ), gives an effect ive power (marginal powers mult iplied) of 84%.

Handling of missing week 68 values for the primary estimand All available data at week 68 (AT and AD) are used and missing values (MT and MD) at week 68 will be imputed and the endpo ints will be derived from the imputed values. Several approaches for imputati on will be applied. First, a descript ionof the primary imputati on approach to address the primary estimand for the primary endpo ints is given fo llowed by a descri ption of the sensit ivity analyses used to assess the robustness of the primary analysis results. The sensit ivity analyses investigate how assumptions on body weight development after discont inuat ion of rando mised treatm ent impact the estimated treatment contrasts between semaglutide 2.4 mg (or semaglut ide 1.7 mg) and semaglut ide placebo. An illustration of all imputation approaches for the effect iveness estimand is given in Figure 10-1. Primary imputation approach for the primary estimand Multiple imputation approach using retrieved su bjects (RD -MI): The primary imputation approach for the primary estimand i s a mul tiple imputati on similar to the one described by McEvoy82. Missing body weight m easurem ent at week 68 for non -retrieved subjects (MD) are imputed using assessments from retrieved subjects (AD) in each rando mised treatment arm. This will be done according to the timing of last available observat ion (LAO) of body weight. Missing body weight measurements at week 68 for subjects on randomised treatment (MT) are imputed by sampling from available measurements at week 68 fro m subjects on randomised treatment (AT) in the relevant rando mised treatment arm. The mult iple imputati on approach is done in three steps: 1.Imputation : Defines an imputation model using retrieved subjects (AD) fro m FAS and done wi thin groups defined by randomised treatm ent and the timing of the LAO of body weight. The m odel will be a linear regression of body weight (kg) at week 6 8 with gender (male/female), baseline BMI (kg/m2) (in categori es 27 -<35, 35 -<40, ≥40) and stratificat ion groups (defined by stratificat ion categori es for T2D status) as factors and baseline body weight (kg) and LAO of body weight (kg) as covariates. No interacti ons will be included. The grouping of timing will be done by quarters (intervals of 17 weeks). If timing by quarters is too restrict ive, halves (intervals of 34 weeks) or excluding timing will be used. If any subjects are MT, an imputation mo del for missing body weight measurements at week 68 for MT subjects will also be defined using AT subjects in a similar way . The est imated posterior distribut ion for the parameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation models are then used to im pute missing week 68 body weight values for each rando mised treatment arm. This will be done 1,000 times and results in 1,000 complete data sets. 2.Analysis : Analysis o f each of the 1,000 complete data sets, using the analysis models (ANCOVA and logist ic regressio n) results in 1,000 times 2 estimat ions.

Based on NN9536 -4153 phase 2 results 1,000 copies should be sufficient to establish stable results. If 1,000 copies are insufficient, 10,000 copies will be used. The mult iple imputations will be generated using Novo Nordisk trial number 95364382 as seed number. Sensitivity analyses Jump to reference multiple imputation approach (J2R- MI): Missing values o f body weight at week 68 (MT and MD) forthe sem aglut ide 2.4 mg (or semaglut ide 1.7 mg) and semaglutide placebo group are imputed by sampling among all available assessments at week 68 in the semaglut ide placebo group (AT and AD). This approach makes the a ssumpt ion that subjects instant ly after discontinuat ion lose any effect of rando mised treatment beyo nd what can be expected fro m semaglutide placebo treatment as adjunct to reduced calorie diet and increased physical act ivity83. The m ultiple imputati on approach i s done as above with the firs t step repl aced by: 1.Imputation: Defines an imputation model using semaglut ide placebo subjects from FAS with a week 68 measurement (AT and AD). The model will be a linear regressio n of body weight (kg) at week 68 with gender (male/female), BMI (kg/m2) (in categori es 27 -< 35, 35 -< 40, ≥ 40) and stratificat ion groups (defined by stratificat ion categori es for T2D status) as factors and baseline body weight (kg) as covariate. No interactions will be included. The estimated posterior distribut ion for the par ameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputa -tion m odels are then used to impute missing week 68 body weight values for each rando mised treatment arm. This will be done 1,000 times and results in 1,000 complete data sets. The j ump to refer ence approach is the basis for the sample size calculat ions. A single imputation approach as done by Sacks84(S1-SI and S2 -SI):Missing weight measurements at week 68 for non -retrieved subjects (MD) are imputed using a weight regain rate of 0.3 kg/month after LAO but truncated at no change from baseline whenever the extrapolat ion would lead to a positive weight gain relat ive to baseline. If a subject's weight at drug discont inuat ion represented a gain in weight relat ive to baseline, no additional gain will be imputed, and the unfavourable gain is carried forward to week 68. The weig ht regain imputation will be done for both randomised arms (S1-SI). Addit ionally , a versi on where only the semaglut ide 2.4 mg (or semaglut ide 1.7 mg) arm uses the regain rate while the semaglutide placebo arm uses last available observat ion (corresponding to a weight regain rate of 0 kg/month) will be performed (S2- SI). For both versions, missing weight measurements at week 68 for su bjects on MT are imputed by using LAO. Tipping -point multiple imputation analysis (TP -MI): First, missing data are imputed acc ording to the primary multiple imputati on approach.

The approach is to gradually increase this penalt y until all confirmed co nclusio ns from the primary analysis are reversed. For each hypothesis tested the specific value of the penalt y that reverses the conclusio n will be used to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results. This sensit ivity analysis evaluates the rob ustness of the superiorit y conclusions. Mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM): This ‘MMRM for effect iveness’ will use all assessments regardless of adherence to randomised treatment, including assessments at week 68 for retrieved drop -outs (AD). The MMRM for effect iveness will be fitted using the same factors and covari ate as for the primary analyses all nested wi thin visi t. An unstructured covariance matrix for measurements within the same subject will be emplo yed, assuming that measurements for dif ferent subjects are independent.

Week 68 assessments for retrieved drop -outs (AD) are not used in this analysis. The MMRM for efficacy will use assessments only fro m subjects who are taking the rando mised treatment until end of treatment or until first discontinuing of randomised treatment. The derived date of the second consecut ive missed dose will be used as the latest date for using assessments in this MMRM. The assessment closest in t ime and before the derived date of the second consecut ive missed dose will be used as last assessment on randomised treatment. For subjects who init iate rescue intervent ions before completion or fi rst discont inuing of rando mised treatment, the date of starting weight management drugs or undergoing bariatric s urgery will be used as l atest date for using assessments in this MMRM. Similarly , the assessment cl osest in t ime and before the date of starting weight management drugs or undergoing bariatric surgery will be used as last assessment on rando mised treatm ent. The MMRM for efficacy will be fitted using % weight change and the same factors and covari ate as for the primary analyses all nested wi thin visi t. An unstructured covariance matrix for measurements within the same subject will be emplo yed, assuming that measurements for different subjects are independent. The secondary estimand for 5% responders will be assessed using the same MMRM for efficacy . From the MMRM individually predicted values for % weight change at week 68 will be used to classify each subjec t as 5% responder or not. This classificat ion will then be analysed using a LR model with treatm ent as the only factor.

The EAC will evaluate events sent for adjudicat ion using pre- defined definit ions and guidelines in accordance wit h the EAC Charter. The evaluat ion is based on review o f pre-defined clinical data coll ected by the tri al sites. The EAC is co mposed of permanent members covering all required medical specialit ies. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordi sk. The EAC will have no authorisat ions to impact on tri al conduct, tri al protocol or amendments. The assessment made by both the EAC and the investigator will be presented in the clinical trial report. In thi s trial, cardi ovascular events will be adjudicated in order to adequately charact erize the cardi ovascular safet y profile, since cardiovascular disease is an important and serious comorbidit y of obesi ty87. In addi tion, events of acute pancreatit is will be adjudicated because Novo Nordisk monitors the se events cl osely as treatm ent wi th GLP -1 RA has been associated with acute pancreat itis. 7) Publication policy The informat ion obtained during the conduct of this trial is considered confident ial, and m ay be used by or on behalf of Novo Nordisk for regul atory purposes as well as for the general development of the trial product.

Provi ded that certain condit ions are fulfilled, Novo Nordisk may grant access to information obtained during this trial to researchers who require acces s for research proj ects studying the same disease and/or tri al product studi ed in this tri al. Novo Nordisk may publish on its clinical trials website a redacted clinical trial report for this trial. One (or two) invest igator(s) will be appo inted by Novo No rdisk to review and sign the clinical trial report (signatory investigator) on behalf o f all participat ing invest igators. The signatory investigator(s) will be appointed based upon the criteria defined by the Internat ional Co mmittee of Medical Journal Edit ors for research publicat ions88. Communication of results Novo Nordisk commits to communicate and disclo se resul ts of trials regardless o f outcom e. Disclosure includes publication of a manuscript in a peer -reviewed scient ific journal, abstract submissio n with a poster or oral present ation at a sci entific meeting or disclo sure by other means. The results of this trial will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to internat ional and nat ional regulat ions. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of d ata until specified milestones are reached, for example when the clinical trial report is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such inform ation may influence the results of the ent ire trial. At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communicat ion for up to 60 day s to protect intellectual property . In all cases the trial result s will be reported in an object ive, accurate, balanced and co mplete manner, with a discussio n of the strengths and limitations. In the event of any disagreement on the content of any publication, both the invest igato rs’ and Novo Nordisk opinio ns will be fairly and sufficient ly represented in the publicat ion. Authorship Novo Nordisk will work with one or more investigator(s) and other experts who have contributed to the trial concept or design, acquisit ion, analysis or interpretati on of data to report the results in one or more publicati ons.

Where required by the j ournal , the investi gator f rom each tri al site will be named in an acknowledgement or in the supplementary material, as specified by the j ournal . Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s) For a m ulticentre clinical tri al, analyses based on single -site data usually have si gnificant stati stical limitations and frequently do not pro vide meaningful information for healt hcare professio nals or subjects, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. Thus, Novo Nordisk may deny a request or ask for deferment of the publicat ion of individual site results unt il the primary manuscript is accepted for publicat ion. In line with Good Publicat ion Practice, such individual reports should not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscri pt of the tri al. Investigator access to data and review of results As own er of the tri al database, Novo Nordi sk has the discret ion to determine who will have access to the database. Individual investigato rs will have their own subjects' data, and will be provided wit h the rando misat ion code after results are available. 8) Dissemination of clinical trial data Inform ation of the trial will be disclo sed at clinicaltrials.gov and novonordisk -trials.co m. It will also be disclo sed according to other applicable requirements such as those of the International Committee of Medical Journa l Editors (ICMJE)89, the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA)90, European Commissio n Requirements91, 92and other relevant recommendat ions or regul ations. If a subject requests to be included in the trial via the Novo Nordisk e -mail contact at these web sites, Novo Nordisk may disclose the investigator’s contact details to the subject. As a resul t of increasing requirements for transparency, some cou ntries requi re public discl osure of investigator names and their affiliat ions. The Primary Com pletion Date (PCD) is the last assessment of the primary endpo int, and is for this trial Last Subj ect Fi rst Treatm ent + 68 weeks corresponding to V24( ‘End of trea tment’ visit ). If the last subject is wit hdrawn early, the PCD is considered the date when the last subject would have completed ‘end of treatment’ visit.

Events meeting the AE definition Any abnormal laboratory test results or safety assessments, including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. A CLAE: a clinical abnormal laboratory finding which is clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow -up due to theabnormality . Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of trial product regardless of intent. A ""lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition. Events NOT meeting the AE definition Pre-existing conditions, anticipated day -to-day fluctuat ions of pre -existing conditions, including those identified during screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product. Note: pre -existing conditions should be recorded as medical history/concomitant illness. Pre-planned procedu res, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. Definition of an SAE An SAE is an AE that fulfils at least one of the following criteria: Results in death Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused d eath, if it were more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation Hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/o r treatment that would not hav e been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalisation are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalisation” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Note: Hospitalisations for administrative, trial related and social purposes do not constitute AEs and should therefore not be reported as AEs or SAEs. Hospital admissions for surgical procedures, planned before trial inclusion, are not considered AEs or SAEs.

This includes important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation, but may jeopardise the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious and reported as SAEs using the important medical event criterion. The following a dverse events must always be reported as SAEs using the important medical event criterion, if no other seriousness criteria are applicable: suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the trial product. risk of liver injury defined as alanine amino transferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3 x UNL and total bilirubin >2 x UNL, where no alternative aetiology exists (Hy's law). Description of AEs requiring additional data collection (via specific event form) and events for adjudication. AEs requiring additional data collection AEs requiring additional data collection are AEs where the additional data will benefit the evaluation of the safety of the trial product (see Table 9-1). The selection of these events is based on the non -clinical and clinical data with semaglutide, knowledge from the GLP -1 RA drug class as well as regulatory requirements. Event type Description Acute gallbladder diseaseEvents of symptomatic acute gallbladder disease (including gallstones and cholecystitis) Acute pancreatitis The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features: (1)abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back) (2)serum lipase activity (and/or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal (3)characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on ima ging. Malignant neoplasm Malignant neoplasm by histopathology or other substantial clinical evidence Hepatic event Hepatic event defined as: Disorders of the liver including cholestatic conditions and liver related signs and symptoms ALT or AST > 3x UNL and total bilirubin > 2x UNL or INR > 1.5* ALT or AST > 3x UNL with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%) *Please note that in case of a hepatic event defined as ALT or AST > 3x UNL and total bilirubin > 2x UNL, where no alternative aetiology exists (Hy's law), this must be reported as an SAE using the important medical event criterion if no other seriousness criteria are applicable.

In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laborato ry and diagnostics reports) related to the event. There may be instances when copies of source documents (e.g. medical records) for certain cases are requested by Novo Nordisk. In such cases, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject numbe r, will be redacted on the copies of the source documents before submission to Novo Nordisk. For all non -serious AEs the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved or at the end of the trial at the latest. For sign -off of SAE related form s refer to “SAE reporting via paper CRF” later in this section. Novo Nordisk products used as concomitant medication if an AE is considered to have a causal relationship with a Novo Nordisk marketed product used as concomitant medication in the trial, it i s important that the suspected relatio nship is reported to Novo Nordisk, e.g. in the alternative aetiology section on the safety information form. Novo Nordisk may need to report this adverse event to relevant regulatory authorities. Assessment of severi ty The investigator will assess intensity for each event reported during the trial and assign it to one of the following categories: Mild : An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with ever yday activities. Moderate : An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities. Severe : An event that prevents normal everyday activities. Note: Severe is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both an A E and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the outcomes described in the definition of an SAE and not when it is rated as severe. Assessment of causality The investigator is obligated to assess th e relationship between trial product and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. Relationship between an AE/SAE and the relevant trial product (s) should be assessed as: Probable -Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. Possible -A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. Unlikely -The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product. Alternative aetiology, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant medication, and other risk factors, as w ell as the temporal relationship of the event to trial product administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator should use the IB for the assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical records that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, it is important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every Protocol v 2.0 | NN9536 -4382 . CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator may change his/her opinion of ca usality in light of follow -up information and send a follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used w hen determining regulatory reporting requirements. Final outcome The investigator will sel ect the most appropriate outcome: Recovered/resolved: The subject has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial -related activity after the subject signed the informed consent. Recovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. Recovered/resolved with sequelae: The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequelae meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. Not recovered/not resolved: The condition of the subject has not improved and the sym ptoms are unchanged or the outcome is not known. Fatal: This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with a fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. Unknown: This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow -up. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Novo Nordisk to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible ( e.g. seve re hy persensitivity reactions). This may include additional laboratory tests (e.g. skin prick test) or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a subject dies during participation in the trial or during a recognised follow -up period, the investigator should provide Novo Nordisk with a copy of autopsy report including histopathology. New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF. SAE reporting via electronic CRF Relevant forms (AE and safety information form) must be completed in the CRF. For reporting and sign -off timelines, see box below. If the CRF is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper AE form and if the CRF is unavailable fo r more than 5 calendar days then the site will use the safety information form (see box below). The site will enter the SAE data into the CRF as soon as it becomes available, see 9.2.1 . After the trial is completed at a given site, the CRF will be decommissioned to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a subject or receives updated dat a on a previously reported SAE after CRF decommission, then the site can report this information on a paper AE and safety information form (see box below) or to Novo Nordisk by telephone.

Definitions Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) A wo man is considered fertile fo llowing menarche and unt il beco ming postmenopausal unless perm anent ly sterile. Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP 1.Prem enarcheal 2.Prem enopausal female wi th one of the following: Docum ented hysterectomy Docum ented bilateral salpingectomy Docum ented bilateral oophorectomy Note: Documentation can come fro m the site per sonnel’s review of subject’s medical records, medical examinat ion or medical history interview. 3.Postmenopausal female A postm enopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternat ive medical cause. A high Follicle St imulating Hormone (FS H) level in the postm enopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or Hormonal Replacement Therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient . Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-horm onal highly effect ive contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the trial. Otherwise, they must di scont inue HRT to allow confirmat ionof postm enopausal status before trial enrolment. Contraception guidance Male subjects No contraception measures are required for male subjects as the risk of teratogenicit y/fetotoxi city caused by transfer of semaglut ide in seminal fluid is unlikely. Fema le subjects Female subjects of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use m ethods of contraception consistently and correctly as described in table(s) below: Protocol v 2.0 | NN9536 -4382 .

Sexual abstinenceb Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the trial product. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Notes: a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subjects participating in clinical trials. b Contraception should be utilised during the treatment period and for at least 49 days after the last dose of trial product In certain cases, it is accepted to use double barrier methods (a condom combined wit h an occlusive cap (e.g. diaphragm) with/wit hout the use of spermicide). This should only be allowed in females with: 1) known intolerance to the highly effect ive methods m entioned in Table 11-5 or where the use of any of the listed highly effect ive contraceptive measures are contraindicated in the individual subject, and/or 2) if the risk of init iating treatment with a specific highly effect ive method outweighs the benefit for the female. Justification for accepting double barrier method should be at the discretion of the invest igator taking into considerat ion his/hers knowledge about the female’s obesit y history , concomi tant illness, concomitant medication and observed AEs.

Appendix 9 Background Treatment with GLP -1 RAs has been shown to be associated with thy roid C-cell changes in rodents but not in non -human primates. The human relevance o f this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensit ive bio marker for C -cell activat ion) is current ly being performed in clinical trials with semaglut ide. While there is general agreement on the clinical int erpretati on of substant ially elevated cal citonin levels (> 100 ng/L) as likely indicat ive of C -cell neopl asia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: renal dysfunction tobacco use autoimmune thy roiditis several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta -blockers, H2 -blockers and glucocorti coids) Physio logy of C-cell activati on in vari ous clinical condi tions and in different patient populat ions (i.e. wi th various com orbidi ties) is poorly understood. There m ay be various clinical condit ions not ident ified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secret ion by C-cells. Calcitonin monitoring A blood sam ple will be drawn at pre -specified trial visits for measurement of calcitonin. In case a subject has a calcitonin value ≥ 10 ng/L, the algorithm outlined in Figure 11-3 and described below should be fo llowed. The al gorithm applies for all calcitonin values in the trial.
