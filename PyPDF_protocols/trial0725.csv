BACKGRO UND / RATIONALE Each year, 120,000 people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Canada1, with an estimate of 80 -90% of TBIs being categorized as mild2,3. Mild TBIs, also known as concussions, have been referred to as the silent epidemic in North Ameri ca, as the incidence is much higher and effects more persistent than once thought. Concussions can result in a variety of long -term cognitive, psychological, and physical symptoms. Self -reported memory and attention complaints are the most common cognitive effects and may persist for several years post -injury4– 6. It has also been reported that in 75% of all sports -related concussions, ath letes experience reduced balance and symptoms of dizziness7. These residual symptoms may also negatively impact the abili ty to engage in regular activities of daily living such as work, sports, and driving. Driving safe is a complex task and requires perce ption of speed and distance, along with good coordination for steering and braking8. After concussion, participants are s lower to respond to traffic hazards8 and this has been related to increased crash frequency9. The goal of the proposed study is to exam ine the effect of an aerobic and balance retraining program (AET) on common persistent symptoms of concussion using measu res of cognition and brain function, mental and physical health, and driving performance. To date, the majority of randomized controll ed trials (RCTs) have used rest and psychological approaches to alleviate persistent concussion symptoms and have focused on providing individuals with recovery -related information, reassurance, or education. Most of these studies have found no benefit or reported inconclusive findings10. Of the research that has focused on treatment, AET11 has shown to be promising for over all symptom reduction. The conclusions of these studies, however, are limited by the lack of control groups, biased samples, and the in clusion of TBIs of all severities. In addition, many of the interventions were delivered prior to the period when symptom s are typically considered persistent. Controlled studies are needed to test the specific effects of treatment on the persistent sympto ms in a post -concussion syndrome sample lasting greater than one month post -concussion. The intervention we plan to test is AET in a controlled/stepwise exercise training program using RCT methodology. Recent evidence indicates that an active rehabilitatio n program may be useful for individuals with persistent concussion symptoms12 and that exercise can also be effective at improving mood13. Studies have also shown that levels of brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are significantly increased as a res ult of aerobic exercise in healthy individuals. In particular, preliminary data from our group14 demonstrated an increase in salivary BDNF levels in a healthy control group following 4 weeks of AET (the same protocol we are proposing). BDNF is a secreted protein that has been shown to play a central role for neural health and brain plasticity15,16. BDNF has been demonstrated to be a useful biomarker of brain injury post - concussion17 with animal research showing significantly reduced levels of BDNF several h ours or days after a concussion18. Notably, aerobic fitness and BDNF share a relationship that is predictive of memory pe rformance in healthy individuals19–21. Also, it is known that executive function and circulating BDNF both decline with age, however, c hanges in serum BDNF"
7,page_7,"8 predicts improvements in cognitive outcomes in response to aerobic exercise in older individuals22. This provides strong evidence to further examine this intervention in people who are experiencing residual cognitive and/or physical c omplaints after concussion, but are otherwise healthy. One of the reasons for the lack of response to treatment in previo us studies may be, in part, due to the heavy reliance on subjective self -report measures. Therefore, in addition to obtaining self -report measures of persistent complaints, we plan to obtain objective measures of functioning using sophisticated technology, including event -related potentials (ERP) during computerized cognitive tasks, biomarkers (BDNF), force plate measures of balance, and driving simulation measures of participant reaction times under dual tasking situations. While self -reported cognitive c omplaints can persist after concussion, they are rarely detected using traditional neuropsychological tests23,24. Using more complex at tention and memory tasks, however, slower and less accurate performance can be detected up to several years’ post -injury25–27. Non -invasive imaging techniques, such as event -related potentials (ERP) can also provide further insight into inefficient neural processing after concussion. ERP is a method of surface electroencephalography (EEG) that non -invasively detects the neur al signaling in relation to an event (stimulus or task). In individuals with concussion, ERP studies have previously found deficits in stimulus discrimination28, and inhibitory control29 reflected by increased errors and variable response times in behavior as well as reductions in electrical potentials. Previous studies have found decreased amplitude and increased latency following concus sion suggesting a decrease in speed and cognitive resources available for attentional processing29–33. One of the main go als of recovery from persistent concussive symptoms is the ability to return to daily living. While evaluating performance in daily liv ing activities can be difficult (e.g., driving), we are able to evaluate performance using devices such as driving simula tors. Measurements of performance in a simulator (e.g., response time) may become a useful tool as part of a comprehensive assessment f or physicians as they recommend return to daily activities. 2. OBJECTIVES / STUDY AIMS The primary objective of our p roposed study is to implement AET to reduce persistent symptoms after concussion. Our secondary objective is to investigate the usefulness of BDNF as a biomarker of persistent concussive symptoms responsiveness to AET. Our 4 specific goals are to help peop le with persistent concussive symptoms by: 1. Minimizing the occurrence of persistent cognitive and physical symptoms following concussion. 2. Improving performance and efficiency of neural processing during cognitive tasks. 3. Correlating BDNF levels with severity of symptoms and correlating change in BDNF levels to improvements in physical symptoms and balance."

Improving func tioning in activities of daily living, such as driving RATIONALE, S IGNIFICANCE, AND JUSTIFICATION The clinical significance, ra tionale, and justification of this collaborative effort is demonstrated by both clinical and research initiatives at treating pe ople with concussion directly in our community. With the recruitment assistance by medical professionals, this project has a strong foundation and the potential to make a direct impact here in Thunder Bay. The group format of the AET is a cost - and time -effective method by which to treat a subgroup of the concussion population who experience long -lasting symptoms. This subgroup is growing as diagnostic protocols are becoming more standardized and the potential persistent effects are becoming general knowled ge, especially due to increased media coverage around sport or military related injuries related to concussion. If successful, t he AET protocol and salivary BDNF biomarker test may help in the assessment and treatment of persistent concussion symptoms that currently are often treated with rest and education. The findings from the proposed study will help clinicians to also monitor progress to aid in return to play, school, or work decisions, resulting in significant savings to the healthcare system and empl oyer as a result of lost work time. Also, by improving physical health, AET may improve the quality of life. ASSESS MENT OF OUT COME/HYPOTHESIS 1. It is anticipated that the concussed participants receiving the AET will exhibit less mental, cognitive, and physical symptoms related to post -concussion syndrome. These signs and symptoms will be measured via the SCAT -3 and the RPSQ s cores. 2. It is anticipated that AET will result in increased efficiency of neural processing during cognitive task s in post measures compared to SC and with less difference than compared to HC compared to pre - intervention comparisons. Cognitive efficienc y will be measured by the amplitude and latency of two event related electrical potentials associated with attentio n and conflict monitoring processing. 3. It is anticipated that concussed participants receiving the AET will exhibit improved balance. This will be measured using the force platform centre of pressure area, displacement, and velocity measures while comple ting the various static stance positions using the BESS protocol. 4. It is anticipated that concussed participants receiving the AET will exh ibit increased improvements in salivary BDNF levels, indicative of an improvement in concussion symptoms. Salivary BDNF will be quantified using the BDNF ELISA assay and changes in pre - vs. post - intervention concentrations will be assessed. Additionally, w e hypothesize that lower levels of BDNF upon entry to the study will indicate more pronounced concussive symptoms. This relationship will be determined by correlating the pre -intervention BNDF concentration to measures of the post intervention assessments."
9,page_9,"10 5. It is anticipated that concussed participants receiving the AET will exhibit improved reaction times compared t o the SC group during dual tasking scenarios to avoid crashing in dangerous traffic situations. 3. EXPECTED RISKS/ BENEFITS 3.1 Expected R isks Low intensity aerobic and balance exercise poses minimal risk for healthy individuals. Like all types of exer cise, there is a slight risk of sustaining a musculoskeletal injury such as a sprain or strain. There is a small risk, however, when performi ng aerobic and balance exercises while experiencing PCS; participants may see an increase or worsening of his/her s ymptoms. In order to minimize this risk, exercise will begin at a very low intensity and gradually increase. All exercise sessions will be mo nitored by a research team member to ensure that the session is being completed at the proper intensity. Should a p articipant report any PCS during a session, the session will be stopped immediately. Furthermore, to ensure that participants are healthy eno ugh to participate in exercise, all participants will be medically cleared by Dr. Wark prior to participating in th e study. There is a minor risk that, when using the driving simulator, participants may experience symptoms such as nausea or dizziness. Brea ks will be allowed during the assessment in an effort to prevent this. Water will also be readily available during the assessment should the participant require it. If a participant experiences any of these symptoms and is unable to continue, the session w ill end. Physical and cognitive assessment, neuroimaging, and biomarker assessment should pose minimal risk to part icipants. There is a minor social risk with respect to confidentiality. This risk will be minimized by ‘de - identifying’ the personal informat ion w ith codes. All names will be removed from data/samples. All data will be stored in an encrypted file on the se cure Sync.com account on a password - protected computer in a locked office at LU. Any hard copies of data such as screening checklists or the IPAQ will be coded and stored in a locked filing cabinet in a secure office at LU (Dr. Zerpa’s current office, SB 1 007). All saliva samples will be coded and stored in Dr. Lee’s secure lab. The results of this study will be published with aggregate data, t hat is, data which is combined and summarized so that no individual participant can be identified. 3.2 Expected Benefits This study may directly benefit participants in the AET and SC group by potentially improving his/her PCS. This study also has benef its to the scientific community and society, in that there is scarcity of research on the effects of an A ET program in individuals with PCS."

Once participants in the SC group have completed the study, the AET will be offered, although it will not b e inc luded in the data analysis . Following informed consent, PCS participants will be provided with Garmin VivoSmart HR unit to mon itor aerobic activity outside of the study (accelerometer, heart rate monitor , and step counter capabilities). Participants will b e required to wear the Garmin units as often as possible for the duration of the study. In place of the Garmin VivoSmart HR un it, participants in the HC group will complete the IPAQ to determine physical activity levels prior to participating in the study, . All participants will compete a series of pre and post intervention assessments (see section 7.2) over the course of one wee k at Lakehead University. Following the pre intervention assessments,"
12,page_12,"RP-506-07112017 V 1.5: November 30th, 201 8 Multi -modal Evaluation of a Physical Intervention Approach to Treating Persistent Post-Concussive Symptoms 13 participants in the AET group will complete an eight week ae robic and balance retraining program at the School of Kinesiology, Lakehead University (see section 7.2). Participants in the SC group will continue with his/her standard of care for eight weeks. Healthy participants will be instructed not to significantly change his/her lifestyle (diet, physical activity) for the duration of the study weeks. After eight weeks, all participant s will complete the assessments once again. 5.2 Number of Participants/Assignment to Treatment Groups It is anticipated that 60 participants will be recruited into this study. Participant enrollment will be split between the AET, SC, and HC group. There will be 20 participants in each group. 5.3 Duration of Study and Study Timeline The study is expected to last one year in total following the coordination of the research team and ethics approvals. Note: These dates are subject to change based on the d ate we begin participant recruitment. The relative timeline will remain the same. Timeline Milestone Targets Sept 2017 - Dec 201 7 Obtain ethics approval Coordinate research team March - Dec 2019 Project start date ( March 2018) Recruitment, interventio n, data collection Oct 2019- Dec 2019 Data analysis Feb 2020 Manuscript completion Conference presentations 5.4 Length of Participa tion Participa tion in this study will last 10 weeks , depending on scheduling of the pre and post intervention assessments . Pre intervention assessments will be conducted at Lakehead University before beginning intervention. The AET intervention will occur three times per week for eight weeks. Each session w ill last approximately one hour . The SC intervention will be ongoing throughout the eight week s. The HC group will not complete an intervention. Final assessments will be completed after any intervention has conclu ded. 6. PARTICIPANT ENROLLMENT 6.1 Participant Identification and Recruitment Procedures The recruitment will include the use of flyers (attached, Section 16.1) and social media. Recruitme nt flyers directed at potential participants with PCS will be placed in Dr. Wark’s office at Fairway Physiotherapy, as well as other healthcare clinics around Thunder Bay. In order to recruit healthy participants, and to reach the general public, the research team will post the recruitment poster on the Lakeh ead University School of Kinesiology Facebook page and Twitter page. Posters wi ll also be displayed around Lakehead University and various public spaces around Thunder Bay. If a potential PCS participant expressed interest in participating,"
13,page_13,"14 he/she will be referred by his/her healthcare provider, or referred by his/her self to Dr. War k, who will forward his/her information to the research team if appropriate. If a potential healthy participant is interested in participating, he/she will contact the research team using the contact informa tion on the recruitment posters. A n appoint ment w ill be set up between he/she and a member of the research team at the Lakehead Uni versity School of Kinesiology. 6.2 Procedures for Informed Consent If a potential participant contacts, or is referred to the research team, an appointment will be set up to complete the informed consent process and pre screening checklist. During this meeting, a research team member with TCPS -2 training, other than Dr. Wark , will go through the information letter and consent form (attached, Section 16.2) with the potential participant. The potential participant will be given at least 24 hours to consider volunteering for the study, as well as ask any questions they may have regarding the study. Po tential participants are welcome to contact another member of the research team or any of the listed Research Ethics Boards to ask such questions prior to signing the consent form. If the potential participant wishes to consent to the study, they will indi cate this by sign ing the consent form (attached, 16.3) and providing it to a research team member. The participant will be given a copy of the consent form to take home. The original will be retained by the research team as part of the study file. 6.3 P rocedures for Participant Screening Once informed consent is obtained, a train ed member of the research team will determine the potential participant’s eligibility using the screening checklist (attached, Section 1 6.3). If the potential participant meets these criteria, they will be included in the study and given a participant code number. If the potential participant does not meet these criteria, their signed consent form as well as the screening checklist and will be marked as a screen -fail and kept in a “Screen -Fail” binder in a locked filing cabinet in a secure office to be kept for a mi nimum of five years. 6.4 Procedu res for Participant Enrolment / Allocation /Randomization To achieve adequate enrolment, recruitment flyers will be placed at severa l locations and clinics around Thunder Bay. Once informed consent has been obtained, and the potential participant has been deemed eligible through the screening process, age and sex of the participant will be used to randomly assign the participant to an intervention group thro ugh a process called minimization. This process ensures group sizes are equal and eliminates potential bias that may be introduced which is important for c linical research of small sizes. The NOSM research assistant would then commun icate the enrolment and group assignment to Dr. Paolo Sanzo who will administer the AET intervention . The SC intervention will continue under the supervision of the participant’s healthcare provider. Participants will be assigned a code number by the resea rch assistant to ensure confidentiality is maintained during the transfer of data or samples between locations."

These assessments will include a physical, cognitive, neuroimaging, bio marker, and driving behaviour assessmentt . These assessments will also be completed after the intervention in PCS participants, and after eight weeks in HC. Physical and Cognitive Assessment: Participants wi ll complete the Immediate Post -Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT ) at the School of Kinesiology, Sanders building, Lakehead University. The ImPACT will be used as a standard measure of cognitive abilities including: attention, working memory, processing speed, and reaction time. A t a mutually agreed upon date and time, participants will meet a member of the research team at the Lakehead University Sanders Fieldhouse. Before beginning the assessments, a member of the research team will verbally restate the participant’s rights and c onfirm that he/she is still willing to p articipate in the study."
15,page_15,"16 Participants will then be set up at a computer station, where they will follow the on screen instructions for completing the ImPACT battery. Following completion of the ImPACT battery, participants will be asked to stand in a varie ty of static positions including: narrow based double leg stance, single leg stance, and tandem stance with one foot behind the other. Participants will perform each stance position with his/her eyes open and closed and on a firm and soft surface using the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) protocol. Each stance will be performed over an AMTI force platform. This approach will be used to measure participant sway, centre of pressure displacement, and t o count for the number of perturbation errors induced du ring the balance test34. The session should last approximately one hour. Biomarker Assessment: Brain -derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) will be assessed using a morning saliva sample. Participants wil l be asked to refrain from brushing his/her teeth, smoki ng, and consuming food or drink within two hours of the sample collection. Participants will also be asked to avoid alcohol consumption 12 hours prior to sampling. At a mutually agreed upon date and t ime, the participant will meet a member of the research team at the Sanders building, Lakehead University. Before beginning saliva collection, the member of the research team will verbally restate the participant’s rights and confirm that he/she is still w illing to participate in the study. Saliva will then be collected from participants in room SB -1025 (biohazard containment level 1) via the passive drool method into a tube, which will then be put on ice and transported to Dr. Lees’ lab for processing. Pro cessed saliva samples will be stored until samples have been collected from all participants. If the sample is collected immediately prior to the physical and cognitive assessments, participants will be provided with light refreshments after saliva has bee n collected. To analyze salivary samples for BDNF, a san dwich ELISA technique will be used (Mandel, Ozdener, & Utermohlen, 2011). A 96 -well microtiter plate (Nunc Maxisorp; VWR, West Chester, PA) will be incubated overnight at four degrees Celsius. In the 96-well plate, a total of 100 µl of monoclonal mouse ant i-human BDNF (clone 35928.11; Millipore, Etobicoke, ON) will be diluted to 1 µg/ml in a filter -sterilized phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a pH of 7.4. The plate will be washed three times, soaking for one minute between washed. It will be washed with tr is-buffered saline (TBS) plus 5% tween (TBST), and blocked with 300 µl of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.05% PBST for two and a half hours at room temperature. Samples will then be acidified for 2 0 minutes to a pH of 3.0 using 1M of HCl. Samples will b e neutralized after 20 minutes using 1M NaOH diluted in a 1% BSA buffer in PBST to a ratio of 1:4. Comparison will be made between samples and standards diluted in the same buffer as the samples. Thes e will range from 15.63 to 500 pg/ml using a full -length , homodimeric recombinant BDNF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). The plate will then be washed five times, before adding in duplicate 100 µl of sample/standard. At room temperature, the plate will then be incubated at room for two hours with agitation, before b eing washed five more times. After being washed again, a total of 100 µl of polyclonal chicken anti -human BDNF (2.5 µg/ml;"

After two and a half hours, the plate will be washed five times again. Following th is incubation, 100 µl of anti -chicken IgY -HRP (1 µg/ml; Promega) will be added to each well, before being incubated for one hours. The pate will be washed five times after this incubation. A total of 100 µl of room temperature Pierce 1 -Step Ultra TMB solut ion (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) will then be added to each well for fifteen minutes. To stop the reaction at fifteen minutes, 100 µl 1M HCl will be added to each well to stop the reaction. Th e assay will be read at 450 nanometres (nm). Total BDNF (pg/ml) will be calculated by using the standard regression equation provided with the standards. To the research team’s knowledge, BDNF is not used as a diagnostic tool, thus no incidental findings are expected. Neuroimaging: Neural processing will be as sessed by using continuously recorded EEG during the performance of computer based tasks commonly used in experimental psychology for assessing divided attention and inhibitory control. At a mutually agreed upon date and time, participants will meet a memb er of the research team at the Sander building, Lakehead University. A member of the research team will then escort he/she to Dr. Michael Wesner’s Vision Laboratory at Lakehead University. Before begi nning the procedures, the member of the research team wi ll verbally restate the participant’s rights and confirm that he/she is still willing to participate in the study. Participants will be seated at a desk and fitted with an EEG cap and 32 channels will be prepared with gel. Once all recording sites are read y for recording the participant will be familiarized with the task procedures and equipment. At the desk he/she is seated at, he/she will view a monitor and be provided with a response pad. The order of the tasks presented will be counter -balanced in orde r to reduce the chance of order effects. Participants will be offered opportunities for breaks in between blocks of each task as well as in between the start of tasks. Event related potential (ER) wil l be measured for the duration of the tasks. Completion of the session should require two hours. ODDBALL paradigm: The Oddball paradigm is a commonly used task to test attention by requiring participants to make a specific response to rare target stimuli amongst more repetitive, distractor stimuli35. In this v isual version, participants will be provided an instruction at the outset of a block that indicates what the target stimulus for that block will be. During each trial, a stimulus (shape/letter) will b e displayed for 200 milliseconds (ms). Participants will be instructed to respond to each stimulus as quickly and accurately as possible with a button press of one of two buttons; a button to denote distractor stimuli, and a button to indicate target stimu li. The interstimulus interval will be variable (1400 -1600 ms) to reduce anticipation. Participants will complete 400 trials separated into 5 blocks with an option for rests between each block."
17,page_17,"18 FLANKER task: The Flanker task is commonly used to test the ab ility to attend to central relevant information (the dir ection of an arrow) while disregarding irrelevant distracting stimuli (pairs of flanking arrows presented on either side of the central arrow). To identify the direction of the central arrow, particip ants will press a left or right button to indicate the d irection of the central arrow. Data will be separated into time frames containing the components of interest (the N200 and P300). The session is concluded after completion of the od dball and flanker t ests twice. Behaviour Measure (Driving Simulator): The performance of participants in a driving simulator will be assessed by measuring his/her reaction time and counting the number of passes and failures when anticipating potentially dangerous traffic situations. Reaction time will also be measured during d ual-tasking activities. At a mutually agreed upon date and time, the participant will meet a member of the research team at the Sanders building, Lakehead University. A member of the research team wil l then escort he/she to the Centre for Research on Safe Driving (Braun Building, room 1024). Before beginning the assessment, the member of the research team will verbally restate the participant’s rights and confirm that he/she is still willing to partici pate in the study. Participants will then be fitted with a POLAR SP0810 heart rate monitor before being introduced to the STISIM Drive® Model 400 driving simulator. Participants will be seated approximately 70% of his/her arm’s length from the steering whe el with a backrest inclination of 10° (Majid et al., 2013; Yoo, An, Lee, & Choi, 2013)36,37. The simulator will be connected to a PowerLab (16/30) data acquisition unit which will be interfaced with LabChart 7 software. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variabil ity (HRV), and reaction time (RT) will be measured using LabChart 7. Participants will perform a 10 minute orientation drive to familiarized his/herself with the control and feel of the driving simulator. During the orientation drive, he/she will be expos ed to examples of the dual tasking activities so that he /she will know how to successfully respond to the prompts. Once a participant feels comfortable with the simulator, the 20 minute simulation and data collection will begin. The simulation will be base d on the Thunder Bay road system with traffic and pedest rians present. Weather will be clear and visibility will not be reduced. Reaction times will be measured during predetermined scenarios and will be recorded from the moment stimulus occurs to the mome nt the brake is depressed or evasive maneuver performed. Heart rate and HRV will be recorded throughout the duration of the simulation and will be marked at the beginning and end of each dual task scenario and reaction time activity. Participants will be e xposed to several scenarios. These scenarios include: Ve hicle incursion at intersection, pedestrian incursion from side of the road, sudden braking by a vehicle in front of participant, pedestrian incursion in school zone, braking by a vehicle in front of participant, and animal incursion (attached) During dual task events, red triangles will be displayed over either of the side mirrors. These triangles will be deactivated by the press of a button on either side of the steering column, accounting for the du al tasking component of the reaction time scenarios. The se scenarios will"

In the event a participant is unsuccessful during a dual tasking scenario and colli des with on screen stimuli, he/she will continue with the simulation with no second chance at completing that specific activity. If a participant begins to experience sympto ms of simulator sickness, the scenario will be paused to allow him or her to take a break from the screen and/or have something to drink or eat. The research team member will have water on hand, if required by the participant. When he/she feels ready to pr oceed, the simulation will be resumed from the point of the original pause. If a pa rticipant feels that he/she is unable to continue, the simulation will be stopped and data collection terminated. Aerobic and Balance Retraining Program : After completing b aseline assessments, PCS participants assigned to the AET intervention will complet e an eight week supervised AET program. The program will consist of three sessions per week, approximately 40 -60 minutes each. Each session will be completed under the super vision of a trainer with the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP - CPT) ce rtification. At mutually agreed upon dates and times, participants will meet a member of the research team at the Sanders building, room SB -1025. Before beginning the interv ention, the member of the research team will verbally restate the participant’s rig hts and confirm that he/she is still willing to participate in the study. Participants will then be outfitted with a Polar F2 heart rate monitor, in order monitor exercise i ntensity during the session. Exercise intensity for each session will be based on t he participant’s heart rate reserve (HRR). At the first session, the participants HRR will be calculated using the Karvonen formula; Target Exercise Heart Rate = ((220 -Age-Resting Heart Rate) × % Intensity) + Resting Heart Rate. Once the participant’s HRR has been calculated, the participant will begin the aerobic component of the session. The aerobic component of the session will be performed on a cycle ergometer. Participa nts will begin with a five minute warmup at a self selected speed, which will be us ed to bring the participant’s heart rate to the desired intensity. Intensity for each session will start at 20% of HRR, and increase linearly by 10% for the first four weeks ; at week four, participants will be cycling at an intensity of 50%. Weeks five and six will be performed at 55% of HRR, week seven will be performed at 60% of HRR, and week eight will be performed at 65% of HRR. Duration will follow a similar pattern for weeks one to four, beginning at 20 minutes and increasing in five minutes/week incr ements. At week five, duration will be reduced to 25 minutes, and then increase to 30 minutes for weeks six to eight. Following completion of the aerobic portion of the ses sion, participants will rest for five minutes before beginning the balance componen t of the session. Participants will perform three balance exercises (in order) each session: narrow based double leg stance, single leg stance, and tandem stance. Difficulty of these exercises will be progressively increased by modifying the"
19,page_19,"20 duration, surf ace, and whether the participant’s eyes are open or closed. For weeks one and two participants will perform the exercises with his/her eyes open; participants will perform e ach exercise for 15 seconds on a firm service in week one, and on a low density foa m block in week two. In weeks three and four, participants will perform the exercises with his/her eyes closed; exercises in week three will be performed on a firm surface, while week four will be performed on a low density foam block. Duration will be inc reased to twenty seconds per exercise for weeks three and four. Weeks four to eight will follow the same eyes open/closed and surface progression as weeks one to four; eyes open for weeks five and six, eyes closed for weeks seven and eight. Exercises will be performed on a firm surface in weeks five and seven, and on a low density foam block in weeks six and eight. Participants will perform each exercise for 35 seconds in wee ks five and six, and 40 seconds in weeks seven and eight. Following the completion of the aerobic and balance components of the session, participants will complete a cool down consisting of a series of static stretches. Each session will conclude after the completion of the cooldown. After completion of 24 sessions (eight weeks x three -one hour sessions per week), participants will repeat the procedures for the previously described baseline assessments. Similarly, HC and SC participants will complete the ba seline assessments again after eight weeks. 8.

SPECIMEN MANAGEMENT A research assistant, will facilitate the collection of the saliva following an establish passive drool protocol. Participants will be instructed to dro ol though a straw into a c ollection tube. The samples will be transported Lakehead University School of Kinesiology to NOSM for processing and analysis. Salivary BDNF will be quantified using an established protocol in Dr. Lees' lab, which utilizes an enz yme-linked immunosorbent a ssay. All samples will be labeled with the participant code number as well as a letter for each time point. For example, A for pre -treatment, B for post -treatment. Samples will be kept until all analysis is completed, after which all labels will be remove d and samples will be disposed of as biohazardous waste. 10. DATA / SPECIMEN ANALYSIS Dr. Lees and the NOSM research assistant will be performing data analysis on the saliva samples at NOSM. Dr. Sanzo, Dr. Lawrence -Deware, Dr. Wesner, and Dr. Zerpa will be performing analysis on the physical and cognitive measures at Lakehead University . The main analysis will be a comparison of the pre - and post -outcomes. Dr. Paolo Sanzo will perform the analysis of the data collected related to balance from the AMTI force platform and ImPACT neurocognitive assessment. The AMTI force platform measures the ground reaction forces that are generated by a body standing or moving across the plate. The AMTI force plate is also capable of measuring t orques about each axis and has six degrees of freedom, which includes three forces (f z, fx, and f y) and three moments (M z, M x, and M y). All of these measures are fed into an AMTI amplifier and converted to digital signals via an analog to digital converter . The information collecte d by the force platform is then uploaded into BIOSOFT computer software which allows the researcher to view and analyze data following collection. The BIOSOFT computer software calculates the x and y moments of postural sway which are used to compute the v ariables of interest and produces graphical representations of this data. Descriptive statistics will be calculated to provide the mean and standard deviations for the variables of interest including the area of the centre of pres sure, velocity of centre o f pressure, length of centre of pressure, and displacement of centre of pressure. The main objective of the analysis is to compare pre - and post -treatment changes in balance. The ImPACT measures components of cognitive functioni ng including: attention, c oncentration, reaction time, memory, processing speed, decision making, problem solving, and response variability. The main objective of this component of the analysis will be to compare pre - and post -treatment changes in composit e scores for the variables described. Dr. Carlos Zerpa will perform the analysis on the data collected from the driving simulator. This analysis will include the comparison of people with concussion who will undergo AET to those"
22,page_22,"RP-506-07112017 V 1.5: November 30th, 201 8 Multi -modal Evaluation of a Physical Intervention Approach to Treating Persistent Post-Concussive Symptoms 23 going through regular stan dard of care and healthy c ontrol on measures of reaction time for dual and non dual tasking driving events. The analysis will be performed pre and post intervention to examine the interaction effect between group and time on measures of reaction time. The statistical analysis will include descriptive statistics to calculate means and standard deviation for each group for the pre and post test data. A mixed factorial analysis of variance will also be performed with group as the independent factor, time (pre and post intervention ) as the repeated measure and reaction times as the dependent variable to examine the effect of the AET. Preprocessing and analysis may either occur on Dr. Wesner’s recording computer using asa -lab software or a separate analysis compu ter (also password protect ed) using EEGlab software. Prior to analysis data will be segmented into epochs around each event (trial) presentation. Data will be temporally filtered. Baseline line correction using the 200 ms before the stimulus presentation will be applied. Artifact detection and removal will be applied to remove trials that have been affected by excessive head motion (for example blinking, general body movement). Once preprocess, all the trials from the same condition type will be averaged t o create an event -related potential for each condition type. This data, for each participant will be exported for statistical analysis (performed in JASP). Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to determine if there are significant between group and between condition differences. Missing data will be handled according to the type of data that is missing. For analyses that depend on change (pre - vs post -), if a participant misses an assessment (i.e saliva) we will have to exclude the participant’s results fo r that assessment. If the rest of the assessments were completed pre and post intervention, then they will be included in the data analysis. There will be no interim analysis. 11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 11.1 Sample Size Calculation A priori power analysis was conducted to determine that we would have 80% power at alpha = .05 (two tailed) to detect a medium to large effect size with 12 participants in each group, leaving room for a 13% dropout rate. We therefore propose 20 participants per group. 11.2 Statistica l Analysis The main analysis will be a mixed factorial ANOVA to examine interaction effects between group (AET, SC, and HC) and time (pre - and post -) on measures of ERP, balance, BDNF and reaction time. If an interaction is found between grou p and time on any of the dependent variables (ERP, balance, BDNF and reaction time), the interaction will be explained using simple main effects. If no interaction is found for any of the dependent variable measures, the main effects for time and groups wi ll examined b y a post hoc analysis to determine differences between groups. We anticipate greater change in the AET group compared to SC and HC group."

OTHER STUDY ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERATIONS 12.1 Concomitant use of medications or interventions du ring the cours e of the study All relevant concomitant care and interventions are permitted throughout the study. 12.2 Allocation sequence generation and concealment mechanism To randomize participant group assignment, an online program called QMinim (http://rct.mui.a c.ir/qminim/) will be utilized. This program uses a process called minimization which ensures group sizes are equal and eliminates potential bias that may be introduced which is important for clinical research of small sizes (BMJ 2005;330:843 ). 12.3 Blinding Procedures Participants will no be blinded to his/her group assignment. P articipants placed into the SC group will be given the option of receiving the AET after completion of the study, although this will not be included in data analysi s. Dr. Le es, Dr. Zerpa, Dr. Lawrence -Dewar , and Dr. Wesner will be blinded from group assignme nt for data analysis purposes. 12.4 Premature d iscont inuation or termination of the s tudy The study sponsor/investigator and the Research Ethics Board reserve the right to terminate this research study at any time. Reasons for termination include but are not limited to: The occurrence of adverse events poses a potential health risk for participants; Unsatisfactory participant enrollment; Investigator request to withdr aw from study; Noncompliance with the protocol or regulatory guidelines are not being followed; REB decision to terminate or suspend approval for the investigation or Investigator. 12.5 Ancillary and post -trial care Participation in this study is not expected to cause any harm, and the participant can withdraw at any time. There is no compensation as the participant agrees to the risks outlined in the information letter. 13. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE We are able to track adherence to the protocol because the intervention requires a visit which is documented in the data abstraction form. All data will be translated into the data abstraction forms. To promote data quality, all team members will be trained in their duties. All questio nnaires to be used are valid (see Section 7.2)."

The name of this study is “A Multi -modal Evaluation of a Physical Intervention Approach to Treating Persistent Post -Concussive Symptoms”. Please keep in mind that this is an invitation, and by no mean s are you required to participate. This study has been funded through the Northern Ontario Academic Medical Association (NOAMA) through their Clinical Innovation Opportunities Fund. We have asked you to participate because you are a healthy individual, 18 -50 years of age, free of any psychological/neurological disorder, no history of substance abuse, are not currently undergoing therapy or counselling for depression, and have a valid drivers license"
35,page_35,"36 We are a group of researchers and doctors from the Nort hern Ontario School of Medicine (NOSM) and Lakehead University. The research team includes Dr. Sheryl Wark, Dr. Simon Lees, Dr. Paolo Sanzo, Dr. Jane Lawrence -Dewar, and Dr. Carlos Zerpa, and Dr. Michael Wesner. What is the usual treatment? Treatment of concussions usually involves complete physical and mental rest until symptoms are no longer present. In many people, symptoms of a concussion can resolve in 7 -10 days. In a minority of people, these symptoms can last longer than 710 days and may last mo nths or years. In persons who experience long term symptoms, some studies have shown that mental and physical rest may not be beneficial. Why is this study being done? Persons with PCS may experience difficulties completing day to day tasks, such as driving, concentrating, or exercising. This reduces a person quality of life and puts a strain on the healthcare system. The goal of the research study is to determine the ef fectiveness of an aerobic exercise therapy (AET) on PCS, which will include mild aerobic and balance training . An AET program has previously been studied for the treatment of PCS, and results have been promising. As a participant who does not have PCS, if you are participating, you will complete a few initial assessments. These assessments include a computerized concussion test, balance test, reaction test, driving test, and a saliva test over a one week period. After eight weeks, you will complete the same assessments again. If you would like to participate in this study, an appointment will be set up between you and a member of the research team at Lakehead University. The purpose of this appointment will be to inform you of your rights as a participant and fill out an informed consent form. Over the course of the whole study, you will be asked to participate in up to eight assessment visits, four at the beginning, four at the end (described below), including a computerized concussion test, simple balanc e test, reaction tests, and driving simulation. Your saliva will also be collected at some point during this week as well. The ImPACT computerized concussion test and balance test will be conducted at the Sanders building, Lakehead University. For the I mPACT test, you will be seated at a computer station, where you will follow on screen instructions designed to evaluate mental functioning. The ImPACT test should last 30 -45 minutes. The balance test will involve single and double leg stances, with and wit hout your eyes closed. The balance test will be performed on a force"

The entire session should last approximately one hour For the computerized reaction test, you will meet a member of the research team at the Sanders building, Lakehead University, where you will be escorted to Dr. Dr. Michael Wesner’s Vision Laboratory at Lakehead University. Here, you will complete two compu terized reaction tests while wearing a specialized head cap. This cap will allow us to measure brain activity non - invasively during these tests. The tests will involve a series of visual stimuli on a computer screen, which will require you to press a corre sponding button to the stimuli shown. The reaction tests should last approximately two hours. For the driving simulation, you will meet a member of the research team at the Sanders building, Lakehead University, where you will be escorted to the Centre fo r Research on Safe Driving in the Braun building, Lakehead University. The simulation will replicate driving conditions of Thunder Bay, and ask you to respond to a series of scenarios including: vehicle entering an intersection, pedestrian running on to th e road, sudden braking by a vehicle in front of you, pedestrian running on to the road in a school zone, braking by a vehicle in front of you, and an animal running onto the road. These assessments will also be completed while you are required to perform a second task during the scenario, such as pressing a button when your side mirror is covered. This visit should take less than an hour. The saliva draw will be completed in the Sanders building, room SB -1025, Lakehead University. For the saliva draw, yo u will be asked not to brush your teeth, smoke, eat, or drink for 2 hours before saliva collection. You will also be asked not to consume alcohol for 12 hours before saliva collection. You will passively drool into a tube, which will be collected and analy sed in a lab for brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Higher levels of BDNF have been associated with improvements in mental functioning. Following the baseline assessments, you will be asked to return after eight weeks to take the tests once again . During this time, you will be instructed not to significantly change your physical activity level. Upon completion of the study, you will be eligible for a $25 gift card. What will happen during this study? You will be asked to complete the baselin e assessments. After eight weeks, you will be asked to return and complete the assessments again. Below you will find an overview of the study."

Here, you will complete two computer -based reaction tasks while wearing a specialized head cap. This cap will allow us to measure brain activity non- invasively during tasks. In order for the recording electrodes to monitor brain activity, we will place electrode gel at each recording location. The gel may feel slimy and cool at first. Once the"
43,page_43,"44 recording sites are ready, the experimenter will review the instructions of the computer based tasks for you. These tasks will require you to make a button press as quickly and accurately as possible when a target image appears on the computer screen. The whole procedure including set up and recordings should last approximately two hours. There is shampoo and towels available at the lab should you want to wash your hair in a sink following the study. For the driving simulation, you will meet a member of the research team at the Sanders building, Lakehead University, where you will be escorted to the Centre for Research on Safe Driving in the Braun building, Lakehead University.

All AET sessions will be comple ted at the Sanders building, Lakehead University , under the supervision of a trainer that has the Canadian Society of Exercise Physiolo gy Certified Personal Trainer (CSEP -CPT) certification . For all sessions, you will wear a heart rate monitor to measure exercise intensity. The aerobic portion of the session will be completed on a stationary bicycle. During week one, you will complete a f ive minute warmup, followed by 20 minutes of cycling at a low intensity. From week to week, the duration and intensity will be adjusted to gradually increase difficulty . Following the aerobic portion of each session, you will complete a series of balance exercises. These exercises will be the same as completed during the preliminary test. In week one, difficulty will be kept low . As with the aerobic portion of the session, difficulty will be increased from week to week. Difficulty will be increased by adjusting duration, surface (firm or soft), and if your eyes are open or closed during the exercises. Each session will conclude wi th a cooldown consisting of static stretching. After eight weeks you will repeat the baseline testing. If you were in the SC group, you will be offered the AET intervention following completion of the study. You will be able to keep the activity monitors following completion of the study.

Low intensit y aerobic and balance exercise has minimal risk f or healthy individuals. Like all types of exercise, there is a small risk of experiencing an injury such as a sprain or strain. There is a small risk when performing aerobic and balance exercises while experiencing PCS; participants may see an increase or worsening of his/her symptoms. In order to reduce this risk, exercise will be very easy to begin, and gradually get harder over the eight weeks . All exercise sessions will be monitored by a research team member to ensure that the session is being completed at the proper intensity. Should you report any signs of PCS during a session, the session will be stopped immediately. Furthermore, to ensure that you are healthy enough to participate in exercise, all participants will be medically cleared by Dr. Wark pr ior to participating in the study."
