Despite the severity of potential complication s, uniform guidelines are lacking both for the treatment and response to treatment of children and young adults with these tumors. KHE patients have been treated with a multitude of aggressive drug regimens without prospective evaluation of response or saf ety. Presently, vincristine is considered the standard of practice although there is not a lot of data to support this . We have treated a subset of these patients on study SIR-DA-0901 (FDA Grant# 5RO1FD003712- 01). This study is a phase II trial assessing t he efficacy and safety of sirolimus for the treatment of complicated vascular anomalies. Although the numbers are small, the response has been extremely promising with excellent tolerability. There is pre- clinical and clinical data supporting the essential regulatory function of the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway in vascular growth and organization that suggests a therapeutic target for patients with complicated vascular anomalies. The overall goal of this trial is to objectively assess the efficacy of siroli mus compared to vincristine for the treatment of patients with high risk KHE. 2 OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIF IC AIMS) 2.1 Hypothesis: Sirolimus treatment for children and young adults with Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas will be more effective than vincristine, assess ed by time to hematologic response in an induction period and provide equivalent safety parameters. 2.2 Primary Aims: 2.2.1 To determine the efficacy of oral sirolimus as compared to intravenous (IV) vincristine for an induction period of 2 courses in patients with high risk KHE. For this purpose, 50 patients with high risk KHE will be randomized to either receive oral sirolimus or IV vincristine for 2 courses. Both treatment groups will also be placed on a defined weaning dose of steroids over the induction period (initial 2 courses) . Time to hematologic response will then be assessed at the end of 2 courses . Hematologic response will be defined as platelet count of > 100,000 /μl x 2 consecutive lab measurements or an increase of 2 times the baseline for 2 consecutive lab measurements , whichever is greater , and a fibrinogen of > 1 50 mg/dl. (Baseline is initial laboratory evaluation without transfusions). Page 6 of 72"

Toxicities will be assessed and recorded at specific intervals throughout therapy. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0.3 ) will be used to categorize and grade all toxicities. Safety monitoring and stopping rules will be instituted to ensure that serious t reatment -related toxicities are reported and study continuation re- evaluated. 2.3 Secondary Aims: 2.3.1 To determine the efficacy of these agents in the maintenance phase in patients with high risk KHE. Maintenance phase will last for 1 year and treatment change may occur for any patient that loses their response. (See research plan for details) . Formal disease response will be assessed at end of maintenance courses 6 and 12 using radiographic, clinical and quality of life measures. 2.3.2 To determine the safety of these agents in the maintenance phase in patients with high risk KHE. Toxicities will be assessed and recorded at specific intervals throughout therapy. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4 .0.3) will be used to categorize and grade all toxicities with same monitoring. 2.3.3 To assess biomarker /genomic analysis on serum and tissue in children and adults with high risk KHE. Biomarkers in serum will be tested at baseline, end of induction, end of maintenance courses 6 and 12. Tissue availability will be more limited and will only be available at one time point. 3 BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE 3.1 Background and Significance: Patients with Vascular Anomalies (VA) have a spectrum of diseases that can be broad ly classified into vascular tumors and malformations ( 1, 2, 49 ) (Figure 1). Vascular tumors grow and spread through a proliferative process while vascular malformations enlarge through expansion of a developmental anomaly, with little cellular proliferative activity. Growth and/or expansion of VA cause clinical problems such as disfigurement, chronic pain, coagulopathies and bleeding, organ dysfunction and occasionally death. Individuals with VA often experience progressive clinical symptoms with worsening quality of life. Although limited treatment options are available, their efficacy has not been validated in prospective clinical trials and is usually based on case reports. Thus there are no validated standards of care for these patients (3). Figure 1: Classification of Vascular Anomalies Page 7 of 72"
7,page_7,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas (KHE) and tufted angiomas (TA) are rare tumors of vascular origin . There are no national registries documenting numbers of KHE patients but from extrapolating data at the 2 largest vascular anomaly centers in the U.S., the prevalence appears to be 0.91/100,000 children with an estimated total number of diagnosed cases in the US of 760 in 2011. These tumors pose difficult dilemmas for the practitioner particularly in regards to there being limited treatment options and a lack of validated biological markers. For example, KHE and TA can cause a coagulopathy known as Kasabach -Merritt Phenomenon (KMP) which has a mortality rate of 20 – 30% (4-7). A number of therapies have been reported via case reports but none have been uniformly effective. Steroids are often used as a first line therapy with varying results. (8, 9) Interfero n has been used but has signif icant neurological side effects (10-12). Antifibrinolytic agents (e - aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) have been used with mixed responses, as have antiplatelet agents s uch as aspirin, or dipyridamole (13) . Chemotherapy wi th agents such as cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and actinomycin has been used with variable responses as well (14-15). Other medical options that have been used include radiation therapy, compression therapy, and embolization therapy. We initially reported a case of refractory KHE with KMP whose hematologic parameters responded to sirolimus (16). Since that time, other cases have been reported that have improved outcome, at least in the short term (17). We initially reported the use of sirolimus in the t reatment of a 9 month old with refractory KHE with KMP on palliative treatment that had a hematologic recovery in 3 weeks to sirolimus and significant improvement in her clinical symptoms and quality of life (17). She began treatment in July 2007and has no t suffered any long term effects. Since that time, other cases have been reported with excellent short term efficacy (18). Presently, 13 KHE patients are enrolled on SIR -DA-0901 (FDA Grant# Page 8 of 72"
8,page_8,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 5RO1FD003712 -04) (Figure 2 and Table 1). Twelve patients completed drug therapy and are in follow up. All twelve patients had a partial response to treatment (improvement of quality of life, organ function and radiologic imaging). Of the twelve patients who completed treatment, 8 were females and 5 were males. The averag e age at the start of treatment was 11 months with a range of 3 weeks to 3 years. Eleven patients presented at the time of diagnosis with KMP. Of the eleven, 3 had resolution of KMP prior to starting study but all were on steroid therapy and unable to wean treatment because of reoccurrence of KMP. When sirolimus was started all of these patients were weaned off steroids without reoccurrence of KMP. Of the 8 patients with KMP at study initiation, all had resolution of KMP with an average time to hematologic recovery of 3 weeks. One patient with multifocal KHE of the bone without KMP was taken off of study secondary to disease progression. This patient had been given a “wash -out period” (removal from previous therapy for 2 weeks prior to starting protocol). She was in severe pain from the beginning of the study, and also had multifocal bone disease which is extremely rare and perhaps has a different clinical spectrum than unifocal KHE. The “wash out” requirement was subsequently removed from the study. There we re limited Grade III or IV toxicities in this group of patients, none of which required dose reduction or withdrawal from study. There have been no drug related infections and no obvious long term effects. Although we are presently evaluating this data, ou r preliminary conclusion is that sirolimus appears to be an effective and well -tolerated agent for high -risk KHE patients who otherwise have very limited options for treatment.

If our hypothesis is correct this drug will be proven to be more effective than vincristine and we will be one step closer to official FDA a pproval of sirolimus as a first line agent for the treatment of high -risk KHE. 3.2 PI3 Kinase/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway and Vascular Malformations The PI3 kinase/AKT signaling pathway is critical to cell growth and survival and has been shown to govern normal vascular development, angiogenesis and even T cell differentiation (19) . The mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) integrates signals from the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway to coordinate cell growth and proliferation by regulating ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis (20) (Figure 4). Figure 3 : The mTOR pathway Activation of AKT results in the phosphorylation of TSC proteins leading to mTOR activation with resultant cellular growth and proliferation. In addition, enhanced mTOR signaling has been shown to increase expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key regulator of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (21- 24). Disorders that lead to the inappropriate activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway would be predicted to result in tissue overgrowth with vascular anomalies. Indeed, there is preclinical and clinical data suggesting a critical role for this signaling pathway in vasculogenesis with disruptions that lead to hyperactivation of the pathway res ulting in vascular pathology (25) . The over -expression of Akt/PKB (a key mediator of resistance to apoptosis in the PI3K pa thway) in mice is known to cause cutaneous vascular malformations in vivo (26). Tie 2 receptor activating mutations have been associated with development of venous malformations through ligand - Page 11 of 72"
11,page_11,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 independent AKT activation lea ding to endothelial survival (27). Several clinical studies have identified single gene mutations within the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway that are associated with vascular malformati ons and abnormalities of growth (28, 29). Tuberous sclerosis (TS) and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) are caused by inactivating mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex tumor suppressor proteins TSC1 and TSC2 leading to increased activation of mTOR and unrestrained growth/lesions like hamartomas and various skin abnormalities (30). Loss of function mutations i n the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, which inhibits the activation of Akt/PKB, are found in Cowden syndrome and Bannayan- Riley -Ruvalcaba syndrome, two disorders characterized by macrocephaly, vascular anomalies, excessive growth and hamartoma formation (31,32 ). These studies provide compelling evidence for a critical role for the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway in the regulation of vascular growth and organization and suggest a therapeutic target for patients with these disorders. 3.3 Sirolimus and Inhibition of Gro wth Sirolimus (Rapamycin) is a specific and potent inhibitor of mTOR. Inhibition is mediated through binding to the cellular protein receptor FKBP512. The exact mechanism of mTOR inhibition by the sirolimus -FKBP512 complex is not known, although it likely involves disruption of an effective signaling complex. Sirolimus has been used extensively as an immunomodulatory agent and in the treatment of patients with cancer. S ingle agent mTOR inhibition using a variety of mTOR inhibitors has resulted in objective radiographic responses in patients with low -grade astrocytomas (36) , glioblastoma multiforme (37), renal cell carcinoma (33) , mantle cell lymphoma (34), breast cancer (35), and sarcomas (36). Sirolimus has been shown to be effective and safe in both adult and pediatric populations. More recently, mTOR inhibition by sirolimus has been shown to be an effective strategy in the treatment of patients with hamartoma syn dromes. Patients with TS (Tuberous Sclerosis ) and LAM ( lymphangioleiomyomatosis ) showed a nearly 50% reduction in the size of angiomyolipomas and LAM lesions with sirolimus treatment. Upon withdrawal of the drug, however, there was some regrowth of the les ions but they did not to return to their pretreatment baseline (37). A recent case report of a patient with Proteus syndrome treated with sirolimus was also positive including some reversal of the manifestations o f his tumors and malformations (38). 3.4 Study Rationale We propose a multi -center, phase II trial with participation from up to 12 sites. The study will consist of two phases. The first of these is an initial induction phase in which vincristine and steroids will be compared to sirolimus and steroids. Response in the induction phase will be assessed as time to hematologic response . At the end of induction phase, change of treatment can occur if there is failure to respond. Part 2 is a maintenance phase which will be 1 year in length. Continued safety and efficacy data will be collected during maintenance and there may be a treatment change at any time for patients who lose their response following induction . Failure will be defined as worsening of hematological parameters on two separate laboratory evaluations at the end of induction or at any time during maintenance , or if they meet the definition of progressive Page 12 of 72"
12,page_12,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 disease following response assessments (or at the discretion of the PI) . Formal response in maintenance will be evaluated by imaging studies, functional assessment, and quality of life as per study SIR -DA-0901. Present therapies are very limited and new therapies are desperately needed for this devastating disease. Based on our preliminary data, there is a very good rationale for sirolimus therapy in KHE patients and so a phase II trial is urgently needed to determine if this therapy is to become the new standard of care for KHE patients. Our secondary aims will be addressing biomarker analysis. There are limited studies describing the biology of these tumors. Per study SIR -DA-0901 there is some preliminary data indicating the importance of VEGF -C and other upregulated markers in the mT OR pathway. This needs to be further investigated , especially in KHE patients. Furthermore there are no clear objective measurement s to determine response data. 4 RECRUITMENT, PAYMENT, CONSENT, STUDY ENROL LMENT PROCEDURES 4.1 Recruitment Patients will be recruited from the various clinics of the investigative sites .

Patients will be followed through an initial 14- course treatment period (2 courses of induction, 12 courses of maintenance), with 5 -year follow up from time of enrollment for all patients who complete the study or have a response . Patients will be randomized to receive vincristine plus a weaning dose of steroids or sirolimus plus a weaning dose of ste roids. Initial treatment combined with steroids is essential as many patients will be started on steroids at their primary institutions and there is speculation i n our present study that this initial combination may have some synergistic benefit. This wi ll provide consistency of treatment. After induction, patients will then continue on a 1 year maintenance phase. If patients fail to achieve hematologic response at the end of induction or lose their response during maintenance, a treatment change may occur. Formal response in maintenance will be evaluated by imaging studies, functional assessment, and quality of life as per study SIR -DA-0901. Failure at any time will be defined as worsening of hematological parameters on two separate laboratory evaluations. The number of study patients was determined from projections of eligible patients seen by multidisciplinary vascular anomalies centers ov er the past three years. Study participation is limited to those institutions that have the required patient volumes, infrastructure and significant multidisciplinary expertise in investigator initiated clinical trials.

17,page_17,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 6.3 Randomization The initial treatmen t assignment will be made using a response adaptive randomization algorithm: patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (with equal probability) for the first 10 and in a skewed ratio for the rest to favor the better performing treatment arm by adjusting t he treatment allocation ratio based on response data observed on previously accrued patients . The response data observed on previously enrolled patients will be available in a real time and continuously analyzed by the study statistician for treatment as signment of each newly enrolled patient. Clinical trial designs using such adaptive randomization algorithm are known to increase patient benefits over the course of trials without undermining the scientific rigor ( 39). We specifically will use the doubly adaptive biased coin design with a target allocation given by an urn model (40, 41) . Because of the time it takes to measure treatment response, we will modify the dynamic randomization in the following manner. Rather than using all previously enrolled patients response information to randomize the next patient, we will only base new randomization on the information from those previous patients who have had treatment response information available at the time of next randomization. Specifically, the prob ability of assigning a new patient to Sirolimus group is 1 1+𝑁𝑚 ,𝐴 𝑁𝑚 ,𝐵�1−𝑝�𝑚 ,𝐴 1−𝑝�𝑚 ,𝐵�2, where 𝑁 𝑚 ,𝐴 and 𝑁𝑚 ,𝐵 are the number of numbers of patients who have been enrolled in Sirolimus and Vincristine respectively. 𝑝 ̂𝑚 ,𝐴 and 𝑝̂𝑚 ,𝐵 are respectively Sirolimus and Vincristine group observed response rates up to that time point. 6.4 INDUCTION Arm 1: Vincristine + Steroid Taper Arm 2: Sirolimus + Steroid Taper 6.4.1 Steroid Taper – Steroids may be started prior to study enrollment. All participants will continue to receive steroids during the Induction period . The steroid (prednisolone or equivalent) taper will begin following enrollment during 2 courses of the induction period along with either vincristine or sirolimus .

Vincristine administration may be moved by one day per course. The vincristine dose used for this study is based upon weight with 10 kg as a cut -off. Vincristine Dose • 0.05 mg/kg/dose IV – for participants less than or equal to 10 kg OR • 1.5 mg/m2/dose IV – for participants greater than 10kg 6.6 Arm 2: Sirolimus + Steroids (Induction) 6.6.1 Administration – Sirolimus will be administered at a dose of 0.8 mg/m2/dose for participants <6 months of age and 1 mg/m2/dose for participants ≥6 months of age twice a day on a continuous dosing schedule . One course will be 28 days, measured by a 24 hour clock, rather than calendar days, to accommodate instances when the first dose of a course is the evening dose. Previous studies support the role of therapeutic monitoring and dose adjustment, and the importance of twice daily dosing given the more rapid drug metabolism in pediatric patients ( 42). Sirolimus will be administered as an oral (liquid) preparation in this study. 6.6.2 Pharmacokinetically Guided Dosing – The target sirolimus trough level is 10 -15ng/ml. Sirolimus dosing will be individually guided using real- time drug concentrations measurement s in combination with a Bayesian population model -based target optimization approach (43) The dosing of siroli mus will be guided by pre -dose concentration measurements (trough) collected prior to either the AM or PM sirolimus dose . Each participant will have sirolimus serum levels measured according to the timeline listed below. Analysis for sirolimus level will occur at each participating site, or at a local laboratory using a validated assay approved by the study Pharmacologist. Regardless of collection and analysis site, the study Pharmacologist (Sander Vinks , PharmD, PhD, FC at Cincinnati Children’s Hospita l Medical Center (CCHMC) ) or designee will perform all modeling and make recommendations for dose adjustment.

The mini -PK collectio n will be at: 1 hour and 3 hours after a sirolimus dose. 6.7 Hematologic Response Assessment –Induction (all participants) During the induction phase, time to hematological recovery will be measured to assess response . Hematologic response will be defined as a platelet count > 100,000/ µl or an increase in platelet count of 2 times the baseline (whichever is greater) and fibrinogen of > 1 50mg/dl. Hematologic response must be documented within 7 days prior to comple tion of induction course 2 or earlier if failure is suspected. Platelet count and fibrinogen levels must meet these parameters on 2 consecutive lab measurements with a minimum of 1 day between evaluations. Baseline is initial laboratory evaluation withou t transfusions ; lab results performed outside of enrolling site may qualify as baseline as long as supporting documentation is provided. Study treatment will be continued during the period of hematologic response assessment. Hematologic response can NOT be assessed within 24 hours of a platelet or cryoprecipitate infusion (Section 7.1). Page 20 of 72"

Although participants are expected to fini sh their assigned induction period , a participant may switch treatment arm (change treatment) prior to the end of the induction period if it is in the best interest of the participant’s safety and well -being and hematologic failure is documented. Such participant will be considered a treatment failure ( a non -responder will be counted as failure and the participant will change to the other therapy , but will be counted in the intent to treat group). Treatment change is permitted one time during the study. Maintenance should be initiated within one week following documentation of hematologic failure for patients who change treatment . Functional assessments ( Appendix V) and Quality of Life Questionnaires will be repeated prior to start of new treatment arm. These will serve as the baseline for the subsequent assessments obtained during maintenance. 6.9 MAINTENANCE (12 courses) Study treatment ( all participants) will be continuous between the periods of Induction and Maintenance.

The mini-PK collection will be at: 1 hour and 3 hours after a sirolimus dose. 6.11 Response Assessment – Maintenance (All Participants) The optimal measure of disease response in patients with complex vascular anomalies has n ot been established. Current practice includes changes in physical exam, radio logic evaluations, laboratory assessments, and/or quality of life measures. These lesions are difficult to assess with any one method because of heterogeneity in growth patterns, diversity of associated clinical and laboratory abnormalities and a fluctuating clinical course dependent upon factors other than treatment, such as intercurrent infections, puberty, and trauma. It is currently unclear if there is a good correlation between lesion size, as determined radiologically and clinical changes or quality of life measures. For these reasons we have elected to assess formal dis ease response using three distinct methods: 1. Radiologic evaluation 2. Clinical measures of disease (cytopenias, coagulopathies, other clinically relevant radiologic evaluation beyond the lesion of interest such as chest X -rays), and/or parameters for grading functional impairment – (Functional Assessment - Appendix V) 3. Quality of life measures Formal Re sponses will be assessed three times during the study : prior to initiation of study treatment (baseline) , and at the end of courses 6 and 12 following t he start of Maintenance. Disease assessments may be performed at any time during maintenance if clinically indicated. Participants with d isease w orsening as defined as “progressive disease” or “loss of response” based upon any one of the above methods will be permitted to change treatment . If worsened disease is based on laboratory parameters we suggest a repeat of lab oratory evaluations to confirm. Refer to Section 11 for definitions of responses. 6.12 Treatment Change ( During Maintenance) Treatment change is permitted one time during the study. If participant has changed treatment at the start of maintenan ce and has ‘progressive disease’ or ‘loss of response’, off treatment criteria will have been met. If treatment change occurs during maintenance, treatment on the new arm will begin within 7 days of documentation of disease worsening. Functional Assessme nt and Quality of Life measures are to be repeated at the time of treatment change unless performed within the last 7 days. 6.13 Duration of Therapy In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for up to 14 courses (inclusive of Induction and Maintenance) or until one of the following criteria applies: • Intolerable toxicity (leading to treatment interruption for more than 4 weeks) • Refusal of further protocol therapy by patient and/or parent/guardian Page 25 of 72"

Participants who are off protocol therapy will be followed until they meet the criteria for Off Study (see below). Follow -up data will be required unless consent is withdrawn. 6.14 Duration of Follow -Up All patients who complete the study or have a response ( defined as stable disease or better ), regardle ss of treatment arm, will continue to be followed for growth and complications of the vascular tumor and therapy -related toxicities for a total of 5 years from the date of study enrollment. Following completion of study therapy, patients will be followed at a minimum interval of every 6 months. Follow up visits may occur at participants home institutions or they may return to the study site for their routine follow up care . Participants should return to the study site on an annual basis during follow -up. Patients who stop study treatment early for any reason and did not have a documented response to sirolimus or vincristine (defined as stable disease or better) will be followed for 30 days from the last dose of study treatment or until toxicities res olve to baseline or less than or equal to Grade 1 . 6.15 Off Study Criteria • Death • Lost to follow -up • Withdrawal of consent for any further data submission • Complete Follow up as defined in Section 6.1 4 • Five years from protocol enrollment Page 26 of 72"

Platelet transfusions have been associated with an increase in pain and lesion size in patients with KHE/ K MP lesions. Platelet transfusions should be limited and only used if there is actual bleeding or prior to procedures. Hem atologic response can NOT be assessed within 24 hours of a platelet or cryoprecipitate infusion. • Good oral hygiene and mouth care are encouraged, as mucositis is a common toxicity . • Infection Prophylaxis will be administered according to treating center’ s institutional guidelines as immunosuppressed patients are susceptible to Pneumocystis carinii infection. • GFs that support platelet or white cell number or function can only be administered for culture proven bacteremia, clinical sepsis, or invasive fun gal infection with neutropenia. • Constipation prophylaxis is highly recommended as constipation and abdominal cramps are common toxicities associated with vincristine. 7.2 Other therapy for vascular anomaly Interventional procedures may be used to treat symptomatic lesions provided it does not interfere with radiographic evaluation. For any planned s urgery , the treating investigator should consider holding sirolimus. Discussion with the study chair is required. 7.3 Concomitant Medications 7.3.1 Steroids - Steroi d use in maintenance should be limited to physiologic replacement doses due to endocrine deficiencies, as a premedication for blood products and for short courses if medically indicated. This should be discussed with study chair . 7.3.2 Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P -450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P -gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P -gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P -gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. Co- administration of Rapamune wit h strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P -gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P -gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) are not recommended. CYP3A4 – Known strong inducers and inhibitors of isoenzyme CYP3A4, as specified in Appendix II, must not be administered. If these treatments are administered, the patient will Page 27 of 72"

The listing of medications in Appendix II lists medications to av oid/ use caution with when taking sirolimus. Enzyme inducing anticonvulsants: Patients may not be taking enzyme –inducing anticonvulsants, and may not have received these medications within 1 week of entry, as these patients may experience different drug disposition. These medications are listed in Appendix II. 7.3.3 Vaccinations - Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus and vincristine, should not be administered live vaccines.

Sirolimus (Rapamune) is a macrocyclic lactone produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus . In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein- 12 (FKBP -12). The sirolimus : FKBP -12 complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian Targe t of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. Following administration of sirolimus oral solution, sirolimus is rapidly absorbed, with a mean time -to-peak concentration of approximately 1 hour (range 1 -3 hours). The systemic availability of sirolimus was estimated to be approximately 14% after the administration of sirolimus oral solution. The mean bioavailability of sirolimus after administration of the tablet is about 27% higher relative to the oral solution. Sirolimus oral tablets are not bioequivalent to the oral solution; however, clinical equivalence has been demonstrated at the 2 -mg dose level. S irolimus is extensively metabolized by O -demethylation and/or hydroxylation to at least seven major metabolites. The parent drug contributes to more than 90 % of the activity. The main route of elimination is through the feces (91%). The mean t 1/2 increased from 79 ± 12 hours in subjects with normal hepatic function to 113 ± 41 hours in patients with impaired hepatic function. Males have a 12% lower clearance of sirolimus than females after oral solution administration. No Page 39 of 72"
39,page_39,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 differences were demonstrated between black and non -blacks. After administration of the oral solution and tablets with a high fat meal, the maximum concentration was reduced, and the time to maximum concentration was increased. The total exposure to drug (AUC) was also increased. Sirolimus is a substrate for both cytochrome P450 IIIA4 (CYP3A4) and P - glycoprotein (P -gp). Sirolimus is extensively metabolized by the CYP3A4 isozyme in the intest inal wall and liver and undergoes counter -transport from enterocytes of the small intestine into the gut lumen by the P -gp drug efflux pump. Sirolimus is potentially recycled between enterocytes and the gut lumen to allow continued metabolism by CYP3A4. Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed sirolimus may be influenced by drugs that affect these proteins. Drugs that stimulate or inhibit p- 450 enzymes will alter clearance of sirolimus and close attention to potential drug interactions is crucial. 10.1.1 Product Description: For the purposes of this study, only sirolimus oral solution, containing 1 mg/mL sirolimus, will be used. Sirolimus is a white to off -white powder and is insoluble in water, but freely soluble in benzyl alcohol , chloroform, acetone, and acetonitrile. The inactive ingredients in Rapamune® Oral Solution are Phosal 50 PG® (phosphatidylcholine, propylene glycol, mono- and di -glycerides, ethanol, soy fatty acids, and ascorbyl palmitate) and polysorbate 80. Rapamune O ral Solution contains 1.5% - 2.5% ethanol. 10.1.2 Solution Preparation and Storage: Each Rapamune Oral Solution carton, NDC 0008 -1030 -06, contains one 2 oz (60 mL fill) amber glass bottle of sirolimus (concentration of 1 mg/mL), one oral syringe adapter for fitting into the neck of the bottle, sufficient disposable amber oral syringes and caps for daily dosing, and a carrying case. Rapamune Oral Solution bottles should be stored protected from light and refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Once the bottle is opened, the contents should be used within one month. If necessary, the pat ient may store the bottles at room temperatures up to 25°C (77°F) for a short period of time (e.g., not more than 15 days). An amber syringe and cap are provided for dosing, and the product may be kept in the syringe for a maximum of 24 hours at room temperatures up to 25°C (77°F) or refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). After dilution, the preparation should be used immediately. Rapamune Oral Solution provided in bottles may develop a slight haze when refrigerated. If such a haze occurs, allow the product to stand at room temperature and shake gently until the haze disappears. The presence of this haze does not affect the quality of the product. 10.1.3 Route of Administration: Sirolimus may be taken either with or without food. Patients should be advised to take their sirolimus at the same time of the day and at the same time in relation to meals. Patients may not take sirolimu s with grapefruit juice. It is recommended that the oral solution be added to at Page 40 of 72"
40,page_40,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 least two ounces (60 mL) of water or orange juice immediately prior to consumption in order to hide the taste. This solution should be stirred vigorously and then consumed. The container may then be refilled with a minimum of 4 oz of additional water or orange juice, stirred vigorously, and immediately consumed. Special attention must be paid to avoiding foods and drugs that will affect CYP3A4. ( See Appendix II) 10.1.4 Drug interacti ons Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P -450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P -gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P -gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P -gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P -gp - Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) o f CYP3A4 and P -gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered. Grapefruit Juice - Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4 -mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with or be used for dilutio n of Rapamune. Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P -gp - Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P -gp. The dosage of Rapamune and/or the co -administered drug may need to be adjusted. Refer to Appendi x II for prohibited medications. Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with Rapamune, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid. 10.1.5 Toxicity Common Happens to 21-100 children out of every 100 Occasional Happens to 5-20 children out of every 100 Rare Happens to < 5 children out of every 100 Immediate: Within 1-2 days of receiving drug Headache (L), hypertension (L), nausea, immu nosuppression (L), diarrhea, constipation, fever Chest pain, insomnia, dysphagia, vomiting, dyspnea Hypotension, asthma, increased cough, flu like syndrome, tachycardia, anorexia, sensitivity reaction s Page 41 of 72"

Embryo/feto toxicity was manifested as mortality and reduced fetal weights (with associated delays in skeletal ossification). Sirolimus is excreted in trace amounts in milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether sirolimus is excreted in human milk. (L) Toxicity may also occur later. 10.1.6 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Monitoring of sirolimus trough concentrations is recommended for all patients, especially in those patients likely to have altered drug metabolism, in patients ≥ 13 years who weigh less than 40 kg, in patients with hepatic impairment, when a change in the Rapamune dosage form is made, and during concurrent administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors. Therapeutic drug monitoring should not be the sole basis for adjusting Rapamune therapy. Careful attention should be made to clinical signs/symptoms, tissue biopsy findings, and laboratory parameters. The above recommended 24 -hour trough concentration ranges for sirolimus are based on chromatographic methods. Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured b y both chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Because the measured sirolimus whole blood concentrations depend on the type of assay used, the concentrations obtained by these different methodologies are not interchangeable. Adjustments to the targeted range should be made according to the assay Page 42 of 72"
42,page_42,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 utilized to determine sirolimus trough concentrations. Since results are assay and laboratory dependent, and the results may change over time, adjustments to the targeted therapeutic range must be made with a detailed knowledge of the site- specific assay used. Therefore, communication should be maintained with the laboratory performing the assay. A discussion of different assay methods is contained in Clinical Therapeutics, Volume 22, S upplement B, April 2000. 10.1.7 Supplier: For this study, sirolimus (oral solution ) will be supplied by Pfizer and is considered an “investigational” drug . 10.1.8 Return and Retention of Study Drug – Study drug supplies may be destroyed on site per institutional poli cies. Documentation of destruction will be collected during on- site monitoring visits and provided to the coordinating center at the conclusion of the study. 10.2 Vincristine (See Package Insert for product information) 10.2.1 Supplier – commercial supplies are to b e used for vincristine. 10.2.2 Source and Pharmacology Vincristine is an alkaloid isolated from Vinca rosea Linn (periwinkle). It binds to tubulin, disrupting microtubules and inducing metaphase arrest. Its serum decay pattern is triphasic. The initial, middle, a nd terminal half -lives are 5 minutes, 2.3 hours, and 85 hours respectively; however, the range of the terminal half -life in humans is from 19 to 155 hours. The liver is the major excretory organ in humans and animals; about 80% of an injected dose of vincr istine sulfate appears in the feces and 10% to 20% can be found in the urine. The P450 cytochrome involved with vincristine metabolism is CYP3A4. Within 15 to 30 minutes after injection, over 90% of the drug is distributed from the blood into tissue, where it remains tightly, but not irreversibly bound. It is excreted in the bile and feces. There is poor CSF penetration. 10.2.3 Administration Vincristine is to be prepared and administered per institutional policies and the package insert recommendations. It is e xtremely important that the intravenous needle or catheter be properly positioned before any vincristine is injected. Leakage into surrounding tissue during intravenous administration of vincristine may cause considerable irritation. If extravasation occur s, the injection should be discontinued immediately and any remaining portion of the dose should then be introduced into another vein. Local injection of hyaluronidase and the application of moderate heat to the area of leakage will help disperse the drug and may minimize discomfort and the possibility of cellulitis.

43,page_43,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 The World Health Organization, the Institute of Safe Medicine Practices (United States) and the Safety and Quality Council (Australia) all support the use of minibag rather than syringe for the infusion of vincristine. The delivery of vincristine via eithe r IV slow push or minibag is acceptable. Injection of vincristine sulfate should be accomplished as per institutional policy. Vincristine must be administered via an intact, free- flowing intravenous needle or catheter. Care should be taken that there is no leakage or swelling occurring during administration. The solution may be injected either directly into a vein or into the tubing of a running intravenous infusion. When dispensed the container or syringe containing vincristine must be enclosed in an over wrap bearing the statement “DO NOT REMOVE COVERING UNTIL MOMENT OF INJECTION. FATAL IF GIVEN INTRATHECALLY. FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY.” 10.2.4 ADVERSE REACTIONS Prior to the use of this drug, patients and/or their parents/guardian should be advised of the possibil ity of untoward symptoms. In general, adverse reactions are reversible and are related to dosage. The most common adverse reaction is hair loss; the most troublesome adverse reactions are neuromuscular in origin. When single, weekly doses of the drug are employed, the adverse reactions of leukopenia, neuritic pain, and constipation occur but are usually of short duration (i.e., less than 7 days). When the dosage is reduced, these reactions may lessen or disappear. The severity of such reactions seems to in crease when the calculated amount of drug is given in divided doses. Other adverse reactions, such as hair loss, sensory loss, paresthesia, difficulty in walking, slapping gait, loss of deep- tendon reflexes, and muscle wasting, may persist for at least as long as therapy is continued. Generalized sensorimotor dysfunction may become progressively more severe with continued treatment. Although most such symptoms usually disappear by about the sixth week after discontinuance of treatment, some neuromuscular difficulties may persist for prolonged periods in some patients. Regrowth of hair may occur while maintenance therapy continues. 10.3 Steroids (Prednisolone or equivalent) – See package insert for further information 10.3.1 Supplies – Commercial supplies of steroid are to be used for this study. 11 RESPONSE ASSESSMENTS 11.1 Evaluation of Disease Response: Patients will be assessed at the baseline (prior to induction) and 6 and 12 courses after start of maintenance. Page 44 of 72"
44,page_44,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 The optimal measure of disease response in patients with complex vascular anomalies has not been established. Current practice includes changes in physical exam, radiologic evaluations, laboratory assessments and/or quality of life measures. These lesions are difficult to assess with any one method because of heterogeneity in growth patterns, diversity of associated clinical and laboratory abnormalities and a fluctuating clinical course dependent upon factors other than treatment, such as intercurrent infections, puberty and trauma. It is currently unclear if there is a good correlation between lesion size, determined radio logically and clinical changes or quality of life measures. For these reasons we have elected to assess disease response using three dist inct methods: 11.1.1 Response by Imaging: For each imaging assessment time point (at baseline and end of maintenance courses 6 and 12), initial radiologic response will be reviewed by each site’s radiologist. If the radiologist identifies an area of possible disease progression while evaluating the imaging , the imaging will be reviewed by the identified site study radiologist prior to dispensing drug. MRI should be used as the radiologic study of choice. MRI will be performed using a 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla system with standard MRI protocols (Appendix III) to assess vascular anomaly response . In rare cases where the patient may have a contraindication to MRI , contrast - enhanced CT should be performed. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize the target lesion at baseline and during follow up. To improve reliability and consistency of response assessments all imaging will be centrally reviewed at BCH . Screening scan will be sent to BCH immediately for review to confirm eligibility . All scans will be sent by disc at the end of maintenance for assessment. If there is a ny question about radiologic disease response at any time during maintenance, the scans will be reviewed by the site radiologist and BCH study radiologist. 11.1.2 Quality of Life Assessments (QOL): This study will evaluate the effects of disease and treatment with sirolimus on the health related quality of life (HR QOL) in children and young adults. QOL measurements in this population are complicated by the range of age of affected individuals (infants to young adults) and the lack of validated QOL scales for patients with vascular anomalies. However, there exist generic scales used to quantitate QOL in pediatric and adult patients with good reliability and validity for a variety of chronic diseases. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0) will be used to assess the QOL of children from 3 to 18 years of age . (46) The infant PedsQL is a tool to assess QOL in pa tients under the age of 2 years . The PedsQL is a brief standardized multidimensional pediatric QOL scales consisting of both child self -report and parent proxy -report measures and includes Page 45 of 72"
45,page_45,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 generic and disease specific modules. It consists of a 23 -item core measure of global QOL that has four subscales: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. Based on the standard error of the mean, Varni has also defined minimum changes in total score as clinically meaningful (4.4 change in the child self -report and 4.5 change in the parent proxy report). Changes in total scores with maintenance therapy will be used to quantitate the effects of this drug on health related quality of life in the pediatric population. A brief description of the QOL scales being used in this protocol is attached in Appendix V. The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) system will be used to assess health -related QOL ( 47) in adult patients (19 -31 years of age). Specifically, this study will utilize a 27 -item generic core (FA CT-G) that includes 4 core subscales - physical well -being, emotional well- being, social well -being, and functional well -being. The FACT -G is a brief, reliable, and valid QOL measure, which is sensitive to clinical change and has been used with patients with cancer and a variety of other chronic illnesses ( 48). Based on the standard error of the mean, the minimally clinically important difference in FACT -G scores is 3.99. Quality of Life assessments will be used in determining disease response as outlined in section 11.2. For Peds -QL, the patient’s self -report will be used when appropriate . If the patient’s self -report is not available or other circumstances such as developmental delays, mental retardation, psychosis, or other apparent psychiatric issue, that in the opinion of the investigator would impair the subject’s ability to complete the scale accurately, then the proxy report will be used instead at the discretion of the investigator. Likewise, a proxy -report will be used over the patient’s self -report as appropriate based on the developmental age of the patient. This determination will be made by the investigator at the baseline QOL time point and will remain consistent for all other QOL time points. In the event that there is neither a consistent parent nor proxy report, the QOL assessments will not be used as a measure of disease response. Pain will be assessed as an exploratory outcome and is not part of the response criteria for this study. Minimal clinically meaningful values have not been established for these variables; however given the importance of pain from the patient ’s perspective, we will include its assessment. Pain will be measured using the FLACC pain questionnaire for infants and older subjects unable to complete their age appropriate pain questionnaire, the PedsQL Pediatric Pain Questionnaire ( 49) for children a nd the short -form McGill Pain Questionnaire ( 50) for adults. 11.1.3 Clinical criteria and functional impairment: The degree of impairment of organ function caused by the vascular anomalies has been used historically to assess disease response to therapy. Currently, there are no validated scales, specific to vascular anomalies, to assess functional impairment. We ther efore, have developed Page 46 of 72"
46,page_46,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 a system of measurement which can be used across centers in a standardized manner (Appendix I V). This instrument has been adopted from the measures of organ function that have been validated in the quantification of AEs resulting from medical therapies or procedures (Common Terminology Criteria for AEs) and is currently in use In SIR -DA-0901 We will use these objective measures to quantify specific organ dysfunction resulting from vascular anomaly. 11.2 Disease Response Response will be established by changes in at least 1 parameter at 6 and 12 courses after the initiation of maintenance using the following criteria: Disease response – Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) • CR o No evidence of disease on radiologic imaging and o No evidence of organ dysfunction due to disease and o Normalization of QOL criteria * • PR o > 20 % reduction in volume by radiologic imaging , or o Improvement in target organ dysfunction by at least one grade, or o Improvement of proxy -report PedsQL by > 4.5; FA CT-G by > 3.99 * Progressive disease • > 20 % increase in target lesion volume by radiologic imaging, or • Worsening in target organ dysfunction by at least one grade, or • Worsening of Peds proxy -report PedsQL by > 4.5; FACT -G by > 3.99 * Stable disease: None of the above Formal Responses will be assessed two times during maintenance at the end of courses 6 and 12 following start of Maintenance. Disease assessments may be performed at any time during maintenance if clinically indicated. Disease worsenin g as defined as “progressive disease” or “loss of response” based upon any one of the above methods will be permitted to cross -over. If worsened disease is based on laboratory parameters we suggest a repeat of laboratory evaluations to confirm. * In the event there is an apparent discrepancy between the patient or parent proxy PedsQL score with either the investigator’s assessment of target organ dysfunction or response evident radiographically, the patient will remain on protocol therapy at the investiga tor’s discretion. In these particular instances, at the time of planned data analysis, the study statistician will determine if the patient should remain evaluable for overall response for the study. Page 47 of 72"
47,page_47,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 Treatment will be continued until one of the criteria for removal from protocol therapy is met as outlined in section 6.13 . 12 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 12.1 Definitions 12.1.1 Adverse Event (AE) An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g ., an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this tr eatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE. Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by the investigator to the study therapy. 12.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug is the cause. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. Causali ty assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in consideration of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant dru g exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions. Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE: • Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be str ongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome) • One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more tha n Page 48 of 72"
48,page_48,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 once occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. • An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that indicates th e events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group 12.1.3 Unexpected AE or SAR An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if the specificity or severity of it is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). Unexpected also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in the package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 12.1.3.1 Serious AE or SAR An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : • Death; • Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); • Requires inpatient hospitalization (>24 hours) or prol ongation of existing hospitalization;* • Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; • Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event. *Hospitalization for anticipated or protocol specified procedures such as administration of chemotherapy, central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events. 12.2 Documentation and reporting of non -serious AEs or SARs The severity of toxicities will be graded in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE) version 4.0. 3. Grade 2 AEs deemed possible, probable or definitely attributed to study Page 49 of 72"
49,page_49,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 medication and all Grade 3 and higher AEs, regardless of suspected causal relationship to study drug, will be recorded as AEs in the CRFs. For non- serious AEs or SARs, documentation must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 30 day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued. Laboratory results from non- pediatric institutions or laboratories often have significantly different lab reference ranges, not specific for age. In the event of a greater than ±10% difference in the reference range for a specific lab result, either BCH or other nationally recognized pediatric standards may be used to determine the grade of the laboratory value. Collected information should be recorded in the Case Report Forms (CRF) for that patient. Please include a description of the event, its severity or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study drug. Documentation should occur at least once a course. Refer to the Manual of Operations for this clinical trial for more detail instructions regarding a dverse event reporting. 12.3 Documentation of SAEs or Serious SARs SAEs and Serious SARs will be recorded from the time of informed consent until 30 days after completion of study treatment. 12.3.1 SAE and Serious SAR reporting in the Follow Up Period In the event that during the 5- year follow up period the Investigator identifies what is believed to be a new (unexpected) long -term risk or short -term risk (in the event the patient continued therapy on marketed off -label sirolimus) attributable to sirolimus, this SA E must be reported to the Sponsor and to the site’s IRB consistent with any Unanticipated Problem reporting policy, as this would be a new risk directly related to any subject that might be participating in the research. 12.4 Participating Site Responsibilities: 12.4.1 SAE/Serious SAR Reporting All SAEs and Serious SARs, regardless of attribution or expectedness, must be reported to BCH verbally to coordinating center and Denise Adams within 24 hours of site awareness and followed with a FDA MedWatch 3500a Form. F or participating sites, this form must be submitted to BCH within 3 days of learning of the event.

Either the sponsor or the investigator can make the determination of life- threatening. o Unexpected, Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions If an investigator or BCH deems that an event is both a serious SAR and unexpected , the FDA will be notified per 21 CFR 312.32(c ) (1) (i), only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event . The serious SAR must be reported to the FDA as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days after the spons or determines the information qualifies for reporting. 12.5.2 BCH IRB and : BCH DSMB: The sponsor will report any unexpected life threatening event or death (grade 4 or 5) adverse Page 51 of 72"

Pfizer: Fax: ( 866) 997-8322 12.6 Reporting of Protocol Violations/Deviations and Unanticipated Problems Any protocol violations, deviations, or unanticipated problems should be documented and reported according to the coordinating center’s Manual of Operations. See the Manual for more detailed instructions. In addition, each participating site should report protocol deviations/violations or unanticipated problems according to their site’s policies, proced ures and applicable regulations. 13 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 13.1 Sample size and power calculation: This is a two treatment arm randomized multi- center two -phase (induction/maintenance) clinical trial using the doubly adaptive biased coin design with a ta rget allocation given by an urn model ( 40, 41 ) to continuously skew the randomization ratio to favor the better performing treatment arm. Patients will be randomized to receive either sirolimus or vincristine in the beginning of induction phase, and will b e switched to the treatment they were not initially assigned to only if they fail to attain hematologic response (an increase of platelet count of > 100,000 / µl or an increase in platelets of 2 times the baseline, whichever is greater , and a fibrinogen > 1 50 mg/dl ; platelet and fibrinogen levels must meet these parameters on two consecutive lab measurements with a minimum of one day between evaluations ). The primary efficacy endpoint is attainment of hematologic response by the end o f the induction period. We plan to enroll n=50 evaluable patients over a 4 year period from up to 8 participating institutions. In the study SIR -DA-0901 we observed the median time to hematologic response was 3 weeks and we anticipate 74%~90% response rate for the sirolimus treatment arm, whereas 20%~40% for the vincristine, depending on the underlying time to response mechanism and preliminary data. Based on a computer simulation study and assuming a response rate difference of 40% or greater, we anticip ate the proposed sample of n=50 in total under the doubly adaptive biased coin design will provide 73%~90% power to detect a significant higher hematologic response rate of the sirolimus treatment arm. The simulation study also suggests that on average ≥2 0% more patients will be treated with the Page 52 of 72"
52,page_52,"This Protocol is for Research Purposes Only Protocol SIR -DA-1202 Version 01/31/2018 more efficacious sirolimus treatment arm compared to the conventional fixed design. In this adaptive design we will not conduct an interim analysis or stop the trial early. The adaptive design will treat more subjects with the sirolimus treatment arm by design in the case that the sirolimus treatment arm is more efficacious. We also do not expect any serious adverse events attributable to sirolimus. Therefore, futility may be the only legitimate reason to stop the trial early. However, the small total sample size limits the power of the interim analysis to test for the futility of sirolimus and splitting the type I error rate between the interim and the final analysis will lead to reducing the power of the final analysis without any substantial chance of early stopping for futility. An early stopping rule will be invoked to prevent further accrual of patients onto the study in the event that Sirolimus or Vincristine is associated with a higher than acceptable rate of severe toxicity (10%) with severe toxicity (defined as Grade 4 infection, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Grade 2 pneumonitis, Grade 4 rash, Grade 4 hypertension, or Grade >2 allergic reaction) identified during the Induction period ( the first 2 courses ). We ado pt a dynamic stopping rule based on cumulative number of patients enrolled into each tr eatment group. Enrollment to a treatment will be stopped, if the number of severe toxicity AE reaches a threshold defined in the table. This threshold is defined such that the 95% lower confidence bound of severe toxicity exceeds acceptable 10% rate, for either of the treatment group s. The stopping rule has high probability of stopping early if the probability of severe toxicity is moderately great (≥20 %) and low probability of stopping if the underlying probability of severe toxicity is ≤10%. A graph is also give n below to visually show threshold as a function of total number enrolled in a particular treatment group. If the cumulative number of aforementioned severe toxicity AE reaches or exceeds the red line, the enrollment to that treatment will be stopped. New enrollment to the study will only be into the other group at that point.

Blood tests will be obtained at study entry, at specific interval during treatment and at times required for the best care. In addition, results of blood work, evaluations including radiologic imaging , and adverse advents will be recorded at the treatment center and reported to BCH as coordinating center in a coded fashion.

The Sponsor and BCH will not have access to identifying information from participating institutions . 14.2 Potential Risks The primary risk to the subjects from participation in this trial is from sirolimus and /or vincristine toxicity. Risk of toxicity has been correlated with serum levels of sirolimus. All participants will have serum levels measured regularly to guide appropriate dosing and to minimize drug toxicity. Vincri stine toxicity will be closely monitored and dose will be adjusted as needed. Participants enrolled on this trial will be carefully monitored for the development of toxicities, with guidelines for dose modifications, discontinuation of drug, and stopping r ules in place. 14.3 Recruitment and Informed Consent Patients may be recruited from the Dermatology, Oncology, Surgery, and Vascular Anomalies clinics at the participating institutions. The investigational nature and objectives of this trial, the procedures, and treatments involved and their attendant risks and discomforts and benefits, as well as potential alternative therapies will be carefully explained to the patient or the patient’s parents or guardian if he/she is a child, and a signed informed consent document will be obtained. Consent will be obtained by the site PI or an associate investigator on the trial. Where deemed appropriate by the clinician and the child’s parents or guardian, the child will also be included in all discussions about the trial. Requirement for documentation of assent will be determined by the local IRB. 14.4 IRB Approval and Required Documentation This is a multi- institutional trial; BCH will require evidence of local IRB approval of the protocol prior to allowing for accrual of patients at that institution. This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirements . 14.5 Protection against Risks We will obtain institution review board approval at all participating sites. Patient’s risks of participating in research will be kept to a minimum with measures to protect confidentiality and planned interim analysis for safety monitoring. Confidentiality will be maximized by coding patient Page 57 of 72"

The treating physician at the clinical center will keep a list linking codes with patient identifying information in accorda nce with their institutional IRB guidelines. The principal investigators will not have access to identifying information. Best of care will be provided to patients in the event of toxicities associated with treatment. Parents will be provided appropriate c ontact number(s) for treating physicians at clinical sites in accordance with institutional IRB guidelines. 14.6 Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subject and Others This is the first clinical trial to prospectively assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of two treatment options for patients with Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas. There will be potential for a direct benefit for patients with KHE as this will determine the optimum therapy option for these patients. The instruments devel oped in this study will be beneficial for future trials for this population. Finally, the participating institutions will develop a working collaboration that could provide the framework for future clinical trials in patients with rare vascular diseases. 14.7 Importance of Knowledge to be Gained The knowledge gained by this study will help to determine a standard treatment for patients with these rare tumors. Response criteria developed in this study could be utilized for future trials. 14.8 Data and Safety Monit oring Plan The Pediatric DSMB at Boston Children’s Hospital consists of individuals with recognized expertise in oncology, neurology , gastroenterology, conduct of clinical trials, and biostatistics. The DSMB meets a minimum of twice per year. Approximate ly 4 weeks before each meeting of the DSMB, the study chair or designee will be responsible for preparing study reports for review by the DSMB. The DSMB will provide recommendations to change the study or to continue the study unchanged. The trial PI and clinical coordinator will review the study progress regularly. Patients entered on the trial and adverse events will be reviewed to ensure that the study is implemented as outlined in the protocol. Quarterly reports will be generated by BCH to assess comp leteness of data. There will be monthly phone conferences between BCH and the local Principal Investigators to address QA issues. 14.9 Study Monitoring and Auditing This study will be monitored in accordance with the BCH Program Data Safety Monitoring Plan for Phase I, Pilot, and Phase II Studies. Monitoring and auditing procedures as outlined in BCH Program Data Safety Monitoring Plan will be followed to ensure that the entire study is conducted, documented, and reported in accordance with the IRB approved protocol, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements of Boston Children’s Hospital .

It is brief standardi zed pediatric QOL scale with good reliability and validity, which includes both generic and disease specific modules. It takes approximately 5 - 10 minutes to complete and consists of a 23 -item core measure of global QOL that has four subscales: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. There are different forms for parents of children ages 0 – 18 years ( infant 0 - 12 months; infant 13 - 24 months; toddler: 2 – 4; young child: 5 – 7; child: 8 – 12; adolescent: 13 – 18) and parallel self -report forms for ages 5 – 18 years (young child: 5 – 7; child: 8 – 12; adolescent: 13 – 18). Adult QOL Measures Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT; Cella et al., 2002 , 19-31 years ): Adult self -report ge neric and disease- specific health -related QOL scales that consist of an assessment of general health status, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -General (FACT -G), and different subscales to assess disease specific issues of both cancer and non - cancer illnesses as well as specific symptoms. The 4 generic core subscales of the 27 -item FACT -G are 1) physical well -being, 2) emotional well -being, 3) social well -being, and 4) functional well -being. The FACT -G is a brief, reliable, and valid QOL measure, w hich is sensitive to clinical change (Cella et al, 1993) and has been used with patients with cancer and a variety of other chronic illnesses (Cella et al, 2001). The response format is a 5 -point likert scale. It will be administered to individuals 18 year s and older and takes about 5 – 10 minutes to complete. Pediatric Pain Measure Peds QL Pediatric Pain Questionnaire (Varni et al., 1987) : A pediatric pain scale designed so that parents and children from 5 – 18 years of age can independently assess the intensity of children’s present pain and their worst pain in the past week. It consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a happy face on one end of the line and a sad face on the other end. The child (or parent) is instructed to put a mark on the line that indicates how much pain the child is feeling. In addition, there is a drawing of a child and the child is asked to color where on the body the pain is. The VAS measure has been shown to be reliable and valid of pain perception in pediatrics. Higher s cores indicate greater pain intensity. This scale takes approximately 5 –10 minutes to complete.
