The study design includes a screening period, a 12-week treatment period, a follow -up period , and a 12 -month open -label extension period . Eligible patient s will be randomly assigned , under double -blind conditions , to receive Risperidone ISM (75 or 100 mg) or placebo . If indicated for an individual patient , prohibited medications may be washed out during the s creening period . Patient s who have never taken Risperidone must have a brief trial of oral Risperidone (2 mg/day for 3 days during the screening period) in order to ensure a lack of any clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions before the first do se of long -acting intramuscular ( IM) study drug is administered . Either of these circumstances may, at the investigators’ discretion, involve admitting the patient to the inpatient unit during the screening period . An ophthalmological examination , inclu ding slit -lamp biomicroscopy examination (eyelids, conjunctiva, iris, crystalline lens, sclera , and cornea), best correct ed visual acuity , visual field, and intraocular pressure , should be done at any time during the screening period. The result of the oph thalmological examination must be available by study day -1. These tests need to be done again at visit 14 or at early termination visit. Patient s enrolled in the double -blind segment of the study will be admitted to the study site’s inpatient unit so metime during the screening period (from 1 to 8 days before study day 1) .

The IM study drug (double -blind active Risperidone ISM or placebo ) will be administered in a deltoid or gluteal muscle for a total of 3 times, once every 4 weeks , during the 12-week treatment period (i.e., at study days 1, 2 9, and 57). Efficacy will be assessed by describing changes in scores on standard psychiatric assessment tools at each visit. Safety assessments will also be conducted at each visit . Patient s who complete planned double -blind study drug treatments and study evaluations may be eligible to participate in a n optional long-term extension segment of the study , in which treatment with open -label Risperidone ISM 75 or 100 mg would begin immediately . For patient s who do not participate in the extension segment , a safety follow -up phone contact will occur approximately 2 weeks after the end -of- treatment visit. In addition to patients continuing from the double -blind segment of the study (rollover patients), clinically stable patients not previously enrolled in the study (de novo patients) may be eligible to enter the long-term extension segment of the study. These patients will be evaluated for eligibility at a screening visit and, if eligib le, will be allocated to receive either 75 or 100 mg Risperidone ISM ev ery 4 weeks for approximately 12 months . Number of Patient s: Approximately 436 patient s total randomized are planned (145 per arm ) in the double -blind segment of the study . Approximately 100 de novo patients are planned to be enrolled in the extension seg ment of the study , in addition to rollover patients . Interim Analysis : One unblinded interim analysis will be conducted when 196 (approximately 50%) randomized patient s, for whom the blinding was not compromi sed, have either reached study day 85 or withdra wn from the study to re-estimate the sample size required for the final analysis up to 558 patient s (186 patient s per arm ). Treatment: The active study drug is Risperidone ISM, and the comparator study drug (inactive) is placebo . Eligible patient s will be randomly assigned under double -blind conditions to receive the following study drug treatments in a 1:1:1 ratio during the double -blind treatment period : Risperidone ISM 75 mg, Risperidone ISM 100 mg, or placebo . During the treatment period of the double -blind segment of the study, t reatment assignment for each individual patient will remain blinded for patient s, investigators, and all study site staff, with the exception of certain identified individuals at each study site who will be unblinded in order t o prepare and administer IM study drug for each patient at that study site . However, i n the extension segment of the study, all participating patient s will receive active Risperidone ISM under open -label conditions. Patient s who had been on active Rispe ridone ISM in the double -blind segment of the study will continue to receive active Risperidone ISM at the same dose ( i.e., 75 or 100 mg) in the extension segment . Patient s who had been receiving placebo in the double -blind segment of the study will be ra ndomly assigned to receive either 75 or 100 mg during the extension segment .

De novo patients participating in the extension segment of the study will recei ve either 75 or 100 mg Risperidone ISM depending on their previous oral risperidone dose. Patients on 4 mg /day of oral risperi done will be assigned to 75 mg Risperidone ISM every 4 weeks , and patients on more than 4 mg/day to a maximum of 6 mg /day of oral risperid one will be assigned to 100 mg Risperidone ISM every 4 weeks . Duration of Patient Participation: Approximately 12 to 15 weeks in total is planned , including a screening period ranging from 1 day to 2 weeks (screening > 8 days requires medical moni tor approval ), a 12-week treatment period, and a 2 -week follow -up period (not applicable for patient s who enter into the long-term extension study) . For rollover patients, t he optional long -term extension segment of the study begins immediately upon compl etion of the end -of-treatment visit and continues for approximately 12 months . For de novo patients, a screening period of up to 8-day is planned, followed by a 12-month open -label treatment period.

Long- acting formulations also are available for certain a typical antipsychotics , including Risperidone (Risperdal Consta®) and paliperidone palmitate ( Xeplion® and Invega Sustenna®). Risperda l Consta has been shown to be efficacious in achieving and maintaining remission status, and studies have shown an overall reduction in healthcare costs associated with frequent relapse and hospitalization .4 Clinical studies have shown that intramuscular (IM) paliperidone palmitate may be clinically useful in the treatment of patients with acute schizophrenia who were previously unsuccessfully treated with oral antipsychotic s.5,6 However, the number of currently available long-acting atypical antipsychotic medication options is limited, and thus there is a clinical need for additional long-acting atypical antipsychotic me dication options. Risperidone ISM® is an injectable IM in situ microparticle (ISM) long-acting formulation of risperidone currently in clinical development as a treatment for schizophrenia . Risperidone ISM is intended for IM administration once every 4 weeks , without any supplementation with oral risperidone . Previous studies of Risperidone ISM support its further clinical development. Two single -dose clinical phase I studies have been conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetic characteristic s and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Risperidone ISM in healthy volunteers (n = 17) and in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (n = 36), respectively . In the phase I study in healthy volunteers (ROV -RISP -2009 -01), single Risperi done ISM doses of 25 mg (n = 8 ) and 37.5 mg (n = 9) were evaluated, and all subjects completed the study . Risperidone , 9-OH-risperidone , and the active moiety (risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone combined ) plasma concentration profiles showed that while p lasma concentrations were higher for the 37.5 mg dose than for the 25 mg dose, maximum concentration ( Cmax) and area under the concentration -time curve values increase s were not dose proportional . All subjects had at least 1 treatment -emergent adverse event (AE) . The most frequently reported AEs were somnolence (10.1%) and injection site pain (8.1%), all of which were considered to be of mild or moderate intensity . Only 2 subjects , both in the second cohort (37.5 mg), had a serious AE (SAE) . Each of these 2 subjects had 2 SAEs; the same 2 SAEs of tachycardia and oromandibular dystonia were reported by both subjects . All subjects were considered to have recovered by the end of the study . In the phase I study in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffecti ve disorder (ROV -RISP -2011 -01 [PRISMA -1]), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of risperidone after single Risperidone ISM doses of 50 mg (n = 13), 75 mg (n = 12), and 100 mg (n = 11) were delineated . Risperidone , 9-OH-risperidone , and the active moiety ( risperidone and 9 -OH-risperidone combined) plasma concentration profiles over time (up to 75 days after administration of Risperidone ISM) showed the following active moiety mean"

Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters of Risperidone ISM were in line with the results of the previous phase I study and with the literature on other marketed long -acting atypical antipsychotics , and overall , Risperidone ISM at all 3 tested dose strengths provided sustained release of risperidon e and achieved therapeutic plasma levels within 1 day after injection . Overall, 34 subjects (94.4%) had at least 1 treatment -emergent AE during the study ; the percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 treatment - emergent AE was similar across the 3 dose groups (92.3%, 100%, and 90.9% in the 50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg group s, respectively) . A phase II multiple -dose study has also been conducted (ROV -RISP -2011 -02 [PRISMA -2]). Population pharmacokinetics modeling simulations were performed to guide the dose selection in th is multicenter, open -label, 2-arm, parallel -design, repeat -dose clinical study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of 4 monthly IM injections of Risperidone ISM (75 mg) in subjects with schizophrenia . Risperidone ISM provided a sustained release of risperidone that achieved monthly therapeutic plasma levels within 1 day, without oral supplementation . The preliminary safety data of Risperidone ISM from the clinical studies mentioned above are consistent with the well-known safety profile of other marketed risperidone products in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and have shown Risperidone ISM to be well tolerated in the subjects evaluated . Based on the pharmacokinetic results from the phase I study in healthy volunteers (ROV -RISP -2009 -01), a population pharmacokinetic model was constructed to estimate plasma concentration s for therapeutic doses of Risperidone ISM. For the phase I clinical study (ROV -RISP -2011 -01 [PRISMA -1]), both overall exposu res and an active moiety C max cutoff point of 80 ng/m L were considered in dose selection . A maximum dose of 100 mg was selected for use in the first part of the study , as the population pharmacokinetic model ’s worst -case estimate was that this dose would provide a n active mo iety median Cmax value of approximately 80 ng/m L (i.e., assuming log -linear increases in bioavailability with ascending doses) . Data from the ph ase I and phase II studies were used to further refine the population pharmacokinetic model to support dose selection for this and other p hase III clinical studies. Simulations and c omparison of 5 multiple -dose regimens (37.5, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mg) showed that doses of 75 and 100 mg administered either in the gluteal or deltoid muscle resul ted in predicted median Cmax and trough concentration in plasma ( Ctrough) that stayed between thresholds of 7.5 and 80 ng/mL , thereby reducing the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms while maintaining plasma concentrations sufficiently high for efficacy. Plasm a concentration -time profiles and steady -state pharmacokinetic parameters of the active moiety after 4 doses (75 and 100 mg) Risperidone ISM were compared to commercially available Xeplion (paliperidone palmitate). Paliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone (i.e., 9-OH-risperdione) and is administered as in itial doses of 150 and 100 mg, given 1 week apart, followed by a maintenance dosing regimen of 75 or 100 mg, given every 4 weeks. There was a large overlap in pharmacokinetic profiles. In a n umber of patient s, the predicted plasma concentrations of active moiety at the end of the 28 -day treatment with 75 and 100 mg isperidone ISM were below the lower threshold of 7.5 ng/mL .7 Steady -"

Furthermore, the same 2 doses (75 and 100 mg) of Risperidone ISM were compared to oral risperidone given daily at doses of either 4 mg/day or 6 mg/day. Full adherence was assumed for oral risperidone . Compared to Risperidone ISM, 4 mg/day oral risperidone resulted in steady -state plasma concentrations of the active moiety above 7.5 ng/mL in almost all patient s. In addition, all simulated profiles did not reach the upper threshold of 80 ng/mL, which is considered to be a surrogate for safety. For the higher dose of 6 mg/day, predicted plasma concentrations were higher than 80 ng/mL in a number of patient s and over the entire dosing interval. The 75 mg dose of Risperidone ISM resulted in similar area under the concentration -time curve within a dosing interval and average plasma concentration as the oral 4 mg/day dose. However, it should be kept in mind that nonadh erence to long -term oral medication is a well - known therapeutic issue in schizophrenia .8,9 Hence, the simulated pharmacokinetic profiles after oral risperidone treatment are predicted to be higher than those that may be actually expected in patients with schizophrenia. As a consequence, C trough values after oral treatment in patients with schizophrenia may well be in the same range or even lower than those predicted for Risperidone ISM. In an exploratory evaluation of predicted D2 receptor occupancy (RO), it was shown that after IM administration of a 100 mg and 125 mg dose of Risperidone ISM, median D2 RO stayed within the 65 % to 80% window over the entire 4 -week dos ing interval , only slightly exceeding the upper limit in the first week after administration. Comparison of Risperidone ISM with Xeplion showed that predicted median average RO values were comparable for both compounds after administration of a maintenanc e dose of 75 or 100 mg. However, predicted median Ctrough RO values were slightly lower and predicted median peak RO slightly higher after administration of Risperidone ISM. When evaluating predicted D2 RO, it should be kept in mind that the correlation between D2 RO and clinical responses to an antipsychotic drug might be more complex and that patient s might experience efficacy on much lower predicted D2 RO or might not experience any extrapyramidal symptoms at higher predicted D2 RO .10 These doses are expected to produce therapeutic levels of risperidone within 24 hours of the first injection; these therapeutic levels will be maintained for 28 days and will provide sustained levels of risperidone throughout the duration of the study. Thus , this study is designed to statistically demonstrate superior efficacy of Risperidone ISM to placebo."

Eligible patient s will be randomly assigned , under double -blind conditions, to receive Risperidone ISM ( 75 or 100 mg) or placebo. The study desi gn includes a screening period ( planned duration 1 to 8 days) immediately preceding the baseline day (designated as study day 1), a treatment period (duration 12 weeks), a follow -up period (duration 2 weeks ; not applicable for patient s who enter into a lon g-term extension study ), and an open -label extension period (duration 12 months) . The screening period for a given patient generally should be as brief as is clinically feasible (e.g., target of 3 days preferred) but may last up to 8 days (e.g., in order to safety washout any prohibited medications) ; an extension up 14 days maximum may be permitted with medical monitor approval . Eligible patient s should be admitted to the inpatient study unit upon completion of screening assessments at the initial screen ing visit . Patient s will have a diagnosis of schizophrenia experiencing an acute exacerbation . Following confirmation of eligibility , each patient will be randomly assigned under double -blind conditions to receive 1 of the following 3 study drug treatm ents: Risperidone ISM 75 mg , Risperidone ISM 100 m g, or placebo . The randomization scheme will ensure that an overall 1:1:1 ratio of assignments to each of these 3 study drug treatment s is approximated."

A trial of oral risper idone is not required for patient s who have previously taken any formulation of risperidone . Patient s enrolled in the double -blind segment of the study will be admitted to the study site’s inpatient unit sometime during the screening period (from 1 to 8 days before study day 1) . It is generally anticipated that patient s may remain on the inpatient unit for at least 7 days after the first IM dose of long - acting study drug is administered . However, inpatient duration may vary for individual patient s and potentially may range from 1 to 14 days . If the investigator determines that a given patient should remain inpatient beyond study day 15, the medical monitor should be contacted to discuss the extension . Study drug will be administered as IM injection s (see Section 5.1.2 ). Treatment assignment for each individual patient will remain blinded for patient s, investigators, and all study site staff, with the exception of identified individual s at each study site who will be unblinded in order to prepare and administer study drug for each patient at that study site . After initial do sing on study day 1 , each study drug (Risperidone ISM or placebo ) will be administered once every 4 weeks during the 12-week treatment pe riod (i.e., at study days 29 and 57). Efficacy will be assessed by describing changes in scores on standard psychiatric assessment tools at each visit, and safety assessments will be c onducted at each visit as well . Patient s who complete planned partic ipation in this study through to the end of the treatment period may be eligible to enter into an optional long-term extension segment of the study during which open -label Risperidone ISM (i.e., either 75 or 100 mg ) will be administered to all participatin g patient s once every 4 weeks for approximately 12 months . However, in order to preserve the blinding condition of the double -blind stage of the study, if a participating patient enters this OLE phase of the study prior to locking the database of the doub le-blind stage of the study, the allocation to either 75 o r 100 mg of this patient will be still blinded at least up to locking the aforementioned database. Patient s who enter into the extension segment of the study will begin participation in the extensio n segment immediately upon completion of the end-of-treatment visit assessments and procedures .

Note: du e to a potential accidental unblinding quality issue , it was considered that 43 patients were potentially compromised and therefore the sample size has been increased to compensate them . In addition to patients continuing from the double -blind segment of t he study (rollover patients), patients not previously enrolled in the study (de novo patients) may be eligible to enter the long -term extension segment of the study. These patients will be evaluated for eligibility at a screening visit and, if eligible, will be allocated to receive either 75 or 100 mg Risperidone ISM every 4 weeks for approximately 12 months ."

At each identified time point, vital signs will be measured afte r the patient has been resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes. On days when patient s receive an IM injection of study drug, vital signs are to be measured within 1 hour before and then again within 3 hours afte r the study drug injection; at e ach of these time points, orthostatic blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured (immediately after completion of supine vital sign measurements) after the patient has risen from the supine to the standing position and has remained standing for approxi mately 3 minutes (see Section 6.4.3 ). 17 A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at identified visits; on days when patient s receive an injection of IM study drug, an ECG will be performed both before and after dosing. Pre-dose ECG is to be completed within 1 hour prior to dosing. The post -dose ECG is to be completed within 3 hours post -dose. All scheduled ECGs are to be performed after the patient has rested quietly for at least 5 minutes in the supine position (see Section 6.4.4 ). 18 The patient will perform and record self -assessment of pain at the injection site using the injection site pain VAS (see Appendix D) approximately 1 hour after each study drug injection.

However, in order to be eligible for transition into the extension segment, a patient must first complete all assessments and procedures scheduled for the end -of- treatment visit for the double -blind treatment period of the main part of the study. Patient s who withdraw or are withdrawn early from the main part of the study ( i.e., before the scheduled week 12 time point) are not eligible for enrollment into the extension segment. 2 Visit 14 is the designated end -of-treatment vi sit. However, if a patient withdraws or is withdrawn early from the study, an early termination visit should occur at which time all assessments for the end -of-treatment visit (as listed for visit 14) plus all the socio -demographic information and HRU (ce nter and patient) data collection will be performed. 3 The follow -up visit will be conducted by telephone. 4 The allowable study visit time window for each of the extension baseline visit is within 3 days after visit 14 of the main part of the study occu rs; however, it is generally preferable to conduct the extension baseline visit assessments and procedures later in the day ( i.e., after completion of all assessments and procedures scheduled for the end -of-treatment visit for the double -blind treatment period of the main part of the study) on the same day on which the main study visit 14 occurs. The allowable study visit time windo w for each of the subsequent extension visits is ± 3 days ( i.e., extension visits 2 through 15, inclusive). 5 Extension day 1 (the extension baseline visit time point) is planned to be the same day and date as day 85 of the main part o f the study, thoug h a + 3 -day window for extension day 1, as compared with the day and date of the end -of- treatment visit for the main study day 85, is allowable. 6 A separate informed consent form for participation in the optional extension segment of the study must be signed before any assessments or procedures for the extension segment are performed for a given patient and before any dose of open -label Risperidone ISM is administered to that patient . 7 Eligibility will be determined by the investigator, who will as sess eligibility by confirming that that all extension segment inclusion criteria (see Section 4.1.2 .1) have been met and that none of the extension segment exclusion criteria have been met (see Section 4.1.2.2 ). 8 In the extension segment of the study, all participating patient s will receive active Risperidone ISM under open -label conditions. Patient s who had been on active Risperidone ISM in the double -blind segm ent of the study will continue to receive Risperidone ISM at the same dose ( i.e., 75 or 100 mg) in the extension segment; patient s who had been receiving placebo in the double -blind segment of the study will be randomly assigned to receive either 75 or 100 mg during the extension segment. All Risperidone ISM doses will be administered by deep IM injection (deltoid muscle or gluteal muscle). 9 For identified assessments at the extension baseline visit time point (on extension day 1), results obtained as part of the main study visit 14 ( i.e., the designated assessments performed for the end -of-treatment visit for the double -blind treatment period [week 12 time point] of the main part of the study) may be used as the extension baseline values and do not ne ed to be repeated for the extension baseline visit time point if and only if the extension baseline visit occurs on the same day and date as th e main study visit 14/week 12/end -of-treatment visit. If the extension baseline visit instead occurs on a day 1 to 3 days after the main study visit 14/week 12/end -of-treatment visit (see extension segment footnotes 2 and 3), all of the designated assessments must be performe d separately on the day of the extension baseline visit, and the main study visit 14/week 12/end - of-treatment visit assessment results cannot be used as substitutes. 10 Although a CGI -I score in reference to baseline of the main part of the study will be reported as part of the assessments for the end-of-treatment visit for the double -blind treatment period (visit 14 of the main part of the study), no CGI -I score in reference to the extension segment will be reported at the extension baseline time point ( which may be later on the same day as the visit 14 of the main part of the study). For all subsequent visits in the treatment period of the extension segment ( i.e., extension segment visits 2 through 14, inclusive), the reference time point for the CGI -I scores will be that patient ’s overall status at the extension baseline time point. 11 Health economics and outcomes research evaluations. To be administered prior to medication dose. 12 Monitoring for AEs will occur throughout a patient ’s participati on in the extension segment of the study, starting from the patient ’s signature of informed consent form; required details of identified AEs are to be recorded. 13 Information regarding concomitant medications, including new medications and changes to ex isting medications, will be elicited and recorded. 14 Vital signs will include blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature.

Each pre -dose ECG is to be completed within 1 hour before dosing. Each po st-dose ECG is to be completed within 3 hours post -dose. All scheduled ECGs are to be performed after the patient has rested quietly for at least 5 minutes in the supine position (see Section 6.4.4 ). 16 The patient will perform and record self -assessment of pain at the injection using the injection site pain VAS (see Appendix D) approximately 1 hour after each study drug injection. The investigator will inspect the recent injection site and all injecti on sites where IM study drug has been injected on previous visits, also approximately 1 hour after each study drug injection. 17 The hematology panel includes the following tests: hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, white blood cell count and differential count (absolute values for basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils), and platelets. 18 The chemistry panel will include standard tests as well as hemoglobin A1c, thyroid -stimulating hormone, and a lipid panel. 19 A blood sample for a serum pregnancy test is not required, but the investigator may order a serum pregnancy test at any time according to the investigator’s judgment. 20 On extension segment day 1 and at each identified visit thereafter, onsite dipstick tests will be used for urine pregnancy tests. At each applicable visit, the urine pregnancy test must be performed and a negative result confirmed before the schedule dose of study drug for that day is administered. 21 The urinalysis includes the following tests: color, pH , specific gravity, ketones, protein, glucose, bilirubin, nitrite, urobilinogen, and occult blood.

The following are considered acceptable methods:  Condom (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide  Intrauter ine device  Hormonal contraceptive ( e.g., birth control pills or patches, vaginal ring , or contraceptive implant) Female patient s who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy are considered surgically sterile and are thus are exempt from the requirement to use contraception . Men with an exclusive female partner meeting 1 of these surgically sterile criteria, as well as men who have themselves had a vasectomy, are also exempt from the requirement to use contracept ion. Female patient s who are postmenopausal are considered not of childbearing potential and thus exempt from the contraception requirement ; for the purpose of this study, postmenopausal is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation for at least 12 months prior to screening in women ≥ 45 years of age. Patient s who are abstinent from sexual intercourse are eligible for participation in this study if they agree to use an acceptable contraceptive method should they engage in such sexual activity while participating in this study . If a female patient becomes pregnant while participating in the study, study drug must be discontinued immediately and early termination and safety follow -up visits should be scheduled . Any pregnancy must be reported to the sponsor (see Section 6.4.9 ). 3.2.2 Concomitant Therapy All concomitant medication s (including those used during ophthalmological examination, if any) and other therapies received during a patient ’s participation in this study ( i.e., from the date of the informed consent form is signed through to the date of the final study visit) should be recorded. The investigator may discontinue or adjust the dose of a concomitant medication to ensure patient safety; however, unnecessary changes in concomitant m edications for reasons other than safety are generally discouraged to avoid confounding study evaluations. The medical monitor should be consulted for any questions concerning concomitant medications. 3.2.2.1 Prohibited Therapy 3.2.2.1.1 Prohibited Medications 3.2.2.1.1.1 Cytochrom e P450 3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors and 2D6 Inhibitors Clinically significant i nducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 2D6 (whether prescription medications, over -the-counter medications, or dietary supplements) are p rohibited during the course of the study and within 30 days before study day 1 (see Appendix B)."

Existing antipsychotic medication must be discontinued during the screening period ( for patients in the double -blind segment of the study, this will be while the patient is admitted to the inpatient study unit) , if deemed clinically appropriate by investigator judgment . The same applies to de novo patents where all antipsychotic medication other than oral risperidone must be discontinued during the screening period. The last dose of oral risperidone should be administered on the day preceding baseline visit . This restriction applies also for antipsychotics given as sleep aids. The duration of the antipsychotic medication washout period (e.g., approximately 3 to 5 times the half-life of an oral antipsychotic, if appropriate and feasible ) will be at the discretion of the investigator , in consultation with the medical monitor when deemed indicated . If administration of an additional or different antipsychotic medication ( other than protocol -defined study drug) , or any other treatment for schizophrenia , is considered clinically indicated during a patient ’s participation in the study, the investigator should contact the medical monitor to discuss the circumstance and determi ne a course of action for the given patient . 3.2.2.1.1.3 Other Psychotropic Medications Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine, selegiline, moclobemide) are strictly prohibited during a patient ’s participation in this study and for ≥ 14 days before the screening visit. All other antidepressant medication s are also not permitted during the treatment period . Patient s taking antidepressants may be considered for washout of these medications durin g the screening period . Lithium and mood stabilizers are not permitted during a patient ’s participation in the treatment period of this study . Nicotine replacement therapy , including nicotine replacement patch and oral nicotine gum , is permitted . How ever, varenicline ( Chantix®) is not permitted. Otherwise, in general, use of psychotropic medications other than study drug is discouraged during a patient ’s participation in the study, with the exception of medications specifically identified in this protocol as permissible . The medical monitor should be consulted for any questions about use of any psychotropic medications during a patient ’s participation in this study. 3.2.2.1.1.4 Drugs of Abuse Prohibited substances include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, methadone, opioid s, and phencyclidine . If it is determined that a patient has been using any of these substances during participation in this study , the investigator should contact the medical monitor to discuss the course of action. Tobacco and/or caf feine use is allowable if use is anticipated to remain relatively stable throughout a patient ’s participation in the study. While it is preferable that patient s do not use any alcohol or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC )-containing substances ( e.g., marijuana), in certain cases patient s with occasional and stable use of small amounts"

It is acceptable for a patient already receiving psychotherapy to participate in the study . While on t he inpatient study unit during participation in the study, initiation of new augmenting psychotherapies ( i.e., group therapy) is discouraged, though standard milieu -related activities are acceptable. Partial hospitalization after discharge from the inpat ient study unit is discouraged, though the level of care after discharge from the inpatient study unit ultimately should be made based on investigator judgment. Psychiatric hospitalization during the treatment period after the patient has been discharged from the inpatient study unit could result in early withdrawal of that patient from the study (se e Section 4.2). 3.2.2.2 Permitted Therapy 3.2.2.2.1 Rescue Medication Permitted r escue medication s for this study include the following:  Benzodia zepines o Indication s: agitation, anxiety, insomnia, and/or restlessness o Maximum dosage: 6 mg/day lorazepam or equivalent for other benzodiazepines o Notes:  Short half -life benzodiazepines are preferable to longer half -life benzodiazepines due to the potentia l for lingering effects on daytime functioning and study assessments  For treatment of agitation and/or anxiety, the dose benzodiazepines should be kept as stable as possible throughout the patient ’s participation in study in order to avoid interference with daytime functioning and study assessments  Anticholinergics o Indication: extrapyramidal symptoms o Maximum dosage: 4 mg/da y benztropine or equivalent for other anticholinergics  Propranolol o Indications: akathisia or tremor o Maximum dosage: 20 mg 3 times daily (60 mg/day total) 4 Patient s 4.1 Eligibility To be eligible for participation in the study, at screening each patient must meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. 4.1.1 Eligibility Criteria for Enrollment into the Double -Blind Segment of the Study 4.1.1.1 Inclusion Criteria"

Reasons for patient withdrawal may include, but are not limited to , noncompliance, safety, development of a medical condition that requires treatment with a prohibited medication, a positiv e result on a pregnancy or urine drug screen test, or patient withdrawal of consent . In addition, if a patient ’s condition changes during the course of the study so that he or she no longer satisfies the inclusion and exclusion criteria, he or she may be withdrawn. If psychiatric hospitalization for worsening , relapse , or exacerbation of schizophrenia symptoms occurs during the treatment period at a time point after the patient has been discharged from the inpatient study unit, the medical monitor should be contacted to discuss whether early withdrawal of that patient from the study may be indicated . All efforts should be made to perform an early termination visit for any patient who withdraws or is withdrawn from the study, except for patient s who withdraw consent . If a patient is withdrawn because of an AE or other medical reason, the patient should be followed until the AE resolves or is deemed stable by the investigator or until the patient is deemed by the invest igator to be lost to follow -up. If, in the opinion of the investigator, it is clinically indicated to monitor a patient beyond the early termination visit, subsequent clinical contacts (in addition to protocol -designated study visits) may be extended on an as -needed basis . In such instan ces, the medical monitor should be contacted so that the sponsor or designee and the investigator can agree to an acceptable clinical follow -up schedule . In the event that a patient chooses to withdraw from the study, the investigator should make a reaso nable e ffort to ascertain the reason for withdrawal while fully respecting the patient ’s rights to withdraw. The investigator will determine the most appropriate post-study treatment for each withdrawn patient , which may include conferring with the patie nt’s treating psychiatrist . The investig ator must maintain a record of all patient s who withdraw from the study and the reasons for discontinuation . The reason for discontinuation will be documented . If a patient is lost to follow - up, a reasonable attemp t to contact the patient must be made and documented. 5 Study Treatment The following 3 study drug treatments will be used in the study :  Risperidone ISM 75 mg (Double -Blind and Open -label Segment)  Risperidone ISM 100 mg (Double -Blind and Open -label Segmen t)  Placebo (Double -Blind Segment only) In the double -blind segment of the study, the t reatment assignment for each patient will remain blinded for patient s, investigators, and all study site staff, with the exception of identified individuals at each study site who will be unblinded in order to prepare and administer IM study drug for each patient at that study site.

Risperidone ISM is a long-acting formulation of risperidone that uses ISM technology . Laboratorios Farmacéuticos ROVI, S.A . is the manufacturer of Risperidone ISM. The World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical class of risperidone is N05AX08 (other antipsychotics) . The active moiety of Risperidone ISM is risperidone . The following e xcipients are contained in both, Risperidone ISM and placebo : poly lactic -co-glycolic acid (PLGA ; copolymer of lactic and glycolic acids ) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) . Risperidone ISM and placebo are formulated as a suspension and dissolution for injection , respectively . The manner in which Risperidone ISM and placebo study drug s are provided to study sites requires a reconstitution procedure to be performed at the study site for each dose to be administered . Rispe ridone ISM/placebo kits will be provided to study sites , and they will be stored refrigerated at a temperature between 2ºC and 8ºC . Each kit inclu des 2 syringe s, 1 of which contains the Risperidone ISM study drug (except for placebo) plus PLGA in the form of a solid powder, and the other of which contains DMSO solvent . Each kit will also contain 2 needles: a 2-inch 2 0 gauge safety needle and a 1 -inch 2 1 gauge safety needle. Risperidone ISM study drug kits will be provided for the dose levels of 75 and 100 mg. Corresponding p lacebo stu dy drug will also be provided . Risperidone ISM and corresponding placebo kits will be labelled appropriately. 5.1.1.1 Justification of Selected Doses Results from previously conducted phase I and phase II studies as well as pha rmacokinetic modeling are considered to support the doses selected for this study (see Section 1). 5.1.1.2 Oral Test Dose s for Risperidone -Naïve Patient s Patients who have never taken risperidone must have a brief tri al of oral risperidone 2 mg/day for 3 days during the screening period in order to ensure a lack of any hypersensitivity reactions before the first dose of IM study drug is administered . A trial of oral risperidone is not required or indicated for patien ts who have previously taken any formulation of risperidone . Risperidone tablets will be provided by study sponsor to all participating sites for risperidone -naïve patient s testing."

Protocol ROV -RISP -2016 -01 PRISMA -3 VERSION 7.0 22 Mar 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 41 of 114 5.1.2 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug At each study site, during th e double -blind treatment period (and until the Data Base lock of the Double -blind segment) , each dose of study drug for each patient will be prepared individually by 1 or more identified members of the study site personnel; such designated individuals will be unblinded to the study drug identities and assignments to patient s. An unblinded individual will also administer the IM injections of study drug to each patient in a manner that maintains the blind . The designated unblinded individuals must be consid ered appropriately experienced, trained, and qualified to perform these critical functions . The study day s on which administration of double -blind study drug injections are scheduled are study day 1, study day 29 (treatment week 4) , and study day 57 (treatment week 8) . An unblinded study staff member will reconstitute the appropriate dosage of the study drug according to the instructions provided by the sponsor and will administer the study drug immediately after reconstitution . For a given patient , each of the IM injections of study drug should be administered at approximately the same time of day, if possible . Generally, at a given study visit, the IM injection of study drug should be administered after efficacy evaluations have been performed and afte r any required blood samples ( e.g., pharmacokinetic sample), if applicable at the given study visit, have been collected. For each injection, the study drug should be injected slowly, deep into the muscle . Care should be taken to avoid inadvertent injec tion into a blood vessel . Each individual dose is to be administered in a single injection; divided injections are not permitted . Generally, s erial gluteal injections should be alternated between the 2 gluteal muscles, and serial deltoid injections shou ld be alternated between the 2 deltoid muscles. However, the investigator may determine which injection site is most appropriate for a given patient . The recommended needle size for administration of study drug into the gluteal muscle for most patient s is the 2-inch 2 0 gauge needle . The injection should be administered into the upper -outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle. The recommended needle size for administration of study drug into the deltoid muscle is 1 -inch 2 1 gauge needle . Risperidone ISM doses are summarized for each double -blind treatment group by study day in Table 4."

Note: During the conduct of the study, assignments of double -blind study drug treatments to patient s will be under double - blind conditions and will not be revealed to investigators, study staff (except for specifically identified unblinded individua ls only), or patient s. 5.2 Study Site Inpatient Unit A patient who, after completion of all scheduled assessments on the screening visi t day , is considered provisionally eligible for participation in the double -blind segment of this study will be admitted directly to the inpatient study unit that day . Patient s subsequently will remain on the inpatient study unit for the remainder of the screening period ( i.e., through study day -1, inclusive) . All confirmed eligible patient s will remain inpatient on study day 1 . No patient should be discharged from the inpatient unit before study day 2, and it is anticipated that most patient s will rem ain on the inpatient unit through study day 8, and that thereafter patient s will be discharged from the inpatient unit when the investigator has assessed the patient and determines that he or she is appropriately clinically stable and otherwise ready for safe discharge . After study day 8, continuation of a patient on the inpatient unit from study day 9 through study day 15, inclusive, is an allowable option, as deemed clinically indicated . If the investigator believes that a given patient should remain in patient beyond study day 15, the investigator should contact the medical monitor to discuss the propos ed inpatient duration extension to discuss the extension. De novo patients entering the extension segment of the study are not planned to be admitted to the inpatient study unit. 5.3 Treatment Assignment and Blinding 5.3.1 Treatment Assignment Upon confirmation of eligibility for a given patient to participate in the double -blind segment of the study, a unique randomization number for that patient will be assigned via an interactive voice or web response system that is to be accessed by study site personnel immediately after confirmation of patient eligibility has been recorded . The randomization number for a given patient will be used to identify the study drug ( i.e., blinded Risperidone ISM 75 mg, Risperidone ISM 100 mg, or placebo ) that will be administered to that patient . The randomization scheme will automatically ensure that the study drug assignment for a given patient is random and that an overall 1:1:1 ratio of assignments to each of the 3 study drug treatments is approximated . In addition, the randomization scheme will include the following stratification parameters to ensure balanced distribution of assignment to the 3 treatments: country where enrol led and PANSS total score (i.e., ≥ 95 versus < 95) at baseline/randomization ."

Once a randomization number has been assigned, that number must not be used again for any other patient (e.g., when patient is withdrawn from the study , that patient ’s randomization number must not be reused for any other patient ). 5.3.1.1 Extension Segment of the Study In the extension segment of the study, all participating patient s will receive active Risperidone ISM under open -label conditions. Patient s who had been on active Risperidone ISM in the double -blind segment of the study will continue to receive act ive Risperidone ISM at the same dose ( i.e., 75 or 100 mg) in the extension segment; patient s who had been receiving placebo in the double -blind segment of the study will be randomly assigned to receive either 75 or 100 mg during the extension segment. Howe ver, in order to preserve the blinding condition of the double -blind stage of the study, if a participating patient enters this OLE phase of the study prior to lock ing the database of the double -blind stage of the study, the allocation to either 75 o r 100 mg of this patient will be still blinded at least up to locking the aforementioned database. De novo patients participating in the extension segment of the study will receive either 75 or 100 mg Risperidone ISM depending on their previous oral risperidon e dose . Patients on 4 mg of oral risperidone will be assi gned to 75 mg Risperidone ISM, and patients on more than 4 mg to a maximum of 6 mg of oral risperidone will be assigned to 100 mg Risperidone ISM . Upon confirmation of eligibility for a given de no vo patient, the corresponding IMP kit will be assigned via an interactive voice or web response system that is to be accessed by study site personnel immediately after confirmation of patient eligibility has been recorded. 5.3.2 Blinding During the double -blind segment of the study, t he IM study drug will be administered under double - blind conditions so that investigators , site staff , and patient s will not be aware about the identity of the study drug (i.e., blinded Risperidone ISM 75 mg, Risperidone ISM 100 mg, or placebo ) administered to any given patient . The packaging and labelling for placebo or Risperidone ISM 75 or 100 mg will be identical during the whole study in order to keep the blinding . The placebo and Risperidone ISM doses are practically indistinguishable before or after reconstitution. Reconstitution follows same process for placebo or Risperidone ISM. Any small differences in final volumes are not perceptible . For de novo patients, the corresponding IMP kit will be assigned via an interactive voice or web response system based on the above described criteria (see Section 5.3.1.1 ) so that both investigator and patient can know the treatment administered, consistent with the open-label definition of this segment of t he study. Nevertheless , the management of the study drug will be perfo rmed by different study personnel (see Section 5.4). Only d esignated unblinded individuals at sites will be dealing with the study drug reconstitution and a dministration of the study drug to the patient , and will not be involved in any clinical evaluation . These individual s will be appropriately qualified and trained to perform the required study drug reconstitution and study drug administration to patient s. Oral risperidone test doses, if applicable for a given patient , will be administered under open -label conditions."

Once it has been determined that breaking the blind is necessary, the investigator or other designated study site s taff member will contact the interactive voice or web response system to obtain disclosure of the identified patient ’s treatment assignment. Breaking the blind for a single patient will not affect the blind for the remaining patient s. 5.3.2.2 Extension Segment of the Study All patient s who participate in the optional extension segment of the study will receive active Risperidone ISM (i.e., 75 or 100 mg ; see Section 5.3.1.1 ) under open -label conditions . However, in order to preserve the blinding condition of the double -blind stage of the study, if a participating rollover patient enters this OLE phase of the study prior to lock ing the database of the double -blind stage of the study, the allocation to either 75 o r 100 mg of this patient will be still blinded at least up to locking the aforementioned database. For de novo patients, the corresponding IMP kit will be assigned via interactive voice or web response system based on the above described criteria (=4 mg or >4 to 6 mg oral risperidone see Section 5.3.1.1 ) so that both investigator and patient can know the treatment administered, consistent with the open-label definition of this segment of the study. 5.4 Study Drug Accountability, Adherenc e, Handling , and Disposal The clinical site is required to maintain current drug dispensation and accountability logs throughout the study for study drug. The study drug injections will be reconstituted and administered directly by appropriately qualified and trained unblinded study site personnel until the Data Base lock of the Double -blind segment . The date and time of each study drug administration will be recorded for each patient and as such will serve to document adherence . Unused supplies will be checked against study drug records periodically throughout the study. After completion and verification of accountability logs by the study monitor , all remaining study drug must be destroyed . Packages may be destroyed on site according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and site practice ; alternatively, the sponsor may arrange for destruction with a third -party vendor operating in accordance with GCP. The same procedure applies to risperidone tablets provided for risperidone -naïve patient s testing , as applicable . 6 Procedures The overall schedule s of assessments and procedures by visit are displayed in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3. A by -visit list of assessments a nd procedures is provided in Appendix A."

Each patient will receive an informed consent form that summarizes pertinent study information and will be given ample time to read it and to ask questions about the study . If a patient choose s to participate, the patient must sign the informed consent form before any study -specific procedures are conducted (see Section 10.3). Screen Failure patients (applicable for patients entering the double -blind segment and de novo patients entering the extension segment ) can be considered to be allowed for Re -Screening purposes as long as they have previously been discussed between the Principal Investigator and the Medical Monitor. More than 14 days, from the initial ICF signature, should be elapsed and all the procedures required (except the Ophthalmological examination, if this is not the reason of the re -screening), including the signature of a new ICF, should be repeated within the established screening pe riod. In these specific cases a new ID number will be assigned. 6.1.2 Demographics, Medical History, and Psychiatric History To determine eligibility during screening, the patient ’s demographic data, medical history, and psychiatric history will be reviewed an d documented . At later visits, each patient ’s medical and psychiatric history since the prior visit will be reviewed and any significant change will be recorded in the source documents and electronic case report form (eCRF) as an AE as appropriate. 6.1.3 Conc omitant Medication Review At screening, patient s will be asked about all medications they have taken in the last 30 days, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and supplements . Patient s will also be asked about any long -acting injectable antipsychotic medications taken in the last 60 days (see inclusion criterion 6 in Section 4.1.1.1 , exclusion criterion 17 in Section 4.1.1.2 , inclusion criterion 5 in Section 4.1.3.1 , and exclusion criterion 17 in Section 4.1.3.2 ) as well as any past use of risperidone (see exclusion criteria 1 and 4 in Section 4.1.1.2 , and exclusion criteria 1 and 3 in Section 4.1.3.2 ). Patient s will also be as ked about any history of failure to respond to adequate trials of antipsychotic medications, as well as about any history of clozapine use (see exclusion criterion 2 in Section 4.1.1.2 and Section 4.1.3.2 ). The investigator will record in the eCRF the use of all medications taken in a period of 30 days prior to the trial , and the use of any long -acting injectable antipsychotic medications taken in the period of 60 days prior to the trial . At each subsequent visit, enrolled patient s will be asked about use of concomitant medications since the previous visit . Any new medications or changes in previously recorded medications will be documente d. The investigator will record the following data on all medications used by the patient : medication name, dose, regimen, route of administration, start and stop dates, and the indication for use. 6.1.4 MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Schiz ophrenia and Psychotic Disorders Studies The MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorders studies, version 7.0. 2 (see Appendix C) will be completed at the screening visit to verify schizophrenia and any other psyc hiatric diagnoses according to the DSM -5 (see inclusion criterion 4 and exclusion criterion 9 in Section 4.1.1 and Section 4.1.3 )."

The PANSS, CGI -S, and CGI -I are performed at scheduled time points throughout t he treatment period as indicated in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. The investigator or qualified designee will complete these scale ratings . The PANSS total sc ore is defined as the sum of scores on the PANSS positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscales . The PANSS results will be used for the primary efficacy variable (Section 6.7.1.1 ) as well as secondar y variables (Section 6.7.1.2 ). 6.3 Health Economics and Outcomes Research Assessments 6.3.1 Healthcare Resource Utilization Health care resource utilization data will be collected in 2 ways: site -based reporting and patient-based (or informant -based ) reporting. Study site staff will retrospectively record any HRU that occurred within the clinical trial center into the applicable forms of the eCRF. Detailed resource use in following categories is collected: medication, em ergency visits, inpatient services, outpatient services (specialist consultations and other outpatient hospital care contacts) , and therapy. During the double - blind phase, clinician -reported data will be recorded once at 3 months (see Table 1). During the open - label extension, data will be recorded every 6 months for a total of 2 measurement points (see Table 2 and Table 3). Study site staff will administer a survey to patient s (or their informant ) to report any HRU that occurred outside the clinical trial center . The patient survey will be administered at the clinical trial center by designated study site staff (paper and pencil). The information will subsequently be recorded into the applicable forms of the eCRF. Detailed resource use in the following categories is collected: medication, emergency visits, inpatient services, outpatient services, therapy, community - based day services, primary and community care contacts, crimi nal justice services, and days absent from work due to illness . During the double -blind phase, patient - (or informant )-reported data will be administered every month for a total of 3 measurement points (see Table 1). During the open -label extension, the survey will be administered every month for a total of 12 measurement points (see Table 2 and Table 3). Clinician -reported and patient - (or informant )-reported HRU will be combin ed for analysis. For each item, total quantity of resources used will be calculated as the sum of resources both within and outside the participating center during the double -blind and open -label extension phases, respectively. This will define the secon dary HRU variables (Section 6.7.2 ). 6.3.2 Health -Related Quality of Life Health -related Quality of Life will be assessed by the patient -completed 20-item Subjective Well - Being Under Neuroleptics Treatment Scale (SWN -20). The SWN is a 38-item instrument developed to measure subjective effects of neuroleptic medications in patients with schizophrenia and consists of 20 positive statements and 18 negative statements .11 The short form of the SWN, the 20-item SWN - 20, was developed in order to allow for quick assessment of subjective side effects in a clinical setting .12 Like in the original SWN, with the SWN -20 the patient is asked to rate well -being items that have been identified as related to antipsychotic treatment on a 6 -point scale ranging from “Not at all” to “Very much.” The SWN -20 is scored on a scale ranging from 20 to 120, with higher scores"

The SWN -20 contains f ive 4 -item subscales: mental functioning, self - control, emotional regulation, physical functioning, and social integration. Each subscale score ranges from 4 to 24, with higher scores indicating better HRQL. The SWN -20 will be performed at scheduled time points throughout the treatment period as indicated in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. The baseline administration of the SWN -20 should occur prior to the adminis tration of the medication dose on study day 1 (double blind segment) or extension study day 1 (de novo patients in the extension segment) . 6.3.3 Social Functioning Social functioning will be assessed by the clinician -administered Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). The PSP is a 100 -point single -item rating scale that is based on 4 areas: family and social functioning, self -care, work and socially useful activities, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors .13 Higher scores indicate better social functioning. The PSP will be administered by a trained clinician, either the study investigator or a qualified designee. The PSP will be performed at scheduled time points throughout the treatment period as indicated in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. The baseline administration of the PSP should occur prior to the administration of the medication dose on study day 1 (double bl ind segment) or extension study day 1 (de novo patients in the extension segment) . 6.4 Safety Assessments Safety assessments will include AEs, vital signs (blood pressure , pulse rate , respiratory rate, and body temperature ), weight , body mass index , laboratory tests (i.e., hematology, chemistry [including prolactin] , urinalysis, urine drug screen ), ECGs, physical examinations, injection site reactions, and selected safety scales . Safety scales will include the C -SSRS and the following 3 scales to assess extrap yramidal symptoms : the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS ), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS ), and the Simpson -Angus Scale (SAS) . 6.4.1 Physical Examination, Body Height, Weight A physical examination will be performed at time points identified i n Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. The physical examination will include assessment of the following: general appearance, skin, lymphatic, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological. Body height (cm) will be measured at screening only. Body weight (kg) will be measured at time points identified in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. The body mass index value at each of these time points will be calculated ; the body mass index value must be within the range of 18.5 to 40 .0 kg/m2, inclusive , at screening . 6.4.2 Opht halmological Examination The Risperidone ISM formulation is composed of risperidone and 2 excipients: PLGA and DMSO. Although DMSO is widely used in the pharmaceutical product formulations for topical, subcutaneous, and intravenous dosage forms and during pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, there have been published reports of toxicity to the eyes in animals treated with DMSO, including crystalline lens opacity. Therefore, an ophthalmological examination of study patient s is required. All efforts sho uld be made to have both examinations performed by the same ophthalmologist in order to get consistent data."

Protocol ROV -RISP -2016 -01 PRISMA -3 VERSION 7.0 22 Mar 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 48 of 114 An ophthalmological examination will be performed at any time during the screening period of the double -blind segment of the study , and the result must be available by study day -1. This examination need s to be done again at visit 1 4 or at an early termination visit during the Double -blind period . Ophthalmological examination includes best correct ed visual acuity , visual field, intraocular press ure (IOP) measurements , and slit -lamp biomicroscopy examination of the eyelids, conjunctiva, iris, crystalline lens, sclera , and cornea. Slit-lamp examination must be performed prior to IOP measurements or instillation of the fluorescein agent. 6.4.2.1 Best Correct ed Visual Acuity Testing A standard procedure is to be used to obtain best correct ed visual acuity measurements. This activity may be performed by an optometrist, ophthalmologist, or certified ophthalmic technician. 6.4.2.2. Slit -Lamp Examinatio n (Biomicroscopy) A slit -lamp examination of the eyelids, conjunctiva, iris, crystalline lens, sclera, and cornea will be performed without pupil dilation (unless needed) . Any abnormalities will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Any abnormality fou nd during the slit -lamp examination should be noted . Presence of cataract (absent, mild, moderate, severe), aphakia, or intraocular lens (anterior chamber intraocular lens, posterior chamber intraocular lens, or iris clip) and status of the posterior lens capsule (intact, open, or absent) should be specified. Slit -lamp examination should precede IOP measurement. 6.4.2.3. Intraocular Pressure The IOP will be measured by a routinely used applanation tonometer. Study sites should calibrate the applanation t onometer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The IOP in both eyes will be measured, with the right eye preceding the left eye . If it is a routine practice at the site, a non -contact air-puff tonometry can also be used. 6.4.2.4. Visual Fields The visual field will be examined using a standard procedure at the site . The recommended visual fields examination is automated perimetry including Humphrey (24 -2 full threshold, 24 -2 SITA standard, 30 -2 central threshold, [Note: 24 -2 SITA fast not allowed] ) and Octopus (GI dynamic strategy, GI normal strategy, 24 -2 dynamic strategy, 24 -2 normal strategy) perimetry. If this procedure was performed within the past 90 days and documented in the patient ’s medical record, this procedure need not be repeated (un less the investigator suspects a change). This may be performed by a trained certified ophthalmic assistant, certified ophthalmic technician, nurse, or research coordinator. 6.4.3 Vital Signs Vital signs will include blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate , and body temperature . Vital signs will be measured at time points identified in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. At each of these time point s, vital signs will b e measured after the patient has been resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes ."

Protocol ROV -RISP -2016 -01 PRISMA -3 VERSION 7.0 22 Mar 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 49 of 114 On days when patient s receive IM injections of study drug, vital signs are to be measured within 1 hour before and then again within 3 hours after the study drug i njection; at each of these time points, orthostatic blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured (immediately after completion of supine vital sign measurements ) after the patient has risen from the supine to the standing position and has remained standi ng for approximately 3 minutes. Efforts should be made to take all blood pressure and pulse rate measurements from the same arm (preferably the patient ’s dominant arm) throughout the study . The same blood pressure cuff should be used to measure blood pr essure each time . Automated measurement is preferred, but if measurements are performed manually, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial artery for at least 30 seconds. 6.4.4 Electrocardiogram A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the study visits identifie d in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. On days when patient s receive injections of IM study drug, an ECG will be performed both within 1 hour before dosing and within 3 hours post-dose. All scheduled ECGs must be performed after the patient has rested quietly for at least 5 minutes in the supine position. Absolute v alues for QT intervals should be automatically corrected for heart rate by the ECG machine using both Bazett’s fomula (QTcB) and Fridericia’s formula (QTcF). The ECGs will be evaluated by a central reader . Additional details regarding recording and evaluation of ECGs will be described in a manual provided to the study site. 6.4.5 Laboratory Assessments Blood and urine samples for laboratory assessments will be collected at screening and at time points identified in in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Samples will be c ollected in accordance with the study site’s usual procedures and analyzed by a central laboratory . In the event of abnormal laboratory test values, follow -up samples may be obtained for repeat testing if deemed clinically indicated by the investigator . Each out -of-range laboratory value will be assessed by the investigator as either clinically significant or not clinically significant . Clinically significant values should be considered AEs and recorded as such. Additional details regarding laborator y sample collection and processing will be described in a manual provided to the study site. 6.4.5.1 Hematology The hematology panel includes the following tests:  Hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, white blood cell count and differential count (abso lute values for basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils), and platelets"

Results must be negative for initial study eligibility. Urine pregnancy test (dipstick) will be performed on site for all women at baseline and subsequently at time points identified in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Results at bas eline must be negative for initial study eligibility. Results must be negative for continued participation. On each IM study drug dosing day, the urine pregnancy test must be performed and a negative result confirmed before the scheduled dose of study drug for that day is administered. A serum pregnancy test is not required during the open -label extension stage but may be performed . The investigator may order a serum pregnancy te st at any time according to her or his judgment. 6.4.5.4.3 Drug Screening A urine drug screen for prohibited substances will be performed at time points identified in Table 1 and Table 3 (mandatory at screening and baseline) and on as -needed basis as indicated in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. The urine drug screen will include identification of the presence or absence of amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, methadone, opioid s, and phencyclidine, as well as for THC , alcohol, and benzodiazepines. Urine drug screen will be performed at each scheduled timepoint and the collected sample will be sent to the central laboratory for analysis. In addition, onsite dipstick urine drug screen testing may be optionally performed on the sample collected."

If a patient has a positive result for benzodiazepines , the investigator should determine if benzodiazepine use was medically indicated ; a positive benzodiazepine result may not be exclusionary if the investigator determines t hat the benzodiazepine use is clinically appropriate and is not indicative of abuse (see Section 4.1.1.2 and Section 4.1.3.2 ). A positive result for THC and/or alcohol generally is to be considere d exclusionary; however, such a finding may not necessarily be exclusionary in certain cases only if exclusion criterion 9 is not met and only if the medical monitor provides approval . 6.4.6 Injection Site Reactions Approximately 1 hour after an injection , the investigator will inspect the injection site where the study drug has been administered for redness, swelling, and induration. The investigator will also observe all injection sites where IM study drug has been injected on previous visits. At the same t ime (approximately 1 hour after injection) , the study patient will perform and record self -assessment of pain at the injection site using a visual analog ccale (VAS ; see Appendix D). If clinically significant, the injection site reaction will be recorded as an AE and the nature, duration, intensity , and relationship to the study drug will be recorded. Any injection site reaction that occurs outside the schedule established in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 will be recorded as AE. 6.4.7 Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scales Extrapyramidal symptoms rating scales will include the AIMS, BARS, and SAS. The investigator or designee will complete the set of abnormal movement rat ing scales at time points identified in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Clinically significant changes from baseline in extrapyramidal symptoms are to be recorded as AEs. 6.4.8 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale The investigator or designee will complete the C -SSRS at time points identified in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. At screening, the baseline version will be administered . At subsequent visits, the since -last-visit version will be administered. The C-SSRS results for each patient should be reviewed by the investigator at each applicable visit . If at any time the C-SSRS results for a given patient reveal potential suicidality, the investigator should assess the clinical significance of such results . If a clinically significant risk of suicidality is identified for a patient , the investigator should consider fu rther clinical evaluation of that patient and implementation of appropriate clinical measures as deemed indicated to help ensure patient safety . Clinically significant changes from baseline in the level of suicidality are to be recorded as AEs. 6.4.9 Adverse Eve nts An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study (from the informed consent form signature) or, if present at screening, worsens during the study,"

All medica l and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) that are present at screening will be documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF . Changes in these conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases ar e to be noted on the source documents and the AE page of the eCRF during the rest of the study . Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities are also to be recorded as AEs. Collection of AE data will begin after a patient signs the informed consent f orm and will continue until completion of the final follow -up visit . Any AE having an onset after the final safety follow -up visit will not be collected or reported unless the investigator feels that the event may be related to the IM study drug. Advers e events may be volunteered spontaneously by the patient, discovered as a result of general questioning by the study staff, or determined by physical examination . At each study visit, the patient will be asked the open -ended question, “Have you experience d any health problems since your last visit?” All AEs will be recorded on the source documents and the eCRF . For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information that is adequate both to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether i t meets the c riteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification . If the AE persists, follow -up even after the date of therapy discontinuation is required until the event resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator. Patient s will be instructed to contact the investigator at any time after randomization if any symptoms develop. In order to avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, all AEs should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than in the patient’s own words . Each AE will also be described in terms of duration, frequency, intensity, association with the study drug, assessment of possible causes, actions taken, and outcome, using choices given on the eCRF . Specific guidelines for classifyi ng AEs by intensity and by relationship to study drug are given below : Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity The severity (o r intensity) of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the patient ’s daily activities and will be classified as mil d, moderate, or severe using the following criteria:  Mild : An event that is easily tolerated by the patient, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities  Moderate : An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with nor mal everyday activities  Severe : An event that prevents normal everyday activities When changes in the intensity of an AE occur within a day, the maximum intensity for that day should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). Classification of Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Drug The investigator ’s assessment of an AE ’s relationship to study drug is part of the documentation process but is not a fact or in determining what is or is not reported in the study. The investigator will assess causality ( i.e., whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characterized using the following classification:"

Protocol ROV -RISP -2016 -01 PRISMA -3 VERSION 7.0 22 Mar 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 53 of 114  Suspected : The temporal relationship of the AE with the investigational medicinal product makes causality possible, and the AE cannot be due to another cause such as other drugs, a surgical intervention, or an underlying disease  Not suspected : The temporal relationship of the AE with the investigational medicinal product makes causality improbable, and the AE may be due to another cause such as other drugs, surgical intervention, or underlying disease 6.4.9.1 Serious Adverse Events An SAE is defined as any AE that meets 1 or more of the following criteria:  The event i s fatal or life threatening  The event i s permanently disabling (incapacitating or interfering with the ability to resume usual life patterns)  The event r esults in unplanned i npatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  The event i s a congenital anomaly  The event r equires medical intervention of any kind in order to prevent any of the aforementioned outcomes Important medical events that may not result i n death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency o r drug abuse. An AE is considered “life threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caus ed death. An SAE is not necessarily severe; for example, an overnight hospitalization for a diagnostic procedure must be reported as an SAE even though the occurrence is not medically serious . By the same token, a severe AE is not necessarily serious: nau sea of several hours’ duration may be rated as severe but may not be considered serious. Protocol -allowed psychiatric inpatient stays ( e.g., during the screening period and for up to 2 weeks during the first part [administration ] of the treatment period or longer if needed ) will not be reported as AEs. Subsequent hospitalizations will be recorded and tracked as SAE s. 6.4.9.2 Reporting Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for recording all AEs that are observed or reported during the study, regardles s of their relationship to study drug or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be recorded. All AEs, regardless of causality and severity, occurring during the conduct of the cli nical trial whether observed by the investigator or spontaneously reported by the patient or in response to an open -ended question about any medical problems since the last visit, must be recorded in the source document and in the relevant section of the e CRF.

The investigator must send a preliminary report of the SAE to the ROVI Pharmacovigilance Department by fax/email within 24 hours (see Appendix F), using an SAE Report Form. ROVI Pharmacovigilan ce Department Phone: +34 917617561/+34 911863678 Fax: +34 912444421 Email: farmacovigilancia@rovi.es The event must also be recorded on the standard AE eCRF page. Preliminary reports of SAEs must be followed by detailed descriptions, including legible pho tocopies of hospital case reports, consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and applicable. The SAE reports must be made whether or not the investigator considers the event to be related to the study drug. Appropriate remedi al measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the response should be recorded. Patient s must be closely followed until sufficient information is obtained to indicate a return to normal status or until the event stabilizes at a level acceptable to the i nvestigator. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed as needed in order to determine the etiology of the event. For this purpose, additional blood samples (as needed) will be collected and analyzed whenever a n SAE is identified u ntil the event stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator. The results must be reported promptly to the sponsor. During the double -blind part of the study and until Data Base lock (of the double -blind part) , this process must be conducted in a m anner that maintains blinding of study drug assignment. As information is available, a pregnancy diagnosed during a patient ’s active participation in the study (and any voluntarily provided notice of a pregnancy that is received within 6 months after a patient ’s last dose of study drug) as patient s staff that is will be reported immediately to the sponsor or designee, including pregnancy in female partners of male patient s. The pregnancy may be followed to term and/or outcome , and this outcome may be rep orted to the sponsor. Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE or SAE unless the birth results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or there is suspicion that the study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medica tion or method. 6.4.9.3 Other Significant Adverse Events To ensure patient safety, the investigator should also notify the safety coordinator or medical monitor should any AE occur that is considered significant but does not meet the criteria for an SAE or that is considered unexpected . An unexpected AE is an AE that is not identified in nature, intensity, or frequency in the reference safety information of the investigator brochure . In addition, any field monitor who notes a significant AE or medical condition while reviewing eCRFs or source documents at the study site must immediately convey this information to the medical monitor. An increase in prolactin plasma levels should be considered an AE when any of the following criteria are present:  Values above 1000 mI U/L for 3 consecutive determinations after randomization, although no clinical symptoms are present"

Protocol ROV -RISP -2016 -01 PRISMA -3 VERSION 7.0 22 Mar 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 55 of 114  Values above 530 mI U/L if clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinemia are present ( e.g., headache, decreased libido, oligo -amenorr hea) However , where patients have prolactin concentrations above the upper limit of normal at screening, the following criteria could be used by the investigator as a guideline:  For patient s at screening with prolactin blood levels above the normal limit, an increase of prolact in from baseline ( day 1, pre-dose) values is recommended to be considered as an AE when the patient presents 3 consecutive determinations with a prolactin value above 1000 mI U/L, if the increase is > 20% even though no other clinical symptoms are associate d  For patient s at screening with prolactin blood levels above 1000 mI U/L, it is recommended to consider it as an AE when there is an increase > 20% of the baseline ( day 1, pre-dose) level in 3 consecutive determinations even though no other clinical sympto ms are associated As a general rule, it should be considered that the “hyperprolactinemia ” event has finished the day when a prolactin value lower to 1000 mIU/L is obtained, or when levels return to the basal value for patient s with prolactin concentration s above the upper normal limit at screening .  The day and time of the determination should be recorded in the eCRF . It has to be noted that same date could be registered as the end of hyperprolactinemia for 1 event ( AE #1) and the start of another hyperp rolactinemia for another event ( AE #2). As an example: if the day when 4 prolactin determinations are made matches that in the first determination the hyperprolactinemia has finished ( AE #1) but after the injection of Risperidone ISM, a new event of hyper prolactinemia ( AE #2) is considered as started (as per protocol), and that date should be registered as the date of the end of AE #1 and start date of AE #2. The times of finalization and starting of both events should be recorded . To this end, the date of the third abnormal determination will be conside red as the start date of the AE. Those patient s with values out of range that are considered an AE will be monitored either until the values do not fulfill the aforementioned AE criteria or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator. 6.5 Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection During the double -blind segment of the study, p harmacokinetic samples will be collected from all patient s participating in the study in a manner that maintains the double -blind wi th respect to patient treatment assignment. All patient s will have pharmacokinetic samples collected on days 1, 3, 29, 31, 57, 59, and 85 (visits 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 14, respectively). Additionally , 75 patient s irrespective of randomized treatment wi ll be selected to have additional sampling on days 8, 15 , and 22 (visits 5, 6, and 7, respectively ). In addition, pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at the time of an SAE . In order t o maintain study drug blind ing, at the selected study sites , pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from all enrolled patient s (regardless of treatment assignment) ; however , only samples from patient s receiving active Risperidone ISM will be analyzed . A blood sample (approximately 4 mL each) for measurement of con centration in plasma of risperidone and its active metabolite (9 -OH-risperidone ) will be obtained at time points shown in Table 1."

Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be processed at the study site ( e.g., centrifugation, separation of plasma, and freezing) according to instruct ions that will be provided to the study site in a manual. Contact information and sample handling and shipment instructions will be described in the manual. Pharmacokinetic samples from patient s receiving active Risperidone ISM will be analyzed by a central laboratory; however, the sa mples from patient s receiving placebo will not be analyzed (they are collected nevertheless in order to maintain the double -blind). The process for this selective pharmacokinetic analysis will be perfo rmed in a manner than maintains the double -blind with respect to patient treatment assignment. 6.6 Genotype Sampl e Collection Genotype samples will be collected from all patient s who will sign the appropriate consent in the double -blind segment of the study . A separate informed consent form for participation g enotype sample collection must be signed before any blood sample s for genotype assessment sample are collected for a given patient . A single blood sample will be collected from each patient for evaluation of genotypes for cytochrome P450 enzymes and/or genes considered potentially related to response . The blood sample for genotype testing may be collected at any time point after randomization during the Double -blind period . 6.7 Outcome Variables 6.7.1 Efficacy Variables Efficacy variables are listed within this section .

The sample may be obtained at any point after randomization occurs during the Double -blind period . The samples will be tested for all patient s for correlation with pharma cokinetic and/or efficacy results. 7 Statistics 7.1 General Considerations The statistical analysis methods are described below and refer to the main (double -blind) part of the study . Additional details will be provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan document , which will be finalized before database lock and unblinding of the study. Analysis for the extension segment of the study will be descriptive only. In general, summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum , and maximum values for continuous variables, and number and percentage of patient s in each defined cat egory for categorical variables) will be provided by treatment group for all variables . Source data for the summary tables and statistical analyses will be presented as patient data listings. Baseline in the main (double -blind) part of the study will be defined as last non -missing observation before first dose of study drug .

The per -protocol (PP) population will consist of patient s from the ITT population who receive ≥ 2 injections of study drug (active or placebo) during the treatment period and have no major protocol deviations that may impact the primary efficacy variable. Patient s will be analyzed according to assigned treatment. The PP population will be used fo r supporting analyses of efficacy endpoints . The modified per -protocol (mPP) population will consist of all patients in the PP population for whom blinding was not potentially compromised. Analyses performed on the mPP population will be as treated. This population will be used for selected efficacy analyses. The pharmacokinetic population will include patient s in the safety population who have at least 1 measured plasma concentration value . In case s where a protocol deviation is identified to potentially affect plasma concentration data, the identified concentration value s will be flagged and excluded from summarization as indicated, a nd in some cases may be excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis overall; excluded concentration value s will be identifi ed before database lock based on a protocol deviations log and confirmed with sponsor . An intense pharmacokinetic subset of patients with additional samples measured after dose 1 will be used to evaluate non - compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters during dosing interval after dose 1. Explanations for pharmacokinetic parameters that could not be estimated will be provided in the clinical study report as applicable . Genotyping data will be listed and summarized for all patient s in safety population if avai lable. A blinded data review meeting will be held before database lock and unblinding of the double -blind phase to clarify any open questions or doub ts and agree upon the PP and pharmacokinetic populations . Attendees will include appropriate individuals f rom the sponsor and Contract Research Organization ( CRO ). All decisions will be documented . Details regarding the data to be reviewed at the meeting will be documented in the S tatistical Analysis Plan, and a separate blinded data review meeting plan. Prior consideration will be given to ensure that no data will be reviewed which has potential to present blinding issues (e .g., pharmacokinetic concentration data). Reasons for excluding patient s from the PP or pharmacokinetic population will be determined a nd documented before database lock.

Patient s who fail to complete the main (double -blind) part of the study will be summarized and categorized by reason for termination . Similarly, the description of the patients ’ dispositions in the extension segment of the study (including whether the patient was a rollover or de novo patient) will be performed. In addition, the number s of patient s randomly assigned to each study drug treatment and the number of patient s include d in each analysis population ( e.g., safety , modified safety , ITT, mITT , PP, mPP , open label, and pharmacokinetic ) will be summarized by treatment group, along with reasons for exclusion as applicable. 7.3.2 Demographics and Baseline Data Demographics and base line characteristics will be summarized by treatment group for safety, ITT, mITT, PP, mPP, open -label, and pharmacokinetic populations using descriptive statistics as described in Section 7.1. Cytochrome P450 2D6 inferred metabolic status will be summarized and details of the genotype will be listed and summarized by treatment group for safety modified safety , ITT, mITT , PP, mPP , open - label , and pharmacokinetic populations using descriptive statistics . Predict ed phenotypes will be determined following the activity score system published by Gaedigk et al (2008 ).14 Patient s with an activity score > 2 will be considered as ultra -rapid metabolizers, a value of 1.5 to 2 as extensive metabolizers, 0.5 to 1 a s intermediate metabolizers , and a value of 0 as poor metabolizers . Medical and psychiatric history will be summarized by treatment group for the safety and open -label population s. 7.3.3 Study Drug Administration Study drug administration data will be summarized for all randomized patient s by treatment group. Study drug administration data from the extension segment of the study will be similarly summarized for the open -label population . 7.3.4 Efficacy Results for efficacy variab les will be summarized by treatment group for the mITT, ITT and PP populations using descriptive statistics (see Section 7.1) for data obtained during the main (double - blind) part of the study . The analyses of p rimary and key secondary endpoints will also be provided for the mPP population. Although any confirmatory findings related to efficacy must be substantiated in both the mITT and ITT populations, the mITT will be used as the primary population to describe efficacy results in the CSR. For the primary and key secondary variables, results will also be summarized se parately for stage 1 and stage 2 of the study (see Section 7.5). Efficacy variable s (PANSS, CGI -S, CGI -I) from the ext ension segment of the study will be summarized similarly for the open -label population , as applicable, for descriptive purposes. To account for patient s for whom the post-baseline endpoint (i.e., at the time when the last post - baseline double -blind assessm ent was performed) occurs at a time point before study day 85, a mixed effect model with repeated measurements (MMRM) using an unstructured covariance matrix approach will be used as the primary method . It is assumed that the majority of the missing value s will be one of the following:  “Missing Completely at Random” (i.e., probability of an observation being missing does not depend on observed or unobserved measurements ) or"

Protocol ROV -RISP -2016 -01 PRISMA -3 VERSION 7.0 22 Mar 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 of 114  “Missing at Random” (i.e., probability of an observation being missing depends onl y on observed measurements ) In such situations, likelihood -base methods like MMRM are appropriate17 and are already usual .16 If a patient has a PANSS assessment reco rded, but any of the 30 items are missing, the last non - missing score for the respective item from previous assessments will be carried forward.22 If the total or subscale score has > 30% of the items missing a t a particular visit, the respective total or subscale score at the visit will not be calculated and will be treated as missing data in the analysis. 7.3.4.1 Primary Efficacy Variable Analyses The primary efficacy analysis is designed to show superiority of acti ve treatment versus placebo in the primary efficacy variable (Section 6.7.1.1 ). Two hypotheses will be tested : a. H0,A: µRisperidone ISM 75 mg - µplacebo = 0 vs H 1,A: µRisperidone ISM 75 mg - µplacebo ≠ 0 b. H0,B: µRisperidone ISM 100 mg - µplacebo = 0 vs H 0,B: µRisperidone ISM 100 mg - µplacebo ≠ 0 with µ = PANSS total score mean change from baseline to endpoint for identified treatment group . An MMRM approach will be fitted for patients in the mITT population with country where enrolled, visit, treatment, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline PANSS total score as a covariate . This model will be applied separately for patient s in stage 1 and stage 2 of the study . The treatment differences from the model at study d ay 85 will be evaluated to test the hypotheses above , maintaining a 2-sided type 1 error rate of 5% . Model results from each stage will be presented. In order to m aintain the type 1 error rate for the primary anal ysis, each hypothesis will be tested using a weighted test statistic in accordance with Cui, Hung, Wang18 (CHW) methodology which comprises of combining the z-statistics from the respective study d ay 85 treatmen t comparison at each stage. The weighting will be equal for each stage and pre -defined as sqrt (0.5). The nominal 2-sided p -value for each hyp othesis will be calculated for the respective weighted CHW statistic using the cumulative normal distribution. To account for multiplicity of testing and to keep the type 1 error rate at 5%, the Hommel ’s closed - testing correction procedure19 as implemented in SAS software (PROC MULTTEST) will be used to provide adjusted p -values to assess for superiority of either dose . The primary efficacy analysis will be supported with sensitivity analyses. All sensitivity analyses will use the CHW and Hommel adjustment to present p -values. The MMRM (as above) and analys is of covarian ce (ANCOVA) model s using both observed endpoint values and multipl y imput ed20 study day 85 values will be perfo rmed for the mITT population. The ANCOVA models will include country where enrolled and treatment a s fixed effects and baseline PANSS total score as a covariate. All analyses described above will be repeated for the ITT population. However, to account for extra 43 patients included in Stage 1, the CHW statistic will be derived using weights of sqrt(0. 55) and sqrt(0.45) for stage 1 and 2 respectively. Confirmatory findings from the Hommel adjusted CHW analyses will only remain so for a particular dose if p<0.05 in both the mITT and ITT analyses."

The descriptive statistics summary will be presented for each country and by the baseline PANSS total score (< 95 v ≥ 95) for both the mITT and ITT population. In addition, the MMRM (without CHW or Hommel adjustments) will be repeated in the mITT and ITT population incorporating a treatment by country or baseline PANSS total score (< 95 v ≥ 95) interaction as a fixed effect in order to explore the treatment differences within each country and baseline PANSS total score (< 95 v ≥ 95). The unadjusted LS means and standard errors of the change fro m baseline over time from the MMRM including all patients will be presented graphically both overall (from the primary analysis) and by the baseline PANSS total score (< 95 v ≥ 95) (from the interaction models). The e ffect of CYP2D6 phenotype on the primar y efficacy variable will be assessed using subgroup analyses . Summaries will be repeated by CYP2D6 phenotype groupings ( using combined data across stages). The MMRM applied to all data combined will be repeated with additional fixed effects for CYP2D6 ph enotype and treatment -by-CYP2D6 phenotype interaction. 7.3.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables Analyses 7.3.4.2.1 Key Secondary Efficacy Variable Analyses The k ey secondary variable will be analyzed at endpoint for the mITT and ITT population in a hierarchical order , taking mu ltiplicity into account. If, and only if, the primary efficacy analysis shows the superiority of the Risperidone ISM treatment versus the IM placebo treatment for both doses will the confirmatory testing be performed sequentially on the mITT and ITT popul ation with regard to the key secondary efficacy variable (Section 6.7.1.2.1 ). Otherwise, all analyses for the key secondary efficacy variable will be deemed supportive/exploratory evidence. The CGI -S mean cha nge will be analyzed using identical methods as described for the primary , sensitivity and subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy variable (Section 7.3.4.1) . The only exception to this will be that the baseline CGI -S will be used as a covariate in the MMRM/ ANCOVA model s instead of the baseline PANSS score. 7.3.4.2.2 Other Secondary Efficacy Variables Analyses The other secondary efficacy variables (see S ection 6.7.1.2.2 ) will be displayed as described in Section 7.1, in each treatment group and at each applicable visit on the mITT, ITT and PP populations. The analysis will be performed using only observed cases with both stages of the study combined . The mean scores and the ir changes from baseline will be displayed for PANSS, PANSS subscales, CGI-S and CGI -I at each applicable post-baseline visit and endpoint. Treatments will be compared at each time point using a MMRM with country where enrolled, visit, treatment, and trea tment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects and the respective baseline (PANSS will be used for CGI -I model) as a covariate. Each dose level of Risperidone ISM will be compared to placebo at each study day . Unadjusted p -values and 95% confidence interval s will be presented. For PANSS and CGI -S, the models applied as part of the primary and key secondary variable sensitivity analyses (on all data patient data combined) will be used for these comparisons."

Concentration values for all patient s in the pharmacokinetic population will be listed. Pharmacokinetic parameters , including C trough, and accumulation index will be derived if possible, an d results will be summarized as applicable . Plasma concentrations will be presented graphically. A set of non -compartmental parameters will be estimated for a subset of patients after dose 1 (e.g., maximum concentration [ Cmax], time to C max [Tmax], area under the concentration -time curve for a dosing interval [AUC tau], and others ). Association of SAEs with the measured pharmacokinetic concentration either planned or outside the regular schedule will be evaluated. Comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters between the gluteal and deltoid muscle injections will be performe d. Effect s of the CYP2D6 phenotype on pharmacokinetic parameters in the complete pharmacokinetic population and in a subset with intense pharmacokinetic sampling will be evaluated. A popu lation pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed according to a separate pharmacokinetic analysis plan document . 7.4 Sample Size The overall ratio for the random allocation of the 3 treatment s to patient s will be 1:1:1 (Risperidone ISM 75 mg : Risperidone ISM 100 mg : placebo ) during the Double -blind period . The primary e fficacy analysis will include all patient s for whom the blinding was not compromised, who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have both a baseline and at least 1 post -baseline PANSS evaluation ( mITT population). The difference bet ween the active treatments and placebo in the PANSS total score mean change from baseline to endpoint (primary efficacy variable ; see Section 6.7.1.1 ) will be assum ed as a 9 -point decrease . Taking into account that each of the 2 Risperidone ISM groups ( i.e., Risperidone ISM 75 mg and Risperidone ISM 100 mg ) will be tested separately against the placebo group , a Bonferroni adjustment for the  level was performed. A common standard deviation of 20 in 2-group t -tests was assumed. A sample size of 124 patient s in the mITT population in each treatment group will have 90% power to detect a difference in means of 9 (standard deviation = 20 , effect size = 0.45 ) with a 2. 5% 2-sided significance level for a Risperidone ISM group versus the placebo group. The power to show superiority of both Risperidone ISM doses to placebo using the above calculatio n would be at least"

This will be higher due to a high correlation in pharmacokinetic data between doses ( see Section 1) and use of a less conservative multiplicity adjustment than Bonferroni ( i.e., Hommel – see Section 7.3.4.1 ). A relatively low post -randomization dropout rate is anticipated because it is surmised that m ost patient s in the inpatient setting will reach study d ay 4 (patient s who drop out before study d ay 4 will not be included in the mITT population); therefore, a 5% dropout rate is considered reasonable . Assuming this 5% dropout rate, a randomized sample size of 131 patient s per treatment group , or 393 patient s total (all 3 treatment groups combined) for whom the blinding was not compromised , will be required. This assumption will be re -assessed at the interim analysis and used in re -estimating the total n umber of randomized patient s required (see Section 7.5). Taking into account the 43 patients for whom blinding was potentially compromised, 436 randomized patients in total will be required. Assuming a screening failure rate of 35%, approximately 671 patie nts will need to be screened in order to achieve the initially planned 436 patient s randomized. 7.5 Sample Size Re -estimation/Interim Analysis One unblinded interim analysis will be conducted when 196 (approximately 50%) randomized patient s, for whom the blin ding was not compromi sed, have either reached study day 85 o r withdrawn from the study; to re-estimate the sample size required for the final analysis up to 558 patient s (186 patient s per arm ) in the mITT population . The unblind ed interim statistical analy sis will be conducted by an independent statistical center. Those patient s included in the interim analysis (as well as those for whom the blinding was compromised) will constitute stage 1 patient s with all subsequent patient s being stage 2 patient s for purpose of the primary and key secondary variable analyse s. There will be no overlap of patient s between stages. Only those patients meeting the criteria for inclusion in the mITT population will be included in the interim analysis for purpose of sample siz e re-estimation. For stage 1 patient s meeting the criteria for inclusion in the mITT population , the effect size (mean difference/pooled standard deviation) will be calculated for each dose compared to placebo separately for the primary efficacy variable ( change from baseline to end point in total PANS S score). The mean difference will be repesented by the difference between LS means from the primary MMRM model at Day 85 (see Section 7.3.4.1) and the pooled standard deviation will be derived from the standar d error of the difference between LS means divided by sqrt(1/n r + 1/n p) where n r and n p are the sample size included in the interim analysis for the risperidone and placebo group respectively . If one or both of the effect sizes are less than the expected e ffect size of 0.4 5, the lowest effect size will be used to derive the new sample size per group for the mITT population (M 2) as suggested by Cui et al. (1999)18 as follows: M2 = 124 * (0.45/ lowest effect size ) up to a maximum of 186 patient s per group in the mITT population . If the lowest effect size is greater than or equal to 0.45, the target sample size for the mITT population will be maintained at 124 patient s per arm."

It will be used to assess for excluded psychiatric conditions outlined in the study entry criteria. PANSS The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), is a 30 -item clinician -rated instrument for assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia and will be used as the primary efficacy endpoint measure. The positive scale consists of 7 items which measure delusions, conceptual disorganizatio n, hallucinations, grandiosity , and suspiciousness/persecution. The negative subscale consists of items which measure blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontan eity and flow of conversation, and stereotyped thinking. The general psychopathology scale consists of 16 items which measure somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms and posturing, depression, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, un usual thought content, disorientation, poor attention, lack of judgment and insight, disturbance of volition, poor impulse control, preoccupation and active social avoidance. The change from baseline in the PANSS total score at 12 weeks is the primary effi cacy endpoint. CGI -S The Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI -S) is a 7 -point clinician -rated scale for assessing the global severity of the illness. The change in CGI -S score from baseline to 12 weeks will be used as a secondary efficacy en dpoint. Also the change in PANSS positive subscale response change from baseline to 12 weeks will be included as a secondary endpoint. The PANSS positive subscale assesses features such as delusions and hallucinations. CGI -I The CGI -I consists of a single 7-point rating score total improvement, regardless of whether or not the change it is due entirely to drug treatment. Raters select one response based on the following question, “Compared to your patient’s condition at the beginning of treatment, how much has your patient changed?” Scores are: 1, Very much improved; 2, Much improved; 3, Minimally improved; 4, No change; 5, Minimally worse; 6, Much worse; or 7, Very much worse. For the CGI -I Scale, the patient ’s condition at the Day 1 (baseline) visit will be the criterion for judging improvement at subsequent visits. AIMS The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) will be used to document occurrences of dyskinesias in patient s, specifically tardive dyskinesia. The scale incorporates observation and brie f examination of the patient and consists of 12 items. Items 1 -4 assess the severity of orofacial movements. Items 5 -7 assess extremity and truncal dyskinesias. Items 8 -10 rate global severity of"

Items 11 12 concern the patient ’s dental status BARS The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) will be administered to assess akathisia. The scale is designed to rate akathisia through observation of restless behavior and questioning of the patient to determine the degree of subjective restlessness and di stress associated with restlessness. A global clinical rating completes the assessment. The first 3 items of the BARS (Objective, Subjective, and Distress related to restlessness) are rated on a 4 point scale (0 -3). The fourth item, the global clinical assessment of akathisia, uses a 6 point scale (0 -5). Only the global clinical assessment measure from this scale will be analyzed. Higher scores indicate increased severity. All ratings are anchored. The BARS takes approximately 10 minutes to administer SAS The Simpson Angus Scale (SARS) will be administered to assess parkinsonian symptoms and related extrapyramidal side effects through observation of the patient . The scale contains 10 items, including gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wri st rigidity, leg pendulousness, glabellar tap, tremor, and salivation. The head rotation item (from the modified SAS) will be substituted for the original #7 item, head dropping. Seven of the 10 items measure parkinsonian rigidity. Each item is rated on a n anchored 5 -point scale, with 0 = the absence of the condition or normal and 4 = the most extreme form of the condition. A total score is obtained by adding all of the scores of the individual items. The SAS takes approximately 10 minutes to administer. C-SSRS The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) is an interview -based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Versions are available for screening /baseline and follow -up visits. PSP This operationalized, 10 0-point scale consists of 4 main areas: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self -care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. Each of the 4 domains is rated in 6 degrees of severity (absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe, very severe). A difference of 8 points can be classified as a clinically highly relevant difference. SWN -20 The Subjective Well -being Under Neuroleptic Treatment Scale (SWN) is used to assess well -being in patients with schizophrenia undergoing antipsychotic treatment. The 20 -item version of the SWN scale consists of 20 i tems referring to the last 7 days. The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor) to a maximum of 120 (excellent). 10 items are formulated p ositively and 10 items are formulated negativel y, describing each complaint in a positive and negati ve phrase . The SWN -20 measures subjective experience in 5 subscales: emotional regulation, self -control, mental functioning, social integration and physical functioning ."
