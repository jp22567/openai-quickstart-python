PTSD is highly comorbid with personality disorders (PD), especially borderline personality disorder (BPD), and cluster C - avoidant, dependent, or obsessive -compulsive - personality disorders (CPD). I t is not clear yet what treatment is most effective for those who suffer from both PTSD and PD. There is growing motivation in clinicians to offer PTSD treatments to PTSD with comorbid PD, because these treatments are highly effective, relatively short (we ekly sessions, 3 -6 months) and there is some evidence that with PTSD treatment, comorbid PD symptoms might resolve as well. PTSD treatments are less time -consuming than PD treatments and - at least in the short term - financially attractive. However, at le ast 30 -44% PTSD patients do not sufficiently respond to these treatments. Moreover, a high number of PTSD patients are excluded from these therapies because of suicidality, self -destructive behaviour or other personality problems. Therefore, it might be mo re efficient to add a PD treatment at the same time. Evidence - based treatments for personality disorders (PD), such as dialectical behaviour treatment (DBT) for BPD, and schemafocused treatment (SFT) for CPD are well established. These treatments are more intensive (twice a week for at least one year) than PTSD treatments. There is some evidence that integrated PTSDPD treatment is twice as effective on reducing PTSD symptoms than PD treatment alone, but integrated PTSD -PD treatment is not yet directly compa red to PTSD treatment alone. This study will address this knowledge gap, including secondary outcome measures on functioning, quality of life and cost -effectiveness. The result of this study might be that one or the other treatment works better, depending on the personal profile of the patient. So far, some psychological factors have been found"
9,page_9,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 10 of 59 to be associated with worse outcome of PTSD treatment. These are cognitive (educational level, working memory emotion regulation), affective (anger, sleep problems, dissociation), and relational factors (therapeutic alliance, attachment, social support). In addition, neurobiological factors are found to be associated with PTSD treatment outcome, such as increased activity connectivity of the limbic network and decrea sed activity and connectivity of the cognitive control networks, and disturbed hormonal levels and epigenetic factors (5 -HTTLPR, BDNF, cortisol/FKBP5 -methylation, oxytocin/OXTR). Because these candidate predictors are found on a group level (in non - respond ers vs. responders), they cannot directly be used on an individual level. By using machine -learning techniques we might use these candidate predictors on an individual level to guide treatment choices and thereby personalise psychiatry. We hypothesize th at in patients with PTSD with BPD, integrated DBT -EMDR treatment results in a higher effect size and higher response rate than EMDR -only (A1); in patients with PTSD and CPD, integrated SFT - ImRs treatment results in a higher effect size and higher response rate than ImRs only (A2). Furthermore, we hypothesize that non - response to PTSD -treatment can be individually predicted by a machine -learning model with (B1) psychological factors (cognitive, affective, and relational) and (B2) neurobiological factors (ne ural factors, and hormonal/ epigenetic factors. Objective: In the current project, we will firstly study effectiveness of PTSD -treatment compared to integrated PTSD -PD-treatment in treatment -seeking, adult patients with comorbid PTSD and PD in a wide ra nge of severity (minimally 4 criteria of a personality disorder). Secondly, we will investigate psychological (cognitive, affective, and relational) and neurobiological candidate predictors of treatment outcome, and use them in a machine -learning paradigm to come to a clinically useful and individual prediction instrument of treatment outcome. Study design: Two related randomized controlled trials (A1, A2) with prediction analyses (B1, B2). Study population: With the assumptions of a small effect size (< 0.5) of PTSD treatment in patients with comorbid PTSD and PD and a double effect size of integrated PTSD -PD-"

Expecting a dropout rate of 25%, we will include 63 persons per arm, for 4 arms a total of 252 adult patients with PTSD and - at least 4 - PD symptoms. Of these patients, 80 next to 40 healthy matched controls will be asked for additional MRI research before and after treatment. In total, 292 persons will be included in this study. Intervention : In patients with PTSD and BPD: EMDR (3 -6 months plus 6 -9 months treatment pause) compared to integrated DBT -EMDR (12 months); in patients with PTSD and CPD: ImRs (3 -6 months plus 6 -9 m onths treatment pause) compared to integrated ImRs -SFT (12 months). Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome measure is PTSD symptom severity after 12 months. Secondary outcome measures are PD symptoms (SCID -5-PD), disability (WHODAS), quality o f life (EQ -5D-5L) and health costs (Tic -P). At baseline (T0) and after 12 months (T4) clinical interviews (CAPS -5, SCID -5-PD dimensional score) and self -rating scales (PCL -5) will be used. After 3 (T1), 6 (T2), 9 (T3), and 18 months (follow -up), questionna ires only will be used. At baseline, candidate predictors will be measured including above mentioned cognitive, affective, relational factors, and hormonal and epigenetic factors. In a subgroup, structural and functional MRI, with resting -state and an emot ion processing (face recognition) will be performed. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation and benefits: The burden and risks associated with participation in this study is reasonable. All patients will receive psychot herapy, which is considered to be the most effective treatment for PTSD and PD. There is evidence that all four conditions are therapeutic in patients with PTSD and PD and no evidence yet what condition is more effective. Total time of the six measurements is approximately 5 hours per patient for interviews and 5 hours for questionnaires (see table 3), which are partly part of the routine outcome measurements (ROM). Questionnaires can be filled in at home. On the one hand, extensive clinical interviews and self-rating scales can be felt as disturbing because of fatigue, taken time and emotional burden. On the other hand, patients may feel well recognized by the time taken by specialized clinicians for them. Assessors will be well -trained and work in close"
11,page_11,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 12 of 59 connection with the treatment teams. For predicting treatment response, biological and genetic measures are integrated in the study. These measurements include physical examination, blood samples and hair samples. The burden and risk associated with the base line blood sample and hair sample is reasonable. For the subgroup of MRI research, participants will twice have a 60 -minute MRI session during which they will perform affective -laden tasks during scanning. Functional MRI is a commonly used technique that is considered to be safe if you follow the safety instructions (e.g. no metal objects in the MRI room) and contraindications (e.g. no metal implants, not pregnant, no seriously claustrophobia). Lying in the scanner while performing affective -laden tasks in the scanner can occasionally give patients uncomfortable feelings of anxiety and distress by reliving of their traumatic experiences. During and after the scan procedure a debriefing will be held to cover this by the executor of the scan protocol. The prin cipal investigators of this study have long experience with symptom provocation in the scanner (Thomaes: early traumatized PTSD patients with comorbid personality disorders: only 1 in 33 patients had a panic attack; OA van den Heuvel in patients with panic disorder, PTSD, OCD, Tourette, Parkinson, hypochondriasis: panic attacks were rare and not more frequently than healthy controls). In all, we consider the risk and burden associated with participation to be low. There are no benefits for individual pati ents participating in this study. Benefits for PTSD patients as a whole are that this study will provide important information about profiling patients guiding optimal treatment choices base on individual prediction models in patients with both PTSD and pe rsonality problems. It will help to know what works for whom and personalize mental health care as short as possible and at the main time most effective. It will help to understand why (working mechanisms) what treatment works best for whom. 1. INTROD UCTION AND RATIONALE Part A: Treatment outcome in PTSD with comorbid PD Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in about 9 -18% of trauma -exposed persons and involves considerable impairments in functioning (Breslau et al., 1998). This syndrome consists of re -experiencing of traumatic details (e.g. flashbacks and nightmares), avoidance of situations feelings and thoughts linking to the traumatic content, numbing"
12,page_12,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 13 of 59 and hyper -arousal, e.g. irritability, over -alertness symptoms (DSM -5). Evidence -based treatments for PTSD are trauma -focused cognitive behaviour therapy (TF -CBT) - including imaginary of prolonged exposure (IE/PE) and cognitive therapy (CT, i.e. without exposure element) - and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) (Balkom van et al., 2013, Bisson et al., 2013, Bisson et al., 2007). More recently, there is growing evidence of effectiveness of Imagination and Rescripting Therapy (ImRs) for PTSD, as a separate PTSD -treatment (Raabe et al., 2015). Effect sizes of TF -CBT compared t o waitlist/usual care are generally large (standardised mean difference, SMD -1.62; 95% CI -2.03 to -1.21; 28 studies; n = 1256) (Bisson et al., 2013). Effect sizes of EMDR (SMD -1.17; 95% CI -2.04 to - 0.30; 6 studies; n = 183 respectively) are similarly l arge, and although EMDR is less well studied than TF -CBT (Bisson et al., 2013), it is practised increasingly. PTSD treatments are highly effective treatments in the majority of PTSD. However, at least 3044% PTSD patients do not sufficiently respond to t hese treatments or drop out of treatment prematurely (Bradley et al., 2005, van Rooij et al., 2016). Even more PTSD patients are excluded from these therapies because of suicidality, self -destructive behaviour or other personality problems (Dorrepaal et al ., 2014, Ehring et al., 2014). PTSD is highly comorbid with personality disorders (PD), around 60%, especially borderline personality disorder (BPD), and cluster C - avoidant, dependent and obsessive -compulsive - personality disorders (CPD) (Landelijke Stu urgroep Multidisciplinaire Richtlijnontwikkeling in de GGZ, 2008). This comorbidity is associated with more severe symptoms and worse functioning than PTSD or PD alone (Fría & Palma 2015). PDs are associated with significant personal and societal burden an d tend to run a chronic course, at least in the first year (Gunderson et al., 2011, Bohus et al., 2013). Longer -term courses are more favourable: 88% of BPD patients achieved remission after 10 years, with the largest remission within 2 years (39.3%) and a nother part within 4 (22.3%) and 6 years (21.9%). Predictors of later remission were mainly childhood sexual abuse and a CPD (Zanarini et al., 2006). It is not clear yet what treatment is most effective for those who suffer from both PTSD and PD. There i s growing motivation in clinicians to offer PTSD treatments to PTSD patients with comorbid PD, because these treatments are highly effective, relatively short (weekly sessions, 3 -6 months), and there is some evidence that with PTSD treatment, comorbid PD s ymptoms might resolve as well (Feeny et al., 2002, Hembree et al., 2004,"
13,page_13,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 14 of 59 Clarke et al., 2008, Roberts et al., 2017, Kredlow et al., 2017). However, it may be more efficient to add a PD treatment at the same time. PTSD patients with (even mild) BPD symptoms were less likely to achieve good end -state functioning posttreatment (Feeny et al., 2002, Hembree et al., 2004) and dropped out twice as likely as PTSD patients without PD symptoms when receiving PTSD treatment alone (Zayfert et al., 2005). Worse end - stat e functioning may lead to a higher relapse rate, which is over 20% in anxiety disorders (Penninx et al., 2011). This might be so because emotion dysregulation, interpersonal malfunctioning, attachment or other personality problems are not sufficiently deal t with in PTSD treatments. Psychotherapy is the most effective treatment for all personality disorders (Leichsenring & Leibing, 2003). In BPD the strongest evidence exists for dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) with moderate to large effect sizes for affective instability (SMD -1.07 [95% CI -1.61 - - 0.52]; n = 59) and anger (SMD -0.83 [95% CI -1.43 - -0.22]; n = 46, 2 RCTs), and moderate effect sizes in terms of impulsivity (SMD -0.61; 95% CI -1.14 to -0.09, n = 59), para -suicidality / self -harm (SMD -0.54, 95% CI 0.92 to -0.16; n = 110, 3 RCTs) and general mental health (SMD 0.65 [95% CI 0.07 - 1.24]; n = 74, 2 RCTs) (Stoffers et al., 2012). For comparisons between different comprehensive psychotherapies in BPD, statistically significant superiority was demonstrated for DBT over client -centered therapy (Kliem et al., 2010), and schema -focused therapy (SFT) over transference -focused therapy (GiesenBloo et al., 2006). In CPD (avoidant, dependent, obsessive compulsive PD), no effect differences are foun d between different theoretical references, such as SFT and psychodynamic therapy (Svartberg et al., 2004). DBT and SFT both have their roots in cognitive behavioral therapy and working mechanisms are based on improving emotion regulation, consisting of st rategies aimed at modulating and adjusting unpleasant emotional experiences (John & Gross, 2004; Pedersen et al., 2014). Although DBT and SFT are both improve emotion regulation skills, there are major differences in the explanatory models and techniques u sed in both methods (Fassbinder et al., 2016): DBT directly focuses on the acquisition of emotion regulation skills (mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness) and patients are encouraged to train these skills on a re gular basis; SFT focuses primarily on the avoidance of emotions and dysfunctional meta -cognitive schemas about the meaning of emotions by working with limited re -parenting, empathic confrontation and experiential techniques like chair"
14,page_14,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 15 of 59 dialogs. As add -on to SFT, ImRs can be used specifically to focus on traumatic experiences (see above). For PTSD with comorbid (B)PD an integrated DBT -PTSD -treatment is investigated in 3 RCTs (Steil et al., 2011, Bohus et al., 2013, Harned et al., 2014). The first study show ed moderate to large effect sizes of DBT -PTSD compared to waiting list, in terms of overall BPD severity (SMD -0.74 [95%CI -1.47 - -0.01]), depression (SMD -1.06 [95% CI -1.84 - -0.29]), and anxiety (SMD -0.96 [95% CI -1.72 - -0.20]) (Steil et al., 2011). The second study indicated that DBT -PTSD resulted in a greater mean change than waiting list on PTSD symptoms (CAPS 33.16 vs. 2.08), but not on BPD symptoms (Bohus et al., 2013). Integrated DBT - PTSD -treatment was also compared to DBT -alone, and led to larg er and more stable improvements in PTSD symptoms, doubled remission rate (80% vs. 40%), and decreased suicide rates (2.4 times less likely) and self -injury (1.5 times less likely), with moderate to large effect sizes for dissociation, trauma -related guilt cognitions, shame, anxiety, depression, and global functioning in completers (Harned et al., 2014). However, integrated PTSD -PD treatment is not yet directly compared to PTSD treatment alone. In summary, there is growing motivation in clinicians to offer PTSD treatments to PTSD with comorbid disorders, because these treatments are highly effective, relatively short, and there is some evidence that with PTSD treatment, comorbid PD symptoms might resolve as well. However, it may be more efficient to add a P D treatment at the same time. Evidence -based treatments for personality disorders (PD), such as dialectical behaviour treatment (DBT) for BPD, and schema -focused treatment (SFT) for CPD are well established. These treatments are more intensive (twice a wee k for at least one year) than PTSD treatments. There is some evidence that integrated PTSD -PD treatment works twice as good as PD treatment alone, but integrated PTSDPD treatment is not yet directly compared to PTSD treatment alone. This study will address this knowledge gap. Hypotheses A: We hypothesize that in PTSD with comorbid PD it is more effective to provide integrated PTSD -PD-treatment compared to PTSD treatment alone, primarily in terms of response rate in PTSD symptoms. Secondarily, we hypothes ize that PD symptoms, disability and quality of life will improve and cost -effectiveness will be better with integrated treatment."

In patients with PTSD with BPD, integrated DBT -EMDR treatment results in a higher response rate than EMDR -only; A2. In patients with PTSD and CPD, integrated SFT - ImRs treatment results in a higher response rate than ImRs -only. Part B: Predictors of PTSD treatment As yet, we cannot predict PTSD treatment outcome to individual patients. Certain candidate psychologic al predictors of treatment response are identified, at least on a group level. It was found that men with PTSD show worse treatment response than women (Tarrier et al., 2000, Karatzias et al., 2007). Younger age is associated with higher dropout (Rizvi et al., 2009). Type of trauma and severity of depressive symptoms were not found to be predictive of treatment response (Minnen van et al., 2002, Ehlers et al., 2005, Ford & Kidd 1998, Rizvi et al., 2009, Forbes et al., 2002, Ronconi et al., 2015). Cogniti ve candidate predictors of PTSD treatment outcome are: educational level/ intelligence (Ehlers et al., 2005, Rizvi et al., 2009), working memory (Nijdam et al., 2015, Wild et al., 2008) and cognitive control of emotions, i.e. emotion regulation. Emotion regulation problems and an extern locus of control are associated with worse response to PTSD treatment (Cloitre et al., 2004, Arntz et al., 2007, Bardeen et al., 2013, Böttche 2016), including high suicide risk (Tarrier et al., 2000) and alcohol intake (For bes et al., 2002). Borderline personality symptoms (affective instability and impulsivity) are related to worse end -state functioning (Feeny et al., 2002, Hembree et al., 2004, Barnicot et al., 2011) and higher drop -out from PTSD treatment (Zayfert et al., 2005, McDonagh et al., 2005), but not if symptoms are relatively mild (Clarke et al., 2008, Walter et al., 2012, Thornback et al., 2014). Affective factors found to be candidate predictors are related to hyper -arousal (anger/irritability, sleep problem s/intrusions) or hypo -arousal (avoidance/numbing, dissociation), both key symptoms of PTSD. PTSD treatment is thought to be effective only when the patient’s affective state is within a window of tolerance: arousal enough to be able to work with the trauma tic material but not too much overwhelmed by emotions (hyper -arousal) or disconnected from it (hypo -arousal). Severity of PTSD – if measured with a clinical interview – is associated with worse treatment response (Karatzias et al., 2007, Taylor et al., 200 3).

Severity of dissociative symptoms is associated with worse response to PTSD -treatment (Ford & Kidd 1998, Lanius et al., 2010, Resick et al., 2012, Cloitre et al., 2010, 2012, Wolf et al., 2016, Bae et al., 2016), although this might not be true for mild dissociative symptoms (Hagenaars et al., 2010; Minnen van et al., 2016). Severe dissociation is however not predictive f or worse treatment outcome in integrated PTSD -PD treatment (Zlotnick et al., 1997, Chard et al., 2005, Dorrepaal et al., 2012, Cloitre et al., 2012, Kleindienst et al., 2016). In addition, relational variables, such as quality of the therapeutic allianc e (Cloitre et al., 2004, Barnicot et al., 2011), credibility of the therapy (Taylor et al., 2003, Alfonsson et al., 2016), attachment problems (Forbes et al., 2010), and especially a lack of social support are predictive of PTSD treatment response (Brewin et al., 2000; Yehuda et al., 2015). Only few studies focused on neurobiological predict ors of treatment response. It is assumed that PSTD treatments mainly rely on extinction and memory re -consolidation processes (Careaga et al., 2016). Extinction, in short, is the attenuation or disappearance of a previously learned response when that response is not reinforced. The amygdala and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are associated with extinction processes and there is evidence that these neurobiolog ical correlates normalize with treatment (Thomaes et al., 2014). Non -responders of TF -CBT showed greater amygdala and greater right ventral ACC activation in response to masked fearful faces before treatment compared to responders (Bryant et al., 2008a, Di ckie et al., 2011, Schmidt et al., 2013, Rooij et al., 2016). A smaller ventral ACC volume and a smaller hippocampus volume were associated with poorer treatment response to TF -CBT (Bryant et al., 2008b, Rooij et al., 2015a). During viewing of negative pic ture before treatment, both decreased (Bryant et al., 2008a) as well as increased activity in the dorsal ACC – a region associated with emotion regulation - was found to be predictive of PTSD treatment response (Rooij et al., 2016), and this inconsistency of findings might point to heterogeneity in PTSD populations. In addition, non -responders showed an increased demand on the executive frontostriatal network during a response inhibition task (Falconer et al., 2013, Rooij et al., 2016) and increased left inferior parietal lobe activation, a region associated with attention processes (Rooij et al., 2015b). In research into BPD response inhibition tasks are also used as a paradigm (see Van Zuthphen et al., 2015 for a review), but not yet for predicting treatme nt outcome."
17,page_17,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 18 of 59 Recently, research criteria and neurobiological models are set to prioritize factors to study and use them in a personalized precision psychiatry (RDoc -criteria of the National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research -priorities/rdoc/; Heuvel et al., 2016, Williams 2016). These models are close to the above -mentioned psychological candidate predictors of treatment outcome: 1) cognitive factors or ‘cognitive’ brain networks, 2) affective factors related to the ‘limbic’ brain networks, and 3) relational factors related to the ‘positive affect’ and social processing brain networks (see figure 1 below). Using these models will help to build a more dimensional instead of categorical psychiatric model that will be better app licable to treatment choice (Williams 2016). Preliminary evidence exists on neurohormonal and associated (epi)genetic predictors of treatment outcome. A serotonin transporter gene promoter -region polymorphism (the LL 5HTTLPR genotype) was associated with greater responsiveness of PTSD to pharmacotherapy, while the S allele was associated with treatment non -response (Schmidt et al., 2013). Lower brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels predicted a greater response to pharmacotherapy in PTSD (Schmidt et al., 2013). It is not clear yet if these factors might predict psychotherapy outcome as well. Cortisol levels and FKBP -5 predicted PTSD susceptibility and might be useful as a treatment outcome marker too (Schmidt et al., 2013, Galatzer -Levy et al., 20 17). The same holds for oxytocin and the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene (Bandelow et al., 2016; 2017) Unfortunately, all those candidate predictors are found on a group comparison level only, and in few studies with small and heterogeneous groups of patie nts. Therefore, they are not yet applicable on an individual level for treatment choice. Single predictors have not shown a large explaining variance, in depressed or anxiety patients, while combining clinical with MRI data increased explained variance sig nificantly (Serra -Blasco et al., 2016; Månsson et al., 2015; Ball et al., 2014; Doehrmann et al., 2013), using machine -learning models. Machine learning prediction models have also been made for pediatric obsessive - compulsive disorder (Lenhard et al., 2017 ) and in depressed patients that received electroconvulsive therapy (Redlich and al., 2016). We will explore if candidate predictors of PTSD treatment outcome can be used in a machine -learning model to predict treatment outcome on an individual basis."

Psychological factors: Cognitive factors (educational level/IQ, working memory, emotion regulation), Affective factors (hyper -arousal: anger, sleep; hyper -arousal: dissociation), and Relational factors (therapeutic alliance, attachment, social support). B2.

OBJECTIVES The primary objectives of this study are : A. To investigate if in adult patients with PTSD and comorbid PD it is more effective to provide integrated PTSD -PD treatment compared to PTSD treatment alone in terms of response rate in PTSD symptoms: A1. In patients with PTSD with BPD, integrated DBT -EMDR treatment results in a higher effect size and higher response rate than EMDR -only."

To investigate individually prediction by a machine -learning model of PTSD treatment outcome in adult patients with comorbid PTSD and personality disorders (profiling), in order to improve treatment indication leading to more precise (personalized) and efficient treatments, with can didate predictors: B1. Psychological factors: cognitive (educational level/IQ, working memory, emotion regulation), affective (hyper -arousal: anger, sleep; hyper -arousal: dissociation), and relational factors (therapeutic alliance, attachment, social sup port). B2. Neurobiological factors: Neural factors (smaller ACC and hippocampus volume, increased right amygdala and ventral ACC activity and de/increased dorsal ACC activity), and Hormonal/ epigenetic factors (5 -HTTLPR, BDNF, cortisol/FKBP5 - methylation, oxytocin/OXTR). 3. STUDY DESIGN The design of this study consists of two – connected - RCTs comparing PTSD -treatment to integrated PTSD -PD treatment in patients with PTSD and comorbid PD in a specialized treatment setting (figure 2): A1. EMDR ve rsus integrated DBT -EMDR, and A2. ImRs versus integrated SFT - ImRs. Assessment points are: baseline (T0), after 3 months (T1), after trauma treatment has finished, around 6 months (T2), 3 months after T2 (T3), after 12 months (T4) and at 18 months (foll ow-up, FU). PTSD treatments specifically address the troubling memories of the traumatic event and the personal meaning of the event and consist of 12 to 18 sessions in maximum 6 months, and are: - EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) EMDR was developed in 1987 by Shapiro (De Jongh & Ten Broeke, 1998). In EMDR the therapist induces a bilateral stimulation once the client has focused the attention on a disturbing image or memory related to the traumatic experience. The bilateral stimulatio n is induced by the movement of the therapist’s fingers in front of the patients face from"

Attention is drawn to what traumatic memory and the dysf unctional thoughts about it are currently doing with the patient and not to what the patient was thinking during the traumatic experience. - ImRs (Imagination and Rescripting Therapy) (Arntz et al., 2007, Raabe et al., 2015). In ImRs, the patient imagines the (onset of a) traumatic experience and subsequently changes the original course of events by imagining different interventions and outcomes, thereby allowing for the change of original schematic representations and cognitions (Hackmann et al., 2011). I mRs implies changing the traumatic imagery in fantasy, to produce a more favourable outcome (without denying the trauma), imagining having control over the situation and being able to act according to one’s needs, to express one’s feelings and action tende ncies. ImRs was hypothesized to alleviate PTSD symptoms as well as change trauma -related beliefs and schemas (e.g. powerlessness, victimization, and inherent badness). It is suggested that ImRs might be more effective in patients with emotions and cognitio ns like anger, irrational guilt, shame disgust and/or self -contempt (Arntz et al., 2007). Integrated PTSD -PD treatment consist of a PTSD treatment interwoven in a PD treatment that takes at least twice sessions per week, for the duration of one year: - DBT (Dialectical Behavior Treatment), a manualized outpatient cognitive –behavioral treatment with two components: (a) weekly individual therapy and (b) weekly group skills training. Individual sessions focus on a hierarchy of target behaviors, which the patient tracks on a daily basis with diary cards. Behavioral analyses of the pattern and chain of thoughts, emotions, and events take place routinely to help the patient identify triggers and alternative strategies for coping. Change strategies such as proble m solving and reinforcement techniques are used in combination with acceptance and validation of the patient’s experience. Group skills’ training is used to help patients develop less self-destructive and more adaptive means of coping with intolerable affe cts. These skills include awareness of emotions and reactions, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance. Skills are then integrated into the individual treatment in problem situations, e.g. suicidal urges (Linehan, 1993). - SFT (schema focused treatment) is a form of psychotherapy integrating cognitive therapy, behavior therapy, object relations, and gestalt therapy into one unified,"
21,page_21,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 22 of 59 systematic approach to treatment. The focus in SFT is on changing maladaptive schemes that pati ents develop early in life and thereby improve emotion regulation skills. Change is achieved through a range of behavioral, cognitive, and experiential techniques that focus on (1) the therapeutic relationship, (2) daily life outside therapy (also through homework assignments), and (3) past (traumatic) experiences (Young et al., 2003). Psychomotor therapy (PMT) is part of the SFT treatment protocol. In the Sinai Centrum, 2 “Zorgpaden” will be implemented in Fall2017: “Zorgpad 1” with EMDR or ImRs (3 -6 months) and Zorgpad 2” with EMDR -DBT or ImRs - SFT (9 -12 months). Therapists need to be “adherent -to-the model”, which will be ascertained by regular supervision with audiovisual recordings based on the different theoretical psychotherapeutic principles and therapies are delivered by protocol. At this moment, there is no clear scientific evidence and criteria are not explicitly defined for the one or the other treatment, except that patients with PTSD without comorbid PD have to be indicated for “Zorgpad” 1. Use of co -intervention: Patients may continue taking medication for PTSD throughout the study. Patients who started with new medication for PTSD within 1 month prior to the initial screening will be excluded from participation. No other psychological or new pharmacological therapy is allowed during treatment. Medication use is monitored during the study. Escape medication/treatment: Participants might start taking medication or another form of treatment/therapy in case of acute crisis during the study. The use of these medications or crisis intervention during the study as co -intervention will not lead to exclusion from the study, but will be monitored, documented, and reported. Further treatment: After completion of the EMDR or ImRs a first follow -up assessment will be completed and the therapist will see the patient for an evaluation. If more treatment is acutely needed, a clinical evaluation is done and the indication staff will decide what treatment to offer to the patient. The kind, intensity and f requency of this further treatment will be monitored, documented and reported. All patients in Zorgpad 1 are allowed to start SFT or DBT after T4 (i.e. 6 months after completing Zorgpad 1)."

STUDY POPULATION 4.1 Population The study population consists of all patients between 18 -65 years old, referred to the SC with comorbid PTSD and PD, who are willing to participate in the study (informed consent); N = 252 patients (see 4.4), of which sub -group of 80 patients (N = 40 Condition 1 + 40 Condition 2) will participate in the MRI study (before and after treatment). For baseline MRI comparison, extra 40 healthy controls, matched on age, gender and educational level, will be rec ruited also for the MRI study via advertisements in local newspapers and through hersenonderzoek.nl. In total, 292 persons will be included in this study. A pilot episode will be introduced (September – December 2017) to test the feasibility of the s tudy and inclusion rate. Feasibility is enhanced by the opportunity to build on the established expertise of the academic research group in Arkin – Research and VUmc in conducting effect studies, longitudinal and neurobiological studies. 4.2 Inclusion c riteria In order to be eligible for study participation as a patient, he/she has to be at T0: - Diagnosed with PTSD (309.81) , and - Diagnosed with a personality disorder (301.81 borderline, 301.4 obsessive -compulsive, 301.6 dependent, 301.82 avoidant), or at least the number of required symptoms minus 1 for at least one of those PDs (i.e. four symptoms for borderline, three symptoms for obsessive -compulsive, four symptoms for dependent, three symptoms for avoidant) . To be eligible for the study, both patie nts and healthy controls have to: - Be aged between 18 and 65 years - Give written informed consent - Speak / understand Dutch sufficiently"

For the subgroup of patients and controls that also undergo MRI examination more exclusion criteria are: Pregnancy; Metal implants (such as pacemakers, etc.); Somatic disorders interfering with brain functioning; Claustrophobia; Other psychopharmaca than at -least -3months stabile dose SSRI or low -dose benzodiazepines 4.4 Sample size calculation A power calculation w as made based on Twisk (2007). We assume that PTSD treatment (EMDR or ImRs) have a small effect size (< 0.5) in the complex patient group with PTSD and comorbid CPD/BPD, while the integrated treatment will show double effect sizes (1.0) (Harned et al., 20 14). With a minimal clinical relevant difference of a 0.5SD on the CAPS -5, and the assumptions of a SD of 20.0, an intra -person correlation coefficient of 0.7, 5 follow -up measurements, the needed number to include is 50 persons per condition to reach fo r 80% power. Expecting a drop -out rate of 25%, we will include 63 persons per arm, or for 4 arms in total 252 persons. In 2016, approximately 950 new patients were referred to the SC (Amstelveen). From these patients, ca. 450 had PTSD. From these PT SD patients, 168 had a comorbid PD and 188 more were not assessed for personality traits (“Uitgestelde diagnose”). We expect that introducing the assessment of axis II assessments with this study will result in an estimated 300 patients with PTSD and PD pe r year, and after 33% refusals or exclusions, in an estimated 2o0 patients possible to include per year. To be sure to include enough patients, we will need to include more patients from another site of the"

From these 252 patients, 80 will be asked for additional MRI, next to 40 healthy controls (Total sample size = 292). An estimated 40 patie nts will be available for a second MRI after 6 months (total of 160 scan sessions). 5. METHODS 5.1 Study parameters/endpoints 5.1.1 Primary outcome parameters o Severity of PTSD (DSM -5) as measured with: • CAPS -5 (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Weathers et al., 2014, Boeschoten et al., 2014). The first psychometric evaluation of the CAPS -5 showed good reliability, convergent and divergent validity (Weathers et al., 2017). Severity of PTSD is measured on a continuous scale on the CAPS -5. All 20 symptoms of PTSD from the DSM -5 are assigned a severity score of 0 -4. These 20 scores are then summed to calculate total PTSD symptom severity. 5.1.2 Secondary outcome parameters o Presence of PTSD (DSM -5) as measured with: CAPS -5 (Clinician Ad ministered PTSD Scale, Weathers et al., 2014, Boeschoten et al., 2014) o PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM -5; Weathers et al., 2013; Boeschoten et al., 2014; Bovin et al., 2016). o Presence and severity of personality disorders as measured with the SCID -5-PD (S tructured Interview for DSM -5 Personality Disorders; First et al 2016) to assess presence and severity (dimensional score) of the DSM - 5 personality disorders o Demographic questionnaire"

Since the CAPS -5 will be used to assess PTSD in the current study, patients will be asked to only complete the CPTSD items of the ITQ. The ITQ measures CPTSD th rough six five-point Likert scale (0-4) items related to three symptom clusters of difficulties in emotion -regulation (C1-2), negative self -concept (C3-4) and distur bed relationships (C5-6). Additionally, three five -point Likert scale items assess functionail impairment (social, occupational and other im portant areas of life) associated with CPTSD symptoms (C7-9). A diagnosis of CPTSD requires that criteria for a PTSD are met (as measured by the CAPS -5), as well as a"

A patient can only receive a PTSD or a CPTSD diagnosis, not both. The ITQ has demonstrated adequate internal reliability and validity (Cloitre et al., 2018; Hyland et al., 2017). 5.1.3 Biological predictors (see table 2): o Biological parameters • Body measures: Weight, height, blood pressure • HPA axis (cortisol): Hair sample • Biomarkers: Fasting blood sample (BDNF, FKBP -5) & Full blood o MRI session in subsample (60 min) • 3 Tesla -MRI (GE, VUmc): functional MRI with a face recognition , Structural MRI, Resting state MRI, DTI.

Literature review: what is known on working mechanisms of PTSD treatment and do neurobiological findings predict PTSD treatment outcome? 2. Are PTSD treatments in this PTSD + PD population mainly working on increas ing extinction of fear responses? Is this associated with decreasing salience, negative affect and cognitive control network activity and connectivity? 3. Do biomarkers (ACC volume, amygdala and ventral ACC and dorsal ACC activity, and/or hormonal/epigenetic factors (5 -HTTLPR, BDNF, cortisol/FKBP5 -methylation, oxytocin/OXTR) individually predict treatment outcome of PTSD treatment? Timing of assessments Baseline (T0) visit All patients coming to the Sinai Center are asked to fill in the ROM questionn aires before the intake as part of standard care (OQ -45, LEC -5/PCL -5, SCID -5-PD screener, see Table 1). As part of the standard intake procedure at the Sinai Centre, patients who score positively on the SCID -5PD screener will be interviewed with the M.I.N. I.-plus and the SCID -5-PD. Patients with potential eligibility based on the in - and exclusion criteria described earlier receive the study information folder from the psychologist who performed the intake with them . If a patient is interested and gives th eir consent, the intaker informs the researchers to contact the patient. One of the researchers will explain the study to the possible participant and provide the information folders. After a consideration period of at least one week, they will be asked wh ether they want to take part in the research. At T0/Day 1, the study - intaker will explain the study information once more. If informed consent is obtained, in - and exclusion criteria will again be checked to assess the patient’s potential eligibility fo r participation (Dutch language, , LEC -5/PCL -5, SCID -5-PD screener ) and if the patient is included, the CAPS -5 will be performed."
35,page_35,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 36 of 59 After the interview, the patients receive an online code to fill in additional questionnaires online at the center or at ho me, if the patient has access to the internet (see Table 1). Total duration of the measurements of To/Day 1 will be ca. two hours (see Table 3). At T0/Day 2, patients are invited for the physical examination (weight and height to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI), blood pressure, hair sample by a research assistant and fasting blood sample as well as questions on cigarette smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption, medication and drug use) and they will be asked to perform a working memory task (N -back -task) o utside the scanner and to fill in the last set of questionnaires (see Table 1) either at the Sinai Center or online at home. Total duration of the measurements of To/Day 2 will be ca. 40 minutes (see Table 3). Blood samples will be collected in 3 x 6ml tu bes and the frozen samples will be stored at -80°C for intended future assaying of inflammatory markers (see Coelho et al., 2014), neuropeptides (such as oxytocin, 5HT), and epigenetics (such as FKBP5 -methylation, OXTR - & 5HTTLPRgenes). The tubes will be s tored without personal data linked to it, and they will only be marked with a subject number as described in section 9.1. below. Cortisol level (HPA -indicator) will be assessed in hair. This sample can be collected non - invasively by cutting a 1 -cm distal t o the scalp (1 month’s exposure) sample of hair (Russell et al., 2012). All samples will be stored for 15 years (according to Archiefwet 1995). In a subgroup: MRI session Exclusion criteria for MRI research will be checked (metal implants, pregnancy , somatic disorders interfering with brain functioning, other (psycho -)pharmaca than at -least -3- months stabile dose SSRI or low -dose benzodiazepines, claustrophobia). A separate visit for MR scanning will be planned within 2 weeks of T0, before the start of treatment, without causing a delay in treatment start. MRI sessions take at maximum 60 minutes (30 -min functional MRI with a face recognition, and a suppression vs. reappraisal task, 5 -min structural MRI, 8 -min resting state MRI; and 8 -min DTI) plus 30 min preparation. Next to patients, 40 healthy control persons, matched for age, gender, and education, will be asked to participate in one MRI session (no repeat MRI). These healthy control persons will be recruited via advertisements in local papers."

The principal investigators can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons. Reasons to terminate a patient’s participation include : - The patient withdraws her/his consent - The nature of the patient’s treatment is changed to coercive treatment (based on judicial ruling) - The investigator considers a patient’s continued participation in the study to be unjustifiable on medical or psych iatric grounds (i.e., because of side effects or unusual risks of the treatments). If an individual patient is discontinued due to one of the above -mentioned reasons, this patient will be treated as usual in normal daily practice. The treating physician remains the primary caregiver during the study and will be contacted at the baseline visit and updated throughout the study. The treating physician will contact the study team in cases of important changes and will be responsible to apply for legal custody if appropriate. All patients leaving the study early, regardless of the reason, will be requested to return to the site for an “early termination” visit to finalize participation. If the patient is not willing to complete all measures, priority will be g iven to the PCL -5 and OQ -45. There are no consequences if a patient also refuses this. 5.5 Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal Not applicable. 5.6 Follow -up of subjects withdrawn from treatment Patients who drop -out out of (part of) the treatment remain in the study and will still be asked to complete the follow -up measures. Priority will be given to the online assessment with the PCL-5 and OQ -45."

SAFETY REPORTING 6.1 Section 10 WMO event This study will be performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki (64th WMA general assembly; October 2013) and the International Confe rence on Harmonisation – Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP). The definitions of adverse events and serious adverse events described in these guidelines will be used for the present study. In accordance to section 10, subsection 1, of the WMO, the investiga tor will inform the subjects and the reviewing accredited Ethical Review Board (ERB) if anything occurs, on the basis of which it appears that the disadvantages of participation may be significantly greater than was foreseen in the research proposal. The s tudy will be suspended pending further review by the accredited ERB, except insofar as suspension would jeopardise the subjects’ health. The investigator will take care that all subjects are kept informed. Subjects are entitled to get information and to ask questions, before, during and after being part of the research to th researchers. Apart from the provided information, there is an independent expert involved. He can provide information for patients, but is not involved in this study himself. In this study the independent expert is a psychiatrist working in one of the companies within Arkin, named Mentrum. He is not involved in the Sinai Center. 6.2 AEs, SAEs and SUSARs 6.2.1 Adverse events (AEs) Adverse events are defined as any undesirable expe rience occurring to a subject during the study, whether or not considered related to the study. All adverse events reported by the subject or observed by the investigator or his staff will be recorded."
39,page_39,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 40 of 59 6.2.2. Serious adverse events (SAEs) We do not expec t any serious adverse event (i.e. any untoward medical occurrence or effect that results in death; is life threatening (at the time of the event); requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; results in persistent or significant di sability or incapacity; is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate me dical judgement, the event may jeopardize the subject or may require an intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). The main reason for this is that all four treatments given in the RCTs are evidence -based for at least one of the disorders t he patients suffer from (PTSD and PD) and patients who will be assigned to the PTSD - treatment only can given PD -treatment as well after T4 (after 6 -12 months) within the research design. Suicidality or self -injurious behaviour is very common in the study population included for this study. It is also known that starting a new treatment, such as EMDR or DBT could increase symptoms in the beginning, which can develop into suicidal behaviour. SAE’s which will occur during the treatment and for which medical care is needed, will be reported to the accredited METC. To monitor the SAE’s, patients will be asked to fill in a self -injury questionnaire (Opzettelijk zelfverwondend gedrag, Baetens & Claes 2014 based on The Brief Non -Suicidal Self - Injury Assessment Too l (BNSSI -AT) van Janis Whitlock en Amanda Purington (2013 )) at the regular assessments. In case of SAE’s for which medical care is needed, in between the assessments, therapists will report these incidents to the researchers at the weekly consultations, wh om will report these to the accredited METC. The sponsor will report SAEs to the accredited METC that approved the protocol, within 7 days of first knowledge for SAEs that result in death or are life threatening followed by a period of maximum of 8 days t o complete the initial preliminary report. All other SAEs will be reported within a period of maximum 15 days after the sponsor has first knowledge of the serious adverse events."

Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) This part i s not applicable to the presented study. 6.3 Annual safety report Not applicable (no pharmacological or other agents involved in this study). 6.4 Follow -up of adverse events All AEs will be followed until they have abated, or until a stable situation has been reached. Depending on the event, follow up may require additional tests or medical procedures as indicated, and/or referral to the general physician or a medical specialist. SAEs will be reported till the end of the study within the Neth erlands, as defined in the protocol. 6.5 Data Safety Monitoring Board It has been decided not to engage a Data Safety Monitoring Board in this study, no pharmacological or other agents are involved in this study. In addition, no interim analyses are planned. In the investigator’s opinion, implementation of a DSMB will not have sufficient added value for the current study."

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics of continuous outcomes will be presented by disorder category and include s ample size, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. For categorical outcomes, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be presented by disorder category. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS for Windows (versi on 20) or in R (https://www.r -project.org). 7.1 Primary study parameters For population description, the CAPS -5, M.I.N.I. -plus, SCID -5-PD, will be used in addition to the CTQ, LEC -5, DERS, ITQ, PAI-BOR, STAS, PSQI, DES -II, WAV, RSQ, CPI, BDI, AUDIT, WHODAS, EQ5D -5L, and Tic -P will be used (see Table 1). The subgroup of patients that underwent MRI will be compared to the rest of the group to test for pretreatment differences in PTSD severity and type/severity of PD. The primary analysis in the RCTs will be improvement of PTSD symptoms at 3 time points. This primary analysis will include trauma symptom scores at T0, T2 and T4 (CAPS -5, severity score) in a repeated measurements model, a linear mixed model for repeated measurements including at least ti me points, treatment group, the interaction between time point and treatment, sex, age and severity as fixed factors, baseline score as covariate and subject as random intercept factor. An cAR(1) structure will be used to model the residual covariance matr ix. Responders will be defined as participants with a posttest score at least 1 SD below the pretest score (based on Jacobsen and Truax, 1991). Secondary analyses will examine whether hormonal and epigenetic factors (5 - HTTLPR, BDNF, cortisol/FKBP5 -methyla tion, oxytocin/OXTR) mediate the treatment effects. Mediation analyses will include levels of the aforementioned variables on T0 and T2 to estimate the direct and indirect paths of casual treatment on the primary and secondary study parameters, through the proposed mediators. For individual prediction analyses, machine learning techniques (in R: supervised and unsupervised techniques, e.g. the random forest model method ) will be applied to separate treatment responders from non -responders based on clinical and neurobiological candidate predictors and in order to define the predictors"
42,page_42,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 43 of 59 contributing most to classification accuracy, calculating sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios from the prediction model (Ball et al., 2014). Candidate predictors that will be used are: - Psychological factors: Cognitive factors (educational level/IQ, working memory, emotion regulation), Affective factors (hyperarousal: anger, sleep; hyperarousal: dissociation), and Relational factors (therapeuti c alliance, attachment, social support); - Neurobiological factors: Neural factors (smaller ACC and hippocampus volume, increased right amygdala and ventral ACC activity and de/increased dorsal ACC activity), and Hormonal/ epigenetic factors (5 -HTTLPR, BDN F, cortisol/FKBP5 - methylation, oxytocin/OXTR). Questions that will be answered with machine learning in this study are: 1. Does brain activity predict treatment outcome for PTSD and PD (all treatment conditions together; N = 80) 2. Does brain activity pre dict treatment outcome for PTSD (EMDR and ImRs; N = 40) 3. Does brain activity predict treatment outcome for integrated PD/PTSD treatment (EMDR + DBT and ImRs + SFT, N = 40) 4. Data from the MRI at T2 can be used to predict relapse after treatment for all trea tments together (N = 80 if all patients return for a second MRI) or for trauma treatment and integrated treatment seperatly (N = 40 for both). fMRI data will be analysed wit Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software or FMRIB Software Library (FSL) t o map connectivity in the brain. Standard group comparisons will be used to analyse structural and task -related (face recognition) fMRI. First, ANOVA analyses will be performed with patients vs. controls for baseline comparison. Second, full factorial anal yses will be conducted in patients -only, with time (baseline vs. end of treatment) and condition (type of treatment) as factors to analyse the effect of treatment on (task -related) brain structure, connectivity and activity. Independent component analysis (ICA; FSL MELODIC) and dual regression analyses will be used to study changes in functional connectivity of brain networks (with a focus on the salience"
43,page_43,"- PROSPER - Prediction and Outcome Study on PTSD and Personality disorders - Version 8, 22 June 2020 44 of 59 network, negative affect network, ventral and cognitive control network). Brain areas that fluctuate si multaneously over time in blood -oxygen level dependent (BOLD; proxy for brain activity) response are automatically assigned to a component per subject. After filtering and preprocessing of the components (e.g. components that are caused by movement or scan ning artefacts), these components are averaged across groups. Through non -parametric permutation testing (FSL randomise) we compare functional connectivity of these networks between intervention groups and over time (T0 to T2). For the whole -brain network analyses, the structural MRI will be parcellated into 92 regions of interest (ROIs), based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. These parcellations will be transformed to resting -state fMRI and time series are extracted for each ROI and corre lated to get a whole -brain connectivity matrix per subject. The brain connectivity toolbox (BCT) will be used to calculate network topological indices (e.g. modularity, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient and efficiency) from these matrices. Net work topological indices narrow down the large amount of information from the brain scans to a few neurobiologically meaningful measures (Rubinov & Sporns, 2010). A more detailed description of these topological measures can be found in Bullmore and Sporns (2009). These measures will be calculated for every condition and compared through permutation -testing. 7.2 Secondary study parameters Secondary study parameters are quality of life with WHODAS, EQ -5D-5L, and health care consumption with Tic -P. Th e secondary analyses on these continuous measures will be similar to the primary analyses. 7.3 Other study parameters The analyses on other study parameters, including the AUDIT will also be similar to the primary and secondary analyses. Safety data : Incidences (number and % of subjects with at least one occurrence) of key SAEs and AEs will be presented per group. For exploratory purposes, confidence intervals comparing both groups will be provided."

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 8.1 Regulation statement The study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol as well as the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (64th WMA general assembly; October 2013). 8.2 Recr uitment and consent Patients diagnosed with PTSD and/or personality disorders will be informed on the study with oral and written information of the intaker. The participant will be informed about the entire course of the study, potential individual benef its and personal risks. Here it must be emphasized that participation is absolutely voluntary. Patients are given sufficient time to read all the provided information, counsel partners or relatives, and clarify any questions with the investigator (3 days t o 2 weeks). Participation requires written consent before any (screening) procedure takes place. This consent can be revoked at any time without citing reasons and without any consequences. A copy of the consent form and patient information will be given t o the participant. For healthy controls, an extra screening informed consent will be used to assess their eligibility. 8.3 Benefits and risks assessment, group relatedness All treatments given in our center are evidence -based and delivered by speciali zed health care professionals with continuing supervision. The safety and efficacy of the treatments are well established. The number of patient visits will be limited. The additional questionnaires for research purposes require an additional time, which c an be completed at home if the patient has access to the Internet. Potential benefits of this study for the patients is that outcome monitoring will be better implemented and that patients can be better informed on improvements and eventual deterioration s so as to adapt treatment plans. Patients are not withheld any standard treatment. Furthermore, routine care consists of less extensive monitoring"

In the face of the limited additional burden for the patient when participating in the current study as compared to routine treatment, and the possible positive outcome for future treatment, offering participat ion to selected patients appears to be justified. 8.4 Compensation for injury The sponsor/investigator has a liability insurance and a trial insurance, which is in accordance with article 7, sub -section 6 of the WMO. 8.5 Incentives Participant s will receive a monetary reward: 10 euro for the assessments for which they have to visit the Sinai centrum. (at T0, T2 and T4). The subgroup that participates in the MRI research will receive 20 euro per scan session plus travel costs. Participants will receive the amount of money in “VVV -bonnen”."
