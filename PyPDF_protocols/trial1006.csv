BACKGROUND AND RATIONAL E FOR ELAFIBRANOR IN PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS Characterization of the Disease Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is a rare, chronic, progressive liver disease of autoimmune etiology, characterized by injury of the intrahepatic bile ducts that, in untreated patients or non- responders to existing therapies, may progress to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and death unless they receive a liver transplant ( Kuiper 2010; Kumagi 2008). PBC disproportionately affects women versus men (approximately 10:1) and is typically diagnosed in patients between 40 years to 60 years of age. The incidence and prevalence rates for PBC in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia are reported as ranging from 0.33 to 5.8 per 100,000 inhabitants and 1.91 to 40.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively ( Boonstra 2012). Kim et al estimated that there were 47,000 prevalent cases of PBC in the United States white population and that approximately 3500 new cases are diagnosed each year ( Kim 2000). Over 60% of the newly diagnosed cases are asymptom atic. The majority of asymptomatic patients become symptomatic within 10 years and the estimates for developing symptoms at 5 and 20 years are 50% and 95%, respectively ( Kumagi 2008). Patients with PBC progress at varying rates, some having liver decompensation over a period of several years while for others progression occurs over more than a decade (Al-Harthy 2012; Selmi 2011). PBC is one of the leading indications for liver transplantation. Despite its rarity, PBC remains therefore an important cause of morbidity in the Western world. PBC has also been identified as an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma ( Ali 2015). PBC is characterized by cholestasis caused by autoimmune destruction of biliary ductules with progressive impairment of bile flow in the liver. This results in increased hepatocellular bile acid concentrations which are toxic to the liver. Such hepatocellular injury is associa ted with a local inflammatory response resulting early on in an abnormal elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, a hallmark of the disease. Antimitochondial antibody and immunoglobulin M are specific immunological hallmarks of PBC, and antimitochondial antibody is a diagnostic marker of the disease in approximately 90% of patients ( Hirschfield 2013). Liver biopsy, while confirmatory, is no longer the standard of care. ALP is also routinely used to clinically monitor the disease and serves as a leading indicator of disease progression. ALP increases with disease progression as bilirubin starts to decline in more advanced disease (as the excretory function starts to decline), and both have been shown to be highly predictive of long -term clinical outcomes, e .g., transplant -free survival ( Beuers 2011; Lammers 2014; Carbone 2013). Two large clinical PBC databases, the PBC Study Group (>6100 patients) and the UK -PBC Research Cohort (>5900 patients) have confirmed a near log - linear correlation of both elevated ALP and bilirubin after 1 year of follow up with long -term liver transplant- free survival ( Lammers 2014). As PBC advances, the transaminases alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) may also be elevated due to hepatocellular damage secondary to cholestasis. While gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT) lacks specificity, elevation of this enzyme in the presence of elevated ALP is confirmatory of a cholestatic condition such as PBC (Giannini 2005). The most common symptoms of PBC are fatigue and pruritus ( Crosignani 2008). The mechanisms underlying these symptoms are not well elucidated and neither correlates with disease stage or clinical outcomes."
21,page_21,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 of 92 Current Treatment Options Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), an epimer of the primary human bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid, was the on ly medicine currently approved to treat PBC until May 2016. UDCA has been shown to improve ALP and bilirubin, and to delay histological progression, thereby increasing liver transplant- free survival ( Corpechot 2008). According ly, UDCA treatment has been recommended as first line therapy for patients with PBC in the treatment guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases ( AASLD: Lindor 2009) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver ( EASL 2009). While UDCA has had a marked impact on clinical outcomes in PBC, a large proportion of patients have an inadequate response. It is estimated ( Ali 2015) that up to 40% of UDCA- treated patients have a suboptimal response to UDCA. Lammers and colleagues found that ALP remains elevated in up to 70% of patients who are currently being treated or are intolerant to UDCA ( Lammers 2014). Such patients remain at risk of disease progression and longer term adverse clinical outcomes. Ocaliva (obeticholic acid, OCA), at doses from 5 to 10 mg, was approved as a second line therapy by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2016 under the accelerated approval regulations based on a reduction in ALP, either as a monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA or in combination with UDCA in adults with an inadequate response. On 12 December 2016, the European Commission granted a conditional Marketing Authorization (MA) valid throughout the European Union for Ocaliva for the same indication . In the UK, the National Institute for Hea lth and Care Excellence ( NICE) recently approved Ocaliva for use as treatment in the UK making it available to patients. Ocaliva is also approved in Germany, and Spain. Datafrom the Phase 2a study suggest the potential for exacerbation of pruritis. In a Phase 1 dose ranging study, more severe pruritus (although with no higher incidence) was observed in the 10 mg OCA group tha n in the placebo arm. This Adverse Event (AE) was shown to be clearly OCA- dose related (Hirschfield 2015). The incidence of pruritus in the open- label extension study phase was 87% (68/78), and 13% (10/78) discontinued OCA due to severe pruritus ( Ali 2015). At present, despite near universal use of UDCA, 10%, 22% and 44% of UDCA -treated patients are progressing to liver transplant or death over 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively ( Lammers 2014). While research has been conducted on a number of other drugs (eg, malotilate, thalidomide, silymarin, atorvastatin, azathioprine, methotrexate, colchicine, D -penicillamine, cyclosporin A, chlorambucil and glucocorticosteroids), little to no evidence supports the benefit of these compounds ( Lindor 2009, Rudic 2012, EASL 2009). The European Association for the Study of the Liver ( EASL 2009) mentioned, however, that the PPARα agonist, bezafibrate, deserved further studies as well as sulindac and the antiretroviral strategy consisting of a combination of lamivudine and zidovudine (Combivir). Rationale for Evaluation of Elafibranor in PBC Elafibranor is being developed by Genfit for the treatment of PBC , based on its pharmacological properties as a PPAR α/δ agonist. A ctivation of PPAR α receptors leads to a decrease in bile acid synthesis, increase in bile acid uptake, and increased detoxification of bile acids through the increased uptake in micelles. PPAR α and PPAR δ receptor activation als o has anti -inflammatory effects by acting on different pathways of inflammation (NF -κB and BCL6 pathways). Ligand-activated PPARα contributes to a range of actions, including cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. PPARα primarily downregulates bile acid synthesis. PPARα also interferes with pro- inflammatory transcription factor pathways leading to the hypothesis that fibrates may exert their beneficial eff ect on cholestatic liver function by also regulating anti- inflammatory pathways."
22,page_22,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 of 92 Fenofibrate may also ameliorate cholestatic liver disease through its transcriptional activation of MDR3 (Ghonem 2015). While large -scale multicenter clinical studies are awaited, several pilot studies have consistently shown that fibrates might be of therapeutic benefit in patients with cholestatic liver diseases, particularly PBC. Use of f ibrates results in a significant reduction in cholestatic parameters (serum ALP and GGT ), transam inases, and immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels in PBC. Effects of fibrates on biochemical parameters can be observed as early as one month after the beginning of therapy, and most patients sustained the biochemical response as long as they were on fibrates. Discontinuation of fibrates results in rebound elevation of biochemical indices in patients with PBC, and an improvement in the biochemical indices is almost always observed after treatment with fibrates is reinstituted, further supporting the potential therapeutic benefit in PBC ( Ali 2015). In addition to the biochemical improvement, significant pruritus relief has been observed in patients with PBC with inadequate response to UDCA following institution of fibrate therapy (Lens 2014). Patients experienced worsening of pruritus when bezafibrate was discontinued, and pruritus improved or completely disappeared after bezafibrate was reinstituted. These data lend support to the use of fibrates in PBC patients, and suggest that fibrates could be used in the management of pruritus. 1.2. S UMMARY OF NONCLINICA L STUDIES 1.2.1. Safety Pharmacology Any potential effect s on the cardiovascular, resp iratory, and central nervous system ha ve been assessed and no safety issue was identified. 1.2.2. Absorption/ Distribution/Metabolism/E xcretion Studies (A DME) In animal studies, elafibranor was well and rapidly absorbed although absolute bioavailabil ity was moderate (about 20% to 40%). Elafibranor is extensively metabolized and the activity is mainly carried by the active metabolite GFT1007. In rat and dog, maximal plasma concentrations and exposure for both elafibranor and GFT1007 linearly increase with the dose a fter single or repeated administrations. Elafibranor and its metabolites are rapidly cleared from the plasma and they are totally excreted by both fecal and renal route within 48 hours. In the rat , elafibranor and/or its metabolites are rapidly excreted into the bile and undergo an extensive entero -hepatic cycle giving support for liver targeting of elafibranor and/or GFT1007. The distribution study in the rat supports the liver targeting of elafibranor and/or its metabolites. In vitro, elafibranor does not inhibit cytochrome p450 ( CYP)1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6, with moderate inhibition of CYP2C9, and weak inhibition of CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP4A11. GFT1007 does not produce any inhibition of the CYP450 isoforms 1A2, 3A4, 2C19, and 2D6, and only weak inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. Both molecules also show weak inhibition of CYP3A4/5, but only with midazolam as substrate. Thus, the risk of drug- drug interaction due to an inhibition of the main cytochromes involved in drug metabolism should be limited. Potential interaction with CYP2C9 metabolized drugs has been assessed through a clinical study (GFT505 - 112-8) designed to evaluate potential pharmacokinetic ( PK) interaction of elafibranor 120 mg administered for 14 days alone or with a single administration of warfarin. This study demonstrated that elafibranor administration did not affect the PK profile of warfarin (R -warfarin and S-warfarin)."
23,page_23,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 24 of 92 A protein binding study showed that elafibranor and GFT1007 were highly bound to human serum albumin. The risk of drug -drug interaction due to albumin binding should be limited since this binding is not saturable. In vitro studies have been performed to determine whether elafibranor (GFT505) and it s principal metabolite GFT1007 are substrates and/or inhibitors of major drug transporters, in order to assess the potential for drug -drug interaction (DDI). Based on the results of the OATP1B3 transporter inhibition assay, elafibranor (GFT505) has recently been assessed in a f ollow-up clinical DDI study with the OATP1B3 -sensitive substrate, atorvastatin. For the other drug transporters studied, the interaction observed does not require follow -up studies based on current regulatory guidance. The metabolic stability and metabolism pathways of elafibranor (GFT505) have been studied on liver microsomes and in primary hepatocytes from rat, dog, mouse, monkey , and human. There was no evidence of the formation of unique human metabolites or metabolites formed at disproportionately higher levels in human hepatocytes than in any other species. An in vivo study has been performed to compare the bioavailability of 14C-GFT505 in the rat, dog, minipig, and monkey. This study showed that in all species 14C-GFT505 is rapidly absorbed, although absolute bioavailability was moderate (about 20% to 40%). 1.2.3. Toxicology 1.2.3.1. Mutagenicity and Genotoxicity The toxicology program performed according to the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines demonstrates that elafibranor has no genotoxic or mutagenicity potential. 1.2.3.2. Acute Toxicity According to acute toxicity study results, it can be concluded that elafibranor is extremely safe when administered as single oral doses in rat and mouse, since no sign of toxicity was detected up to the dose of 1000 mg/kg. 1.2.3.3. Repeated Dose Toxicity Studies The safety of elafibranor has been assessed in multiple preclinical toxicology studies with repeated-dose oral administration for up to 6 months in rats and 12 months in monkeys. Moreover, two-year repeated -dose carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been completed. The only consistent safety concern raised by these studies is the expected PPAR α-associated hepatomegaly, hepatocellular hypertrophy, and liver carcinoma in rodent species (mice and rats). However, it is well known that, compared to nonhuman primates and humans, rodents are highly sensitive to PPAR α agonist induced peroxisome proliferation and associated liver side effects. Thus, available information on this class of drug which includes marketed fibrates together with the lack of any liver side effects in monkeys treated with high doses of elafibranor for 1 year support the nonrelevance to human (Cattley 2008 ).Overall, these studies did not reveal any other safety issues up to the highest doses tested. Notably, elafibranor did not have any of the known PPARγ-related concerns such as excess weight gain, hemodilution, edema, cardiomegaly, adiponectin induction, or urinary bladder carcinoma. Importantly, the non clinical studies have demonstrated a reduced plasma ALP activity in monkeys treated for 3 or 12 months with elafibranor"
24,page_24,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 25 of 92 1.2.3.4. Phototoxicity Studies The phototoxic potential of elafibranor has been assessed by the in vitro 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test and the UV -Local Lymph Node Assay ( LLNA) test in mice. Elafibranor (GFT505) , but not its major metabolite GFT1007, showed UVA -dependent cytotoxicity in vitro. The UV -LLNA test was performed in mice with oral dosing for 3 days at up to 800 mg/kg/day elafibranor . Although a very conservative no observed e ffect level (NOAEL) was set at 400 mg/kg/day based on isolated findings at the highest dose, it is considered that data are more in favor of an absence of phototoxic effect, given the tissue distribution of elafibranor (GFT505), and absence of phototoxicity signal in the clinical studies . 1.3. CLINICAL STUDIES 1.3.1. Phase I Program A Phase I program to assess the safety and tolerability as well as the PK profile of elafibranor has been conducted through 12 clinical trials. A total of 621 volunteers were randomized in these studies performed in Phase I centers, including 549 healthy l ean subjects, 60 overweight or obese subjects, and 12 patients with type 2 diabetes. The plasma concentrations of elafibranor and GFT1007 were determined using validated high- performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods. The PK parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental analysis. In healthy volunteers, the PK of elafibranor and GFT1007 after single administration of elafibranor at rising dose levels were assessed in 2 distinct double- blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials from 10 mg to 120 mg (GFT505-106- 1 and GFT505-108- 4). The PK of elafibranor and GFT1007 after repeated doses of elafibranor at rising dose levels were assessed in 3 distinct double -blind, placebo- controlled randomized trials: GFT505-106- 2 (5, 10, 20, and 30 mg/d), GFT505-108-4 (40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/d) and GFT505-113-9 (300 and 360 mg/d). In overweight/obese but otherwise healthy volunteers, the PK of elafibranor and GFT1007 after single administration of elafibranor at rising dose levels from 180 mg to 300 mg were assessed in a double-blind, placebo- controlled randomized trial (GFT505 -111-7). In the same trial, the PK of elafibranor and GFT1007 after repeated doses of elafibranor at dose levels from 120 mg to 240 mg, were also assessed in these overweight/obese but otherwise healthy volunteers. Another part of this trial assessed the PK of elafibranor and GFT1007 after repeated doses of elafibranor at 180 mg in type 2 diabetic patients. The food effect on PK of elafibranor and GFT1007 was assessed in healthy volunteers at the dose of 30 mg elafibranor in a Phase I, randomized, crossover trial (GFT505-106- 1). The PK of elafibranor and GFT1007 obtained after administration of the different formulations used throughout clinical evaluation of elafibranor we re compared in dedicated clinical trials in healthy volunteers: GFT505-108- 3, GFT505-111-7, and GFT505-115- 12. Comparable relative bioavailability was demonstrated. The lack of PK DDI between elafibranor (80 mg/d) and simvastatin has been verified (GFT505- 109-5). The lack of effect of a concomitant administration of sitagliptin on elafibranor PK has been verified (GFT505-109-6)."
25,page_25,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 of 92 The lack of effect of elafibranor administration (120 mg/d) on the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of warfarin has been verified (GFT505-112- 8). The lack of effect of elafibranor administration (180 mg/d) on the PK and PD of atorvastatin has been verified (GFT505-115-11). The study GFT505 -113-9 evaluated the effect of multiple oral doses of elafibranor on the QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval compared to placebo with moxifloxacin (400 mg in single oral dose) as a positive control, in healthy male and female volunteers. No effect of elafibranor on QT/QTc interval at both therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses for 14 days was observed. The excretion balance of radiocarbon (ie , the sum of 14C-labeled elafibranor and its 14C-labeled metabolites) and the metabolite profiling and PK of elafibranor after a single oral dose of 120 mg 14C-labeled elafibranor have been assessed (GFT505 -114-10). Most of the radiocarbon was excreted in feces (77.1%) and urine (19.3%), giving a recovery of 96.3% of the administered dose. The metabolite profile was assessed in plasma, urine, and feces, and did not highlight any new Phase I metabolite but allowed the identification of new glucuronated metabolites, one of them being the main urinary metabolite (12% of the administered dose). The last p art of the study GFT505-115-12 has been completed . The objective was to assess the dose linearity after single oral administration of 120, 180 and 240 mg of elafibranor, and if confirmed, to assess the time dependency of the PK parameters after single and multiple oral administration of therapeutic doses of elafibranor. 1.3.2. Phase II Program A Phase II program was initiated to assess the safety , and efficacy profile of elafibranor in patients suffering from cardiometabolic disorders. To date, 5 Phase IIa pilot trials have been completed in which 297 patients were randomized. A Phase IIb trial has also been completed (, and evaluated the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80 mg and 120 mg on steatohepatitis in 274 patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). A Phase IIa pilot study (GFT505-207- 1) was first conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of elafibranor at 30 mg/d for 28 days in patients with Fredrickson type IIb dyslipidemia. Thirty -seven randomized patients received elafibranor 30 mg (24 patients) or placebo (13 patients) over a 28- day treatment period. Although improvements were observed on primary lipid parameters, these trends were not statistically significant v ersus placebo. The Phase IIa study (GFT505-208- 3) assessed efficacy and safety in men and postmenopausal women with atherogenic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides, low HDL -C) and abdominal obesity treated once a day for 28 days with 80 mg/d of elafibranor. Ninety -four patients were randomized: 63 patients in the elafibranor 80 mg/d arm and 31 patients in the placebo arm. The Phase IIa study (GFT505-209- 4) assessed efficacy and safety in patients treated for 35 days with elafibranor at 80 mg/d. This study targeted patients with impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance ass ociated with abdominal obesity. Forty -seven patients were randomized: 23 patients in the elafibranor 80 mg/d arm and 24 patients in the placebo arm. The Phase IIa study GFT505-210- 5 assessed efficacy and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pa tients were treated once a day for 12 weeks with 80 mg/d of elafibranor. Ninety -seven patients were randomized: 50 patients in the elafibranor 80 mg/d arm and 47 patients in the placebo arm."
26,page_26,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 of 92 The Phase IIa study (GFT505-210- 6) was designed to evaluate the s afety and efficacy of elafibranor on hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity using the gold standard glucose clamp technique in male patients with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA- IR) > 3 and abdominal obesity. Patients were treated once daily (QD) with 80 mg/d of elafibranor or placebo for 8 weeks in a crossover design. In this study, after 8 weeks of treatment, elafibranor significantly improved the response of the liver to insulin action. Indeed, at the first level of insulin perfusion, the insulin- induced decrease in hepatic glucose production was -49 ± 4% after elafibranor v ersus -34 ± 4% after placebo (p = 0.0016). The insulin sensitivity of the muscles and other peripheral tissues measured at the second level of insulin perf usion was also increased by 28% with a significant effect on the glucose infusion r ate (3.69 ± 0.31 mg/kg/min after elafibranor versus 3.21 ± 0.31 mg/kg/min after placebo, p = 0.048). Moreover, at the end of the treatment period, elafibranor significantly lowered the FFA levels measured at the first insulin level (FFA 0.21 mEq/L after elafibranor v ersus 0.27 mEq/L after placebo, p = 0.006). The favorable effect of elafibranor on insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis was also observed in Studies GFT505-209- 4 and GFT505-210- 5. In prediabetic patients with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and abdominal obesity ( Study GFT505-209- 4), treatment with elafibran or 80 mg/d for 28 days led to a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose (-5%, p = 0.04), fasting plasma insulin ( -25%, p = 0.009), and consequently improvement of the insulin resistance index (HOMA -IR: -31%, p = 0.027). In diabetic patients treated for 3 months with 80 mg/d of elafibranor (study GFT505-210- 5), oral glucose tolerance test -derived parameters, including area under the time- concentration curve for glycemia, insulinemia and FFA levels, significantly improved. In all Phase IIa studies, pat ients treated with elafibranor at 80 mg/d for 1 to 3 months consistently experienced an improvement of the plasma lipid profile, with significant reduction of triglycerides (-20% to - 35%), reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (-10% to - 15% in prediabetic, insulin- resistant and diabetic patients) and increase in HDL -C (+10% in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia). In addition, elafibranor treatment consistently increased the anti - atherogenic apolipoproteins (ApoAI and ApoAII) while reducing the pro- atherogenic apolipoproteins (ApoB, ApoCIII, ApoE). In all Phase IIa studies, elafibranor treatment at 80 mg/d for 1 to 3 months also led to favorable reductions in inflammatory markers. Reduced haptoglobin levels were observed in all Pha se IIa clinical trials with elafibranor, with the greatest effect obtained after 3 months of treatment in diabetic patients ( -20% in the elafibranor group versu s +6% in the placebo group, p < 0.001). Similarly, fibrinogen levels were consistently decreased by approximately 10% in all Phase IIa clinical trials with elafibranor, and high-sensitivity CRP levels were lowered after 3 months of treatment in diabetic patients ( -17% in the elafibranor group versu s +52% in the placebo group). Finally, beneficial eff ects of elafibranor on liver function were consistently observed in all Phase IIa clinical trials of patients treated for 1 to 3 months with 80 mg/d elafibranor. Significant reductions in circulating levels of GGT and ALP were observed and reached up to -29% for GGT and -25% for ALP in elafibranor treated groups compared to placebo. In addition, in insulin- resistant patients, elafibranor treatment induced a significant reduction in ALT ( -20% compared to placebo), while the level of aspartate aminotransferas e (AST) was unchanged. A Phase IIb study in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) patients (GFT505-212- 7) included 274 patients and involved a total of 56 centers in the U S and in multiple European countries (France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Italy, UK, Germany, Spain, and Romania). The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of elafibranor at 80 and 120 mg QD for 52 weeks versu s placebo in reversing histological steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis."
27,page_27,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 of 92 The study results showed that elafibranor at 120 mg demonstrates efficacy on the resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis in patients with an active disease ( NAFLD Activity Score [NAS] score ≥ 4). Importantly, elafibranor at 120 mg concomitantly improved the cardiometabolic risk profile of NASH p atients by decreasing plasma triglycerides, total and LDL -C, increasing HDL-C, and improving inflammation, insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis. The safety profile of elafibranor was confirmed in this study. Elafibranor was well tolerated, at both doses. From the start to end of the study, regular safety reviews did not generate any comment or additional request from the Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB). The most frequent and expected adverse events were of gastrointestinal nature. Clinical adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and were similar in the placebo and treated groups for the most frequently reported treatment -related AEs. Leukocyturia, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus inadequate control were more frequent in elafibranor arms as well as cutaneous rash, arthralgia, decrease in appetite, dizziness and renal impairment which were only reported in the elafibranor treated groups. Serious adverse events ( SAE) were reported in 27 patients treated with elafibranor (13 with elafibranor 80 mg/d and 14 with elafibranor 120 mg/d). Of these, only 5 SAEs reported treated with elafibranor were considered by the sponsor as reasonably related to treatment after further analysis. Nineteen patients discontinued the study for safety reason with no imbalance between groups (6 in the placebo arm, 6 in the elafibranor 80 mg arm, and 7 in the elafibranor 120 mg arm). 1.4. CONCLUSION In nonclinical studies, plasma ALP activity was reduced in monkeys treated for 3 or 12 months with elafibranor. Moreover, in the Phase 2a and 2b program, elafibranor has consistently shown a significant decrease in liver enzymes, notably in ALP. A decrease in ALP levels is recognized as a particularly relevant surrogate marker for the treatment of PBC, and was recently used as the basis for FDA approval of OCA in this indication. Elafibranor has also demonstrated significant anti - inflammatory properties i n the phase 2a and 2b program. The good safety profile of elafibranor was demonstrated through its development, including the therapeutic dose of 120 mg selected for the Phase 3 study in NASH. Based on the mechanism of action of elafibranor, and on the relevant efficacy and safety data up to the phase 2B study, specifically the ALP decrease and inflammation markers, Genfit has decided to launch a phase 2 study in PBC patients , in order to validate the efficacy of elafibranor on ALP decrease, and to confirm its safety in this population. Additional information can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure."

The Screening Period (-4 weeks to -1 week) will precede a 12-week double -blind Treatment Period (Figure 1). A pre-randomization visit (to confirm eligibility), will take place 1 week prior to randomization at Visit 1. The study follow-up period will last up to 30 days after Visit 5. A schedule of assessment by visit is presented in Table 1, and a schedule of biological assessment by visit is presented in Table 2. 3.5.1. Screening Period 3.5.1.1. Screening Visit [SV] (Week -4 to Week -1) The following screening procedures will be performed for all potential patients at the SV conducted between Week -4 and Week -1 prior to Randomization: • Signature of informed consent witnessed by the Investigator or designated person. • Patient number allocation via IVRS/IWRS. • Check medical history/demographics. • Check inclusion/exclusion criteria (as described in Section 4). • Physical examination (described in Section 6.2.1). • Review dietary, fluids and recommendations (described in Section 5.1.1) including alcohol restrictions . • Record vital signs (described in Section 6.2.2). • Record height and weight. • Check concomitant/prior medication (described in Section 7.12 and Appendix III) • Check AEs from time of Informed Consent Form (ICF) signature (described in Section 6 and Section 8). The Screening biological assessment (SB x) will be performed at the SV. The following biological assessments (detailed in Table 2 will be performed at SB: • Blood samples (described in Table 2). • Urinalysis collection (dipstick will be done at central lab) . • Urinary pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential only [WOCBP]). If needed, a retesting of abnormal creatine phosphokinase (CPK) results or testing of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, may be performed during the screening window to determine the eligibility for the study as described in exclusion criteria 1 and 2 (see Section 3.5.5.1 and Section 4.2). Any other retest deemed necessary by the Investigator should be discussed with the Study Medical Monitor. At the SVpotentially eligible patients will be asked if they agree to participate in the study and sign the I CF. Preliminary entrance criteria will be reviewed . Each patient who has signed the ICF will be allocated a patient number composed of 7 digits which is generated by the IV RS/IWRS.  First 3 digits corresponding to the ISO numeric country code (this number will be pr edefined),  Next 2 digits corresponding to the site number (this number will be predefined),  Last 2 digits corresponding to the numerical order of the patient entry at the study site. A specific I VRS/IWRS procedure manual will be provided to the Investigator."

Pre-Randomization Visit [PRV] (Week -1) Upon receipt of the SB results or any retesting /additional testing results from the central laboratory, the Investigator should check the eligibility with inclusion/ exclusion criteria. If the patient meets all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (clinical, histological, and biological), the Investigator or authorized, designated Study Coordinator/Research Nurse will inform the patient of his/her inclusion by a phone call at least 1 week prior to the Randomization Visit V1. As soon as this randomization date is validated, the Investigator or authorized, designated Study Coordinator/Research Nurse will register immediately the patient eligibility and provisional randomization date in the IVRS/IWRS in order to pre -randomize the patient. When the IVRS/IWRS confirms the pre -randomization, it will provide the Investigator with a treatment number for the patient and will immediately forward the information to the drug distribution centre which will be responsible to send to the site the treatment allocated to the patient within 1 week at most. In case of ineligibility, the patient should be contacted as soon as possible. 3.5.2. Treatment Period (Week 0 to Week 1 2) Efficacy of elafibranor versus placebo on PBC will be evaluated in the double-blind treatment period of 12 weeks. During these 12 weeks of treatment, visits will be scheduled at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12. Clinical and biological evaluation will be performed during this T reatment Period. 3.5.2.1. Randomization Visit V1 (Week 0) Eligible patients will return to the site at the Randomization V isit (V1) and at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 during the Treatment Period of the study.

TRIAL PROCEDURES The procedures performed at each visit are summarized in the study sch edules (Table 1 and Figure 1) and in Section 3.5. The Investigator will be asked, whenever possible, to schedule patient visits at the same time of the day for each patient. A patient may be seen at any time for reasons of safety. During each visit, dietary, fluid and lifestyle and study recommendations will be repeated, vital signs will be measured , and the patient will be queried in the form of an open question regarding new or continuing events. Procedures for premature discontinuation after SV are described in Section 5.2. 5.1. STUDY RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1.1. Dietary, Fluid, and Lifestyle Restrictions The following restrictions should be applied to patients in this trial from Screening through to the end of the study: • Patients will be required to fast (no food or drink other than water) for at least 12 hours prior to all blood sampling (i.e., at each study visit ). As such, patients should not consume any breakfast or take any medication (including study medication) in the morning prior to blood sampling. In case the patients do not fast before a visit, a new appointment will be scheduled within 2 days. • Urine will be collected at each visit. • On each study visit day, study treatment will be taken in fasted conditions after the blood sampling (which corresponds to the day of the visit). • On visits with PK assessment, study treatment will be taken after the blood sampling for biological assessment and PK predose sampling. If possible, patient should remain fasting for 90 minutes after dosing. • During the 48 hours preceding each study visit, patients should not perform strenuous exercise. • Alcohol consumption should be limited during the study duration and registered in the eCRF. Alcohol consumption of more than 20 g per day for women and 30 g per day for men is considered abusive (see Appendix IV ). A standard drink is equal to 14.0 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in: o 12 ounces/350 ml of beer (5% alcohol content) o 5 ounces/150 ml of wine (12% alcohol content) o 1.5 ounces/50 ml (40% alcohol content) distilled spirits or liquo r (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, whisk y). Concomitant therapy is restricted and any change to treatment or introduction of a new treatment should be discussed with the Investigator before doing so (see Section 7.12 and Appendix III )."

Handling of P atient Withdrawal Patients will be informed that they have the right to discontinue the study at any time, for any reason, without affecting future management and treatment. 5.2.2. Permanent Discontinuatio ns of Study Drug In some instances, it may be necessary for a patient to permanently discontinue study drug. The patient may be discontinued from study drug at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons. In keeping with the ITT analysis, the patient will not be permanently discontinued from the study. The reason for permanent discontinuation of study drug should be documented in the eCRF and the study Medical Monitor informed. If the discontin uation of study drug is due to an AE, the event should be documented in the eCRF. Some possible reasons that may lead to permanent early study drug discontinuation include: • In the opinion of the Investigator , any AE , SAE (described in Section 8), or significant change in a laboratory value that warrants permanent discon tinuation of study drug therapy. Investigators are advised to call th e study Medical Monitor prior to making such a decision • Non-permitted concomitant medication (described in Section 7.12 and Appendix III ) • Female patients who are pregnant (see Section 8.6.1) or are breastfeeding or who do not agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study will be permanently discontinued from study drug • Non-compliance with the study treatment • Uncooperative patient • The patient requests to stop study drug permanently. Patients permanently discontinued from study drug will be requested to stop taking study drug and attend an EOT Visit at least 16 days but no more than 30 days after the last adminis tration of study drug (described in Section 3.5.3). 5.2.3. Patient Discontinuation F rom the Study Patient discontinuation prior to the patient’s completion of the study is expected to be low, occurring only if the patient withdraws consent, or if e nrolling in any other clinical trial involving an IP, or enrolling in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study. At the time of discontinuing from the study, the Medical Monitor and IVRS/IWRS should be contacted, and, if possible, an EO T Visit should be conducted (see Section 3.5.3). The patient will be permanently discontinued from the study at that time with no further follow -up. The date the patient is withdrawn from the study and the reason for withdrawal should be appropriately documented in the eCRF. Where possible, patients withdrawn from the study will be followed until resolution of all their SAEs or until the unresolved SAEs are judged by the Investigator to have stabilized."
43,page_43,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 44 of 92 5.2.4. Patients Lost to Follow-Up A patient would be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. Site personnel are expected to make diligent attempts to contact patients who fail to return for a scheduled visit or were otherwise unable to be followed up by the site. Survival status will be collected within legal and ethical boundaries for all patients randomized, including those who did not get study drug. Survival status will be searched in public sources during the study close -out period. If survival status is determined, the patient will not be considered lost to follow -up. 5.2.5. Replacement No patient replacements are permitted in this study. 5.2.6. Premature Discontinuation of the Study Premature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a Regulatory Authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of the Sponsor. In addition, the Sponsor retains the right to discontinue development of the study drug at any time. The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of patients, but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons. After such a decisio n, the Investigator must contact all participating patients within a reasonable period of time. As directed by the Sponsor, all trial materials must be collected and all eCRFs completed to the greatest extent possible. Furthermore, the Investigator can decide to prematurely discontinue the study. In that event, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor immediately of his/her decision and give the reason in writing. Prompt compliance with this requirement is essential so that the Sponsor may comply with its regulatory obligations. In all cases , ethics committee (IRB/IEC) and Health Authorities should be informed. If the Investigator decides to prematurely discontinue the study, all test articles, eCRFs, and related study materials must be returned to the Spons or. 5.3. PATIENT RESCREENING Patient Rescreening is allowed in a screen failed patient if there is a change in the situation of the patient which allows him/her to fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria. This will need sponsor approval. In case of rescreening, the patient will need to sign a new informed consent and will be entered as a new patient with a new patient number."

Biological A ssessments All blood and urine samples for efficacy and/or for safety assessment (as described in Table 2) will be returned and analyzed by the central laboratory (BARC : Ghent – Belgium, or New York – USA). A laboratory m anual will be provided to each trial site. The manual will outline the collection process and shipping requirements for the specific central laboratory. Blood sampling will be performed by trained personnel at each site. Blood samples will be processed and shipped as outlined in the laboratory m anual. Refer to the laboratory m anual for exact amounts of blood required for each test. For all visits, reportable laboratory results (except serology) will be available at sites approximately 24 hours after receipt of samples. Final results will be sent to sites. Laboratory reports should be reviewed, signed, and dated by the Investigator as soon as they are received. The Investigator should comment upon out of range parameters and assess clinical significance. The option to retest during the study is left to the Investigator’s judg ment. During Screening, retesting (to be performed at Retesting Screening visits ) is limited to CPK , and HCV RNA (in case of positive HCV Ab at screening visit , or known cured HCV infection) as described Section 3.5.5.1. Any other retest deemed necessary by the Investigator should be discussed with the Study Medical Monitors. 6.1.1.1. Laboratory Assessments Clinical laboratory evaluations (including hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis) will be measured at every visit as described in Table 2. Hematology and urinalysis (dipstick done at central lab ) will be measured at all visits. Both blood and urine sample will be transported to the central laboratory for testing and a nalysis. At Screening, the Screening Visit chemistry panel will be measured . The total chemistry panel and urine analysis will be measured at all visits from V1 to EOT orEOS visits respectively . 6.1.1.2. Urinary Pregnancy Tests Urinary pregnancy tests will be supplied to each site to perform a pregnancy diagnostic at each visit during the study on WOCBP. 6.1.1.3.

The plasma samples will be stored at –70°C/-112°F at the site facilities. Thereafter, the plasma samples will be transported, in dry ice, first to the central laboratory (as for all the other blood samples) where they will be stored at –80 ± 10°C (-112 ± 50°F) until shipped to ADME BIOANALYSE for analysis. 6.2. OTHER SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND ONGOING SAFETY M ONITORING 6.2.1. Physical Examination A physical examination will be performed by a qualified medical professional , and weight measured at each visit. Height will be measured at the Screening Visit only. 6.2.2. Vital Signs Blood pressure (mmHg) and pulse rate (beats per minute) will be measured at each visit according to the “Recommendations for Blood Pressure Measurement in Humans and Experimental Animals” published in an A merican Heart Association scientific statement. Systolic BP and diastolic BP will be measured after 5 minutes rest in the seating position with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer or a validated sphygmomanometer. Where possible, the validated manometer should be the same for a given patient throughout the visits. 6.2.3. Electrocardiogram A standard 12-lead ECG will be obtained at V 1, 3, 4, 5 and E OT or EOS Visits. Electrocardiograms will be recorded using 12- lead ECG recorders. A minimum of 3 cycles will be recorded per lead. The ECGs will be analyzed by the In vestigator. Any potential clinical significance of ECG changes will be determined by the Investigator with relation to the patient’s medical history, physical examination , and concomitant medications and recorded in the e CRF. 6.2.4. Patient Reported Outcomes Questionnaire s A standardized and validated questionnaire for quality of life (PBC 40QOL ) will be completed by patients at V1, V3, V4, V5 and EOS or EOT Visits respectively . In addition, patients will complete the 5D Itch scale and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at these visits. 6.3. I MPORTANT SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND PATIENT DIS CONTINUATION RULES 6.3.1.

Specific Biological Monitoring At any visit, if a patient experiences clinically significant lipase and/or amylase elevations, imaging CT Scan may be performed for the diagnosis of pancreatitis. 6.3.4. Safety and Efficacy Data Review Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) : Not applicable. A DMSB was not specifically set -up for this study for the following reasons: - The study is conducted in a small number of participants, for a short duration - GFT505 showed in previous clinical studies a very good safety profile The medical monitors will assist the investigators for all medical matters, whenever required, and will make sure that they respect the Protocol and the study procedures, including reporting of adverse events. 6.3.5. Guidance for Investigators Summary of safety d ata (for com pleted studies only) The safety and tolerability of elafibranor were confirmed in Phase I and Phase II studies. A Phase I program to assess the safety and tolerability, as well as the PK profile, of elafibranor has been conducted through 12 clinical trials. A total of 621 volunteers were randomized in these studies performed in Phase I centers, including 549 healthy lean subjects, 60 overweight or obese subjects, and 12 patients with type 2 diabetes. A Phase II program was initiated to assess the safety and efficacy profile of elafibranor in patients suffering from cardiometabolic disorders. To date, 5 Phase IIa pilot trials have been completed in which 297 patients were randomized. A Phase IIb trial has been completed, and evaluated the efficacy and s afety of elafibranor 80 mg and 120 mg on steatohepatitis in 274 patients with NASH. Of the 69 SAEs that have been reported cumulatively in the completed clinical development program, 48 occurred with elafibranor, 13 with placebo, and 8 prior to administration of study medication. For all SAEs, the treatment code has been broken (end of study unblinding). Of the 48 SAEs that occurred with elafibranor, only 9 were considered as having a reasonable possibility of relationship to elafibranor by the investigators (serious adverse reaction). They consisted of: • Atrial fibrillation in a patient with history of arterial hypertension and suspected chronic coronary disease treated with elafibranor 80 mg • Acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis that occurred in a patient on the second day of drug administration of elafibranor 80 mg • Spontaneous abortion in a pregnant patient treated for 6 months with elafibranor 80 mg • Ataxia, tremor and fasciculations in a patient treated for 51 weeks with elafibranor 80 mg"
49,page_49,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 50 of 92 • Acute pancreatitis that occurred after 7 weeks of treatment in a patient treated with elafibranor 120 mg. • Parkinson’s disease in a patient treated for 12 months with elafibranor 120 mg, aged 76 years (in the risk group for Parkinson’s disease, and with a family history of Parkinson’s disease). For 3 of the cases (atrial fibrillation, acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis, and Parkinson’s disease) after later investigations, given the medical history of the patients or the time of occurrence of the event, relationship to elafibranor was judged as “no reasonable possibility” by the Sponsor. For all completed studies to date with repeated administration of elafibranor (at least 14 days) from 80 mg/day up to 300 mg/ day (MTD) , numbers and percentages of frequency of non serious adverse drug reactions ( AR, adverse events reported by investigators as possibly related or related to study drug) have been calculated compared to the total number of subjects treated with elafibranor and the total number of subjects treated with placebo. Only non- serious adverse reactions with frequency > 1% are considered for reporting. Given the small numbers for each adverse reaction identified with a frequency >1%, an imbalance in frequency of occurrence compared to placebo is reported when the relative delta is ≥ 30%. The common non- serious adverse drug reactions reported with repeated doses of at least 80 mg elafibranor per day are thus summarized in Table 3. Table 3: Overview of the common non- serious adverse reactions (>1% of patients treated with elafibranor) by system organ class (SOC) reported in completed elafibranor clinical studies with repeated administration of elafibranor (at least 14 days) from 80 mg/day up to 300 mg/day (MTD)"

The first ones consisted mostly of diarrhea and vomiting. For general disorders, the main symptoms were fatigue / asthenia. Other non- serious adverse reactions reported in more than 1% of patients concerned changes in biological parameters such as liver enzymes increase (mainly transaminas es), CPK elevation, or increase of creatinine (reported by investigators as renal failure and/or impairment due to the calculation of creatinine clearance by MDRD based on creatinine). Myalgia, decrease of appetite and rash were also reported in more than 1% of patients but remain limited. Regarding specific monitoring, although no signal for increase in CPK has been observed in the clinical trials, given the known effects of PPAR α agonists on the increase of CPK enzyme, this parameter is monitored in clinical trials. For this reason, it is recommended that investigators review these lab results in the course of clinical trials. Other known effects of PPAR α agonists include the increase of creatinine, which was observed in our phase IIa and IIb trials, in a range of 5 -10%. This increase was reversible at end of treatment. This should also be monitored in clinical trials. Liver enzymes will also be monitored in clinical trials, with specific attention paid to drug induced liver injury ( DILI). Based on the f indings of nonclinical reproductive and developmental toxicity studies performed to date, and in the absence of human pregnancy data, elafibranor may be classed in the “Possible human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy” risk category according to the Clinical Trial"

As such, all clinical trials with elafibranor including WOCBP request a negative pregnancy test before Randomization, with effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. It is recommended to maintain the contraception up to 1 month after end of treatment. Pregnancy tests should be repeated as stated in each study protocol. In the absence of a c linical pharmacokinetic interaction study between elafibranor and contraceptive steroids, the exclusive use of hormonal contraceptive methods during clinical trials should be avoided, and they should be accompanied by barrier methods. Conclusion Based on the cumulative experience gathered to date, gastro -intestinal disorders such as diarrhea and vomiting, and asthenia or fatigue are considered common non serious adverse reactions reasonably associated with elafibranor. Most of them are of mild to moderate intensity. As previously, laboratory increases of serum creatinine or CPK should be monitored throughout clinical trials as this has been observed in Phase II trials, and is a known PPAR α agonist effect. Elevation of AT will be monitored as well a s DILI. In the absence of human pregnancy data, double contraception should be maintained for women of childbearing potential participating in clinical trials with elafibranor treatment, up to 1 month after end of study treatment."

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY MEDICATIONS Elafibranor ( propanoic acid, 2-[2,6- dimethyl-4-[3-[4-(methylthio)phenyl] -3-oxo-1(E)-propenyl] phenoxy]-2- methylpropanoic acid) will be supplied as 80 mg or 120 mg white to off -white round coated tablets (of different size) with no printe d inscription . The tablet contains elafibranor and inactive ingredients ( microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, c roscarmellose, anhydrous colloidal silica, magnesium stearate, Opadry II HP 85F18422). Two Placebo tablets (each one of same size as corresponding active tablet) to match elafibranor 80 mg or 120 mg will be provided as a white to off -white round coated tablet with no printed inscription . For additional information see Investigator’s Brochure. 7.2. PACKAGING AND LAB ELING 7.2.1. Packaging Elafibranor/placebo: The primary packaging is composed of opaque polyamide/aluminum/PVC complex and aluminum foil blisters. This has been shown to be a suitable primary packaging for tablets. Blisters will be packed in child proof wallets. Each childproof wallet will contain 2 tablets (one of each size), containing either one active tablet and one placebo tablet or two placebo tablets to ensure the blind between the treatment arms. Thirty-five wallets of two tablets will be packaged inside a period box. Three period boxes will be packaged into a carton. 7.2.2. Labeling All labels for study drugs will meet all applicable requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EU annex 13 of Good Manufacturing Practices: Manufacture of Investigational Medicinal Products ( February 2010) and /or other local regulations, as applicable. Distribution of study drug will be performed according to the Good Distribution Practices. Product cartons will be labeled with the protocol number, Sponsor’s name and address, description of contents, storage conditions, expiry date, dosage instructions, and any other applicable items required by national and regional guidelines/regulations. The label will contain the statem ents “For clinical trial use only” or other similar/appropriate statements as well as the following instructions “Please return empty packaging and unused products to your doctor at your next visit.” Details of carton and wallet labels are detailed in Appendix V . 7.3. D OSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION OF ELAFIBRANOR AND PLACE BO Patients will be informed to take two tablets per day of elafibranor 80 mg or 120 mg or placebo orally before breakfast with a glass of water each morning."
53,page_53,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 54 of 92 7.4. METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENT TO TREATMENT GROUP If the patient fulfills all criteria to enter the treatment period, the Investigator or authorized, designated study coordinator/research nurse will register the patient in the I VRS/IWRS system to pre-randomize him/her (at least 1 week before V 1). The IVRS/IWRS will check if the Investigator or authorized, designated study coordinator/research nurse is is authorized to use the system (identification number and access code). The IVRS/IW RS will then allocate the patient to a treatment group ( placebo or elafibranor 80 mg or 120 mg) through a treatment number and will immediately forward the information to the Drug Distribution Centre which will be responsible to send to the site the corresponding treatment package allocated to the patient for the 12- week period, within 1 week at most . This labeled package will include 3 period boxes , one for each period [V1-V3], [ V3-V4], and [V4-V5]. A confirmatory email will also be sent to the Investigator or authorized, designated study coordinator/research nurse, and to the Sponsor. The pharmacy will acknowledge receipt of the study drug in the IVRS/IWRS. A specific IVRS/IWRS procedure manual will be provided to the pharmacy. The randomization list will be generated by the IVRS/IWRS partner and will be kept under blinded condition to the study participants until the Blind -Review Meeting and the Sponsor authorization to unblind the trial. 7.5. STORAGE CONDITIONS Elafibranor and placebo should be stored between +15°C and +25°C (59°F and 77°F). Storage conditions are specified on the label. 7.6. D ISPENSING OF TREATME NT The Investigator will receive one package per randomized patient, each package covering the full treatment period: • Upon pre -randomization of each patie nt: the Investigator will receive a 1st package containing 3 perio d boxes (one for each of periods V1 -V3, V3-V4 and V4-V5) Each randomized patient will be given at each visit from V1 to V4 (except at V2) the study medication containing the adequate number of tablets to cover the drug administration over the entire period ( i.e. covering at least 4 weeks of treatment + 5 days margin for each period): • At Visit 1: the Investigator will dispense 1 labeled period boxes of 35 wallets of 2 tablets • At Visit 3: the Investigator will dispense 1 labeled period boxes of 35 wallets of 2 tablets • At Visit 4: the Investigator will dispense 1 labeled period boxes of 35 wallets of 2 tablets • The patient will be instructed to take the treatment orally ( 2 tablets per day before breakfast) with a glass of water. The Investigator will confirm each study drug dispensation in the IVRS/IWRS. A specific IVRS/IWRS procedure manual will be provided to the Investigator. 7.7. TREATMENT REPLACEMENT Treatment replacement , if needed, will be explained in details in a specific IVRS/IWRS procedure manual which will be provided to the Investigator."
54,page_54,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 55 of 92 7.8. PROCEDURE FOR BLINDING The Investigator, patient, and study personnel will be blinded to the treatment. Both elafibranor and placebo tablets and packaging are indistinguishable. Identification numbers will be assigned to a patient at the Screening Visit. The number will also be reported in the eCRF. Upon completion of the Screening Visit, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to active treatment (elafibranor 80 or120 mg) or placebo at the pre- randomization visit. 7.9. P ROCEDURE FOR UNBLINDING The randomization code may be broken by the Investigator when urgent action is required for the clinical management of the patient. For each patient, the list of treatment numbers allocated to the patient will be stored in the IVRS/IWRS . The Investigator w ill be able to unblind any treatment carton that was dispensed to the patient by connecting to the IVRS/IWRS (24-hour and 7-day access) and entering their identification number and access code. A back-up phone Interactive Response Technology (IRT) module w ill also be available should the site be unable to access the internet. The IVRS/IWRS will verify the authorization to unblind the entered treatment carton number and the screen will then display the treatment group. When completed, a blinded confirmatory e-mail will be sent to the Investigator and the Sponsor. The reason for unblinding should be clearly and fully documented by the Investigator. 7.10. S TUDY DRUG COMPLIANCE From Visit 1 and at every subsequent visit while the patient is being treated with study drug, the patient will be directed to bring back all used and unused cartons and blisters. Compliance will be checked by the Investigator during those visits and re corded in the eCRF. If treatment is interrupted , whatever the cause, duration and reason of the interruption should be documented. 7.11. T REATMENT ACCOUNTABILITY , RETRIEVAL AND DESTRUCTION . The Investigator or pharmacist will acknowledge receipt for each study treatment on the day of receipt. A drug accountability record should be maintained by the person responsible for dispensing the trial medication to the patient. All partially used or unused treatments will be inventoried by the monitor during and at the conclusion of the study. On Sponsor request, the Drug Distribution Center will organize the retrieval of all treatments (used or unused) and will proceed to their destruction only after the Sponsor provides written authorization. If the site has an appropriate Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for drug destr uction, the site may destroy used and unused study drugs in accordance with the site SOP and always after the drug accountability has been performed by the monitor."
55,page_55,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 56 of 92 If drug is destroyed at the site, the Investigator must maintain accurate records for treatment cartons destroyed recording: • Treatment carton (kit) number (see Appendix V ) • Quantity destroyed • Method of destruction • Person who disposed of the drug • Date of destruction 7.12. OTHER MEDICATION 7.12.1. Handling of C oncomitant Medication In a general manner, patients should be discouraged from starting any new medication without consulting the Investigator unless the new medication is required for emergency purpose. Similarly, any qualitative or quantitative change in concomitant therapy should be avoided, when possible (see Table 4 and Appendix III ). In the event such a change becomes necessary during the study, it should be recorded by the Investigator in the eCRF (including concomitant medications taken within 30 days prior to Screening) and information should be communicated to the Medical Monitor in order to evaluate the risk of DDIs. This includes drugs used on a chronic as well as on an “as needed” basis. 7.12.2. Non-Permitted Medication See Table 4 and Appendix III . The following medications are not allowed within the timeframe given in Appendix III : • Thiazoledinediones (g litazones [pioglitazone & rosiglitazone ]) • Obeticholic acid • Fibrates • Budesonide and other systemic corticosteroids • Azathioprine • Colchicine • Cyclosporine • Methotrexate • Mycophenolate m ofetilPentoxy filline • Potentially hepatotoxic drugs (alpha -methyl-dopa, sodium valproic acid, isoniazide, nitrofurantoin) • Antibodies or immunotherapy directed against interleukins or other cytokines or chemokines • Indomethacin (NOTE: Other NSAIDs are allowed) If it is identified after Randomization that these non -permitted drugs have been administered to a patient within the excluded timeframes , the patient will be permanent ly discontinued from the study drug (see Section 5.2.2). 7.12.3. Permitted Medication Under Conditions See Table 5 and Appendix III ."
56,page_56,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 57 of 92 The following medications are permitted under the condition of steady dosage prior to Screening: • Ursodeoxycholic acid if taken for at least 12 months ( and stable dose for ≥ 6 months) prior to screening visit • Statins and ezetimibe provided the dosage is kept stable for at least 2 months prior to Screening • Rifamycin and other anti -pruritis medication, if taken for at least 6 months prior to screening, and at stable dose for the 3 months prior to screening . 7.12.4. Permitted Medication Any medications other than those listed above are permitted. However, the dosage of a current medication for a chronic disease should remain unchanged as far as possible in order to reduce the risk of unknown D rug-Drug Interaction s. In the event that additional concomitant therapy becomes necessary during the study (treatment and follow-up periods) , it should be recorded by the Investigator in the eCRF. This includes drugs used on a chronic as well as on an “as -needed” basis. Patients should be discouraged from starting any new medication without consulting the Investigator unless the new medication is required for emergency purpose."

Adverse Events Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or c linical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical (investigational) product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment will be considered as an AE. The term AE is synonymous with the term “adverse experience” as used by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA). An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding or physiological observation, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Examples of AE include (but are not limited to): abnormal test findings; clinically significant symptoms and signs; changes in physical examination findi ngs; hypersensitivity; progression/worsening of pre -existing condition or underlying disease; recurrence of a pre - existing condition; lack of effect, complication , and termination of pregnancy. Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from: drug overdose , drug withdrawal , drug abuse , drug misuse , drug interactions , drug dependency , extravasation , exposure in utero. The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows: • Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms • Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention • Test result leads to a change in trial dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy • Test result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or Sponsor. Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an err or does not require reporting as an AE. An AE does not include the following: • Medical or surgical procedures performed; the condition that leads to the procedure may be an AE if applicable • Pre-existing disease, condition or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before the Screening Visit that do not worsen • Overdose without clinical sequelae • Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset before the consent form is signed. Such a medical condition is considered to be pre-existing and should be documented on the medical history of the eCRF • Uncomplicated pregnancy • An induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy without medical reason The questions concerning whether the condition existed before the start of the active phase of the study and whether it has increased in severity and/or frequency will be used to determine whether"
58,page_58,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 59 of 92 an event is a treatment -emergent AE. An AE is considered to be treatment emergent if (1) it is not present when the active phase of the st udy begins and is not a chronic condition that is part of the patient’s medical history, or (2) it is present at the start of the active phase of the study or as part of the patient’s medical history, but the severity or frequency increases during the active phase. The active phase of the study begins at the time of the first dose of the study drug. The active phase of the study ends at the last study visit. 8.1.2. Serious Adverse Events A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death • Is life-threatening (see Section 8.1.2.1) • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (see Section 8.1.2.2) • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (see Section 8.1.2.3) • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (including fetal malformations associated with spontaneous abortions or elective abortions) • Is another medically important condition (see Section 8.1.2.4). In addition, any illnesses reported before starting active treatment or AE meeting the criteria of seriousness (as defined above) and considered to be possibly related (according to the Investigator) to any study -specific procedure (e.g., laboratory testing procedure) must be reported as an SAE. 8.1.2.1. Life-Threatening Adverse Events A life-threatening AE in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 8.1.2.2. Inpatient or Prolonged Hospitalization An inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization means that the patient stays overnight in the hospital. Visits to the ER will not be considered hospital admission. Pre-planned hospital stays or hospital stays for nonmedical social reasons will not be considered as hospitalization , for example: • Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed for a procedure required by the protocol..Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of a routine procedure followed by the study center (e.g., stent removal after surgery). This should be recorded in the study file. • Hospitalization for survey visits or annual physicals fall in the same category. • Hospitalization planned before the start of the study for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened does not constitute an SAE (e.g., elective hospitalization for a total knee replacement due to a pre- existing condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the study). 8.1.2.3. Significant or Incapacitating Disability Only a persistent or significant or incapacitating disability is intended. This item refers to a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. Thus, disability is not"
59,page_59,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 60 of 92 intended to include experiences of relatively minor me dical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma. 8.1.2.4. Medically Important Conditions Medical and scientific judg ment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life - threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may requi re intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are: • Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm . • Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. • Development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.1.3. Clarification on S erious Adverse Events • Death is an outcome of an AE, not an AE in itself. • An SAE may occur even if the patient was not being treated with the investigational medicinal product at the occurrence of the event. • Life-threatening means that patient is at immediate risk of death . This does not include an event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity. • Complications that o ccur during hospitalizations are AEs. If a complication prolongs the hospitalization, it is a SAE. • Patient hospitalization means that the patient stays overnight in the hospital. Pre -planned hospital stays or hospital stays for nonmedical social reasons will not be considered as hospitalization . • A procedure for protocol/disease -related investigations (e.g. , biopsy) should not be reported as SAE. Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such procedures should be reported as SAE. 8.1.4. Adverse Drug Reaction An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended and that is considered ca usally related to an investigational medicinal product. A serious ADR (SADR) is an ADR which meets the seriousness criteria. 8.1.5. Unexpected Adverse Event Expectedness is assessed by the Sponsor. An unexpected AE is defined as an event that has a nature of severity or specificity that is not consistent with the applicable Investigator Brochure or that is symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to a known toxicity but differs because of a greater severity or specificity. “Unexpected” refers to an ADR that has not been previously observed and reported rather than an event that has not been anticipated based on the properties of the drug."
60,page_60,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 of 92 8.2. ASSESSMENTS The Investigator will establish whether or not any AE s have occurred at each visit from the date of consent through the EOS/EOT visit (or 30 days after the last drug intake whichever is later) . The patient will be questioned in a general manner to determine specific symptoms without offering the patient any suggestion. 8.2.1. Intensity Assessment The intensity of the AE will be graded as follows: • Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. • Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by simple therapeutic measures; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe: Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating. 8.2.2. Relation to the Study Treatment The Investigator will make a clinical and scientific judg ment regarding whether or not the AE was related to study treatment. The Investigator will evaluate any changes in laboratory values, make a determination as to whether or not the change is clinically important, and whether or not the changes were related to study drug. However, even if the Investigator feels there is no relationship to the study drug, the A E or clinically significant laboratory abnormality must be recorded in the eCRF. The Investigator will record the relation to the study treatment according to the following causality terms: • Related: the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the ti me of drug administration and it cannot be explained by the patient's clinical state or the study procedures/conditions. The A E abates upon discontinuation of the study drug and reappears when the study drug is introduced. • Possibly related: the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration, but could have been produced by the patient's clinical state or the study procedures/conditions. • Unlikely related: the temporal association between the A E and the study drug is such that the study drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the A E. The relationship is not likely because of other plausible explanations. • Not related: the AE must definitely be caused by the patient's clinical st ate or the study procedure/conditions. A reasonable explanation must be given, e.g., no IP taken, preplanned elective medical intervention, or incompatible temporal relationship. • Not assessable : the report suggesting an adverse reaction cannot be judged because information is insufficient or contradictory and data cannot be supplemented or verified. 8.2.3. Action Taken and Outcome The Investigator will record the action taken with drug and outcome of the event for each AE according to the following:"
61,page_61,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 62 of 92 Action taken with investigational drug • Drug permanently withdrawn – in case a patient is permanently withdrawn from the study drug • Drug temporarily withdrawn – in case the study drug is temporarily withdrawn • Dose not changed – in case no action is taken regarding the study drug • Unknown • Not applicable – an AE started before initiation of treatment with study drug, the treatment had been completed prior to reaction/event, or the patient has died. Outcome • Recovered/resolved • Recovering/resolving • Not recovered/not resolved • Recovered/resolved with sequelae • Fatal • Unknown Note: In case of irreversible congenital anomalies the choice not recovered/not resolved should be used. “Fatal” should be used when death is possibly related to the reaction/event. 8.3. REPORTING 8.3.1. Reporting an A dverse Event All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug, including those occurring during the Screening P eriod, are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) of the eCRF and in the patient’s medical record from the ICF signature until the EOS/EOT visit (or 30 days after last drug intake, whichever is later) . Whenever possible, symptoms should be grouped as a single syndrome or diagnosis. The Investigator should specify the date of onset, maximal intensity, action taken with respect to study drug, corrective therapy given, outcome , and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the study drug. Adverse event reporting begins from signature of the patient I CF at the first Screening Visit and ends at the EOS/EOT visit (or 30 days after last drug intake, whichever is later) . 8.3.2. Reporting a S erious Adverse Event Serious AE reporting begins from signature of the patient I CF and ends at the EOS/EOT visit (or 30 days after last drug intake, whichever is later) . Any SAE that is brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the reporting period and which is considered by him/her to be caused by the study drug within a reasonable possibility, should be reported. Investigators must notify, by fax or e -mail, the Sponsor designat ed representative SGS Life Science Services (LSS) Medical Affairs of all SAEs IMMEDIATELY (within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event) ."
62,page_62,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 63 of 92 ANY SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, WHETHER OR NOT RELATED TO THE STUDY DRUG, MUST BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY (WITHIN 24 HOURS) TO SGS LSS MEDICAL AFFAIRS AT THE FOLLOWING FAX NUMBERS: FAX number s: +32 (0)15 29 93 94 or 1 -800-746-6618 Contact Person: SGS LSS Medical Affairs Department E-mail: be.life.saefax-ma@sgs.com All SAEs independent of the circumstances or suspected cause must be reported in ENGLISH on a SAE Form. The SAE Form should include a clearly written narrative describing signs, symptoms, and treatment of the event, diagnostic procedures, as well as any relevant laboratory data and any sequelae, in order to allow a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of the possible causality. The Investigator is also required to submit follow -up SAE reports to SGS LSS Medical Affairs within 24 hours of becoming aware of additional information such as diagnosis, outcome, causality assessment, results of specific investigations , and any new significant information that has not been previously reported. It is critical that the information provided on the initial or follow -up SAE Form matches the information recorded in the source documents and the eCRF for the same event. Copies of additional laboratory tests, consultation reports, postmortem reports, hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents should be sent when requested and applicable. All provided reports must be anonymized. Follow-up reports relative to the patient’s subsequent course must be submitted to SGS L SS Medical Affairs until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes. The Sponsor or its designated representative will report all the relevant safety information to the concerned Competent Authorities and to the Independent Ethics Committee(s) (IRB/IEC) concerned according to the country- specific requirements. Investigator must fulfill his/her regulatory obligations to the Regulatory Authorities and/or to the Ethics Committee in accordance with local regulations. Depending on local regulations in different regions and countries, the Sponsor or designated clinical research organization (CRO) may be required to exp edite report to the Regulatory Authorities for: • SAEs (including events related to study procedures) • SADRs • Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) Each SAE report received from the Investigators will be evaluated by the designated CRO for pharmacovigila nce who will assess the seriousness of the event. Each SAE report will be evaluated by the Sponsor and/or his designees who will assess the relationship to study procedure or study treatment and the expectedness of the event. Expectedness will be assessed using the reference safety information included in the Investigator Brochure."
63,page_63,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 of 92 Any unexpected safety issue that changes the risk benefit analysis and is likely to have an impact on the patients who have participated in the trial will be reported by the Sponsor as soon as possible to the Competent Authority(ies) concerned together with proposed actions. 8.3.3. Follow-Up The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients, notably he/she should follow up the outcome of any AE until the return to normal or until stabilization of the patient ’s condition, even if this goes beyond the EOS or EOT visit . The patient must be followed up until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the patient has left the study and that additional investigations may be requested by the Sponsor. This information should be documented in the patient’s medical records. 8.4. P OST STUDY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Any SAEs and deaths that occur within 30 days of the last dose of the study drug, regardless of causality, should be reported. Any SAE that is brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time afte r the reporting period and which is considered by him/her to be caused by the study drug within a reasonable possibility, should be reported. 8.5. CLINICAL LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES AND OTH ER ABNORMAL ASSESSME NTS AS ADVERSE EVENTS OR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS Laboratory abnormalities are not necessarily recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities that are considered clinically relevant by the Investigator must be recorded as an AE or SAE as applicable. 8.6. S PECIAL SITUATION REP ORTS Special situations reports include pregnancy reports, reports of medication error, abuse, misuse or overdose, and reports associated with product complaints. 8.6.1. Pregnancy In case of pregnancy a communication will be sent by the Investigator to SGS LSS Medical Affairs by faxing a completed pregnancy form within 24 hours of his/her knowledge of the pregnancy. Pregnancies of females partners of male patients exposed to study m edication should also be reported to SGS LSS Medical Affairs using the corresponding pregnancy form. Female patients must be instructed to discontinue the study drug immediately and inform the Investigator as soon as possible once they are aware of being pregnant or suspect that they are pregnant during the study or within 30 days of the last dose of the study drug. Female patients will be requested, as p art of the general ICF , to provide informed consent to allow reasonable attempts to be made to obtain information on any possible medicinal product exposure to an embryo or fetus and to follow up on the outcome of the pregnancy."
64,page_64,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 65 of 92 The Investigator will contact the patient at the expected time of delivery for follow -up. If the outcome of pr egnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g. , spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, congenital anomaly, birth defect) , the Investigator should follow the procedure for reporting SAEs as detailed in Section 8.3.2. The pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. 8.6.2. Medication Error Medication error is defined as an unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, patient , or consumer. All medication errors will be documented in the eCRF and , in case of any potential risk to patient safety, would be reported as appropriate (see Section 8.3). 8.6.3. Misuse This refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the authorized product information and will be reported in the eCRF. All misuse will be documented in the eCRF and, in case of any potential risk to patient safety, would be reported as appropriate (see Section 8.3). 8.6.4. Overdose This refers to the administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively, which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorized product information (see Section 8.1.1 and Section 8.3.1). Clinical judg ment should always be applied. 8.6.5. Abuse This corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects."

STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS This section is an overview of the key elements of the statistical analysis for this study. Unless stated otherwise, statistical tests will be 2 -sided and use a 5% significance level, leading to 95% (2-sided) confidence intervals (CIs). No adjustment for multiplicity will be made for the primary and secondary efficacy variables. Further d etails on statistical reporting and analyses will be contained in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP). This SAP may be revised during the study only to accommodate protocol amendments and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data collection that could affect planned analyses. In all circumstances, a final SAP should be issued prior to database lock and treatment unblinding. Descriptive summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of patients, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and range. Descriptive summary statistics for categorical variables will include frequency counts and percentages. Unless stated otherwise, the denominator for percentage calculations will be the number of patients with non-m issing data. Descriptive statistics will be reported for the primary and all secondary endpoints . 9.1. R ANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT Random allocation will be made to the 3 treatment groups (elafibranor 80 mg, 120 mg and placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Details regarding the randomization process are in Section 3.2. 9.2. ENDPOINTS 9.2.1. Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of elafibranor 80 mg or 120 mg with respect to relative change from baseline in serum ALP levels compared to placebo. 9.2.2. Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoints are to assess at Week 12: • Response to treatment based on composite endpoints: o ALP < 1.67 × ULN and total bilirubin within normal limit and > 15% decrease in ALP o ALP < 2 × ULN and total bilirubin within normal limit and > 40% decrease in A LP • Response according to Paris I, Paris II, Toronto I, Toronto II, UK- PBC risk score • Response to treatment on normalization of ALP • Response to treatment on normalization of bilirubin • Response to treatment on norma lization of albumin • Response on 10%, 20%, 40% decrease in ALP • Change from baseline in ALT, AST, GGT, 5’nucleotidase, total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, albumin • Change from baseline in lipid parameters • Change from baseline in bile acids • Change from baseline in C4, FGF19 • Change from baseline in IgM • Change from baseline in inflammatory and liver fibrosis markers • Change from baseline in pruritus (through 5D- itch scale & visual analogue score VAS)"
66,page_66,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 67 of 92 • Change from baseline in Quality of Life (using PBC 40 questionnaire) • Adverse Events (AEs) • Cardiovascular parameters ( 12-lead ECG, heart rate, blood pressure) • Hematology and safety parameters 9.2.3. Exploratory E ndpoint The exploratory endpoint is to determine PK parameters of elafibranor (GFT505) and its metabolite GFT1007 at two daily doses 80 mg and 120 mg in patients with PBC and explore an exposure- response relationship. Details on all endpoints will be given in the SAP. 9.3. ANALYSIS SETS The follow ing analysis sets will be used in this study: • Enrolled: all patients who sign informed consent. This set will be used to summarize disposition. • ITT: all randomized patients. This set will be used to summarize efficacy. The main analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be based on the ITT. All ITT- based analyses will group patients according to the treatment they were randomized to regardless of the treatment received during the course of the study. • Safety set (SS): all randomized patients wh o receive at least 1 dose of study drug. This set will be used to summarize safety. • Per protocol set (PPS): all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and do not have any important protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PPS. Importan t protocol deviations will be defined in the SAP and agreed prior to database lock. Supportive analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be based on the PPS. All analyses using the PPS will group patients according to the treatment actually received. • PK set (PKS): All patients who have taken at least 1 dose of elafibranor and have sufficient plasma concentrations to be able to derive the various PK parameters. Patients in the ITT will be analyzed based on randomized treatment. Patients in the SS or PKS will be analyzed based on actual treatment received. 9.4. A NALYSIS OF PRIMARY E NDPOINT 9.4.1. Reduction in Serum Alkaline Phosphatase Percent change in ALP levels between baseline and end -point will be computed as follows: [(End-point value – Baseline Value) / Baseline value)] x 100. Baseline value will be computed as value at randomization visit (V1). End-point will be computed as:  Value at visit V5 or  Value at EOT (must be post baseline value) if patient prematurely dropped out"
67,page_67,"Clinical Trial GFT505B -216-1 Protocol V3.0 04 December 2017 GENFIT CONFIDENTIAL Page 68 of 92 The laboratory value u sed for calculation will be the first value (and not the retest value) in order to reduce the delay between last study drug intake and specimen date collection. The primary analysis elafibranor’s effect on ALP changes will be performed using a randomizatio n-based analysis of covariance method with an adjustment for the baseline ALP level (LaVange, Durham and Koch, 2005). A supportive analysis of elafibranor’s effect on ALP changes will be conducted based on an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model, with percentage change in ALP as the response variable and with the treatment group and baseline ALP level as explanatory variables. If there are baseline imbalances that are deemed to be important in influencing the relative change of ALP due to random chance, the corresponding variables may be added as further explanatory variables in the primary and supportive models. The analys es will be carried out based on the ITT population and, in addition, analyses based on the PPS population will be performed . 9.5. OTHER STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 9.5.1. Secondary Endpoints The difference s in proportions or rates among the three treatment arms with respect to responses to composite endpoints, risk scores, normalization of bilirubin and albumin will be tested using the Fisher Exact Test. If there are important baseline imbalances that occurred by chance, these confounding factors may be added into a binomial regression model (Spiegelman and Hertzmark , 2005) to compare the differences in proportions among the three arms in the study. Continuous endpoints, including changes from baseline in laboratory parameters (including lipid parameters), inflammatory and liver fibrosis markers , will be examined using an ANCOVA model similar to that used in the analysis of the primary endpoint, i.e., the change in the variable of interest will be included as the response variable whereas the treatment group and baseline level of the variable will be included as explanatory variables. If there are important baseline imbalances that occurred by chance, thes e confounding factors may be added into the model. For other items such as change in baseline in pruritus or QOL, only the descriptive statistics will be presented. The analys es defined above will be performed based on the ITT population with additional analyses based on the PPS population. Further details will be in the SAP. 9.6. STRATEGIES TO CONTROL TYPE I ERROR The overall type I error for the primary endpoints in this study is two- sided α=0.05. Statistical testing for all other secondary endpoints will be of exploratory nature. 9.7. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATI ON All sample size calculations were done in PASS 13 software. 9.7.1. Reduction in ALP It is planned to randomized 15 patients per treatment group."

This calculation assumes that the standard deviation (on the % of relative change from baseline) in each elafibranor arm is 18 and for placebo arm is 15 and were based on the results from the phase 2B elafibranor trial. The significance level (alpha) is 0.05 and test is based on two-sided two-sample unequal- variance t -test. 9.8. PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSIS Pharmacokinetic measurements: AU C024 and Cmax will be analysed for elafibranor and GFT1007 (main metabolite). Pharmacokinetic parameters of elafibranor and GFT1007 will be summarized by mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, minimum and maximum, and median. An exposure-response relationship will be explored. 9.9. SAFETY ANALYSIS Safety data (exposure, AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs , and ECGs) will summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. The main summaries of safety will be based on th e Safety Set. Adverse events will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). An overall summary of AEs will be provided. The number and percentage of patients reporting AEs will also be presented by MedDRA System Organ Class and preferred term. The AEs will be summarized by worst severity and relationship to study drug. Serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation will also be summarized. Narratives will be written for all SAEs. Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) recorded at each timepoint and change from baseline will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. Clinical laboratory values for each parameter will be assigned a classification according to whether the value is lower than, within , or higher than the reference range for that parameter. The values will then be summarized using shift tables to evaluate categorical changes from baseline to end of the 12 week treatment period with respect to r eference ranges. The number and percentage of patients reporting markedly abnormal clinical laboratory values will also be summarized by treatment group. Vital signs recorded at each timepoint and change from baseline will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics."

CASE REPORT FORM AND SOURCE DOCUMENTS A case report form ( CRF) is required and should be completed for each screened patient. The completed eCRFs are the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized Sponsor’s representatives or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the Sponsor. The Investigator will e nsure that all data are entered promptly, legibly, completely, accurately and conform to source documents, in accordance with specific instructions accompanying the eCRFs designed specifically for this study. The CRF being used for this study is an electronic CRF that has been fully certified as being compliant with the FDA regulations at 21 C ode of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11. All study required patient data generated during the study will be recorded in the eCRF, with the exception of SAE forms and PBC-40 or pruritus score which will be collected in paper. Patients will not be identified by name in the eCRF or on any study documents to be collected by the Sponsor (or designee), but will be identified by a patient number. The Investigator will review and approve each completed eCRF; the Investigator’s validation serving as attestation of the Investigator’s responsibility for ensuring that all clinical and laboratory data entered in the eCRF are complete, accurate, and authe ntic. Should a correction be made, the corrected information will be recorded in the eCRF by the authorized person and explained (if necessary). All corrected data will be tracked through an audit trail. It is the Investigator’s obligation to ensure docume ntation of all relevant data in the patient’s medical file (medical history, concomitant diseases, patient identification number, date of informed consent, visit dates, administration of study medication, AEs [start and stop dates ] and all concomitant medi cations [start and stop dates ]). All data recorded in the eCRF will be documented by source data. 10.2. R ETENTION OF RECORDS The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. The Investigator will be provided with a study file, which should be used to file the Investigator Brochure, protocol/amendments, drug accountability records, sample informed consent, staff curriculum vitae, correspondence with the IRB/IEC, Sponsor, and other study- related documents. To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients, all original signed ICFs, copies of all eCRFs, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. The Investigator must retain the study documentation until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. However t hese documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor. All hospital records will be archived according to local regulation."

QUALITY CONTROL & MONITORING PROCEDURES It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (ICH topic E6) , applicable regulatory requirements , and the current Declaration of Helsinki ( Appendix I ) and that valid data are entered into the e CRFs. To achieve this objective, the Study Monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, the Sponsor in the maintenance of complete, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. Before enrolling any patients in this study, the Study Monitor will review the protocol, the brochure for clinical investigators, the eCRFs and instructions for their completion and return, the procedure for obtaining informed consent, and the procedure for reporting AEs and SAEs with the Investigator. In addition, the Study Monitor will explain the Investigator’s reporting responsibilities and all applicable regulations concerning the clinical evaluation of the study drug. The Investigator will permit the repr esentatives of Sponsor to monitor the study as frequently as the Sponsor deems is necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. A Study Monitor from the CRO will be responsible for monitoring this clinical trial. To this end, the Study Monitor will visit the study site at suitable intervals and be in frequent contact through verbal and written communication. The eCRFs and related source documents, as well as drug accountability will be reviewed in detail by the monitor at each visit, in accordance with relevant SOPs and Good Clinical Practice (GCP; ICH topic E6) regulations. This includes results of tests performed as a requirement for participation in this study and any other medical records required to confirm information contained in the eCRFs, such as past medical history and secondary diagnoses. Further details can be found in the Monitoring Plan. It is essential that the Study Monitor has access to all documents (related to the study and the individual participants) at any time these are requested. In turn, the Study Monitor will adhere to all requirements for patient confidentiality as outlined in the ICF. The Investigator and Investigator’s staff will be expected to cooperate with the Study Monitor, to be available during a portion of the Monitoring Visit to answer questions, and to provide any missing information. All monitoring activities will be reported and archived in the Trial Master File. 11.2. E THICAL PRINCIPLES This protocol complies with the principles laid down by the 18th World Medical Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and all applicable amendments laid down by the World Medical Assemblies (Appendix I ), and the GCP guideline.

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD/INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE The GCP guidelines and the U S CFR Title 21 Section 56 (21 CFR 56) require that approval must be obtained from an Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) prior to participation of human patients in research studies. Prior to the study onset, the pr otocol, ICF, advertisements to be used for patient recruitment, and any other written information regarding this study to be provided to the patient or the patient’s legally acceptable representative must be approved by the IRB/IEC. The Sponsor will supply relevant material for the Investigator to submit to the IRB/IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. Verification of the IRB’s unconditional approval of the protocol and the written ICF statement will be transmitted to the Investigator. Documentation o f the relevant IRB/IEC approval and of the IRB/IEC compliance with GCP guideline will be maintained by the site and will be available for review by the Sponsor or its designee or by the authorized members of r egulatory agencies. The Applicant must supply the Sponsor with written documentation of the initial favorable opinion of the clinical research before the start of the trial. The study will not commence until favorable opinion has been obtained from the appropriate IRB/IEC. If any alterations, other than changes of administrative nature only, are made to the study protocol, a formal protocol amendment will be issued. The IRB/IEC will be informed by the Investigator of subsequent protocol amendments and of S USARs. Approval for protocol amendments will be transmitted in writing to the Investigator. The amendment will not be implemented until IRB/IEC approval, except in cases where immediate implementation is necessary to eliminate or prevent imminent hazard to the patients. A protocol change intended to eli minate an apparent immediate hazard must be documented in an amendment, reported to the IRC/IEC within 5 working days, and submitted to the appropriate regulatory agencies in the required time frame. If requested, the Investigator will permit audits by the IRB/IEC and regulatory inspections by providing direct access to source data/documents. The Investigator will provide the IRB/IEC with progress reports at appropriate intervals (not to exceed one year) and a Study Progress Report following the completion, termination, or discontinuation of the Investigator’s participation in the study. 12.2.
