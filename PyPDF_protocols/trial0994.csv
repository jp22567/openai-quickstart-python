Approximately 220 participant s will be enrolled . This includes ~80 participants (~40 per treatment group) who consent to participate in a CMR s ubstudy at selected sites . Randomization will be stratified according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification (II or III) , current treatment with β - blocker (yes or no), planned type of ergometer u sed during the study (treadmill or exercise bicycle) , and consent for the CMR substudy (yes or no) . The study will comprise 3 periods as follows : S creening period ( Day - 35 to Day -1) : P articipants will undergo a variety of general, cardiopulmonary, laboratory, symptom , and PRO assessments over 1 to 2 days in order to assess eligibility (s ee Table 1"
7,page_7,"MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-005 MyoKardia, Inc. Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 7 Confidential and Table 2). Key Screening tests include electrocardiogram (ECG) ; transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) conducted at rest, with Valsalva maneuver, and post -exercise; as well as cardiopulmonary exerci se testing (CPET) . The following screening assessments may be repeated, as long as within the 35 -days screening window : blood tests, ECG , and/or TTE. Repeat assessments are allowed if central core labs require a repeat submission due to quality and in order to better assess inclusion/exclusion values. Participants who screen fail may be considered for rescreening based on the investigator’s discretion, taking into consideration the reason(s) for screen fail. One attempt at rescreening will be allowed, and all procedures must be repeated. Double -blind treatment period (Day 1 [randomization] to Week 30/end of treatment [EOT]): The double -blind treatment period will include a two-step dose titration scheme designed to achieve safe and effective dosing for each participant based on their own response parameters. Participants who meet all eligibility criteria at Screening will first be randomized via an interactive response system in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with mavacamten 5 mg starting dose or matching placebo once daily (QD). Subsequently, assessments including ECG, PK (trough plasma concentrations) , and TTE will be perform ed at each of 7 study visits , beginning at Week 4, and read by core laborator ies (s ee also Safety Monitoring and Study Treatment sections in this synopsis and Table 1 ). At Week 8 and Week 14, the dose may be increased, decreased, or remain unchanged based upon results of Week 6 and Week 12 assessments, respectively. At Week 8 , the dose may be increased to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg (ie, increase from 5 mg QD to 10 mg QD) , and at Week 14 to a maximum daily dose of 15 mg (ie, increase from 10 mg QD to 15 mg QD). Dose increases are designed to be step -wise and are not allowed to skip doses (eg, from 5 mg to 15 mg). At Week 30 /EOT, participants will complete CPET and post -exercise TTE. For any participants perm anently discontinuing treatment prior to Week 30 , an early termination (ET) visit should be conducted as soon as possible, including CPET and post -exercise TTE . Participants with ET will also be encouraged to complete all remaining study visits and assessments, including the Week 30 visit. Posttreatment follow -up period (Week 30 /EOT to Week 38 /end of study [EOS] ): When double -blind treatment ends at W eek 30, participants will be contacted by phone at Week 34 and return to the site at Week 38 for an EOS visit. At the EOS visit, specified assessments will be repeated. This posttreatment follow -up period applies only to participants who are receiving stu dy drug after Week 22. Safety Monitoring To maintain safety throughout the double -blind treatment period , a clinic visit will occur every 2 to 4 weeks, beginning at Week 4 for an initial evaluation of clinical tolerability and safety (Table 1). Clinic visits will include but are not limited to clinical evaluation (symptoms, PRO evaluation s, adverse event [AE]/serious adverse event [SAE] assessment), ECGs, PK sample , TTEs, and laboratory assessments. Results of TTE performed by study site sonographers at each"

Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 8 Confidential scheduled visit following randomization should be kept blinded to the investigator and other study site personnel . An exception may occur if left ventri cular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30% is measured at the site, then the investigator will be immediately notified and study drug will be permanently discontinued as described within the protocol . A ssessments at Weeks 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 22, and 26 will be used to guide dose reduction or temporary discontinuation if indicated, based on pre defined criteria detailed within the protocol . If a t any time during the double - blind treatment period the m avacamten dose is decreased fr om the previous dose , the participant will continue on the reduced dose to the EOT (Week 30) unless further safety concerns or intolerability arise . Number of Participants Approximately 220, with 110 participants in each of 2 treatment groups . S t udy Treatment Participants will receive mavacamten immediate - release capsules 5 mg or matching placebo QD for the first 8 weeks of the dosing period with trough PK samples drawn at Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8. If at Week 4 the trough PK is between 700 ng /mL and 1000 ng/mL , the dose will be decreased to 2.5 mg at Week 6 . Otherwise, the d ose will be adjusted (increase, decrease, or remain unchanged) at Week 8 based on Week 6 assessments and Week 14 based on Week 12 assessments. The permissible doses after dose adjustment at Week 8 will be 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or placebo. The permissible doses after dose adjustment at Week 14 will be 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, or placebo . For added safety, if 700 ng/mL < Week 8 PK < 1000 ng/mL then an unscheduled visit will be arranged 2 weeks later ( W eek 10) to reduce dose. After Week 14 , assessments will continue every 4 weeks to W eek 30 /EOT for safety monitoring . At any time if PK plasma concentration ≥ 1000 ng /mL, then study drug will be temporarily discontinued.

Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 14 Confidential Sample Size and Statistical Considerations Approximately 220 participants will be randomized, with 110 participants in each of the 2 groups. Randomization will be stratified for NYHA functional class, current treatment with β - blocker, type of ergometer, and consent for the CMR substudy . The sample size should provide adequate power to determine the superiority of mavacamten in improving pVO 2 and NYHA functional classification relative to placebo. The power calculation is derived assuming a true clinically meaningful difference of 25% between mavacam ten and placebo subjects in achieving the clinical response. Based on the MYK - 461 - 004, PIONEER - HCM phase 2 study, 50% of the subjects receiving mavacamten met the clinical responder definition by the end of 12 - week treatment period. Assuming the same perce ntage of subjects in the active treatment arm and 25% in placebo arm will achieve the clinical response at the end of 30 - week dosing period in the current study, the proposed sample size of 110 subjects per arm will provide 96% power at two - sided 5% statis tical significance level. Subjects who terminate early or cannot be assessed for the clinical response at the end of 30 - week dosing period will be considered as non - responders. Efficacy A nalyses Primary efficacy endpoint s analysis The primary efficacy endp oint s of clinical response will be analyzed using the Cochran - Mantel - Haenszel test for stratified categorical data. Early dropouts or participant s whose response status is unable to be assessed at the end of 30 - week dosing period will be classified as non - responders. More detailed statistical analysis strategies will be documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Secondary efficacy endpoints analyses The general analytical approach for the secondary efficacy endpoints are the following: • To minimize f alse discovery among the secondary endpoints , appropriate methods to control Type 1 errors will be employed; further details will be specified in the SAP . • Categorical endpoints will be analyzed by the Cochran - Mantel - Haenszel test taking into account of str atification factors or Chi - square test without adjusting for stratification factors, whenever appropriate. • Continuous variables will be analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) model comparing between group means."

QTcF value from Day 1 ECG will not be used for eligibility or for temporary discontinuation. The Day 1 QTcF value will be used as the baseline to d etermine percent change at future visits when criteria for temporary discontinuation are applied. (Note: If for any reason a D1 QTcF is not determined, then QTcF from screening ECG will be used in percent change calculation.) h At Screening, ET, Week 30/EOT, and Week 38, complete v ital signs includ ing temperature, HR, respiratory rate, and BP will be obtained . At all other visits, only HR and BP are required. If PK sampling is conducted at a visit, vital signs should be collected before PK sampling. Vital signs should be taken with the study participant in the same position at all visits . BP should be taken via an automated recorder after resting for at least 5 minutes . i Resting TTE should be performed prior to post -exercise stress echocardiography or CPET. Resting TTE images and views w ill be acquired at each onsite visit prior to dosing as detailed in the echo site instruction manual. Instantaneous LVOT peak gradient (resting) and provoke d LVOT peak gradient (Valsalva maneuver) will be assessed by the core laboratory. Left ventricular e jection fraction (LVEF) will be measured at the clinical site by the certified site sonographer and subsequently by the core laboratory. The LVEF site read will be kept blinded from the investigator and other study site personnel, except in case of locally measured LVEF≤30%. j For post -exercise stress echocardiography, participants will undergo a standard symptom -limited exercise test after a 4 -hour fast by standardized treadmill or bicycle ergometer during Screening and Week 30/EOT prior to dosing. Instantan eous LVOT peak gradient will be assessed immediately post -exercise by TTE. Post -exercise stress echocardiography may be performed on a different day than CPET. If the 2 procedures are performed on the same day, participants must exercise only once, and par ticipants will undergo CPET and then post -exercise TTE. Post -exercise stress echocardiography should be acquired the same day or within 72 hours of the Resting TTE and should also be performed as close as possible to ET if it occurs. If post-exercise stres s echocardiography and CPET are performed on different days, the same sequence of visits must be performed for both screening and EOT. k CPET by standardized treadmill or bicycle ergometer will be performed during Screening and at Week 30/E OT prior to dosing . CPET is done after a 4 -hour fast. Record the fasting status and the date and time of the last dose taken prior to CPET. Any concomitant medication may be administered prior to all exercise testing. CPET should also be performed as close as possible to ET if it occurs . l A cardiac monitoring device will be applied during Screening , Week 12 , and at the Week 2 6 visits and retrieved at the Day 1, Week 14 , and Week 30 visits, respectively. m An accelerometer will be fastened to the participant’s wrist at Screening (at least 11 days before Day 1) and at the Week 26 visit to collect data on activity. Participants will return the accelerometer at the next study visit for data upload and analysis. n Participants should not take study drug on day of visit prior to blood d raw for PK. PK sample will be collected ≤2 hours before dosing. Additionally, on Week 30 (last dose), another PK sample will be collected within 1 to 2 hours postdose."

Pharmaco genetic Screening for CYP 2C19 genotyping will occur at Screening; samples from screen failures must be destroyed. t At all onsite visits, study drug will be administered at the investigational site to facilitate collection of PK samples ≤ 2 hours prior to dosing. Note: There is no PK sample at Day 1 or Week 14. With the exception of Week 30 when a PK sample is also drawn within 1 to 2 hours postdose, Study drug will be administered at the end of the visit when all other asse ssments have been done, including any drawing of blood. u All participants will return their study drug dosing containers to the site pharmacy for capsule counts.

Approximately 220 participants will be enrolled. Randomization will be stratified according to NYHA functional classification (II or III), current treatment with β - blocker (yes or no), planned type of ergometer used during the study (treadmill or exercise bicycle), and consent for the CMR substudy (yes or no). The study will comprise 3 periods ( Figure 1 ) . Screening period (Day -35 to Day -1): Participants will undergo a variety of general, cardiopulmonary, laboratory, symptom, and PRO assessments over 1 to 2 days ( Table 1 and Table 2 ) in order to assess eligibility criteria, including presence of HCM and presence of obstruction (at rest or provoked). The investigator should also confirm that participants can adequately perform a Valsalva maneuver. Key S creening tests include ECG ; TTE conducted at rest, with Valsalva maneuver, and post- exercise ; and CPET . The following screening assessments may be repeated, as long as they fall within the 35 -days screening window: blood tests, ECG, and/or TTE. Repeat assessments are allowed if central core labs require a repeat submission due to quality and in order to better assess inclusion/exclusion values. Screening test results as reported by core laboratories ( electrocardiogram core laboratory, echocardiography core laboratory, and CPET core laboratory) will be used to confirm eligibility for random ization."

If CPET and post- exercise TTE are conducted on the same day, participants must be exercised only once for both procedures, and participants w ill undergo CPET followed by post- exercise TTE. If the participants undergo CPET and post-exercise TTE on different days, then participants will first undergo resting, Valsalva, and post- exercise TTE (and send the echocardiogram to the core laboratory to d etermine LVOT gradients for each) and undergo CPET on a later day. If CPET and post- exercise TTE are performed on different days, the same sequence of visits must be used for bothscreening and EOT. •Participa nts who are receiving treat ment for their oHCM condition should be on optimal medical therapy for their condition as determined by the investigator and informed byHCM treatment guidelines (eg, β -blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem). This treatment should be stable and well -tolerated for a t least 2 weeks prior to S creening . Concomitant medications at Screening should be maintained at a stable dose throughout the study, unless safety or tolerability concerns arise. •A pa rticipa nt may also be considered for enrollment if the investigator has d etermined that receiving no treatment for their underlying oHCM condition is a valid option (eg, incase of prior i ntolerance or contra -indication to β-blockers). In such cases, there should be no plan to initiate treatment (with β -blocker, verapamil , or diltiazem ) after randomization in the study.

Participants will subsequently be seen at Week 6 and Week 12 for repeat evaluation. Blinded assessments including trough PK, and TTE measures of LVEF and LVOT gradient with Valsalva will be performed to guide dose adjustment via the IXRS. At Week 8 and Week 14, the dose will be adjusted (dose increase, dose decrease, dose remain unchanged) based upon results of Week 6 and Week 12 assessments, respectively , as specified in Section 7.3.1. For added safety, a Week 8 blood sample will be drawn to determine trough plasma PK. If PK is greater than 700 and less than 1000 ng/mL, then an unscheduled visit will be arranged 2 weeks later to reduce dose as specified in Section 7.3.3. At any time if PK plasma concentration ≥ 1000 ng/mL, then study drug will be temporarily discontinued. After Week 14, there are no additional scheduled dose titration s. Blinded assessments at Weeks 18, 22, and 26 can inform dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of study drug based on predefined criteria detailed in Section 7.3.2. Whenever a mavacamten dose is decreased, the participant will continue on the reduced dose to the EOT (Week 30) unless further safety concerns or intolerability arise. At Week 30/EOT, participants will comple te post- exercise TTE (between Week 26 and Week 30) and CPET (at Week 30). For any participants permanently discontinuing treatment prior to Week 30, an early termination (ET) visit should be conducted as soon as possible, including CPET and post- exercise TTE. Part icipants with ET will also be encouraged to complete all remaining study visits and assessments, including Week 30 (see Section 10.1.4). Post-treatment follow -up period (Week 30 /EOT to Week 38/end of study [EOS]): After the end of the double- blind treatment period (W eek 30), participants will be contacted by phone at Week 34 and return at Week 38 for an EOS visit. At the EOS visit, baseline rest ing assessments will be repeated. This posttreatment follow -up period applies only to participants who are receiving study drug after Week 22. Description of Patient -reported Outcomes PRO assessments will be completed on an e lectronic device provided to each participant during the Screening period (see Sections 9.1.3 and 9.1.4) . Data from the se PRO assessments will not be made avai lable to the inv estigators and other site personnel throughout the study. Participants will first be informed of this when they fill out the consent form that is required in order to participate in the trial. The form will include information explaining that the PRO information gathered via the device is not shared with their healthcare provider and they should therefore report any concerning sympto ms directly to their physician. P articipants will then be reminded of this each time they go to complete the assessment on their handheld device. When the participant logs onto their handheld device to complete the assessments, a message screen will be shown advising the participant to consult their healthcare provider if they have any concerning symptoms. The participant will no t be able to continue with the PRO assessments until they have acknowledged th at they have read this message. The exact message text states:"

The SC will be composed of members who are experts in cardiovascular disease, including HCM, with relevant clinical and methodological expertise. The SC will include 2 co-chairs, approximately 5 members, and Sponsor representatives. All SC members will remain blinded to treatment assignments (unless unblinding is required for participant safety) until the conclusion of the study. Specific respo nsibilities will be further described in the SC Charter. 4.2.2 Clinical Event Adjudication Committee The Clinical Event Adjudication Committee (C EAC) will be assembled to ensure quality and timely event reporting. The role of the C EAC will be to adjudicate a pre -specified set of safety endpoints, including major adverse cardiac events (eg, death, stroke, acute myocardial infarction) as listed in Section 9.3. The committee will be composed of experienced cardiovascular specialists and experts who will review all pertinent blinded, clinical , and diagnostic source documentation and independently adjudicate any cardiovascular ( CV) events. The processes to identify coded events for submission to the committee members for adjudication and their completion of electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be described in a separate CEAC Charter . The C EAC ful l committee will meet quarterly or as needed to review discordant cases and conduct their responsibilities as outlined in the C EAC Charter. The C EAC Charter and associated data management plan will also describe how the communication of information to and from the CEAC will be handled to ensure timely delivery of adjudicated data for Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) meetings. 4.2.3 Independent Data Monitoring Committee An IDMC will meet at regular intervals to review ongoing study data. The role of the IDMC will be to act in an advisory capacity to the Sponsor with respect to safeguarding the interest of study participants, assessing interim unblinded safety data, and advising the Sponsor on important emerging study conduct issues. The IDMC may formulate recommendations in relation to the evaluation procedures and methodologies being employed to survey and detect potential safety signals. Meeting frequency, membership, and conduct will be described in the IDMC Charter. 5 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION 5.1 General Study Population and Clinical Sites Approximately 220 participant s with symptomatic oHCM are expected to enroll in this study at up to ~90 clinical site s worldwide. 5.2 Inclusion Criteria Each participant must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study. 1.

Randomization will be stratified according to NYHA functional classification (II or III), current treatment with β -blocker (yes or no), type of ergometer (treadmill or exercise bicycle) , and consent for the CMR substudy (yes or no). 6.2 Study Blinding Participants will be randomized to receive mavacamten or matching placebo in a double-blind manner such that the principal investigator , site staff including the pharmacist, and the participant will not know which study drug is being administered. In addition, the Sponsor, the central and core laboratories, and clinical site monitors will be blinded to assigned treatment. Mavacamten and matching placebo will be identical in appearance in order to preserve the blind. Study drug ( mavacamten or matching placebo) will be labeled with a unique identifying number that will be assigned to a participant through the IXRS. Blinded results (ie , echocardiography results , and PK data) will be transferred to the IXRS by the respective core laborator ies in order to perform dose adjustments and dose discontinuations in a blinded manner. In addition, sham dose discontinuation and unscheduled visits , if necessary, will be performed in the placebo arm in order to keep the blind. However, site personnel who pe rform specific tasks such as reviewing echocardiograms for safety may be unblinded (see Study Reference Manual ). In the case of LVEF ≤30% the investigator will be notified as described in Section 7.3.3. The pharmacovigilance team will be unblinded for suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) reporting. The IDMC may also be unblinded to treatment allocation and all safety and efficacy data. 6.3 Methods for Unb linding All efforts should be made to keep participant s blinded to treatment assignment. However, participant s may be unblinded to treatment assignment upon request from the investigator and agreement by the Sponsor if knowledge of treatment assignment will impact future treatments or clinical care of the participant. Unblinding by the investigator independently of the Sponsor also may occur if an AE or toxicity nece ssitates identification of the medication for the welfare of the participant . Please refer to the Suvoda Intera ctive Web Response System Manual for the unblinding process and contact information. 7 STUDY TREATMENT Study drug is defined as mavacamten (MYK-461) or placebo. All randomized study participants will receive either mavacamten or placebo in a double- blinded manner."

The study drug presentation is size 2 , blue opaque capsules printed with a yellow band on the body and black band on the cap. Each capsule contains white to off-white powder. The active capsules are supplied in 4 strengths : 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg. Mavacamten active and placebo capsules have been manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP ) regulations. They will be supplied in high-density polyethylene bottles with induction seals and child- resistant caps at 30 count per bot tle. All study drug will be labeled according to applicable local regulatory guidelines. The mavacamten active and placebo capsules must be stored at 2°C to 25°C (36°F to 77°F) in the packaging supplied by MyoKardia. Study medication at the investigational site will be stored in a secure area with access limited to authorized study personnel. Study drug will be supplied to participants in 30-count high-density polyethylene bottles that are appropriately l abeled. Refer to Table 1 for the complete schedule of study drug administration. Participants will take study drug as directed by the study investigator . The participant s will be instructed to store the study drug capsules and bottles in a cool, dry place. Study drug should be taken with approximately 8 ounces (48 tablespoons or ~235 mL ) of water. 7.2 Treatment Compliance Compliance with study drug will be monitored by capsule count at all study visits. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details. Participant s should be instructed to take the study drug at approxima tely the same time every day (±8 hours). If the dosing window is missed, the participant should not take study drug that day. Participants should never receive 2 doses of study drug within a n 8-hour period. On study visit days, participant s should wait to take study drug until after they reach the clinic and have a PK blood sample taken as indicat ed in the schedule of study procedures (Table 1 ). Any concomitant medication may to be administered prior to all exercise testing . 7.3 Dose Adjustment s 7.3.1 Blinded Dose Adjustments During Double- blind Treatment Period 7.3.1.1 Dose Titration Period ( Day 1 to Week 14) The double- blind treatment period will include a two -step dose titration scheme at Week 8 and Week 14 designed to achieve safe and effective dosing for each participant based on their own PK/PD response parameters ( Figure 1 and Table 3). In this study, the starting dose of study drug is mavacamten 5 mg or matching placebo QD, and each participant will receive this dose of study drug from D ay 1 through Week 8 unless a"
47,page_47,"MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-005 MyoKardia, Inc. Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 47 Confidential PK/PD criterion is met at Week 4, in which case the dose will be reduced at Week 6 (Table 3). At Weeks 8 and 14, participants will undergo dose adjustment ( dose increase, dose decrease, or dose unchanged) based on their results from PK/PD assessments at Week 6 and Week 12, respectively (Table 3). Note tha t Table 3 is provided for IXRS programming. S ites and investigators will not be actively adjusting doses. All d ose adjustment s will occur in a double- blind manner via IXRS, and all participants, whether recei ving mavacamten or matching placebo, will undergo assessments that could lead to a blinded dose adjustment. However, note that participants who are on placebo will remain on placebo (in blinded fashion) unless the participant has a temporary discontinuation as described in Section 7.3.2 or a permanent treatment discontinuation as described in Section 7.3.3 and Section 10.1.3. For added safety, a Week 8 blood s ample will be drawn to deter mine trough plasma PK . If PK is greater than 700 and less than 1000 ng/mL, then an unscheduled visit will be arranged 2 weeks later to reduce dose (see Table 3). Dose reduction will occur via IXRS. To avoid potential bias the IXRS will randomly select a participant from the placebo arm to undergo an unscheduled follow- up visit (see also Section 6.2). If the mavacamten dose is decreased at any time during the study, the n the participant will continue on the reduced dose to the EOT (Week 30) unless safety concerns or intolerability arise requiring further dose reduction or dose discontinuation. Based on PK modeling informed by prior mavacamten clinical studies, and depending on the demographics of enrolled patients, it is estimated that the following percentages of participants will reach the target steady -state concentrations for the following doses: 2.5 mg (< 1%), 5 mg (5–20%), 10 mg (40–50%), and 15 mg (30–55%). If the PK/PD criteria for down -titration are met, then dose reduction will be implemented as follows:"

Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 49 Confidential 7.3.1.2 Dosing Period (Week 14 to Week 30) After the second dose titration at Week 14, there are no further up- titrations; the intent is for dose to remain unchanged unless for safety or other reasons for premature discontinuation (see Section 7.3.2 and Section 10.1 ) . After Week 14, participants will return to the clinical site for monitoring at scheduled 4- week intervals (Weeks 18, 22, 26, and 30 [±7 days]). At each visit, AEs, concomitant medications, and symptoms will be assessed , and ECG, plasma PK, and TTE will be perform ed for ongoing safety monitoring. Compliance with study drug will also be monitored by capsule count at each visit. If PK/PD criteria are met, then an unscheduled visit 2 weeks later will be required to reduce dose as s hown in Table 4 . . 7.3.2 Blinded Dose Adjustment Leading to Temporary Discontinuation In addition to the blinded dose adjustments described above (which are not preceded by dose discontinuation), at any time (T) during the treatment period, dosing may be tempor arily discontinued in the case of exaggerated pharmacologic effect (systolic dysfunction), higher than expected plasma concentration, or excessive QTcF prolongation as described below. If participant has a resting LVEF <50 %, plasma drug concentration ≥1000 ng/mL, or QTcF stopping criteria described below, as determined by the echocardiography central laboratory, PK analysis laboratory, or ECG core laboratory, respectively, it will be communicated to the investigator and Sponsor that a criterion for temporar y discontinuation has been met. Upon receipt of this information, the study site/investigator will contact the participant by telephone and instruct the participant to discontinue study drug and to return for an onsite visit within 2 to 4 weeks (T+ 2 to 4 weeks) . This could correspond to a scheduled or unscheduled visit. Note that to avoid potential bias the IXRS will randomly select participant (s) from the placebo arm to undergo an unscheduled follow-up visit (see also Section 6.2 ) ."
50,page_50,"MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-005 MyoKardia, Inc. Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 50 Confidential Criteria for temporary discontinuation due to QTcF prolongation are as follows and depend on QRS width as determined by the ECG core laboratory : • If QRS is narrow (<120 ms), then temporary discontinuation criteria are the smaller of: a 15% increase from baseline QTcF OR QTcF ≥520 ms • If QRS is wide (≥120 ms), then temporary discontinuation criter ia are the smaller of : a 15% increase from baseline QTcF OR QTcF ≥550 ms At the follow -up visit ( T+2 to 4 weeks), ECG, plasma PK , and TTE will be repeated and another unscheduled visit will be planned for 2 weeks later (T+4 to 6 weeks) . If LVEF ≥ 50% AND plasma drug concentration <1000 ng/mL AND QTcF duration is below programmed discontinuation rules , then the study drug will be restarted at a lower dose (at T+ 6 weeks) for remainder of the study as follows (previous dose → restart dose): • Placebo → placebo • 2.5 mg → placebo • 5 mg → 2.5 mg • 10 mg → 5 mg • 15 mg → 10 mg If LVEF, plasma d rug concentration and/or QTcF persist out of range at the follow-up visit, then study drug will be switched permanently to placebo. 7.3.3 Management of Double- blind Treatment in the Case of LVEF ≤30% at Study S ite Results of TTE performed by study site sonographers at each scheduled visit following randomization should be kept blinded to the investigator and other study site personnel. An exception may occur if LVEF ≤ 30% is measured at the site. Under these circumstances, the sonographer should re view and re- measure the findings with a t least one other non-study professional qualified in echocardiography assessment who is not the investigator ( eg, echo laboratory director, other experienced sonographer or non- study cardiologist). I f the result is confirmed (LVEF ≤ 30%), then the investigator will be immediately notified and study drug will be discontinued. Low LVEF ≤ 30%, as measured by local site, is one of the criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation ( Section 10.1.3), as this finding will lead to Investigator being unblinded. It should be subsequently managed as described in Section 10.1.4."

Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 51 Confidential 7.3.4 Management of Double- blind Treatment in the Case of New or Worsening Heart Failure If a participant experiences heart failure related to systolic dysfunction, no further study drug should be administered and administration of therapeutic doses of a β -adrenergic agonist (eg, 5 to 10 µg/kg/min dobutamine infusion) should be considered. Additional supportive measures, eg, IV volume supplementation and/or the use of arterial vasoconstri ctor agents (α-adrenergic agonists) should complement the use of a β -adrenergic agonist. Aside from this specific advice regarding the role of a β -adrenergic agonist, appropriate care will be determined by the treating medical personnel. New or worsening heart failure associated with systolic dysfunction is one of the criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation ( Section 10.1.3) and should be subsequently managed as described in Section 10.1.4. 7.4 Hepatotoxicity Stopping and Rechallenge Rules Participant s with abnormal hepatic laboratory values (eg , alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ], aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ], alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ], total bilirubin [ TBL ], or international normalized ratio or signs/symptoms of hepatitis may meet the criteria for withholding of study medication or other protocol-required therapies. Withholding is either permanent or conditional depending on the clinical circumstances discussed below (as specified in the United States (U S) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Indus try–Drug Induced Live r Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation , July 2009). 7.4.1 Criteria for Permanent Withholding of Study Drug Due to Potential Hepatotoxicity Study drug should be discontinued permanently and the participant should be followed according to the recommendations in Appendix 3 for possible drug-induced liver injury (DILI), if all the criteria below are met: • TBL > 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or international normalized ratio >1.5 • AND i ncreased AST or ALT , if the b aseline value was <UL N and AST or ALT elevation is >3 × ULN • AND no other cause for the combination of laboratory abnorm alities is immediately apparent.

If such signs or symptoms are coupl ed with ALT or AST elevations >3× ULN, study medication should be withheld • OR: TBL > 3× ULN at any time OR: ALP >8× ULN at any time Study drug should be withheld pending an investigation into alternative causes of DILI. If study drug is withheld, the participant should be followed according to recommendations in Appendix 3 for possible DILI. Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause, such as acute hepatitis B infection, is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline ( Section 7.4.3 ). 7.4.3 Criteria for Rechallenge of Study Drug After Potential Hepatotoxicity The decision to rechallenge the participant should be discussed and unanimously agreed by the investigator and Sponsor."

Participants who clearly meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation (as described in Section 7.4.1 ) should never be rechallenged. 7.5 Overdose An overdose is defined as taking more capsules of study drug than directed. An overdose may be suspected by the investigator or spontaneously reported by the participant. An over dose may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In the event of suspected overdose, the investigator should contact the medical monitor. No further double-blind treatment should be administered. The participant should be closely monitored clinically for AEs/SAEs, with supportive measures undertaken as clinica lly indicated.

Safety testing in other mammalian species has demonstrated that dose - limiting toxicity is related to exagge rated pharmacologic effect and not to off- target adverse effects. For overdose, see Section 7.5 . 8.2 Pregnancy 8.2.1 Avoidance of Pregnancy Women of childbearing potential must use appropriate methods of birth control as listed in Section 8.2.2. Women of nonchildbearing potential are defined as women who are permanently (surgically) sterilized or are postmenopausal.

Permanent sterilization includes hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and/or documented bilateral tubal occlusion at least 6 months prior to Screening. Femal es are considered postmenopausal if they have had amenorrhea for at least 1 year or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments and follicle stimulating hormone levels (FSH) are in the postmenopausal range. Male partners must also use a contraceptive (eg, barrier, condom or vasectomy) 8.2.3 Reporting and Follow- up of Pregnancies All pregnancies in female participants and female partners of male participant s receiving at least 1 dose of study drug must be reported if they occur anytime from first dose to 3 months after the last dose of study drug. The investigator is responsible for informing MyoKardia within 24 hours of knowledge of the pregnancy even if no AE has occurred . The participant will be asked to provide information on the outcome of the pregnancy, including premature termination. Spontaneous miscarriage and congenital abnor malities will be reported as SAE s. 9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar and comply with the content of this section. The following describes the study procedures to be performed during the study. Additional details are provided in Table 1 and Table 2 of this document. When several assessments are to be conducted at the same time point , the preferred order of assessments is ECG, vital signs, PK , and then TTE all prior to study drug dosing. The o rder of assessments may vary slightly at specific time point s (eg , additional 1-hour postdose PK sampling on Day 1 and Week 30/EOT ) to facilitate the most contemporaneous performance of the required assessments. Unscheduled or additional safety assessments may be performed if necessary, in the opinion of the investigator. Whenever possible discussion with the medical monitor is encouraged. For assessments that require the participant s to be in a semi -recumbent or supine position, assessmen ts should be conducted with participant s in the same position at all time points."

Safety assessments include medical history, physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, observed and participant - reported AEs , pregnancy testing , and safety laboratory results. Any abnormal findings judged by t he investigator to be clinically important will be recorded as an AE. The following safety endpoints will be adjudicated by the CEAC : D eath, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, all hospitalization s (CV and non - CV) , heart failure (HF) events (includes HF hospitalizations and urgent emergency room (ER)/outpatient (OP) visits for HF) , atrial fibrillation /flutter (new from screening) , ICD therapy , resuscitated cardiac arrest, ventricular tachy arrhythmias ( includes ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) ; also any Torsades de Pointe identified during CEAC review ) . 9.3.1 Medical History A complete medical history will be recorded at the Screening visit, which will include evaluation (past or present) of the following: general, head and neck, eye s, ears, nose, throat, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, gynecological/urogenital, musculoskeletal/extremities, skin, neurological/psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic, hematologic/lymphatic, allergies/drug sensitivities, past su rgeries, substance abuse , or any other diseases or disorders as well as participation in clinical studies (study medication and/or device or other therapy ). 9.3.2 Physical Examination A t selected v isits , a complete physical examination will be conducted including a neurological examination (gross motor and deep tendon reflexes) , height (Screening only) and weight , and assessment of the following: general appearance, skin, head and neck, mouth, lymph nodes, thyroid, abdomen, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular , and respiratory systems. At all other visits, an abbreviated cardiopulmonary physical examination will be conducted, with other systems assessed as directed by interval history. Height (cm) and body weight (kg) will be measured at Screening , and body mas s index (kg/m 2 ) will be calculated. Participant s will be required to remove their shoes and wear clothing as specified by the clinical site. Body w eight will be captured in clinic at Screening and Week 30 . 9.3.3 12 - l ead ECG 12 - lead ECG evaluations will be performed after 10 minutes of rest at Screening and at all onsite study visits except for the Day 1, Week 8 and 14 visits .

All ECG data will be sent to a central cardiac labora tory and transmitted to IXRS . The investigator may perform 12- lead ECG safety assessments if he/she considers it is required for any other safety reason. These assessments should be recorded as an unscheduled assessment. 9.3.4 Cardiac Monitoring Device At 3 time points during the study, participants will wear a small device to collect continuous HR and rhythm data for approximately 48 hours ( Table 1). The monitoring device uses surface electrodes, internal electronics to capture a continuous ECG waveform, removable memory card to store data over 48 hours, and a battery to power the device (see manual) . Following a period of data collection, the memory card will be transported to a core laboratory where the continuous ECG waveforms will be uploaded for analysis. The analysis will provide full disclosure capabilities for H R and heart rhythm over the period during which the device was properly applied and functioning. The device will be used to explore the pattern of HR and heart rhythm before and during treatment with study drug. 9.3.5 Vital Signs Vital signs are to be assessed at each onsite study visit except the Week 8 and 14 visits. At Screening, ET, Week 30/EOT, and Week 38, complete vital signs including temperature, HR, respiratory rate, and blood pressure ( BP) will be obtained. At all other visits , only HR and BP are required. Vital sig ns will be obtained with the participant in the same position; BP will be t aken after resting for at least 5 minutes via an automated recorder. At all visits, vital signs will b e taken prior to dosing. Alert values will be flagged. Refer to the Study Laboratory Manual for additional details. 9.3.6 Other Safety Assessments Refer to Section 11 for information on AE assessment and Section 7.6.3 for concomitant therapy assessments. Safety laboratory results will be assessed in an on going manner. A central safety laboratory will be used. Laboratory parameters are provided in Appendix 1. Serum pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening for all females of childbearing potential. In addition, urine pregnancy testing either in clinic or at home will be conducted every 4–6 weeks throughout the study. Confirmatory s erum testing will be performed if any urine test is positive."

Approximately 80 participants will be enrolled (~40 per treatment group). Participants will undergo CMR up to 5 days prior to Day 1 and up to 5 days prior to Week 30. Refer to the CMR S ubstudy Reference Manual for additional details. 9.5 Participant Restrictions D uring t his Study The following restrictions apply for the specified times during the study period. If a participant does not comply with these restrictions or tests positive in any laboratory tests (eg, drug, alcohol, pregnancy), he or she may be excluded or withdrawn from the study. • Starting 72 hours prior to the first dose until the final follow -up visit, participant s should not engage in unaccustomed intensive exercise except during protocol- specified exercise tests • Starting at Screening, participants will be required to abstain from blood or plasma donation until 3 mon ths after the final study visit • Starting on Day 1 until the final follow-up visit, participant s will be asked to abstain from grapefruit or grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, and quinine ( eg, tonic water) Contraception requirements are discussed in Section 8.2. 9.6 Study Procedures by Visit Study procedures are presented by visit in Table 1 and Table 2. Every effort should be made to avoid protocol deviations. At the investigator’s discretion, unscheduled visits may be conducted for the assessment of AEs, new or worsening symptoms, physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory tests, ECGs, and/or TTEs . The investigator should make best effort to contact the medical monitor before conducting an unblinded TTE if possible. Refer also to Section 7.3.2. All information collected from unscheduled visits will be recorded on the eCRF and included in the clinical database. 9.7 Visit Scheduling All visits should occur within the visit window (± 7 days). If an evaluation is missed, reschedule and perform it as close as possible to the original date."

Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 64 Confidential 10 TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION AND WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY In general, every effort should be made to keep a participant on double- blind treatment for as long as possible during the study unless a safety concern arises. Treatment Discontinuation may either be temporary or permanent and if permanent, the degree to which a study participant withdraws can vary. Each of these circumstances are described below. 10.1 Treatmen t Discontinuation 10.1.1 Temporary Treatment Discontinuation Temporary treatment discontinuation • Will be implemented when a pre defined safety threshold has been met (see Section 7.3.2) • May be considered by the investigator in the case of an AE/SAE or for another reason As a general rule, any discontinuation of study drug should be initially considered temporary unless permanent treatment discontinuation is mandated by the protocol (see Section 10.1.3). If a temporary treatment discontinuation was caused by a safety threshold being met, blinded treatment will be resumed approximately 4 to 6 weeks later, either at a lower dose or with permanent switch to placebo, transmi tted via IXRS (see Section 7.3.2). In the case of discontinuation for an AE/SAE, the investigator should make a best effort to resume study drug as soon as practically possible, assuming there are no safety concerns (ie, the investigator is satisfied that in his or her medical judg ment , the study drug is unlikely to be responsible for the event concerned). All temporary treatment interruptions should be recorded in the eCRF. 10.1.2 Permanent Treatment Discontinuation After a tempora ry treatment discontinuation, if a safety concern has not resolved or stabilized or the investigator suspects that study drug is responsible, the investigator may consider a treatment discontinuation as permanent. The investigator should make best effort t o contact the monitoring team before considering any treatment discontinuation as permanent. Permanent treatment discontinuation should be considered a last resort. Every effort should be made to collect important safety data if feasible and the study participant agrees. In all cases, participants should be encouraged to discuss stopping study drug with the investigator or the investigator’s designee so that questions can be addressed, concomitant therapy can be adjusted if needed, and a follow- up assessmen t be arranged. Any permanent treatment discontinuation should be recorded in the eCRF."
65,page_65,"MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-005 MyoKardia, Inc. Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 65 Confidential 10.1.3 Criteria for Permanent Treatment Discontinuation The following reasons will lead to permanent treatment discontinuation: • Pregnancy • LVEF ≤ 30% as determined by local site • New or worsening heart failure associated with systolic dysfunction • Any breaking of the study blind requested by the investigator • Continued administration of study drug is considered by the investigator to be detrimental to the participant’s safety or well- being • If all the criteria are met for possible DILI (see Section 7.4.1 ) • The participant requests to discontinue study drug • The Sponsor requests that the participant permanently discontinues study drug 10.1.4 Management of Participants After Permanent Treatment Discont inuation If a participant permanently discontinues treatment prior to Week 30 /EOT , the participant will be asked to undergo an ET visit as soon as possible after stopping study drug, using the procedure normally planned for the EOT visit, including post- exercise echocardiogram and CPET. Subsequently, every effort will be made to have the participant return to the site at the times corresponding to his or her remaining scheduled visits (ie, until the end of the study and including final CPET study at Week 30), or through the recovery or stabilization of any AE to be followed as specified in this protocol, whichever comes last. Under circumstances of permanent treatment discontinuation, study participants can: • Withdraw from treatment (permanent treatment discontinuation) and agree to participate in ET, EOT, and EOS visits . Participants are eligible to complete ET, EOT , and EOS visits only if they have received 22 weeks or more of study drug. If they have received less than 22 weeks of study drug, they are eligible to participate in the ET visit and visits up to EOT (week 30) but not beyond week 30. • Withdraw from treatment (permanent treatment discontinuation) and agree to participate in the ET and EOT visit . This is the preferred follow -up for partici pants who have received less than 22 weeks of study drug. • Withdraw from treatment (permanent treatment discontinuation) and agree to participate in the ET visit . This is the preferred follow -up for participants who have received study drug, regardless of treatment duration and who do not wish to be followed beyond ET visit."
66,page_66,"MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-005 MyoKardia, Inc. Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 66 Confidential • Withdraw from treatment (permanent treatment discontinuation) and all follow -up (see Section 10.2 ) In case of difficulties to comply and return for all study visits until Week 30, every effor t should be made to have the participant return for as many study visits as possible, especially the Week 30 visit with final CPET . For participants who do not withdraw consent for ongoing study participation but fail to return to the site, the investigato r should make every effort to contact the participant (eg, contacting participant’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, particularly vital status. Attempts to contac t such participants must be documented in the participant’s records (eg, number of attempts and dates of attempted telephone contact and receipt for sending a registered letter). Then participants will receive a phone call from the investigator at Week 38 for vital status assessment. 10.2 Withdrawal from Study 10.2.1 Withdrawal of Consent for Ongoing Study Participation Participants may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and for any reason. Withdrawal of consent for treatment (permanent treatment discontinuation) described above should be distinguished from withdrawal of c onsent for ongoing study participation with scheduled visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-participant contact follow -up (eg, medical records check). Participants who withdraw from the study should be explicitly asked about the reason and the contribution of any possible AE(s) that led to their decision, and any AE information elicited should be documented. The participant may withdraw consent verbally or in writing. If the consent is withdrawn verbally, the site should document it appropriately. P referably the participant should withdraw consent in writing and, if the participant or the participant’s representative refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the participant’s failure to withdraw consent in writing. All study withdrawals should be recorded by the investigator in the appropriate eCRF and in the participant’s medical records when considered as confirmed. The date of the withdrawal and the reason should be documented. The Statistical Analysis P lan (SAP) will specify how these participants lost to follow -up will be considered for their primary endpoints. Participants who have withdrawn from the study cannot be re -randomized (treated) in the study. Their inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused."

If a participant withdraws after randomization and before dosing, that participant may be replaced. The replacement participant will undergo the same stratification procedure as a new participant; no special replacement rando mization schedule is necessary. 11 EVALUATION, REC ORDING, AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS 11.1 Definitions 11.1.1 Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, or the deterioration of a pre existing medical condition (other than the condition that is being treated by the study) associated with the use of a study medication in humans, whether or not it is considered related to the study medication. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver, clinically important or abnormal laborator y result ), participant -reported symptom ( eg, nausea, chest pain), or evidence of any disease activity temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time after the participant has signed informed consent, including run- in or washout periods, even if no specific treatment has been administered. Preexisting medical conditions (other than natural progression of the disease being studied) judged by the investigator or participant to have worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character during the protocol -specified AE reporting period will be reported as AEs or SAEs as appropriate. Imaging- based assessments of a decrease in contractility are not considered AE s unless associated with symptoms or signs of clinical concern on the part of the investigator. Such events should be categorized as an AE defined in terms of those symptoms or signs. An AE or SAE can also be a complication that occurs as a result of protocol -mandated procedures ( eg, invasive procedures such as biopsies). For MyoKardia to collect additional information about clinically important laboratory results or diagnostic tests ( eg, blood, ECG, imaging), at a minimum, the following abnormalities should be captured on the AE eCRF: • Any test result that meets the definition of an SAE • Any clinically important test abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity is worsening or is new ( eg, >3× deviation from the upper or lower limit of the analyzing laboratory reference range, or as otherwise specified in the protocol)"
68,page_68,"MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-005 MyoKardia, Inc. Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 68 Confidential • Any test abnormality that require s the participant to have study medication discontinued or interrupted or in the clinic al judgment of the investigator • Any test abnormality that requires the participant to receive specific corrective therapy, close observation, more frequent follow -up assessment, or f urther diagnostic investigation The term AE is used generally to include any AE whether serious or nonserious. 11.1.1.1 Events Not Meeting the Definition of Adverse Event Events that do not meet the definition of AE include the following: • Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease under study, un less judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition • The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the p articipant’s condition • Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that led to the procedure is the AE • Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital) • Antic ipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen • Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met: o The subject has not experienced an AE . o The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the study when elective surgery or procedure became necessary because of the expected normal progression of the disease . 11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event An SAE is an AE th at fulfill s one or more of the following criteria in the opinion of the investigator or MyoKardia: • Results in death • Is immediately life -threatening (places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred) • Requires in -participant hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization"
69,page_69,"MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-005 MyoKardia, Inc. Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 69 Confidential • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • Results in a congeni tal abnormality or birth defect • Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 11.2 Adverse Event Reporting and Descriptions 11.2.1 Reporting Period and Follow -up AEs will be assessed from the time the participant provides informed consent through the duration of the study. Pre existing medical conditions that increase in severity from the first dose of study medication will be reported as AEs. Pre existing medical conditions that increase in severity after providing informed consent but before the first dose of study medication w ill be reported as medical history. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant ’s last visit in the study are followed by the investigator until resolved or stabilized and are considered irreversible, or the participant has died. MyoKardia retains the r ight to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 11.2.2 Adverse Event Attributes The following attributes will be recorded for each AE. Additional attributes may be col lected as req uired by MyoKardia. 11.2.2.1 Description All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study personnel “Have you had any health problems since you were last asked?” , or revealed by observation will be collec ted and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms ( eg, anemia, not low hemoglobin). However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. Death is an outcome and not the name of the event. In this situation, the event that led to the death is the name of the event. If the cause of death is unknown, “found dead” is an acceptable description."

Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 70 Confidential 11.2.2.2 Start Date/Time and Stop Date/Time The date (and time during the period of residency) that the AE started and the date (and time during the period of residency) that the event ended will be recorded. For events that continue for long periods of time, recording the end date as the day the event stabilized will be acceptable. 11.2.2.3 Relationship to Study Treatment (Suspected Adverse Reactions) The investigator should assess causality by answering either “y es” or “n o” to the question “I s there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the IMP /study medication?” 11.2.2.4 Intensity Record the intensity or severity of the event using the following guide: • Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easi ly tolerated) • Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities) • Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities) • Life-threatening (urgent intervention indicated) • Fatal (event le d to death) 11.2.2.5 Seriousness Record SAE criteria described in Section 11.1.2 or indicate that the AE is not serious. It is important to distinguish between category (AE vs SAE) and intensity (mild, moderate, or severe) of AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity ( Section 11.2.2.4), whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 11.1.2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea but not an SAE. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE . 11.2.2.6 Outcome Record the outcome of the event based on the options provided on the eCRF. 11.3 Reporting and Evaluation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs occurring during the treatment -emergent period (defined as the period from the first administration of study drug to 56 days [5 half- lives] after the last administration of study drug [corresponding to Week 30] ) regardless of causality will be reported by the"

Deaths and SAEs occurring after the treatment- emergent period and considered related to study medication or study procedure must also be reported. SAE reporting instructions are provided in the Study Reference Manual . SUSARs are SAEs that qualify for mandatory expedited reporting to regulatory authorities when the SAE is suspected to be caused by the study treatment and is considered unexpected (ie, not defined as expected in the current IB, clinical protocol, or approved labeling for marketed products). In this case, MyoKardia or designee will report to the relevant regulatory authority(ies) and forward a formal noti fication describing the SUSAR to investigators, according to regulatory requirement. Each investigator must then notify his/her ethics committee ( EC) of the SUSAR as required by local regulatory authorities and in accordance with their EC policy. 11.4 Reporting Adverse Events of Special Interest Overdose, pregnancy, and LVEF ≤30% as determined by local site read echocardiogram are considered Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI). If AESI occurs, this must be reported within 24 hours to MyoKardia. 12 STATISTICAL METHODS 12.1 Determination of Sample Size Approximately 220 participants will be randomized, with 110 participants in each of the 2 groups. Randomization will be stratified for NYHA functional classification (II or III), current treatment with β -blocker (yes/no), type of ergometer (treadmill or exercise bicycle), and consent for the CMR substudy (yes or no). The sample size should provide adequate power to determine the superiority of mavacamten in improving pVO 2 and NYHA functional class relative to placebo (see Section 12.2.1). The power calculation is derived assuming a true clinically meaningful difference of 25% between mavacamten and placebo participant s in achieving the clinical response. Based on the MYK -461-004 PIONEER- HCM phase 2 study, 50% of the participant s receiving mavacamten met the clinical responder definition by the end of 12- week treatment period. Assuming the same percentage of partici pants in the active treatment arm and 25% in placebo arm will achieve the clinical response at the end of 30-week dosing period in the current study, the proposed sample size of 110 participant s per arm will provide 96% power at two -sided 5% statistical si gnificance level. Participant s who terminate early or cannot be assessed for the clinical response at the end of 30 -week dosing period will be considered as non-responders. 12.2 Study Endpoints The study design is a randomized two-arm double- blinded trial, and the conceptual analytical approach is to compare the mavacamten treatment arm with the placebo arm."

Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 95 Confidential APPENDIX 3 POTENTIAL DRUG -INDUCED LIVER INJURY REPORTING AND ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS REPORTING To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ), cases of concurrent asparta te/alanine (AST/ALT) and total bilirubin ( TBL ) elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 7.4 (3 × upper limit of normal [ ULN ] for AST/ALT and 2 × ULN for TBL in participant s with no underlying liver disease and eligibility criteria requiring normal liver function at baseline) require the following: • The event is to be reported to MyoKardia as an SAE within 24 hours of discovery or notification of the event ( ie, before additional etiologic investigations have been concluded) The appropriate case report form ( CRF ) (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captures information necessary to facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver ab normalities are to be completed and sent to MyoKardia. Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as SAEs if they meet the criteria for an SAE defined in Section 11.1.2. Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation All participants in whom investigational product(s) or protocol- required therapies is/are withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI o r who experience AST/ALT elevations > 3 × ULN are to undergo a period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the participant’s baseline levels. Assessments that are to be performed during this period include the following: • Repeat liver chemistries within 24 -48 hours (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ], TBL); in cases of TBL > 2 × ULN or AST/ALT much greater than 3 × ULN, retesting is to be performed within 24 hours ◦ For participant s that are far away from the trial site, it may be difficult for the participant s to return to the trial site promptly. In this case, the participant s should be retested locally, but normal laboratory ranges should be recorded, results should be made available to trial investigators immediately, and the data should be included in the case reports Participants are to be monitored at least twice weekly; testing frequency may decrease to once per week or less if laboratory abnormalities stabilize or the investigational product(s) or protocol-required therapies have been discontinued AND the participant is asympt omatic . • Obtain prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, fractionated bilirubin, and any other potentially relevant laboratory evaluations of liver function or disease • Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess for eosinophilia"

Amendment 5: 04 October 2019 Page 96 Confidential • Obtain appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic ( PK) analysis if this has not already been collected • Obtain a more detailed history of the following: ◦ Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness ◦ Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents ◦ Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, hypersensitivity-type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and fever ◦ Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs, and special diets ◦ Concomitant medications (including nonprescription medicines and herbal and dietary supplements) • Initiate full viral and autoimmune hepatitis evaluation (serologies for hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, etc.); evaluate for other potential causes of DILI, including but not limited to: nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH), hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy, and biliary tract disease • Obtain gastroenterology or hepatology consult • Perform appropriate liver imaging or biopsy if clinically indicated; strongly consider these tests in cases of concurrent transaminase and TBL elevation as specified in Section 7.4 • Follow the participant until all laboratory abnormalities return to baseline or normal. The “close observation period” is to continue for a minimum of 4 weeks after investigational product(s) or protocol- required therapies discontinuation The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding CRFs."
