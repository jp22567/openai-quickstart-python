3,page_3,"4 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 Synopsis Title Exercise in older women with breast cancer during systemic therapy – a randomized controlled trial . Introduction Although cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly, older cancer patients are underrepresented in clinical trials. Aging itself is associated with limitations in physical function, reduced reserve capacity, a poorer resilience to physiological stressors, and an increased burden of comor bidities . A diagnosis of cancer and its accompanying treatments can lead to numerous symptoms and side effects, physical disability, psychological distress and increased health care needs. The interplay between age -related and cancer -related declines in health increas es vulnerability and the risk of development of short and long -term disability . Research has shown that exercise t raining has several beneficial effects in cancer patients and survivor s both during and after anti -cancer treatment . However, older patients h ave often been underrepresented in these studies, and only few exercise -based intervention studies have specifically focused on older cancer patients . Breast cancer is a malignanc y associated with aging. Research projects that investigate the effect of intervention s that may reduce symptoms, maintain physical function , and optimize QOL are wanted . The TOLCA Breast Cancer Exercise study will be conducted similar to the ongoing PACE -MOBIL -PBL study regarding physical therapy . Design TOLCA Breast Cancer Exercise study is a two -armed 1:1 randomized controlled study in older patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant or first-line palliative systemic t herapy . Target population Older patients with breast cancer who are treated with adjuvant or first-line palliative systemic therapy . Number of Centers and setting Single center. Department of Oncology and Department of Occupational Therapy and Physi otherapy , Herlev and Gentofte Hospital. Objectives To investigate the effect of an exercise -based intervention on physical function and capacity, cancer -related symptoms and side -effects, depression and anxiety, quality of life, body composition, treatment tolerance and toxicity, inflammation, hospital admissions, and survival. Selecti on Criteria Inclusion criteria : • Be operated for primary breast cancer within 12 weeks or • Be diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer . Be treated with adjuvant or first-line palliative therapy defined as chemotherapy ± HER2 directed treatment, ± antihormonal treatment, antihormonal treatment ± HER 2, directed treatment ± CDK 4/6 inhibitor. • Be ≥ 70 years of ag e at the time of signing the informed consent form • Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncolo gy Group (EC OG) performance status score ≤ 2 • Be able to speak and read Dan ish, and to provide a signed informed consent form"
4,page_4,"5 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 Exclusion criteria ; patients with: • Any physical condition that hinder the execution of physical exercise training • Other types of cancer • Documented an d uncontrolled brain metastases that hinder participation in an exercise -based trial, based on the re ferring oncologist’s assessment • Dementia, psychotic disorders, or other cognitive diseases or conditions that hinder written consent • Unstable medical disease or history of serious or concurrent illness; any medical condition that might be aggravated by exercise training or that cannot be controlled, including, but not restricted congestive heart failure (NYHA class II I-IV), unstable angi na pectoris , implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), or myocar dial infarction within 6 months, based on the re ferring oncologist’s assessment In patients with documented bone metastases : • A bone metastatic burden or location that poses a risk of injury in the performance of exercise training, as as sessed by the referring oncologist Study arms Included patients will be randomized 1: 1 to an intervention group and a control group . Patients in the intervention group will receive standard care and a 12 -week exercise -based intervention comprised of: 1. Supervised and group -based exercise training at the hospital setting two times a week. Each session wil l last approximately 60 minutes 2. Home -based walking w ith activity trac ker assessment . Evaluation and goal-setting in relation to activity (step counts) will be conducted once weekly 3. Serving of a protein supplement (protein drink or bar) after each supervised t raining session Patient in the control group will receive standard care . Baseline data and endpoints Baseline data • Demographic and patient -reported data: data on civil status, working status, education, sm oking, alcohol consumption, weight loss before and after cancer diagnosis, and physical activity • Clinical and medical data : diagnosis, treatment, performance status (ECOG) , comorbidity, including Charlson comorbidity score . End-points • Physical function and capacity : 30-second chair stand test (30 s-CST) (primary outcome) , 6-minute -walk -test (6MWT), hand grip s trength (HST) , 6- and 10 -meter gait speed , measured at normal and maximal gait speed (6MGS & 10MGS) and stair climb test (SCT) . • Feasibility measures : recruitment rate, attr ition, retention, and adherence • Patient reported outcomes : patient reported perform ance status (ECOG), EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC -QLQ -C30"
5,page_5,"6 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 & BR23 ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and M.D. And erson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) • Physical activity : step counts, distance, and energy consumption measured with an activity tracker • Treatment tolerance and toxicity : completion of scheduled therapy, dose-reductions, discontinuations, toxicity (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteri a for Adverse Events v 4) • Body measures and composition: weight, height, body mass index (BMI) , and body composition measured by bioimpedance assessment and DXA scans • Inflammatory biomarkers: C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), YKL -40, GDF11 and GDF15 . • Hospital admissions : number s, causes , length of hospitalizations and contact to the Emergency Room (ER) with falls. • Mortality/survival Number of patients / sample size No prior studies have reported the minimal clinically important difference in the 30 s-CST in older pati ents, or in cancer patients . However, based on results from a prior study focusing on patients with osteoarthritis, a clinically i mportant change in the 30 s-CST was set at 2.6 repetitions. Based on results from other studies focusing on patients with advanced cancer , a standard deviat ion (SD) of around 3 in 30 s-CST was reported. To be able to detect a change of 2.6 repetitions in the between group difference at the 12-week assessment, and to obtain a type I error rate of 5% and a p ower of 90%, a sample size of 29 patients per study arm will be needed. To account for an expected dropout rate of approximately 40%, we decided to increase this n umber to a group size of 50 . Hence, a total of 100 patients will be included in the study. Statistical Analysis Feasibilit y measures will be reported as numbers and percentages. Reasons for declining participation will be analyzed descriptively with numbers and percentages of patients declining for various reasons. Baseline characteristics will be calculated for all patients included (total) , and separately for the intervention group and the control group . For all quantitative variables, the median number and interquartile range (IQR) will be calculated, and for nominal variables the number and percentage distribution will be calculated. Results from physical tests, blood test, body measures, and questionnaires will be reported as means a nd standard deviations (SD) or as median and IQR, as appropriate. Change over time in ordinal categorical values will be evaluated by a trend test using logistic regression. In -group and between - group differences in continuous -level data, will be performe d using a repeated measurement analysis . Survival analyses will be conducted with Kaplan -Meier method, competing risk analyses and Cox regression analyses. The significance level of all tests is set a p < 0.05, and analyses will b e carried out in SAS or R by Zoltan Szallasi (DTU ) in collaboration with the study group . Publication of results Positive, negative, or inconclusive results from the TOLCA -Breast Cancer Exercise study will be published in relevant international peer -reviewed journals. Co -authorshi p for the upcoming publications will be offered to members of the project group or other collaborators based on contributions to the current work, and in accordance with the Vancouver recommendations."
6,page_6,"7 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 Potential risks and disadvantages There are a few pote ntial risks and disadvantages for patients in the intervention groups, including exercise injuries and discomfort in performing the exercise program. However, risks and disadvantages are limited. If a patient reports any di scomfort or incidence of injury during the intervention, the safety and further program -continuation for the patient will be discussed in the research group, and in consultation with the patient and the responsible physician. Data on adverse events will be collected systematically through out the intervention period. Body composition will be assessed for all included patients at baseline and after 12 weeks using DXA technology. At each of the two DXA scans patients will be exposed to a small radiation dose of approximately 3 μGY (= 0.003 mSv). Scientific statement The TOLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise study is expected to involve low risk of adverse events and discomfort for patients involved. It is the project group’s assessment that it is necessary to carry out the current research projec t to gain important knowledge abou t the effect and feasibility of exercise -based intervention as a rehabilitative approach to older patients with breast cancer. The project group estimates that the TOLCA -Breast Cancer Exercise intervention will maintain or increase physical function levels, reduce symptoms and side effect, inc rease tolerance to oncological treatment, and improve psychological well -being and QOL in older patients with breast cancer and that the expected benefits of the intervention exceeds t he estimated limited risks for patients involved."

9,page_9,"10 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 1. Introduction Although the risk of cancer increases with age, and the number of older cancer patients is expected to rise i n the coming yea rs (1-4), research on older canc er patients and survivors has been limited (3, 5) . In Denmark, approximately 65% of all cancer s are diagnosed among patients ≥ 65 years of age, and the number of incident canc ers is expected to increase with 30% towards 2030 solely because of the increasing elderly population (6). Before discussing the impact of cancer disease in older individuals, it is necessary to describe the normal aging process and psychosocial factors related to aging. 1.1 The aging process The age at which a person is considered being ‘elderly’ or ‘o lder’ varies in the literature and currently no definitive consensus exists. Age above 65 years has traditionally been chosen as the ‘cut -off’ as it represents t he age of retirement in many Western countries. Aging involves a continuum of changes in function, biological, psychological and social structures that vary depending on individual differences in genetic facto rs. It must be empathized that older people represent a widely heterogeneous group and that chronological age does not accurately describe the capacity , resources and functioning of an older person. In a biological view, a ging involves physiological changes in the organisms that lead to a de cline of biologic al functions and the ability to adapt to metabolic stress. The biological changes involve a decrease in cardiac function and capacity due to r educed muscle strength, vascular stiffness, increased ventricular wall thickness, atherosclerosis , and loss of elasticity of the vessel walls (7). The respiratory tract undergoes structural and functional changes which are often associated with a decrease in lung function, limited regeneration and an enhanced susceptibility to infections and pulmonary diseases (8). Despite large variation among individuals, aging is also as sociated with a decline in kidney function, including a decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which makes drug excretion more problematic (9). In the gastro intestinal tract, age -related physiological changes (e.g. decrease in gastric acid and functiona l absorption , alteration s in gastric motility and gastrointestinal hormones ) may significantly alter the absorption and metabolisms of nutrients and medications , and thereby places older persons at a major disadvantage when they are exposed to weakness or disease (10). The ag ing process typically involves change s in the body composition with an increase in fat mass and a decrease in muscle mass. Evidence suggest s that age -related l oss of muscle mass starts in the fifth decade with an annual rate of up to 1 -2%, and mainly influences the lower body skeletal muscle mass (11, 12) .Loss of muscle mass is accompanied by an even faster deterioration of muscle strength (13).With age, the bones deteriorate in composition, st ructure and function. Increased bone resorption and reduction in bone formation leads to a fall in bone mineral density , and increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures (14). Aging also has an effect on immunity, with evidence indicating that the cell -mediated immunity consistently displays age -related declines in function (15). The reduction of reserve capacity in bone"
10,page_10,"11 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 marrow that occurs with aging deduce s the ability to respond to stressors such as infections or blood loss (15, 16) . Comorbidity, def ined as the occurrence of two or more medically diagnosed diseases, increases with age and heightens the risk of disability and mortality (17, 18) . Furthermore, the use of multiple drugs for multiple diseases, also known as polypharmacy, leads to an increased risk of drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and poor adherence (19). The aging process also entails cognitive and psychosocial changes. Despite significant heterogeneity among older individuals, cognitive changes are recognized as a normal part of the aging process, and some cognitive abilities such as memory, processing speed , and conceptual rea soning decline over time (20). Social structures and roles also change with ag ing because of multiple factors and events such as retirement , limited social network, loss of family me mbers or close friends , decreased functional ability , and increased dependency (21). 1.2 Cancer and aging Aging itself is associated with limitations in physical function, reduced reserve capacity, a poorer resilience to physiological stressors, and an increas ed burden of comorbidities (17, 22) . A diagnosis of cancer and its a ccompanying treatments can lead to numerous symptoms and side effects, physical disability, psychological distress and increased health care needs (23). The interplay between age -related and cancer -related declines in healt h increases vulnerability and the risk of development of short and long-term disability (24, 25) . Compared to older individuals without a history of cancer, older cancer patients and survi vors suffer from a greater inci dence of limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), reduced quality of life (QOL) , lower self -rated health, and higher prevalence of geriatric syndromes such as depression, falls and osteoporosis (26, 27) . Rese arch suggests that older cancer patients derive benefits to chemotherapy similar to the benefits derived by younger patients (28-30). However, older cancer patients are at increased risk of chemotherapy toxicity due to age -related physiologic changes, e.g. decreased stem -cell reserves, reduced ability to repair cell damage, and progressive loss of body protein (31). Furthermore, comorbidities and their associated treatments increase risk of chemoth erapy toxicity even further (31). Recommendations from an expert group meeting in 2016 concluded that rehabilitation services should be offered early to older cancer patients to optimize tolerance to cancer treatment, minimize toxici ty, and improve outcomes (32). 1.3 Sarcopenia and cancer cachexia Loss of muscle mass and strength is a part of the normal aging process, and is often referred to as ‘sarcopenia’. In accordance with an European consensus report, sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength (33). Sarcopenia has multiple contributing factors including aging process itself, insufficient nutrition, sedentary lifestyle or bedrest, a nd chronic disease s and certain medical drugs. Sarcopenia that occurs solely due to aging is"
11,page_11,"12 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 typically referred to as ‘primary sarcopenia’, while the term ‘secondary sarcopenia’ is used to describe sarcopenia that is caused by other factors such as cancer or other chronical diseases (33). Sarcopenia may be responsible for functional impairment, increased risk of falls, and loss of independence in the elderly population (34). The clinical diagnosis of sarcopenia is made from the presence of low muscle mass in combination with low muscle function (either low muscle strength or performance), and can be diagnosed with different validated measurement techniques (33). Besides sarcopenia, ‘cachexia’ is another depleting syndrome that causes weight loss and muscle wasting due to an underlying disease. Cachexia is an important complication among cancer patients, particularly in advanced -stage cancer. Cancer cachexia is “a multi -factorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment” (35). The pathophysiology of cancer cachexia is complex and includes a combinatio n of reduced energy intake, hormonal alterations, and abnormal metabolism and inflammation. Cancer cachexia is clinically defined as loss of more than 5% of stable body weight over the past 6 months, or loss of more than 2% of body weight in patients who a re already showing depletion according to Body Mass Index ( BMI ) (BMI <20kg/m2) or according to skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia) (35). Differentiation between cachexia and sarcopenia can be difficult as loss of muscle mass is an important feature of cachexia, and therefore most cachectic subjects will also be sarcopenic, whereas most sarcopenic subjects are not considered cachectic (36). Prior studies have identified cachexia and sarcopenia as contributors to impaired physical functioning (37), reduced tolerance to anti - cancer treatment (38-40), higher symptom burden (41), reduced QOL (41, 42) , and increased mortality (39, 43 -46) among patients with cancer. Therefore, it is of upmost importance to focus on prevention, identification and treatment of cancer cachexia and sarcopenia in clinical practice. However, research has shown that cancer cachexia and sarcopenia are rarely recognized or managed actively by physicians (41, 47) . Furthermore, older cancer patients may be at particular risk of cachexia and sarcopenia due to age-related declines in physical reserves, sedentary life -style, insufficient nutrition and comorbidities (48). Evidence suggest s that regul ar exercise training, increased activity level, and sufficient energy and protein intake are effective strategies in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia, which also have been shown as promising interventions in the prevention and treatment of cancer cachexia (49-51). According to recently published guidelines for nutrition al care in cancer patients from the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), body resources and physiological decline in cancer patients are endangered by a complex pattern of physical and functional derangement (52). Therefore, strategies to prevent and treat malnutritio n, sarcopenia and cachexia among cancer patients should optimally comprise a comprehensive approach, including nutritional advice/therapy,"
12,page_12,"13 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 counseling and guidance to optimize symptom management, and physical rehabilitation/exercise training (52). 1.4 Exercise training Exercise training is a strengthening multi -effect strategy that has the capacity to work across multiple organ systems . Research has shown that exercise training (e.g. aerobic training, resistance t raining, and balance and flexibility exercises) is safe and beneficial to perform for older people . The beneficial effects include increased muscle mass and strength, aerobic capacity, functional mobility and ADL function, balance and reduction of falls, improved QOL , and reduction of depressive symptoms (53-56). Also, evidence suggests that exercise training alone or in combination with nutritional interventions have some effect on the prevention and treatment of age -related sarcopenia (57, 58) . The effects of exercise interventions have also been widely investigated among cancer patients. Research has shown that exercise training is effective in the prevention or reduction of symptoms and side effects from cancer disease and treatment (59). Several intervention studies have investigated effects of exercise training in cancer patients both during and after oncological treatment, and a myriad of beneficial ef fects have been documented, including reduced levels of fatigue, and improved aerobic capacity, muscular strength, physical functioning and QOL (60-62). However, older patients have often been underrepresented in these studies, and only few exe rcise -based intervention studies have specifically focused on older cancer patients (63). Among the few studies that investigated the effects of exercise interventions in o lder cancer patients, most focused on o lder p atients with early -stage breast, prostate and colorectal cancer in the post-operative treatment period, and excluded patients in active oncological treatment. Especially, research investigating the effect of exercise training in older cancer patients with adva nced -stage disease is lacking (63). 1.5 Breast cancer Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women and is a major cause of cancer -related deaths worldwide. It is estimated that more than 1.67 million new cases of breast cancer occurred worldwide in women in 2012 ( 65). Breast cancer accounts for approximately 522,000 deat hs in the world each year, which makes it the 5th most common cause of cancer -related death today in women and men combined (64). In 2030 breast cancer i s expected to be the 5th leading cause of cancer -related death (65). Every year approximately 5000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in Denmark ( 68; NORDCAN 2011 - 2015 ; Cancerregisteret Årsrapport 2016). At diagnosis, more th an 90% of patients present with early breast cancer defined as local disease amenable for curative surgery. Depending on patient age, menopausal status and tumor characteristics such as size, grade of malignancy, lymph node status, estrogen receptor (ER) a nd human epidermal"
13,page_13,"14 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressions, approximately 90% of patients with early breast cancer are offered systemic adjuvant treatment. This includes some or all of the following; anti-estrogen, anti - HER2 treatment and chemotherapy (69). The hormone receptor -positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -negative (HER2 -) breast cancer subtype is the most prevalent of breast cancer subtypes and accounts for approximately 70% of all breast cancers ( 70). Overall, adjuvant che motherapy decreases risk of recurrence and improves survival , but the absolute benefits in patients with a low risk of recurrence may be small. Therefore, the decision to offer chemotherapy must consider risk factors of the disease as well as patient age a nd comorbidities . Adjuvant chemotherapy is standard for patients with triple -negative breast cancer and HER2 -positive breast cancer. Chemotherapy treatment decision -making for women with ER -positive, HER2 -negative breast cancers is more complicated, owing to the variation in prognosis among women with ER -positive, HER2 -negative tumors, the effectiveness of adjuvant endocrine therapy at reducing recurrence, and the variable sensitivity of ER -positive tumors to chemotherapy treatments. For such patients, the decision to administer chemotherapy is based on an assessment of the composite risk of recurrence and likely benefit of treatment based upon patient age, tumor lymph node status, size, grade, lymphovascular invasion , and the results of a gene expression pr ofile such as PAM50. In Denmark, standard adjuvant chemotherapy consists of thre e series of epirubicin + cyclophosphamide (every 3 weeks) and 3 se ries of paclitaxel (every week) (66). Patients with HER2 -positive disease receive trastuzumab 600 mg s.c every three weeks in combination with paclitaxel and continuing for 12 months. Risks of chemotherapy include acute toxicities including fatique, nausea, vomiting, hair loss and myelosuppression. Immunosuppression associated with chemotherapy may also lead to severe infections in some. Taxanes are associated with neuropathy, which generally resolves weeks to months after treatment, but may be incomplete in severe cases. Longer -term toxicities also include the risks of cardiotoxicity associated with anthracyclines and the rare risk of chemothera py-related leukemia (67). Risk of trastuzumab include flue like symptoms immediately after injections and cardiotoxicity. About 3 -10% of the patients will have distant metastases at the time of diagnosis and the risk of loco - regional or metastatic relapse after treatment for early breast cancer is approximately 20% (71-73). Despite new treatments arising during the past decades metastatic breast cancer remains a largely incurable disease. After documentation of distant metastases, the median survival is approximately 2 years with a 5 -year mortality of approximately 80% (73-75). Increased survival and quality of life are therefor e the primary goal of treatment for these patients. The goals of treatment of metastatic breast cancer are to prolong survival and improve quality of life by reducing cancer -related symptoms. In order to achieve these goals, an individualized approach is n eeded since no one strategy can be applied for all women. In Denmark, the following strategies are applied: 1) Patients with h ormone receptor -negative"
14,page_14,"15 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 HER2 - negative breast cancer is offered chemotherapy. In general, sequential use of single -agent chemothe rapy is used as sequential single -agent treatment is often less toxic and results in similar overall survival compared with combination chemotherapy (76); 2) Patients with symptomatic hormone receptor -positive breast cancer, in whom endocrine therapy is un likely to result in a prompt clinical response. These include patients with rapid disease progression following more than one endocrine therapy (i .e., endocrine -resistant disease) and patients with a large tumor burden involving visceral organs and threatening organ function ; and 3) Patients with HER2 -positive disease will receive chemotherapy in combination with HER2 -directed treatment (73). The majority of patients with breast cancer have ER -positive disease, and in the case of recurrence, they will primarily develop metastases to the bones and lymph nodes. In addition, there is often a long disease -free interval. Postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer, who have ER -positive and HER2 -negative tumors, are primarily offered endocrine tr eatment with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant, possibly in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Patients who are premenopausal are offered ovariel suppression in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant in combination with CDK4/6 inhibit ors. CDK4/6 inhibitors are recommended in addition to endocrine treatment in first -line treatment in patients with PS 0 -1 (68). The choice of first line chemotherapy takes into account several factors in an effort to individuali ze therapy as much as possible as there is no ideal sequence of treatments that can be applied to all patients. It is likely that patients with metastatic breast cancer will receive many (if not all) available treatments throughout the course of their disease. For HER -2 negative patient who has been previously exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy the preferred regimen will most often be capecitabine. The drug is an orally fluoropyrimidine carbamate that is enzymatically -activated to 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) preferentially by thymidine phosphylase (TP) in the liver and tumor tissue (77). Capecitabine for metastatic breast cancer has been shown to be well tolerated and efficient as both first - and second -line therapy (77, 78). Capecitabine is approved for metastatic breast cancer in combination with docetaxel after failure of prior anthracycline treatment, or as monotherapy in patients’ resistant to both taxanes and anthracyclines (79). Side effect i ts primary toxicities are hand -foot syndrome and diarrhea, and it can be used in s ettings of mild hepatic dysfunction. It causes very little alopecia or neuropathy. For HER -2 negative patient who ha d not received adjuvant chemotherapy the preferred regimen will depend on performance status, tumor burden and patient’s preferences. The mo st used regimens are doxetaxel or capecitabine (see above) (54). Taxanes are among the most active agents for metastatic breast cancer. Docetaxel is associated with a significant risk of fluid retention, which is reduced by"
15,page_15,"16 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 premedication. Side effects include alopecia, neuropathy and myalgia, myelosuppression, febrile neutropenia, edema, and gastrointestinal toxicities. Therapies that target HER2 have become important agents in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and have altered the natural course of HER2 -positive breast cancer. Because the use of HER2 -directed therapy improves survival for patients with HER2 - positive metastatic breast cancer, such patients receive HER2 -directed therapy as first - and later -line treatment (69). In HER -2 positive pa tients the preferred treatment regimen is vinorelbine in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (66). The treatment regimen is reasonably well tolerated with toxicities consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual agents. Common side effects for vinorelbine include : nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and constipatio n whereas pertuzumab may be associated with heart problems, diarrhea, and rash or itching. 1.5.1 Exercise training in patients with breast cancer Exercise training for older patients with breast cancer is a relatively unexplored research field. It is indicate d that physical activity after breast cancer diagnos is is associated with better survival (70, 71) . Physical activity is safe and effective in improving health -related QOL as well as physiological , behavioral and physical outcomes among breast cancer survivors (71). Only a small number of minor adverse events have been reported and no evidence of harmful or negative effects of physical activity interventions among women diagnosed with breast cancer have been found (71). Several e xercise intervention s among patients with breast cancer receiving adjuvant therapy consist of resistance training or a combination of resistance - and aerobic tra ining (72-81). These exercise interventions reduce fatigue (74, 77) and sym ptoms of depression (74) and improve QOL (73, 76, 77) for patients with breast cancer receiving adjuvant therapy . Furthermore, exercise interventions have a positive effect on minimizing decline in cardiorespiratory fitness and improve muscle strength (75, 76, 79), physical function, bone mineral density, sleep (82), and shoulder range of motio n (75, 82) . Resist ance training in patients with breast cancer during adjuvant che motherapy significantly reverses sarcopenia and dynapenia (72). Slimmer, fitter and younger (premenopausal) breast cancer patients receiving chemothera py are more likely to benefit from a higher dose of exercise intervention than their counterparts. This indicates that age, menopausal status, obesity, past exercise experie nce and fitness level should be taking into account when exercise is prescribed to cancer patients (76). The exercise interventions mentioned above all i nclude patients with breast cancer with a mean age of approximately 55 year s. Very few trials have examine d the effect of exercise among older breast cancer patient s under going treatment (83, 84) . One trial has examined the effect of yoga training compared to"
16,page_16,"17 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 routine physical therapy (n = 20) (83). Both types of exercise seemed to have a posi tive effect on QOL (83). Therefore , research exploring exercise training in combination with oncological treatments for older breast cancer patients is needed. 2. Study rationale and aim Older cancer patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, including trials within exercise training in combination with oncological tre atments . Nevertheless, the older cancer population is the largest group of cancer patients, and their number is rapidly growing . With a mean age around 65 years at diagnosis, breast cancer is associated with aging. Interventions that reduce symptoms, maintain physical funct ion and optimize QOL are essential . Since few previous stud ies have investigated the effect of an exercise - based intervention specificall y focused on older patients with primary or advanced -stage breast cancer during chemotherapy , the primary focus of the current study is to investigate the effect and feasibility of such an intervention. Hence, the aim of the present “TOLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise” study is to investigate the effect of a 12 -week exercise -based intervention, comprised of a supervised and group - based resistance training program, an individualized and home-based walking program in older patients (≥ 70 years) newly diagnosed with primary , locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer w ho are undergoing treatment with adjuvant or first-line palliative systemic therapy. 3. Research questions and hypotheses 3.1 Research questions 1. Can the exercise -based intervention increase or maintain physical function level s in older patients with breast cancer during treatment with adjuvant or first-line palliative systemic therapy? 2. Is it feasible and safe to recruit and engage older patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the exercise -based intervention during treatment with adjuvant or first-line systemic therapy? 3. Can the exercise -based intervention reduce symptoms and side -effects in older patients with breast cancer during treatment with adjuvant or first-line systemic therapy? 4. Can the exercise -based inte rvention improve QOL and psychological wellbeing among older patients with breast cancer during treatment with adjuvant or first-line palliative systemic therapy? 5. Can the exercise -based intervention affect circulating biomarkers of inflammation in older patients with breast cancer during treatment with adjuvant or first-line palliative systemic therapy?"
17,page_17,"18 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 6. Are circulating levels and changes in inflammatory biomarkers associated with the development of ca ncer cachexia, sarcopenia, and other changes in body composition in older patients with breast cancer during treatment with adjuvant or first-line palliative systemic therapy ? 3.2 Study hypotheses We hypothesize that the exercise -based intervention will maintain or increase physical function l evels, reduce symptoms an d side effects, improve QOL and psychological wellbeing, and prevent weight loss and muscle wasting in patients with breast cancer during treatment with adjuvant or first-line palliative systemic therapy . We pre dict that recruitment of older patients with breast cancer might be challenging because of treatment -related side -effects , symptom burden, and age -related factors that affect these patients. Also, as prior exercise -based intervention studies targeted patients with advanced stage cancer during systemi c therapy treatment have experienced considerable attrition rates, we expect that a certain percentage of drop -outs during the intervention period will be inevitable . However, we believe that a n intervention specifically targeted the special needs of older patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant or first -line palliative therapy can be integrated in both the hospital and home setting, will make the intervention feasible and effective . 4. Design and methods 4.1 Design TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise is a prospective two -armed r andomized controlled trial of a 12 -week exercise intervention in older patients (≥ 70 years) with breast cancer who are treated with adjuvant or first-line palliative systemic therapy. 4.2 Recruitment of patients Patient will b e recruited from the Department of Oncology , Herlev and Gentofte Hospital. Potentia lly suitable patients will be identified and screened by oncologists to find eligible participants. The screening procedure aims at confirming that inclusion criteria are met (4.3), and that none of the exclusion criteria are present (4.4). The oncologist will inform eligible patients about the possibility to participate in the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study. P atients who are interested in part icipation will hereafter be informed, and potentia lly recruited and randomized by the primary investigator Ida Lundager . Before the information, by the primary investigator, is given to the patient, patients are informed about the possible to have an assessor. Patients will be informed both verbally and in writing about the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise program, perceived benefits, risks, and safety precautions, and about the ir person al rights in entering the trial . The informatio n will be given to the patients in"
18,page_18,"19 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 undisturbed settings at outpatient department of oncology. After all information have been delivered and understood, patients will be informed about their right for time to consider participation in the study (a minimum o f 24 hours). Hereafter, i nformed consent forms (ICF) will be signed and collected from patients who want to participate in the trial . Included patients will receive a copy of the signed ICF . Due to ethical considerations, and challenges with significant information load, patients will first be approached and informed about the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise trial after the first treatment dose of either adjuvant or first -line palliative systemic therapy. 4.3 Inclusion crite ria Patients must: • Have undergone surgery for primary breast cancer within 12 weeks or • Be diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer • Be treated with adjuvan t or first -line palliative therapy with chemotherapy ± HER2 directed treatment, ± antihormonal treatment, antihormonal treatment ± HER 2, directed treatment ± CDK 4/6 inhibitor • Be ≥ 70 years of age at the time of sig ning the ICF • Have a n Eastern Cooperative Oncology Grou p (ECOG) performance status score ≤ 2 • Be able to speak and read Dani sh, and to provide a signed ICF 4.4 Exclusion criteria Patients with: • Any physical condition that hinder the execution of physical exercise training • Other type of cancer • Documented and uncontrolled brain metastases that hinder participation in an exercise -based trial, based on the re ferring oncologist’s assessment • Dementia, psychotic disorders, or other cognitive diseases or conditions that hinder formal consent • Unstable medical disease , condition, or hist ory of serious or concurrent illness; any medical condition that might be aggravat ed by exercise training or that cannot be controlled, including, but not restricted to congestive heart failure (NYHA class II I-IV), unstable angina pectoris , implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), or myocar dial infarction within 6 months, based on the re ferring oncologist’s assessment In patients with documented bone metastases :"
19,page_19,"20 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 • A bone metastatic burden or location that poses a risk of injury in the performance of exercise training, as assessed by the referring oncologist 4.5 Stratification at randomization Patients included in the study will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention group and control group . As cancer stage and performance status are expected to influence the outcomes of interest, stratification will be performed at randomization. Patients will be stratified at randomization based on: • Cancer stage and treatment. Randomization and stratification will be performed through the randomizati on module in REDCap. 4.6 Intervention 4.6.1 Exercise intervention Patients in the intervention group will receive usual care and the exercise -based intervention. Based on recommendations from the Cancer and Aging group NCU U13 (63), this interv ention will be initiated early after cancer diagnosis . Focusing on a group of older patients with breast cancer and treated with adjuvan t or first -line palliative systemic therapy several factors have been considered in targeting the intervention, including the debilitating symptoms and side -effects, age -related physical limitations and comorbidities, and the rapid physical decline seen among patients with advan ced cancer . The overall focus of the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise interventio n lies on maintaining muscular strength, physical function and mobility . In addition to the PRT, an individualized light to moderate intensity walking program , based on step counts , will be developed for each patient with the aim of avoiding inactivity and to keep patients active on days when they a re not engaged in the PRT program . The exercise -based intervention is composed in a w ay that allows individualization based on each patients’ physical state, psychosocial state, and motivation throughout the intervention period. Patients in cluded in the intervention group will rece ive a 12 -week exercise -based interventi on composed of the following components : 1. Supervised and group -based exercise program : Patients in the intervention group will participate in the supervised exercise program two times a week, and each se ssion will last approximately 60 minutes. The exercise program consists of warm -up exercises , including exercises for balance and flexibility (15 minutes) , a program of PRT that comprises seven resistance training exercises targeting the large muscle groups (chest pr ess, low row, hamstring curls, knee extension, leg press, abdominal crunches, back extensions) (35 minutes) , and stretching and relaxa tion (10 minutes ). In"
20,page_20,"21 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 week 1 -2, patients will be introduced to the PRT and the program will be initiated with high repetition number s and low load. The intensity is progressed during the intervention period from two to three sets with a load corresponding to 15 to 8 repetition maximum (RM) (the load that can be lifted to 15 and 8 repetitions, respectively, using proper technique as assessed by the physiotherapist). This model of PRT is in accordance with the recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (85). The progression will be tailored to each individual patient regarding potential comorbidities and physical limitations, and will be closely monitored by the responsible physiotherapist. In patients with documented bone metastases, a very conservative approach to progression will be taken, which involves very small increments in resistance. The supervised exercise training will take place at the Department of Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy at Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, and will be led by an experienced physiotherapist. When entering the project, all patients will receive a ‘replacement training program’ that includes a few effective exercises for the major muscle group s and can be performed at home. If a patient for unforeseen reasons cancels a group -based training session during the intervention period, the patient will be recommended to perform the exercises in the replacement -program instead. All patients will be thoroughly introduced to these replacement exercises when entering the study. 2. Individualized walking program based on step counts (pedometer assessment) . After randomization, patient s in the intervention group will receive a n activity tracker and wil l be asked to wear it for three consecutive days. B ased on each patient’s starting point (a mean of the th ree pre - measured days ), prefe rences and motivation, an individualized walking program will be conducted to increase or maintain the level of activity . Goal-setting in relation to step counts will be set once weekly in collaboration between each patient and the primary investigator ( Ida Lundager ). Even though t he overall aim is to increase activity level/step counts during the intervention, it is also possible to maintain or even reduce the step -goals in some weeks if an increase is not realistic due to physical or psychosocial reasons , or if patients are already sufficiently active . Each patient will receive a booklet at the introduction meeting with information and advice a bout walking , and goal - setting and evaluation schemas for the 1 2-week intervention . Evaluation and goal-setting will be conducted once a week befor e or after the supervised training session , or by t elephone (based on patients’ preferences). Patient s will also be asked about their beliefs and confidence about reaching their next goal (self -efficacy rating)."
21,page_21,"22 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 3. Nutritional supplement after supervised exercise session : a nutritional supplement (protein bar or protein drink) will be given to patients immediately af ter the supervised exercise training session at the hospital setting . The TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise intervention is illustrat ed in Table 1. Table 1. Components of the multi modal TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise intervention Supervised exercise training Nutritional supplement Home -based walking Content • Warm up • Exercises for balance • Exercises for flexibility • Progressive resistance training • Stretching • Relaxation Protein drink or protein bar (~ 200-300 calories, 12 -18 grams of protein).

Setting Dept . of Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital. Dept. of Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital. Home -setting. Evaluation and goal -setting will be conducted at the hospital setting or by telephone (based on patients’ preferences). 4.6.2 Theoretical framework The elements of exercise training in the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study are designed in accordance with Danish and international basic principles and recommendations for exercise training in healthy individuals, healthy older in dividuals, cancer patients, and older cancer patients (82, 85, 86) . Both Danish and international guidelines emphasize the importance of adapting exercise training to both cancer site, symptoms and side effects, and with consideration for each individuals’ health status, physical limitations , and comorbidities (82, 86) . Focusin g on older cancer patients, Danish recommendations specifically underline that exercise interventions should focus on maintaining mobility and physical function (86). With an overall purpose of empowering and activating patients involved, goal -setting will b e incorporated as an element in the intervention (home -based walking program) . Goal setting is widely recognized as an effective method to achieve behavioral changes and enhance self -efficacy in people (87). In the rehabilitation setting it is generally agreed t hat goals must"
22,page_22,"23 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic/relevant and timed -based (SMART). Furthermore, goal - setting should be carried out th rough a continuous process that involves planning, evaluation and reassessment, in collaboration between the p atient and HCP (88, 89) . 4.7 Study assessments and data collection The following assessments and data collection will be performed: 1. Clinical data and medical outcomes : data on diagnosis, time of diagnosis, treatment reg ime, performance status (ECOG) (Appendix 1) , and comorbidities (assessed by Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (90) will be registered and assessed from medical records. Risk of systemic therapy toxicity (toxicity score) will be calculated using the Cancer & Aging Research Group (CA RG) toxicity score with data from medical records and patient questionnaire (28). 2. Demographic and patient -reported data: data on civil status, w orking status, education level, smoking h abits, alcohol consumption , weight loss before and after cancer diagnosis (kg/percent), and physical activity level before cancer diagnosis and current will be collected through patient questionnaire (Appendix 2) . 3. Physical function : To measure physical capacity and lower extremity strength , the 30-second Chair Stand Test (30 s-CST) will be used (primary outcome). The 30 s-CST is a widely used physical measure, especially among older people and those with significant weakness, and is regarded as a prerequisite for functional independence (91).The 30 s-CST has also been used and tested in cancer patients (92). Using a chair with a seat of 45 cm above the floor, patients will be instructed to sit in the middle of the chair with their back straight, arms crossed over the chest, and both feet resting flat of the floor (93). The correct technique will b e demonstrated for patients before assessment. On the instructor’s signal patients will be asked to stand straight and then return to the seated position as many times as possible in 30 seconds. A modified version of the 30s-CST, where patients are allowed to use armrests, can be used in patients who are not able to rise from a chair without using their arms. Use of the modified version will be registered, and will be carried out in accordance with the test manual (93). The 30 s-CST has proved to be a valid and reliable method in measuring lower body strength among healthy community -dwelling older adults (91). Physical performance will also be asses sed with a 6 -meter gait speed test (6mGS) and 10 meter gait speed test (10mGS) at normal and maximal gait speed (94). Gait speed is a suitable measure to use in the clinical evaluation and rehabilitation setting when focusing on older individuals, as it is easy to administer, and has document ed predictive value for health -"
23,page_23,"24 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 related outcomes such as functional and cognitive decline, falls, hospitalization, independence, and mortality (94, 95) .To measure physical capacity and endurance, the six -minute -walk -test (6MWT) will be used. The 6MWT measures the distance an individual can walk over a total of six minutes on a hard and flat surface. It was originally developed for use in frail o lder patients, but it has been used and validated in a variety of chronic diseases and populations (e.g. cardiac, cancer and pulmonary patients) (96, 97) . Prior studies have demonstrated that the 6MWT is a reliable and valid measure of physical capacity and endurance in older adults and in cancer patients, and that the test may have prognostic value among cancer patients (98, 99) . To measure phys ical function of the upper -body, the handgrip strength test (HST) will be used. Handgrip strength will be measured using a hand -held Jamar dynamometer and with three attempts performed for each hand. Measurements of grip strength with the Jamar dynamometer have evidence for good reliability and validity (100) . Patient will be sitting down during the assessment with their elbow flexed at 90⁰. Th e best measure in the strongest hand will be used as test score. Research has shown that handgrip strength may be independently associated with functional capacity, QOL and survival in patients with advanced cancer (101) . To measure lower extremity muscle power a stair climb test (SCT) will be used. The patient will climb a flight of stairs (20 steps) as fast as possible. The best of three trials will be used as test score . Leg power is an influential factor in the mobility performance of older adults (102) . The SCT is a clinically relevant measure of l ower extremity power among older adults and is associated with more complex modes of testing power (103) . All physical tests will be conducted by blinded physiotherapists. 4. Feasibi lity measures : feasibility of the intervention will be evaluated as acceptability, attrition and adherence. Acceptability will be measured as the number of eligible patients who agree to participate in the study. Also, reasons for refusing participation will be registered and evaluated. Attrition is the number of patients who do not co mplete the study (drop -outs). For each compone nt of the intervention (supervised exercise, protein supplement after exercise sessions, and walking program ) adherence to the intervention will be assessed. Safety (adverse event) and tolerability will be eval uated at every training session and at the weekly evaluation of the walking program. 5. Patient -Reported Outcomes Measures (PRO Ms): Patient reported performance status (PRP S) will be assessed using ECOG PS (Appendix 1). PS is a known and common -used prognost ic tool for assessment and decision making in oncology and palliative settings. Evidence suggests that"
24,page_24,"25 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 patients are reliable assessors of their own performance status, and that PRPS is a predictor of cancer -related outcomes (104) . To measure symptom burden, M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) will be used (Appendix 3) . MDAS I is a multi -symptom PROM to assess the severity of symptoms and the interference with daily living as assessed by cancer patients based on the last 24 hours (105) . MDASI consists of 13 core symptom items representing symptoms that have been found to have the highest frequency and/or severity among cancer patients with various cancers and treatme nt types , and 6 interference items representing commonly experienced symptom interference with daily activities (105) . To assess QoL the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and the breast cancer specific module QLQ -BR23 (EORTC QLQ -C30 & BR23 ) will be used (Appendix 4) . EORTC QLQ -C30 comprises 30 items, is designed to be cancer specific , and consists of six functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social functioning, and global QOL) and symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, sleep dis turbance, constipation, diarrhea, appetite loss, dyspnea) (69, 106) . EORTC QLQ -C30 is developed in a way that is appropriate for self -administration and for use across a range of cultural setting. To assess symptoms of depression and anxiety, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be use d (Appendix 5) . HADS comprises a total of 14 items and is designed to measure general anxiety and depression by self -administration (107) . 6. Physical activity : Data of steps counts will be assessed daily for patients in the intervention group . Data of walked steps, distance and energy consumption for all patients ( intervention group and control group ) will be assessed in a 3 -days period both before and after the intervention period (at baseline and 12 -week post -intervention). D ata on physical activity will be me asure d with an activity tracker. 7. Chemo therapy tolerance : data on completion of scheduled chemotherapy, dose -reductions, treatment discontinuation s, toxicity (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 ) will be registered from medical records . 8. Body composition : data on weight, height, BMI, and body composition will be registered . Weight, height and BMI will be assessed using standard procedures (no shoes, light clothing). Body comp osition will be assess ed by whole -body dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry scan (DXA ) and by bioelectrical impedance (BI) assessment . The DXA technology is a special type of X-ray that is based on a three -component model that determines fat -free-mass, body fat, bone"
25,page_25,"26 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 mass, and bone mineral density (111) . DXA is acknowledged as a valid method to evaluate body composition, and it is frequently used both in research and in the clinical setti ng (111, 112) . However, all available single methods for the assessment of body composition have their limitations. Focusing on DXA, it has previously been questioned whether the validity is affected by patients’ hydration status , and , prior studies have also shown that the validity may be impaired in very lean or in very obese persons (112, 113) . Therefore, assessment of body composition will be supplemented with BI assessment . BI is a portable, easy -to-use, and non -invasive method to estimate body composition (114) . BI measures the resistance of di fferent body tissues to the flow of a low -level electrical signal which is sent through the body. The electrical flows at a different rate through the various body tissues, which allows for the analyses of estimated body fat percentage, fat mass, fat -free mass, muscle mass, body water, and bone mass (114) . The validity of BI measures of body composition can be affected by several factors, including body position, distribution of body fat, skin tem perature, and dietary intake (112, 115) . Incidence of cancer cachexia will be determined as loss of more than 5% of stable body weight over the last 6 months, or loss of more than 2% of body we ight in patients with BMI < 20kg/m2 or in patients with sarcopenia (35). Incidence of sa rcopenia will be determined by the consensus criteria from the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older Pe ople (EWGSOP), and will determined by exact cut -off value representing incidence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (performance or strength) (33). 9. Biomarkers : Results from prior studies have shown that inflammation is a critical comp onent of cancer development and progression (116, 117) . Inflammation has also been linked to important clinical outcomes, such as cancer -related fatigue and cancer cachexia (43, 118) . Although not yet fully elucidated, it also seems that exercise training may have the potential to affect tumor - specific and anti -cancer treatment outcomes th rough regulations of inflammatory processes and functions (119) . Loss of skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia) is an independent pro gnostic factor predicting poor outcome in a wide range of cancers (108) . In rece nt years, there has been an increased focus on the possible importance of growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF -11) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF -15) for the development of sarcopenia. GDF -11 and GDF - 15 belong to both the TGF β family shown via the ActRII/ALK4/ 5 signaling pathway to inhibit skeletal muscle growth. High levels of GDF -11 and GDF -15 have been shown to be associated with frail ty and increased comorbidity in older subjects and, quite recently, also shown to be up - regulated in cancer a nd related to the muscle loss s een in conjunction with cancer and cachexia (109, 110) . Data on biomarkers will be collected and registered as an exploratory translational"
26,page_26,"27 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 part of the study (see detailed description in section 4.8). Included patients must give their separate informed consent to par ticipate in the biomarker s tudy. Patients who refuse to participate in the biomarker study will still be allowed to participate in the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study. Recruitment to the biomarker study will be performed in accordance with the described and approved manner in t he biomarker study . Data on the biomarkers serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL -6), YKL -40, GDF11 and GDF15 will be used in analyses in the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study to investigate whether the exercise -based intervention affects the inflammatory process , and to investigate the association between the se biomarkers and clinical outcomes . Trans mission of the biomarkers data to the TOLCA Breast Cancer Exercise study will be done in accordance to th e regulations of the Danish Data Protection Agency and all necessary approvals will be obtained. 10. Hospital admissions : number s, causes, and length of hospitalizations during the intervention and follow -up period . Contact to the Emergency Room with falls will be noted. 11. Mortality/survival : with a purpose to investigate whether the intervention may affect survival time/mortality, incidences of deaths (cancer -related and other cause) will be registered throughout the intervention period and during follow -up. 4.8 Inflammatory biomarkers (data collection and assessment) At Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, translational resear ch will be performed for all pa tients participating in the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study , provided that included patients give their separate informed consent to partici pate in these biomarker studies . Patients who refuse to participate in th e biomarker studies will still be allowed to participate in the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study. Patients will be informed and asked to participate in the biomarker study ‘Prospektiv indsamling af blodprøver hos patienter med cancer mammae – giver bioma rkører i blod ny information om diagnose, behandlingseffekt, bivirkning og prognose?” (PRIMA -b-protokollen ) as described in the approved PRIMA -b protocol . Entering the PRIMA -b study, 30 ml blood will be collected at baseline (before the other baseline data is collected in TOLCA Bre ast Cancer Exercise Study) , before the second cycle of chemotherapy (approximately midway intervention, 6 weeks), and at the time of CT scanning (approximately post intervention, 12 weeks) according t o the PRIMA -b protocol (VEK ref.: KA-H-3- 2014 -120,; and Datatilsynet: HE-2014 -083, I-Suite 03140 ). Blood samples will be stored as serum, plasma or buffy -coat for biomarker analyses in the approved PRIMA B biobank at Herlev Hospital until 2024.

However, according to a previous study focusing o n patients with osteoarthritis, the clinically important change in the 30 s-CST was set at 2.6 repetitions (120) . Based on results from prior studies focusing on patients with advanced cancer, a standard deviation (SD) of around 3 has been reported in the 30s -CST(121, 122) . To be able to detect a difference of 2.6 repetitions in the between - group difference in the 30 s-CST at the 12 -week assessment, and to obtain a type I error rate of 5% and a power of 90 %, a sample size of 29 patients per study arm will be needed. To account fo r an expected"
29,page_29,"30 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 dropout rate of ~40%, we decided to increase this number to a group size of 50 . Thus, a total of 100 patients will be included in the study. 4.10.2Analysis plan 4.10.2.1 Quantitative data Feasibility measures (accep tability, attrition, adherence , and adverse events ) will be reported as numbers and percentages. Reason s for declining participation will be analyzed descriptively with numbers and percentages of patients declining for various reasons. Baseline characteristics will be calculated for all patients included (total) and s eparately for intervention group and cont rol group. For all quantitative variables the median number and interquartile range (IQR) will be calculated, and for nominal variables the number and percentage distribution will be calculated. Results from p hysical tests, blood test, body measures, and questionnaires will be reported as means and standard deviations (SD) or as median and IQR, as appro priate . Change over time in ordinal categorical values will be evaluated by a trend test using logistic regression. In -group and between - group differences i n continuous -level data, will be perfor med using a repeated measurement analysis . Survival analyses will be conducted with Kaplan - Meier method, competing risk analyses and Cox regression analyses. Using the Kaplan -Meier method, cancer -specific and overall survival time will be ass essed for the intervention group and the control group , and comparison in survival between groups will be assessed using the log -rank test. To account for competing risks (death s from other causes than cancer), the cumulative incidence of cancer -specif ic death will be assessed using competing risk analyses, and comparison between group s will be conducted using Grey’s test. Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to esti mate the hazards (risk) of death, and cause specif ic Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to assess the risk of cancer - related death . The significance level of all tests is set a p < 0.05, and analyses will be carried out in SAS or R by statistician s in collaboration with the primary investiga tor. 5 Ethical considerations Study approval will be obtained by the Scientific Ethics Review Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark and the Dani sh Data Protection Agency. T he study will also be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. TOLCA – Breast Cancer E xercise will be carried out in accordance with the protocol, and according the Helsinki Declaration. All personal data will be treated with confidentiality and security in accordance with the Danish Per sonal Data Act . All potential participants will be provided with full and adequate verbal and written information about the project and will have the right to ask questions about the study. Each patient will be informed about their personal rights when entering the study. It is emphasized that participation in the study is voluntary,"
30,page_30,"31 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 and that any include d patients at any given time can cancel participation in the study. I f the o ncological treatment regime is changed or discontinued for included patient s in the study, these patients will still be allowed to continue in the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study. Written informed consent forms will be obtained from all patients when entering the study. The primary investigator will also sign each informed consent form to confir m that all verbal and written information has been provided. 6 Potential risks and disadvantages There are a few potential risks and disadvantages for patients in the intervention group , including exercise injuries and discomfort in performing the exercise program. However, risks and disadvantages are considered to be limited. An experienced physiotherapist will supervise all exercise sessions at the hospital setting. If a patient shows any signs of being physically unwell during an exercise session, the patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature will be measured, and appropriate actions will be taken. For safety reasons, patients will not be allowed to partic ipate in the training session s if there is fever (≥38.5 ºC). If a patient reports any dis comfort or incidence of injury during the intervention period , the safety and further program continuation for the patient will be discussed in the research group, and in consultation with the patient and the responsi ble physician. The investigators and the responsible oncologists have the rights to exclude a patient from the study at any given time, if it is considered unsafe for the patient to continue. Data on adverse events will be collected systematically every week, and patients will furthermore be informed to contact the primary investigator immediately if injuries or other adverse events related to the intervention program should occur. 6.1 Radiation exposure Body composition will be assessed for all patients ( intervention group and control group ) by DXA scan and BI technique at baseline and after 12 weeks . BI causes no radioactive radiation and is a completely harmless method for assessment of body composition . DXA scans will be conducted with the Lunar iDXA from GE Healthcare (123) . Depending on individual body size, patients will be exposed for a small radiation dose of approximately 3 μ GY (= 0.003 mSv ) in each of the two DXA scans (123) . This dose of radiation is low and correspond s the radiation a person is exposed to by flying at 10 kilometers altitude (during the scan time = approximately 6 minutes) . All patients w ill be informed, both verbally and in writing, about the DXA scan s and about the expected radi ation exposure before enterin g the study. 7 Publication of study results Potentially positive, negative , or inconclu sive results from the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study will be published in relevant international peer -reviewed journals. Co-authorship for the upcoming"
31,page_31,"32 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 publicatio ns will be offered to members of the project group or other collaborators based on contributions to the current work , and in accordance with the Vancouver recommendations . 8 Economy The initiator of the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study is Dorte Nielsen, Professor, MD, PhD, DMSc, at Department of Oncology, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital The TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study is financially supported by grants from the VELUX Foundat ion (a total of 1, 308.069 DKK). The support from The VELUX Foundation covers the salary for PhD student Ida Lundager during the 3-year period. The VELUX Foundation will be mentioned in all written and oral presentations, and in future publications. The VEL UX Foundation (or other future funding organizations) will not have any role in the conduction of the study design or protocol, data collection, interpretation of data, or in the drafting or approval of coming publications. There is no commercial or politically binding relationship between any members of the TOLCA project group and the VELUX Foundation. Financially support from other funding organizations will be applied, to cover expenses related to the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study. The Scientific Ethics Review Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark and participants in the study will be informed about any further grants. Patients included in TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study will not receive any financial fe es by participating in the trial . 9 Scientific statement The TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study is expected to involve low risk of adverse events and discomfort for patients involved. The intervention and all assessments will be led and conducted by experienced therapists and other health care practitioners with all relevant safety precautions installed . Patients involved in the r esearch program will not experience any delays in their treatment due to participation in the program. Included patients can withdraw from the program at any time and without any specific reasons. It is the project group’s assessment that it is necessary t o carry out the current research project to gain important knowledge abo ut the effect and feasibility of a exercise -based intervention as a rehabilitative approach to older patients with breast cancer durin g oncological treatment adjuvant or first line pal liative systemic therapy . The pr oject group estimates that the TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise intervention will maintain or increase physical function l evels, reduce symptoms and side effect, in crease tolerance to oncological treatment, and improve psychol ogical well -being and QOL"
32,page_32,"33 Protocol T OLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06 .2018 in older patients with primary advanced breast cancer , and that the expected benefits of the intervention exceed the estimated limited risks for patients involved. 10 Clinical perspectives and implementation With the aging population and expected increase of cancer incidence ( especially among older people) , new approaches of early rehabilitation are needed to maintain physical function levels and independence in older cancer patients . The TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study has the potential to become a new model of early rehabilitation care for older patients with breast cancer . In the long term, it is our goal to investigat e the program’s effect among older pati ents with various malignancies in order to map out the effects, common features, and the differences across cancers, with an overall focus on the old er cancer population. The TOLCA – Breast Cancer Exercise study supports the development of future health promotion guidelines for older cancer patients during anti-cancer treatment by reducing the complex symptom burden, supporting treatment tolerance, maintaining physical function and thereby enabling a better quality of life. The interventions pragmatic approach and integration in the hospital and home - setting will be implementable should the study prove effective and implementation is the goal."
