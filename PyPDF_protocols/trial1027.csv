For example, in the two most recent large RTOG randomized trials involving primary CRT , these two disease sites comprised 86% and 93% of the entire cohort of RTOG 01 29 and 0522, respectively (1, 2) . Outcomes following radiotherapy depend strongly on disease site. Patients with OPC are now dichotomized into human papillomavirus (HPV) -related disease (HPV -positive), and HPV - negative disease. The outcomes are dramatically improved in patients with virally -mediated cancer, with 8 -year overall survival (OS), progression -free survival (PFS), locoregional recurrence (LRR) and distant metastasis (DM) risks of 70 .9%, 64%, 19.5% and 10.3% versus 30.2%, 23.3%, 52.4% and 16.1% for HPV -positive versus HPV -negative, respectively. The survival outcomes for patients with laryngeal cancer have remained roughly stable over the years. In RTOG 9111, definitive CRT using co nventional radiotherapy led to 5 -year OS, LRR and DM of 55.1%, 32.3%, and13.6%, respectively (3). In a more recent study (also using conventional radiotherapy), induction chemotherapy plus CRT for LXC led to a c rude risk of locoregional and distant failure of 20% and 8.3% at a median follow -up of only 36 months, suggesting similar rates of disease success over time (4). Radiotherapy has evolved dramatically over the pa st 20 years, such that now intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is the standard -of-care. IMRT allows the physician to contour (i.e. target) regions for specific doses of radiotherapy, while also specifying normal structures (termed organs -at-risk, OAR) that should be avoided. The use of IMRT has been shown to reduce x erostomia in randomized t rials (5). However, IMRT still targets the same lymph node regions as conventional 2D radiotherapy, despite our ability to tailor the radiotherapy volume and dose to specific areas. It is notable that the majority of disease sites treated with radiotherapy no longer receive elective/prophylactic radiotherapy to clinically -negative areas, including lung, pancreas, and lymphoma. Fields that eliminate or minimize elective irradiation are terme d “involved -field.” In this study, we aim to improve acute and long -term toxicity of IMRT for OPC and LXC by delivering a conservative form of involved -field radiotherapy, using a lower dose while also sparing tissue with an established, very low risk of occult microscopic disease. 1.2 Study Agent(s) Background and Associated Known Toxicities Radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are established treatments for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. This stud y is evaluating a radiation dose paradigm that should be equally or more tolerable – in both the short - and long -term – than the established outcomes. The dose to known gross disease is the same as in these studies, but the dose to the areas with potential microscopic disease, termed elective volumes, will be lowered or eliminated . The allowed chemotherapy regimens are standard agents that have been used in prospective phase II and III studies and are considered feasible treatments according to the NCCN g uidelines. To provide a rough estimate of acute and late toxicities, in the control arm of RTOG 0129 (conventional radiotherapy plus bolus cisplatin), 73.7% of patients experienced a non - hematologic acute grade 3 -5 toxicity, and 39.1% of patients develop ed acute grade 3 -5 mucositis/stomatitis (6) . A total of 9.4% of patients developed febrile neutropenia. However, only 3.7% of patients were diagnosed with late (i.e. after 90 days from the start of RT)"
11,page_11,"STU 052016 -044 ________________________________________________________________________ STU052016 -044, Sher, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_25, 03 -15-21 (1) 6 mucositis /stomatitis. Thirty -six percent of patients experienced any late grade 3 -5 toxicity, the majority of which were esophageal (8%), “other” (8%), or salivary gland (4%). 1.3 Other Agents Patients with stage I and II disease will be treated with radiotherapy alone. Patients with stage III (T1 -2 N1) may be treated with radiotherapy alone or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Patients with stage III (T3N0 -1) and IVA -B cancers will be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The specific systemic therapy agent will be left to the physician. The four allowed chemotherapy regimens are bolus cisplatin ,weekly cisplatin , cetuximab (weekly, including 1 week before treatment), and carboplatin -paclitaxel (weekly, over the course of treatment). 1.4 Rationale Before proceeding with the rationale section , it is critical to note that radiotherapy targets two basic types of treatment volumes: gross disease and microscopic disease. Gross disease, termed gross tumor volume (GTV) receives the highest dose level, and microscopic disease, termed clinical target volume (CTV) receives a lower dose level. Frequently (but not always) there are several CTV dose levels, d epending on the risk of microscopic disease. The critical organs - at-risk ( salivary glands, oral cavity, pharyngeal constrictors, larynx and esophagus) almost always abut areas that may harbor microscopic disease but are relatively distant (1 cm or more) fr om GTV. In practical terms, this means that the dose to structures crucial to long-term quality -of-life are determined by the elective, CTV, dose rather than the radiation to the known gross disease. When we think about reducing the intensity of treatmen t to the CTV, we aim to minimize the subsequent risk of solitary elective recurrence (i.e. first and only failure) . That is, the risk of recurrence in an elective region before any other treatment failure, either local or distant. A patient who has an elec tive recurrence synchronous with (or after) an in -field or distant recurrence was not harmed by the less intense elective treatment, because the disease would have recurred anyway . There are thus t hree key questions in considering how to manage elective volume irradiation. First and second , how frequent are solitary elective recurrences and at what elective dose are these outcomes achieved ? Thirdly , what is the risk of any microscopic disease in the first place? Frequency of solitary elective recurrence s, and required dose With respect to the patterns -of-recurrence and required elective dose, a lthough RTOG 0129 did not describe the patterns -of-failure relative to the irradiation field, many other studies have shown that the vast majority of recurrences occur within the high -dose zone. In a retrospective study from Dana -Farber Cancer Institute, the risk of recurrence wit hin the elective volume (56-63 Gy) was 1%, and results were very similar from Dandekar et al, which showed only a 2% elective failure risk in regions treated to 54-56 Gy (7, 8) . In a very large stu dy from MD Anderson (776 oropharyngeal cancer patients), only 7 patients (< 1% of total) failed outside of the high-dose zone , with the low -dose irradiated to 50 Gy (9). There were no elective volume failures in a 71-patien t retrospective study of oropharyngeal cancer from UCSF (54 Gy in 33 fractions ) (10). In a carefully -performed patterns -of-failure study from Ghent University Hospital, there were no solitary elective nodal failures (out of 140, with the majority oropharynx [35%] or larynx [28%]) in the primarily irradiated neck , in which the elective neck received 56 Gy in 35 fractions (11)."
12,page_12,"STU 052016 -044 ________________________________________________________________________ STU052016 -044, Sher, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_25, 03 -15-21 (1) 7 Bedi et al described 69 patients treated with 50 Gy in 35 fractions to the low -risk elective neck, with no recurrences at a median 2.5 years of follow -up (12). In a very large study (376 patients, 70% OPC and 16% LXC) from Belgium, although 11.1% (41 patients) developed a regional recurrence, only 11 patients (3% of total) developed a solitary regional recurrence. Moreover, only 2 patients (<1% of total) developed a solitary elective regional recurrence in an area that received betwe en 46 -50 Gy (13).Studer et al. described the patterns -of-failure in 202 head and neck cancer patients (70% OPC and LXC) treated with IMRT (14) . In this series, 99 patients unde rwent prophylactic neck dissection after RT, and 29 nodes were still positive; 28 out of these 29 (96.5%) were only positive in gross disease. Out of the 103 patients who did not receive a prophylactic neck dissection, 27 (26%) patients developed an isolat ed nodal relapse. However, out of these 27 patients, only 1 (4%) occurred in the elective PTV. Importantly, salvage surgery was performed in 24 of these individuals (89%) and was successful in 21/24 (88% of attempted surgeries, 78% of all recurrences), des pite nearly all of these recurrences reflecting in -field failures. Similarly, there w ere only 6 solitary elective recurrence s out of 264 (50% OPC, 37% LC) patients treated to 50 Gy in 34 fractions in van den Bosch et al (15). Importantly , this latter paper evaluated almost 120 0 lymph nodes , and found that elective nodal recurrence always occurred in a previously visualiz ed (presumed benign) lymph node . Thus, the nodes at -risk appear to be visible at diag nosis. Moreover, the risk of recurrence in these radiologically -negative node s was only 0.4% (at 2 years) if the summed diameter of the lymph node was less than 17 mm. In summary, it seems clear that solitary elective recurrences are very rare, if a radiologically -clear region has microscopic disease, 50 Gy is nearly always sufficient to sterilize it. In fact, the drive to lower the elective dose even further led to a Belgian randomized controlled trial comparing 50 Gy with 40 Gy to the electiv e neck, with 100 patients in either arm. A preliminary study showed significantly improved dosimetry in the dose to the swallowing structures, with significantly less grade 3 dysphagia at 3 months (2% vs 11%, p=0.03) (16). With longer follow -up, the authors found no difference in local control but significant improvements in grade 3 dysphagia at 6 months and borderline improvement at 2 years (p=0.065) (ESTRO, 2014, OC-0058). Risk of disease in level IB (submandibular nodes) The second issue is the probability of any microscopic disease in a given lymph node level, because if that risk is sufficiently low, no irradiation is required at all. Although the original IMRT experience treated all lym ph node stations in the neck to parallel older irradiation techniques, there is now a substantial volume of pathologic and radiotherapeutic data supporting a very low risk of occult disease in radiologically -negative regions. Several surgical series have shown a low risk of disease in ipsilateral level IB in oropharyngeal cancer. For example, Sanguineti et al showed that out of 91 patients with resected, HPV -positive oropharyngeal cancer with a lymph node 10 mm or smaller in level IB, the risk of level IB p athologic involvement was 2.5% (17). In a surgical series of 104 oropharyngeal patients who underwent neck dissections, there were no occult metastases to level IB (18) Parallel surgical studies in larynx cancer confirm similar patterns of disease. dos Santos et al performed 100 consecutive dissections for patients with T3 -4 or N1 -N2c disease, and only 2 (2%) patients had level I involvement (19). Mercante et al dissected 150 patients with larynx and hypopharynx cancer, finding no patients with level IB disease (20). Primary radiation -based series also show a very low risk of microscopic disease in level IB. Tam et al reported on 125 node -positive OPSCC patients from Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center treated with bilateral submandibular sparing radiotherapy, including 26% T3 -4 disease and 76% N2b or N2c, finding no submandibular recur rences (21) . In a very large patterns -of-failure study, Kjems study excluded level IB in the IMRT for all oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancers (unless it was clearly involved or the oral cavity was involved) , and there wa s only 1 oropharyngeal patient (out of 469) and no larynx patients (out of 253) with a level IB recurrence when it wasn’t initially included in the field (22). Thus excluding level IB from the treatment field is extremely reasonable in the absence of overt involvement or oral cavity extension."

The absolute risk of level V disease in Sanguineti et al was only 2.6% (17). Naiboglu et al. reported on the nodal pathology of 107 patients (43 oropharynx, 16 larynx) who underwent level V neck dissection (23). Although level V was involved in 13 patients (12.1%), it was only positive when nodes in l evels II -IV were positive . Similarly, Spriano et al dissected 346 clinically N0 necks in patients with larynx cancer, and only 10 out of 604 (1.6%) level V nodes were involved (24). In a node dissection study including 72 OPC and LXC patients, only 1 patient had a positive level V (1.4%) node without other nodes also being involved ( (25). Mohindra et al reported on a series of 35 patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiotherapy in which level V was spared ipsilaterally, and there were no recurrences in this echelon (26). In the Kjems study, in which level V in OPC or LXC was only included if obviously involved, there were no level V recurrences (22). The preponderance of extant data thus s upports sparing leve l V as well if that side has a low burden of nodal disease. Thus we would only treat level V if the patient has 2 or more involved nodes on a given side. Risk of disease in level IV (low neck nodes) Level IV lymph nodes start at the cricoid and exten d inferiorly into the supraclavicular fossa. Although they are nearly always included in the typical irradiation field, the surgical data actually suggests the risk is very low if the (superior) level III is uninvolved. For example, Sanguineti et al showed that the risk of occult level IV disease was just over 2.5% when level III lymph nodes were 8 mm or less (17). This estimate was supported by an oropharyngeal cancer surgical series from Lim et al, in which there w ere only 3 occult level IV metastases out of 104 necks, and all three occurred in combination with level III metastases (18). In a similar report from Lodder et al from Erasmus Medical Center, there was only 1 skip metastasis to level IV alone out of 92 oropharyngeal neck dissections (27). Chone et al performed a prospective study of results from laryngeal cancer neck dissections, finding that while 25% of 54 necks had le vel IV disease, they only were positive if level II or III w as positive (28). Similarly, Lim et al reported on 72 clinically N0 neck dissections, finding that only 3.5% of all necks contained level IV disease, all of which were ipsilateral, and there were skip metastases to level IV in only 2 necks ( 1.4% of all necks) (29) . As perhaps the best evidence that sparing level IV is oncologically sound, Kjem et al routinely spared level IV if level III was not clinically involved in OPC and LXC , and there were no solitary level IV recurrences (22). University of Chicago experience As one final supporting example to motivate this study, investigators at the University of Chicago performed a prospective phase II study titled RAVD (response -adapted volume de - escalation), in which all patients received 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy, and good responders (50% or greater) rec eived treatment just to the gross disease, without elective irradiation. (30) It’s notable that the investigators use d a large margin on gross disease (1.5 cm), presumably encompassing neighboring microscopic disease, but this group received no intentional elective irradiation. Patients without a good response received 45 Gy to the first uninvolved nodal echelon and then a boost to 75 Gy to gross disease plus 1.5 cm. No other elective nodal stations were irradiated. Of the 93 patients, 71 had OPC, and 7 had LXC. Much of the neck was still spared, even in poor responders. Since the majority (72%) of patients had ipsilateral d isease, most patients did not receive contralateral levels III and IV irradiation, and several presumably did not receive any contralateral RT at all.

Many organs -at-risk border elective treatment volumes rather than gross disease. 2. Solitary e lective volume failures are extremely rare (0 -5%). 3. 50 Gy to the elective regions is sufficient t o sterilize microscopic d isease and may even be too high, as randomized data suggest 40 Gy may be adequate. 4. Failures in elective nodal regions occur in previously identified , radiolo gically - negative, lymph nodes , as opposed to tissue without any prior evidence of a “benign” node. 5. Occult disease in level IB is extremely rare . 6. Occult disease in level V is extremely rare if levels II -IV contain minimal disease. 7. Occult disease in leve l IV is extremely rare if level III is uninvolved, and in general, as shown by the University of Chicago study, skip metastases (i.e. level III is involved without prior level II involvement) are very unusual. Given these observations , this study aims to significantly improve the acute and late morbidity of patients with oropharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma both by tailoring the elective irradiation only to regions with a legitimate risk of recurrence (> 5%) and by lowering the elective dose to 40 Gy. Level IB will not be electively treated unless it is involved with pathologic or suspicious lymphadenopathy. Level V will not be treated unless two or more ipsilateral nodal levels are invol ved (or level V itself has pathologic or suspicious adenopathy). Levels III and IV will only be irradiated if the immediately proximal level contains pathologic lymphadenopathy (i.e. level III irradiated if level II is positive; level IV irradiated if leve l III is positive). We anticipate that this approach should dramatically improve the acute and late complication profile. 1.5 Correlative Studies NA 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objectives 2.1.1 To determine the risk of solitary elective volume recurrence following elective volume and dose de -escalat ion. 2.1.1.1 Definition: solitary means that the recurrence occurred without a preceding or synchronous in -field or distant recurrence 2.2 Secondary Objectives 2.2.1 To determine patient -reported outcomes (PRO) following treatment with elective volume and dose de -escalation. 2.2.2 To describe the rates of grade 3 and 4 acute and late toxicities following elective volume and dose de -escalation."

It will be up to physician discretion as to which paradigm is applied to a given patient. The difference in the effective elective dose is expected to be trivial between these approaches.

IV contrast is recommended but not mandatory. 4.1.1.3 Primary tumor delineation and targeting The primary gross tumor volume (pGTV) will be contoured on the planning CT, using radiographic and clinical information to define its extent. The pGTV will be expanded by 5 mm to create the p PTV70. For patients with T1N0 OPSCC, pGTV plus 5 mm will create the pPTV66. 4.1.1.4 Primary elective volume delineation and targeting. The creation of the primary clinical target volume (pCTV 1), which is the primary elective volume, is a multi -step process. First, the pGTV will be expanded by 5-8 mm. Then any contours in structures that are a natural barrier to spread (e.g. bone) will be deleted. The pCTV1 is then expanded by 5-8 mm to create p PTV64; note this volume receives 40 Gy in the first 20 fractions, and then 1.6 Gy per fraction. A lower dose primary clinical target volume (pCTV2) will be designed by expanding the pGTV by typically 5-10 mm and deleting contours in structures that are a natural barrier to spread . The specific width here is reliant on physician discretion. The pCTV2 is then expanded by 5 -8 mm to create pPTV40. 4.1.1.5 Nodal tumor delineation and targeting. Visible lymph nodes will be categorized as benign, suspicious, or involved. By definition, a node is “involved” if it meets any of the following criteria:  Max SUV is greater than 3.0 (31)  The short -axis diameter is > 1.5 cm (level II), > 0.8 cm (retropharyngeal nodes), or > 1.0 cm for other nodal stations  The node shows central necrosis or heterogeneous enhancement  Lymph nodes whose max SUV is greater than mean liver SUV may be considered “involved” at the discretion of the treating physician. (32) A node is “suspicious” if it doesn’t meet the above criteria, but:"

The nodes will be expanded by 5 mm to create the PTV s. Lymph node stations will be contoured according to RTOG consensus guidelines (description and atlas included at https://www.rtog.org/CoreLab/ContouringAtl ases/HNAtlases.aspx) Contouring and dosing schemes are as followed: 4.1.1.5.1 Any in volved node receives 70 Gy (nPTV70) . The elective CTV must include this node plus 5 mm expansion to account for microscopic extranodal extension. 4.1.1.5.2 Any suspicious node receives 64 Gy (nPTV 64). In the first course, the node is treated to 40 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, then 1.6 Gy per fraction for 15 fractions. The station containing that node is treated in the elective CTV. The elective CTV must include this no de plus 5 mm expansion to account for microscopic extranodal extension. 4.1.1.5.3 For oropharynx primaries, level II is treated bilaterally (except in early -stage tonsil cancer, see Section 4.1.1.6.3 ). For either side of the neck, if level II does not contain an involved node then levels III -IV are not treated. If level III does not contain an involved node, then level IV is not treated. Level V is only treated if 2 levels of the neck are involved. When level IV and level V are treated, the entire level is included. 4.1.1.5.4 For larynx primaries, levels II -III are treated bilaterally . For either side of the neck, if level III does not contain an involved node, then level IV is not treated. Level V is only treated if 2 levels of the neck are involved. When level IV and level V are treated, the entire level is included. 4.1.1.5.5 A suspicious node does not lead to treatment of the next elective station. 4.1.1.5.6 Level IB is never treated unless it includes an involved or suspicious node , or there is oral cavity extension of the oropharynx primary tumor . 4.1.1.5. 7 If level II has an involved node, then upper level II (above the subdiagstric node) is treated to 40 Gy (nCTV4 0) because of poor salvage rates.

A node that is biopsied and negative may be treated as a negative node, regardless of imaging findings. 4.1.1.5.12 The ipsilateral and contralateral retropharyngeal nodes may be included in nCTV40 if there is soft palate invasion.

All adverse events after radiation treatment will be captured at the time of radiation oncology follow -up. Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring of subject safety and care . All subjects experiencing an a dverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug, will be monitored until:  the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse event return to baseline;  any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;  there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes observed; or  death. [Insert ed from Adverse Event Definitions and Reporting Section – Appendix II of the SCC DSMC Plan] 7.2.1 Definitions An adverse event is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human research study participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam , imaging finding or clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, clinical event, o r disease, temporarily associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not it is considered related to the subject’s participation in the research. Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psychological harms. Adverse events occur most commonly in the context of biomedical research, although on occasion, they can occur in the context of social and behavioral research. Adverse events may be expected or unexpected. Adverse Events will be reported as indicated by the appropriate following table (see below). Acute Adverse Events Adverse events occurring in the time period from the signing of the informed consent, through 90 days post treatment will be known as acute adverse events. All acute adverse events will be assessed and reported as per below . Late Adverse Events Adverse effects occurring in the time period from the end of acute monitoring, to 36 months post treatment, will be defined as late adverse events. These events will include all adverse events reported directly to a member of the study team and will be captured, assessed, graded and reported as appropriate . In addition, the study team will revi ew encounters in the following select specialty categories relevant to study endpoints: radiation oncology, medical oncology, and otolaryngology. The queried encounters will be limited in scope based on categorization of events; namely, encounters that rel ated to any head and neck or gastrointestinal event or problem Severity"

Adverse events not specifically defined in the NCI CTCAE will be scored on the Adverse Event log according to the general guidelines provided by the NCI CTCAE and as outlined below.  Grade 1: Mild  Grade 2: Moderate  Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life thre atening  Grade 4: Life threatening consequences  Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event Serious Adverse Events ICH Guideline E2A and the UTSW IRB define serious adverse events as those events, occurring at any dose, which meets any of the following cr iteria:  Results in death  Immediately life -threatening  Results in inpatient hospitalization1,2 or prolongation of existing hospitalization  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by definition an event that meets any of the above criteria. Serious adverse events may or may not be related to the research project. A serious adverse event determination does not require the event to be related to the research. That is, both events completely unrelated to the condition under s tudy and events that are expected in the context of the condition under study may be serious adverse events, independent of relatedness to the study itself. As examples, a car accident requiring >24 hour inpatient admission to the hospital would be a serio us adverse event for any research participant; likewise, in a study investigating end -stage cancer care, any hospitalization or death which occurs during the protocol -specified period of monitoring for adverse and serious adverse events would be a serious adverse event, even if the event observed is a primary clinical endpoint of the study . 1Pre-planned hospitalizations or elective surgeries are not considered SAEs. Note: If events occur during a pre -planned hospitalization or surgery, that prolong the exis ting hospitalization, those events should be evaluated and/or reported as SAEs . 2 NCI defines hospitalization for expedited AE reporting purposes as an inpatient hospital stay equal to or greater than 24 hours. Hospitalization is used as an indicator of the seriousness of the adverse event and should only be used for situations where the AE truly fits this definition and NOT for hospitalizations associated with less serious events. For example: a hospital visit where a patient is admitted for observation or minor treatment (e.g. hydration) and released in less than 24 hours. Furthermore, hospitalization for pharmacokinetic sampling is not an AE and therefore is not to be reported either as a routine AE or in an expedited report."

For device studies, part 812 uses the term unanticipated adverse device effect, which is defined in 21 CFR 812.3(s). Guidance from the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated problems to include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets ALL three (3) of the following criteria: • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); AND • Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. Note: According to OHRP, if the adverse event is serious, it would always suggest a greater risk of harm. Follow -up All adverse events will be followed up according to good medical practices. 7.3 Steps to Determine If a Serious Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting to the SCCC DSMC and/or HRPP Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4) . Step 2 : Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v4. Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy . Attribution categories are as follows: - Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment. - Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. - Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment. - Unlikely – The AE may NOT be related to the study treatment. - Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatmen Note : This includes all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol treatment . Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be reported accordingly. Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event . Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the treatment. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in:  the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section of this protocol (if applicable);"

All SAEs/UPIRSOs occurring during the protocol -specified monitoring period should be submitted to the SCCC DSMC within 5 business days of the PI or delegated study team members awareness of the event(s). In addition, for participating centers other than UTSW, local IRB guidance should be followed for local reporting of serious adverse events. The UTSW study team is responsible for submitting SAEs/UPIRSOs to the SCCC DSMC Coordinator. Hardcopies or electronic versions of the eIRB Reportable Event report; FDA Form #3500A forms, or other sponsor forms, if applicable; and/or any other supporting documentation available should be submitted to the DSMC Coordinator. The DSMC Coordinator forwards the information onto the DSMC Chairman who determines if immediate action is required. Follow -up eIRB reports, and all subsequent SAE /UPIRSO documentation that is available are also submitted to the DSMC Chair who determines if further action is required. (See Appendix III of the SCCC DSMC Plan for a template Serious Adverse Event Form which may be utilized when a sponsor form is unavailable and SAE submission to the eIRB is not required). If the event occurs on a multi -institutional clinical trial coordinated by the UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, the DOT Manager or lead coordinator ensures that all participating sites are notified of the event and resulting action, according to FDA guidance for expedited reporting. DSMC Chairperson reviews all SAEs/UPIRSOs upon receipt from the DSMC Coordinator.

Additional reporting requirements apply for research relying on a non - UT Southwestern IRB. According to UTSW HRPP/IRB policy, UPIRSOs are incidents, experiences, outcomes, etc. that meet ALL three (3) of the following criteria: 1. Unexpected in nature, frequency, or s everity (i.e., generally not expected in a subject’s underlying condition or not expected as a risk of the study; therefore, not included in the investigator’s brochure, protocol, or informed consent document),AND 2.

Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. Note: According to OHRP, if the adverse event is serious, it would always suggest a greater risk of harm. For purposes of this policy, UPIRSOs include unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) and death or serious injury related to a humanitarian use device (HUD). UPIRSOs must be promptly report ed to the UTSW IRB within 5 working days of PI awareness . For research relying on a non -UT Southwestern IRB (external, central, or single IRB) : Investigators relying on an external IRB who are conducting research on behalf of UT Southwestern or its affil iates are responsible for submitting LOCAL UPIRSOs to the UT Southwestern IRB within 5 working days of PI awareness . Investigators must report to their relying IRB according to the relying IRB’s policy. In addition, the external IRB’s responses or determin ations on these local events must be submitted to the UT Southwestern IRB within 10 working days of receipt . Events NOT meeting UPIRSO criteria : Events that do NOT meet UPIRSO criteria should be tracked, evaluated, summarized, and submitted to the UTSW HRPP/IRB at continuing review .

Although this drug see ms to act as an alkylating agent, there are data to indicate that its mode and sites of action are different from those of nitrogen mustard and the standard alkylating agents.  Storage and stability: Reconstituted solution of cisplatin is stable for 20 hours when stored at 27°C and should be protected from light if not used within 6 hours. The vials and injection should not be refrigerated. Cisplatin has been shown to react with aluminum needles, producing a black precipitate within 30 minutes.  Protocol dose: Bolus or weekly  Preparation: Each vial contains 10 mg of DDP, 19 mg of sodium chloride, 100 mg of mannitol, and hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. One vial is reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile water. The pH range will be 3.5 to 4.5. Cisplatin i njection also is available from the manufacturer in aqueous solution, each ml containing 1 mg cisplatin and 9 mg NaCl and HCL or NaOH to adjust pH.  Route of administration for this study: Intravenous  Incompatibilities: Cisplatin may interact with metal a luminium to form a black precipitate of platinum. All aluminium -containing IV sets, needles, catheters and syringes should be avoided. There is a total loss of cisplatin in 30 minutes at room temperature when mixed with metoclopramide and sodium metabisulp hite in concentrations equivalent to those that would be found on mixing with a commercial formulation of metoclopramide. Cisplatin and sodium bisulphite have been known to react chemically. Such antioxidants might inactivate cisplatin before administratio n if they are present in intravenous fluids.  Availability: Commercially available  Side effects: Human toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, renal toxicity (with an elevation of BUN and creatinine and impairment of endogenous creatinine clearance, as well a s renal tubular damage, which appears to be transient), ototoxicity (with hearing loss that initially is in the high -frequency range, as well as tinnitus), and hyperuricemia. Much more severe and prolonged toxicity has been observed in patients with abnorm al or obstructed urinary excretorytracts. Myelosuppression, often with delayed erythrosuppression, is expected.

Binds to the EGFR receptor (epidermal growth factor receptor)  Storage and stability: Reconstituted solution of cisplatin is stable for 20 hours when stored at 27°C and should be protected from light if not used within 6 hours. The vials and injection should not be refrigerated. Cisplatin has been shown to react with aluminum needles, producing a black precipitate within 30 minutes.  Protocol dose: Loading and then weekly  Preparation: Cetuximab must not be administered as an iv push or bolus. Cetuximab must be administered with the use of a low protein binding 0.22 -micrometer in -line filter. Cetuximab is supplied as a 50 -mL, single -use vial containing 100 mg of cetuximab at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline. The solution should be clear and colorless and may contain a small amount of easily visible white amorphous cetuximab particulates. DO NOT SHAKE OR D ILUTE. Cetuximab can be administered via infusion pump or syringe pump.  Route of administration for this study: Intravenous  Incompatibilities: It should not be mixed with any other compounds.  Availability: Commercially available  Side effects: Cetuximab may be associated with significant toxicities, most commonly fatigue, skin rash/folliculitis and paronychia, and gastrointestinal effects, nausea and diarrhea. Hypomagnesia is common. Of greatest concern is the potential for an allergic reaction, possibly anaphylaxis.

Paclitaxel vials should be stored between 2° -25°C (36° -77°F).  Protocol dose: Weekly  Preparation: Paclitaxel is a sterile solution concentrate, 6 mg/ml in 5 ml vials (30 mg/vial); 100 mg/16.7ml vial; or 300 mg/50 ml vial, in polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) 50% and dehydrated alcohol, USP, 50%. Improved solubility requires a mixed solvent system with furthe r dilutions of either 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water. The contents of the vial must be diluted just prior to clinical use. Paclitaxel, at the appropriate dose, will be diluted in 1000 ml of D5W, USP, in 5% polyolefin containers due to leachin g of diethylhexphthalate (DEHP) plasticizer from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags and intravenous tubing by the Cremophor vehicle in which paclitaxel is solubilized. Each bag/bottle should be prepared immediately before administration. Note : Formation of a sm all number of fibers in solution (acceptable limits established by the USP Particular Matter Test for LVP’s) have been observed after preparation of paclitaxel. Therefore, in -line filtration is necessary for administration of paclitaxel solutions. In -line filtration should be accomplished by incorporating a hydrophilic, microporous filter of pore size not greater than 0.22 microns (e.g.: Millex -GV Millipore Products) into the i.v. fluid pathway distal to the infusion pump. Although particulate formation does not indicate loss of drug potency, solutions exhibiting excessive particulate matter formation should not be used.  Route of administration for this study: Intravenous  Incompatibilities: Avoid the use of PVC bags and infusion sets due to leaching of DEHP (plasticizer).

Collaborating institutions will be encouraged to collect the same specimens per local institutional protocols, but that will not be paid for by UTSW or this study. If funding ultimately becomes available, we will perform genomic studies on these specimens to assess their ability to predict survival, local, and distant recurrence. The following information obtained from the subject's medical record may be provided t o research collaborators when specimens are made available:  Diagnosis  Collection time in relation to study treatment  Clinical outcome – if available  Demographic data 10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints 10.1.1 Primary endpoint: 2-year crude risk of solitary elective volume recurrence (SEVR). 10.1.2 Secondary endpoints: 10.1.2.1 Patient -reported outcomes: Difference in PRO measures between baseline and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following treatment: 10.1.2.1.1 EORTC QLQ -C30 Summary score 10.1.2.1.2 EORTC QLQ -C30 Physical and role functioning subscales 10.1.2.1.3 EORTC HN35 Dry mouth and sticky saliva subscales 10.1.2.1.4 MDADI global, emotional, functional and physical subscales 10.1.2.1.5 EQ-5D global score (0 -100) 10.1.2.2 Rate of grade 3 -5 acute (start of treatment through 90 days from the completion of treatment) and late (after 90 days from the completion of treatment) adverse events, according to NCI’s CTCAE v4.0 toxicity criteria. 10.1.2 .3 Prevalence of gas trostomy -dependence at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months from the end of treatment. 10.1.2 .4 Average patient utilities (derived from EQ -5D) at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months from the end of treatment. 10.1.2 .5 Overall survival probability at 2 years from the sta rt of treatment 10.1.2 .6 Progression -free survival probability at 2 years from the start of treatment"

Conditional power will be computed when the first 30 patie nts were followed for 2 years. If the conditional power is less than 50%, the trial will be discontinued. 10.3 Sample Size and Accrual The primary hypothesis is that the risk of elective or out-of-field failure (i.e. in largely unirradiated tissue ) is less than 10% more than the baseline risk. As a general rule, the 10% threshold is used as a reason to irradiate a given region, which is why we chose this number. A sample size of 60 achieves a 90% power to detect a non-inferiority difference of 0.1 using a one-sided exact test with a significance level (alpha) of 0.5. These results assume a baseline risk of 0.03 and that the actual difference is 0.0 Note that patients who develop recurrent disease that is not SEVR are not censored, since those patients would not have benefitted from dose to the elective regions (since they failed elsewhere, regardless). The same logic holds for patients who die. Thus, the only patients who need to be replaced are those who are lost to follo w-up so there is no 2-year endpoint. With the conservative assumption of 10% loss to follow -up, the final sample size will be 67 patients. 10.4 Data Analyses 10.3.1 Primary endpoint ( SEVR ) The crude risk of 2-year solitary elective volume recurrence will be calculated among all patients who are followed for at least 2 years. Patients who die before 2 years without an SEVR will be included in the denominator. A binomial 95% confidence interva l will be calculated. 10.3.1.1 Comparison of SEVR risks by p16 status and anatomic site Given the recognized difference in locoregional recurrence risk and survival between patients with p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer with p16-negative oropharyngeal cancer, we will perform several analyses on the risk of SEVR as a function of p16 status , as well as by anatomic site of origin. These comparisons will be important to confirm that the risk of solitary elective recurrence does not vary by histology or disease site. In addition to using SEVR as the endpoint, we will also include any elective volume recurrence as the outcome. These comparisons will include:  p16-positive versus p16-negative OPC  p16-positive, minimal smokers (< 10 pack -year) versus p16-positive smokers and p16-negative OPC"

Patients with disease recurrence will be excluded. The changes in these outcomes from baseline to these timepoints will be analyzed using generalized estimated equations (GEE). 10.3. 2.2 Toxicity Only adverse events assessed to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to protocol treatment will be considered. The rates of all Grade 3-5 adverse events, and death during or within 30 days of discontinuation of protocol treatment will be characteri zed. Predictors of high-grade acute and late toxicity will be determined using multivariable logistic regression. 10.3.2.3 Gastrostomy dependence The prevalence of gastrostomy use at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months will be described. Predictors of gastrostomy -dependence will be determined using multivariable logistic regression. 10.3. 2.4 Patient utilities The average patient utilities (derived from EQ-5D) at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months from the end of treatme nt will be described. Changes in patient utility will be analyzed using generalized estimated equations (GEE). These models will be used to estimate the beta coefficient for grade2 -3 xerostomia and grade 2-3 dysphagia, to produce an estimate of the utility decrement from this toxicity. 10.3.2.5 Overall survival Overall survival outcomes will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier approach. The Cox proportional hazard regression model will be used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for key covariates of interest, including age, T and N stage, and smoking status. Overall survival will be calculated from the initiation of treatment. 10.3.6 Progression -free survival Progression -free survival outcomes will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier approach. The Cox proportional hazard regression model will be used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for key covariates of interest, including age, T and N stage, and smoking status. Progression -free survival will be calculated from the initiation of treatment. 10.3.7 Locoregional recurr ence and distant metastasis The cumulative incidence of locoregional and distant failure will be estimated using cumulative incidence statistics, with death serving as the competing risk. A comparison of these endpoints will be performed using Gray’s test."

All investigators will follow the University conflict of interest policy . 11.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and funct ion in accordance with federally mandated regulations . The IRB must approve the consent form and protocol. In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the subject will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essent ial information has been provided to the subject and the investigator is assured that the subject understands the implications of participating in the study, the subject will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB -approved c onsent form. Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by the subject and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. 11.3 Required Documentation (for multi -site st udies) Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be provided to the research office.  A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed consent  IRB membership list or Federal -wide Assurance lette r  CVs and medical licensure for the principal investigator and any associate investigators who will be involved in the study  Form FDA 1572 appropriately filled out and signed with appropriate documentation (NOTE: this is required if {institution} holds the IND.

The eligibility checklist and confirming documentation will be entered electronically through the system. All research data will be recorded and entered into Case Report Forms using REDCap. Following registration, research staff from CRO will review all relevant data to ensure eligibility criteria have been met. The first number of the subject’s ID will r efer to the treatment site. The ordering is: 01: UTSW 02: Rush New subjects will receive a secondary number beginning with 001 upon study consent such that the first subject consented is numbered 001, the second subject consented receives the number 002, etc. Upon confirmation of eligibility and enrollment as per the afore -mentioned instructions, the subject will be assigned a tertiary number in the order of enrollment. For example, the first patient consented and enrolled at UTSW will have the number 0 1- 001-001. The third patient consented and second enrolled at Rush will have the number 02-003-002. Each newly consented subject should be numbered using the schema provided above. Upon registration, the registrar will assign the additional registration /randomization code according to the numbering schema outlined above, which should then be entered as the patient study in Velos upon updating the status to enrolled. The numbering schema should clearly identify the site number; the sequential number of the subject enrolled as well as the status of the subjects enrolled so that the number of subjects consented versus the number of subjects actually enrolled may be easily identified. 11.5 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing REDCap is the UTSW SCCC institut ional choice for the electronic data capture of case report forms for SCCC Investigator Initiated Trials. REDCap will be used for electronic case report forms in accordance with Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center requirements , as appropriate for the project Other institutions participating in this trial as sub -sites will be expected to enter data into REDCap and upload de -identified source materials when instructed by the Simmons Cancer Center study team to facilitate remote source to case report for m verification. In order to facilitate remote source to case report form verification, the Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center study team will require other institutions participating in this trial as sub -sites to enter data into the selected EDC system and upload selecte d de- identified source materials when instructed Trial monitoring will be conducted no less than annually and refers to a regular interval review of trial related activity and documentation performed by the DOT and/or the CRO Multi -Center IIT Monitor. Th is review includes but is not limited to accuracy of case report forms, protocol compliance, timeless and accuracy of Velos entries and AE/SAE management and reporting. Documentation of trial monitoring will be maintained along with other protocol related documents and will be reviewed during internal audit."

The UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center ( SCCC ) Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and patient safety for all UTSW SCCC clinical trials. As part of that responsibility, the DSMC reviews all local serious adverse events and UPIRSOs in real time as they are reported and reviews adverse events on a quarterly basis. The quality ass urance activity for the Clinical Research Office provides for periodic auditing of clinical research documents to ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance. A copy of the DSMC plan is available upon request. The SCCC DSMC meets quarterly and conduc ts annual comprehensive reviews of ongoing clinical trials, for which it serves as the DSMC of record. The QAC works as part of the DSMC to conduct regular audits based on the level of risk. Audit findings are reviewed at the next available DSMC meeting. In this way, frequency of DSMC monitoring is dependent upon the level of risk. Risk level is determined by the DSMC Chairman and a number of factors such as the phase of the study; the type of investigational agent, device or intervention being studied; a nd monitoring required to ensure the safety of study subjects based on the associated risks of the study. Protocol - specific DSMC plans must be consistent with these principles. 11.6 Adherence to the Protocol Except for an emergency situation , in which proper c are for the protection, safety, and well-being of the study subject requires alternative treatment, the study shall be conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol . 11.6.1 Exceptions (also called single -subject exceptions or single -subject waivers): include any departure from IRB -approved research that is not due to an emergency and is:  intentional on part of the investigator; or  in the investigator’s control; or  not intended as a systemic change (e.g., single -subject exceptions to eligibility [inclusion/exclusion] criteria)  Reporting requirement : Exceptions are non -emergency deviations that require prospective IRB approval before being implemented. Call the IRB if your request is urgent. If IRB approval is not obtained beforehand, this constitutes a major deviation. 11.6.2 Emergency Deviations: include any departure from IRB -approved research that is necessary to:  avoid immediate apparent harm, or  protect the life or physical well -being of subjects or others  Reporting requirement: Emergency deviations must be promptly reported to the IRB within 5 working days of occurrence . 11.6.3 Major Deviations (also called violations ): include any departure from IRB- approved research that:  Harmed or placed subject(s) or others at risk of harm (i.e., did or has the potential to negatively affect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects or others), or  Affect data quality (e.g., the completeness, accuracy, reliability, or validity of the data ) or the science of the research (e.g., the primary outcome/endpoint of"

A summary of change s document outlining proposed changes as well as rationale for changes, when appropriate, is highly recommended. When an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risk to the patient, a revised consent form might be required . The written amendment, and if required the amended consent form, must be sent to the IRB for approval prior to implementation . 11.8 Record Retention Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, source documents, Sponsor -Investigator correspondence, monitoring logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms). Source documents include all recordings of observations or no tations of clinical activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study. Government agency regulations and directives require that the study investigator retain all study documentation pert aining to the conduct of a clinical trial . In the case of a study with a drug seeking regulatory approval and marketing, these documents shall be retained for at least two years after the last approval of marketing application in an International Conferenc e on Harmonization (ICH) region . In all other cases, study documents should be kept on file until three years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study. 11.9 Obligations of Investigators The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declaration of Helsinki . The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally overseeing the treatment of all study patients . The Principal Investigator must assure that all study site personnel, including sub -investigators and other study staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion."
