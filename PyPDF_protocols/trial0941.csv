The primary outcome is visual field mean deviation change at first of Month 6 (26 weeks) or time of treatment failure of the eligible eye (s), followed by a continuation study to assess time to treatment failure. The determination of eligible eye (s) is based on meeting the eligibility criteria at baseline. Study Objectives Primary objective: to determine whether the efficacy of stereotactic ventriculo -peritonea l CSF shunting (VPS) with medical therapy is superior to medical therapy alone or optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) with medical therapy in reducing or reversing visual loss in subjects with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and moderate to severe visual loss. Secondary objective: To assess time to treatment failure over up to 3 years. Study Design Multi -center randomized single -masked phase 3 clinical trial  RCT is followed by a treatment failure identification phase (up to 3 years of follow -up tot al) Number of Sites ~40 sites Endpoint Primary Efficacy Outcome:  Change from baseline to first of Month 6 (Week 26) or time of treatment failure in PMD (perimetric mean deviation) in eligible eye(s) with the size V stimulus. Key Secondary Efficacy Outcom es:  Time from randomization to treatment failure  CSF pressure measurement by lumbar puncture  Papilledema grade  OCT measures  QOL assessments  Visual field examination ratings (improved, remained the same, or worsened) Key Safety Outcomes: Vision loss, all re ported adverse events Other Key Outcomes: Change in weight"

Subject Duration ~7 months - 3 years Protocol Overview/Synopsis After signing the info rmed consent form, potential subjects will be assessed for eligibility, including eliciting medical and neurologic history, measurement of best -corrected visual acuity, visual field testing, ophthalmoscopy with optic disc edema grading, physical examinatio n, and OCT. Questionnaires will be completed. Blood will be drawn for CBC, electrolytes, liver function tests, renal function tests, amylase if not done as part of routine care within 4 weeks and a pregnancy test will be performed (women of childbearing p otential). Two visual field examinations using a size V stimulus will need to be performed at the Screening /Baseline Visit . The size V fields will be sent to the VFRC to confirm eligibil ity or determine that testing must be repeated for the subject. Eligible individuals will be randomly assigned with equal allocation to one of 3 treatment groups: (1) medical therapy, (2) medical therapy plus ONSF, or (3) medical therapy plus VPS. Acetazol amide should be started on the day of randomization. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible, ideally within 3 days of randomization, but not more than 7 days. Medica l therapy will consist of a low sodium weight loss diet and acetazolamide with or without furosemide. Treatment will start with acetazolamide 2 gram s per day, with the dose increased as tolerated up to 4 grams per day. If there is no clinical improvement after 2 weeks of maximal dosage of acetazolamide, furosemide will be started at a dose of 40 mg per day (along with potassium) and titrated up to 160 -200 mg per day. Pharmacotherapy will be tapered when there is improvement in the papilledema grade, substantial improvement in the PMD and improvement in symptoms or when there is a safet y concern . The primary outcome is measured at the first of 6 months (26 weeks) or time of treatment failure . During the randomized trial, follow -up visits will occur after weeks 4, 8 , 16, and 26 (± 7 days). Safety visits will occur after weeks 1 and 2 (± 4 days) . Additional office visits may occur as needed. Phone contacts will occur after 12 and 20 weeks (±7 days). After the 6 -month primary outcome visit, subjects will transition to the Treatment Failure Identification Phase for up to 3 years . Ongoing treatment will continue following the guidelines for the first six months as long as treatment failure criteria are not met at which time treatment will be at the discretion of the Site Investigator. Investigators are urged to employ treatments from another arm of the study before other treatments under these circumstances."

Its incidenc e is rising with the obesity 4 epidemic, with about 22.5 new cases each year per 100,000 overweight women of childbearing 5 age. It affects at least 100,000 Americans. Because of pressure on the optic nerve (papilledema), 6 86% have visual loss and 10% develop s evere visual loss.1 7 We recently completed the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT), a 8 multicenter, randomized, double -masked, placebo -controlled study of 165 subjects with IIH and 9 mild vi sual loss. We showed that the acetazolamide -plus-diet regimen was significantly superior 10 to placebo -plus-diet for improving perimetric mean deviation (PMD), papilledema grade, quality 11 of life measures (QoL) and intracranial pressure.2 12 In patients with IIH who have moderate to severe visual loss at presentation, no intervention, 13 neither medical nor the various surgical treatments, has been verified as efficacious by well - 14 designed clinical trials. The Neuro -Ophthal mology Research Disease Investigator Consortium 15 (NORDIC) Network has identified management of moderate to severe visual loss in IIH as an 16 investigational priority. The NORDIC Executive Committee has provided the guidance for the 17 development of a second pro spective IIH treatment trial, the Surgical IIHTT (SIGHT – 18 pronounced “Sight”). NORDIC will provide the infrastructure to accomplish the proposed study, 19 consisting of experienced study leadership, ~40 sites (most of whom had successfully executed 20 the IIHTT), Coordinating Center, Reading Centers, and an Enrollment Center. The goals of the 21 proposed study are: (1a) to establish evidence -based treatment strategies to restore and protect 22 vision in IIH patients with moderate to severe visual loss; (1b) to compare c urrently used 23 treatment strategies with respect to the cumulative probability of treatment failure over time to 24 determine long -term outcomes; (2a) to determine how interventions that purportedly lower 25 intracranial pressure affect deformation of the peripap illary retinal pigment epithelial – Bruch’s 26 membrane layer (ppRPE/BM layer) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging; and 27 (2b) to determine the predictive value of OCT retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness at 28 baseline for visual outcome. 29 To address these aims, we will enroll 180 newly diagnosed* IIH patients with a perimetric mean 30 deviation (PMD) between -6 and -27 dB in at least one eye, as determined by full threshold 31 standard automated perimetry using the size V stimulus. We will compare th e efficacy of 1) 32 medical therapy alone, 2) surgical intervention via optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) with 33 medical therapy, and 3) surgical intervention via ventriculo -peritoneal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 34 shunting with medical therapy. Subjects will be followed for an initial 6 -month intervention 35 phase, followed by transition to the treatment failure identification phase with clinical follow -up 36 at 12 months, 24 months , and 36 months . After one year, there will be quarterly telephone 37 contact to determi ne the subject’s clinical status. 38 * Nearly all subjects will be “newly diagnosed;” however, if a patient was previously diagnosed but not treated, they will undergo another evaluation for IIH and visual loss to assess eligibility. We expect this situation to be rare."

The first stage (20% of IIH patients) exhibits 41 papilledema and symptoms, but no visual field loss. The second stage (40% of cases ), the target 42 for the IIHTT, is characterized by mild visual field defects and prompts effective intervention. 43 The third stage (30% of cases), a target for the SIGHT, is characterized by moderate visual loss. 44 Stage three patients have symptomatic vision lo ss and current thinking, without class I or II 45 evidence, suggests that aggressive intervention is required to prevent blindness. In the fourth 46 stage (10% of cases), also a target for the SIGHT, severe visual loss occurs, which can worsen 47 rapidly to blindne ss. 48 Medical treatments, including diet, acetazolamide, and furosemide, are the interventions usually 49 employed for the first two stages of IIH. Several retrospective studies of obese patients with IIH 50 suggest that weight loss may be associated with reductio n in papilledema grade. The IIHTT 51 demonstrated that acetazolamide -plus-diet led to a statistically significant improvement in vision 52 and significant improvements in papilledema grade, CSF pressure, and quality of life measures at 53 6 months compared to place bo-plus-diet in patients with mild visual loss. 54 Surgical treatments, such as ONSF and CSF shunting, with or without medical therapy, are 55 commonly employed in the third and fourth stages of IIH. 56 1.2.2 Optic Nerve Sheath Fenestration for IIH 57 Hayreh,3 using a primate model, demonstrated efficacy of ONSF for relief of experimental 58 papilledema. Later, Smith et al.4 reported successful relief of papilledema in a human after 59 ONSF. ONSF consists of either creating a window or making a series of slits in the optic nerve 60 dural sheath just behind the globe in one eye. This treatment has been used for patients with 61 progressive visual loss, and over 50% of patients with IIH have post -operative headache relief.5 62 Several hypotheses exist as to the mechanism of action of ONSF. The demonstration of fistula 63 formation6,7 and some improvement of papilledema in the unoperated eye suggest that ONSF 64 efficacy may be due to local decompression of the subarachnoid space with filtration of CSF into 65 the orbit.8 CSF pressure may be modestly lowered post -operatively, but the duration and 66 magnitude of this effect is unknown. Another possible long -term mechanism of action of ONSF 67 may be secondary closure of the subarachnoid space via fibrosis at the surgical site, thereby 68 preventing transmission of pressure to the optic nerve head.9,7 The success of surgical 69 decompression of the optic nerve, however, may be limited by several factors that are no t yet 70 fully understood. Trabeculations within the retrobulbar subarachnoid space may contribute to 71 resistance of bidirectional CSF flow between the optic nerve sheath and the intracranial 72 subarachnoid space; this compartmentalization of CSF, demonstrated i n vivo by Killer et al.,10 73 may be responsible for the occasional failure of the fellow eye to improve after ONSF.11 On the 74 other hand, there may be free flow from the fenestration site to the full CSF space and a 75 generalized pressure lowering effect may occur. It is not known which if either of these 76 mechanisms prevails. 77 A meta -analysis of large case series suggests efficacy of ONSF in IIH. Post -operative visual 78 acuity or visual field results were equal to, or better than, pre -operative results in 87% of patients 79"
17,page_17,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 18 OF 87 reported; however, 13% of patients had worse vision in the post -operative period. A report on 75 80 eyes from 54 patients undergoing ONSF suggested that patients undergoing ONSF may have 81 substantial long -term failure rates.12 This study defined perimetric mean deviation worsening as 82 > 2 dB deterioration in PMD post -operatively on a single visual field exam. By this crit erion, 83 68% of eyes improved or stabilized and 32% worsened. However, these results are suspect since 84 a 2 dB or greater mean deviation worsening is within observed individual retest variability in 85 patients with moderate to severe visual field damage and a c onfirming visual field should have 86 been required.13 Although ONSF appears to be helpful in the short term for visual loss, other 87 interventions, such as weight loss or acetazolamide, may have a delayed, but long -term benefit. 88 There are no quality of life (QoL) studies of ONSF in IIH. The uncertainties concerning the 89 short - and long -term efficacy and safety of ONSF in moderate to severe IIH can only be 90 addressed with a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. 91 1.2.3 CSF Shunting for IIH 92 Various CSF shunting procedures have been employed for the treatment of IIH, including 93 lumbo -peritoneal (LP), ventriculo -atrial (VA), ventriculo -jugular, and ventriculo -peritoneal (VP) 94 shunting.14-17 In general, the indication for a CSF shunting procedure has been failed medical 95 therapy or intractable headache. Most series document efficacy in preserving vision in most 96 cases, but there was a high rate of shunt failure and shunt revisions were often required.14-18 97 While shunting preserved vision in many patients, long -term headache relief was achieved in 98 only 50% o ver 36 months.19 Many of the shunts inserted were lumbo -peritoneal; these are now 99 out of favor due to a high complication rate, which includes frequent shunt occlusion, infection, 100 and intracranial hypotension. S tereotactically inserted ventriculo -peritoneal shunts (VPS) have a 101 lower failure and complication rate, and are easier to monitor and adjust.19-22 102 There is no consens us regarding strategies for therapeutic intervention for IIH patients with 103 moderate to severe visual loss. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action of the treatments and their 104 effectiveness remain uncertain.23 Various therapies have been used to treat IIH, but prior to the 105 IIHTT, their safety and efficacy had not been adequately evaluated in prospective, randomized, 106 controlled trials. Although there are large variations in practice, most physicians wait until there 107 is more advanced visual loss before recommending a surgical intervention. However, all studies 108 evaluating interventions for IIH with more advanced visual loss are anecdotal, retrospective, and 109 uncontrolled. Also, the various surgical procedures for IIH hav e not been compared with regards 110 to efficacy, safety, complication rate, and long -term outcome. Thus, as confirmed by a recent 111 Cochrane review, there is an inadequate evidence base to guide clinicians in management of 112 IIH patients with moderate to severe v ision loss.24 113 Based on Curry’s results and extrapolating to 2014, estimating 2500 CSF shunt surgeries per 114 year at a cost of about $38,500 per patient, and 250 ONSF surgeries at $23,000 per patient, 115 surgical cost s for IIH are estimated at $102 million per year.25 Friesner and colleagues come to a 116 similar conclusion regarding surgical costs. In addition, they estimated in 2007 dollars the total 117 costs due to IIH to be $44 4 million per year,26 so it is imperative that we obtain high quality data 118 regarding the efficacy and safety of surgical treatments for IIH. 119"

Due to a small number of 127 shunt patients, 3 additional sites were asked to abstract charts. Visual field outcomes (PMD) at 3 - 128 12 months after intervention were analyzed. Of 298 subjects meeting eligibility criteria stated 129 above, 91 had pre - and post -intervention Humphrey Field Analyzer data available for analysis. 130 (Table 1). 131 Table 1.

19,page_19,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 20 OF 87 1.2.5 Use of OCT in Monitoring Papilledema in IIH 140 Papilledema is typically quantified from fundus photographs using the Frisén grading scale.1 141 OCT can be used to objectively measure the degree of swelling and monitor treatment effects. 142 Time -domain OCT provides cross sectional images of multiple retinal layers and the 143 peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RN FL) with a resolution of approximately 10 microns.2-5 144 OCT has several advantages, based on optics, when compared to photographic imaging. OCT is 145 also reasonably repro ducible on repeat measurements in normal eyes and in eyes with 146 glaucoma.6-11 Limitations include no current algorithm specific for optic disc edema, particularly 147 when it is severe. Fundus photography, the current gold standard and the technique that was used 148 in the IIHTT, requires skilled interpretation of features that can be difficult to quantify. 149 Most prior OCT studies have investigated disorders that cause RNFL thi nning; few report the 150 effects of papilledema on RNFL or total retinal thickness. Time -domain OCT has been compared 151 to fundus photographs in children with IIH.12 Another study measured RNFL thickness, using 152 scann ing laser polarimetry (SLP) and not OCT, in IIH.13 OCT has demonstrated subretinal 153 macular fluid in patients with papilledema,14 and we and others have shown RNFL thi ckening 154 using OCT in patients with acute optic neuritis.15-17 We have also found that OCT is superior to 155 SLP in demonstrating and quantifying papilledema.18 Other studies have compared RNFL 156 thickness in papilledema and pseudopapilledema, but have not compared results with fundus 157 photograph grades.19,20 When using time -domain OCT in patients with severe papilledema, there 158 can be inaccurate placement of the peripapillary ring to measure optic disc elevation and RNFL 159 thickness, as well as failure of the algorithm used to measure RNFL thickn ess. 160 Newer three -dimensional spectral -domain OCT (SD -OCT) methods, such as the cube scan for 161 data collection, give flexibility to find the exact measures of interest with increased resolution 162 and scanning speed to acquire data over a wider area, thereby re ducing sampling errors for 163 higher density and faster scans (512 x 128 axial B -scans for a 6 mm2 area).21 Coupling these 164 advances with refined algorithms will improve the reproducibility and quantification of 165 papilledema and RNFL alterations, even when swelling obscures the disc borders. Higher scan 166 density should improve measurement of localized RNFL defects, which can be related to visual 167 field loss. 168 1.3 Rationale 169 1.3.1 Discussion of Study Design 170 1.3.1.1 Visual Field Monitoring 171 Patients who are newly diagnosed with IIH with moderate to severe visual field loss (with PMD 172 between -6 dB and -27 dB with full threshold size V testing ) may be treated with medical or 173 surgical therapy. The current thinking, without class I or II evidence, suggests that aggressive 174 intervention is required to prevent further visual deterioration and blindness. However, it is 175 unclear if any of these treatments are effective for treating this subset of IIH patients. Patients 176 with milder visual loss may benefit from medical therapy alone, as shown by the IIHTT. 177"
20,page_20,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 21 OF 87 Being an average, the PMD is a summary statistic that is less prone to perimetric variability than 178 using individual or groups of test locations. It is assumed that visual loss by visual field 179 examination best reflects neural damage due to increased intracranial pressure and in the IIHTT 180 correlated well with QoL measures. 181 Standard automated perimetry uses size III stimuli. There is now considerable evidence that 182 automated perimetry using size V stimuli has advantages in patients with moderate to severe 183 visual loss.29,30,32-36 Thes e advantages include lower retest variability and about one additional 184 log unit (10 dB) of useful dynamic range. Use of the larger size V stimuli also makes for an 185 easier test for the patient due to an increase in visual field area in moderate to severely damaged 186 visual fields. In addition, the size V stimulus was recently successfully used in another NEI 187 sponsored clinical trial investigating retinitis pigmentosa.31 Use in this trial will demonstrate its 188 utility for optic neuropathies and we will relate size V results to the conventional size III results. 189 1.3.1.2 OCT Monitoring 190 OCT analysis routines have been developed and optimized for glaucoma. Recent data suggest 191 that OCT appears to be the best imaging modality to mon itor papilledema and other optic 192 neuropathies. In the IIHTT OCT sub -study, 89 subjects’ (43 acetazolamide and 46 placebo) OCT 193 measurements of swelling, average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL), total retina 194 thickness (TRT), and optic nerve head v olume (ONHV) were similar in both treatment groups at 195 baseline. At 6 months, the swelling in study eyes was reduced in both groups, but the 196 acetazolamide group showed more reduction in RNFL (174 µm vs. 93 µm, p=0.001), TRT (218 197 µm vs. 121 µm, p=0.001), and ONHV (4.9 µm3 vs. 2.4 µm3, p=0.001) when compared with the 198 placebo group.37 199 Furthermore, OCT showed greater improvements in the optic neural canal shape (inward 200 deviation of the peripapillary RPE/Bruch’s membra ne borders) in the acetazolamide group than 201 in the placebo group.38 Sibony et al.39 in another study showed reduction in the RNFL and less 202 inward deviation of the per ipapillary RPE/Bruch’s membrane borders following interventions 203 that lower intracranial pressure, such as lumbar puncture, VPS and acetazolamide treatment (see 204 Figure 2). 205"

Mean posterior displacement of the RPE -Bruch’s membrane complex from pre - to post, 207 following interventions (left to right: LP, VP shunt, ACZ) to lower intracranial pressure in IIH39. 208 We have also shown in a case series that the peripapillary RPE/Bruch’s membrane positioning 209 normalize d within days of intracranial pressure -lowering procedures. These changes can also be 210 seen in eyes with optic atrophy and no apparent papilledema. The deformation of the 211 RPE/Bruch's membrane position appears to be an acute biomarker of changes in intracran ial 212 pressure, whereas the optic nerve morphology (edema) is a chronic biomarker that takes at least 213 1-2 weeks to respond. In some cases, the RNFL or ONH volume may be decreasing, but the 214 RPE/Bruch's membrane does not change, suggesting that intracranial pr essure may not be 215 changing, yet axoplasmic flow may be improving or RNFL loss may be occurring. OCT will be 216 done before lumbar puncture at screening /baseline and again at 6 months , to further characterize 217 RPE/Bruch’s membrane changes. The RPE/Bruch's membrane biomarker may represent a non - 218 invasive objec tive method of monitoring intracranial pressure and, thus, may serve as a surrogate 219 for identifying changes in intracranial pressure. 220 In another study evaluating 31 IIH patients with visual acuity of 20/25 or worse at presentation, 221 macula ganglion cell lay er thickness at presentation was mildly correlated (r=0.44, p=0.005), and 222 at 2-3 weeks after presentation was strongly correlated (r=0.76, p=0.0001), with visual field 223 outcome. Furthermore, a reduction of the ganglion cell layer thickness of > 10 µm within 2-3 224 weeks of presentation was also associated with a worse visual field outcome.40 225 We plan to further study changes in OCT parameters to determine their validity as biomarkers 226 for changes in intracranial pressu re and optic nerve damage. Preliminary studies suggest that 227 OCT may facilitate early identification of optic nerve injury due to papilledema and have 228 prognostic significance. We anticipate that OCT will provide information that helps guide 229 treatment decisi ons. 230 1.3.1.3 Discussion of Subject Characteristics 231 This study will enroll 180 individuals with IIH who are 18 -63 years of age. This age range 232 represents the population that is most likely to be affected by IIH. Children under 13 will not be 233 included because IIH ap pears to be a different disease in this age group (no correlation with 234"

Adolescents will not be eligible for the 235 SIGHT since attrition in weight loss programs within this group of subjects is substant ial, as high 236 as 73% in some reports.41 Only high intensity behavioral modification targeted towards children, 237 combined with physical activity program and/or drug therapies have been shown to be effective 238 in smal l studies. The SIGHT lacks the expertise and means to safely conduct this therapy of 239 weight management in children. Further, the IIHTT provided data to measure the risk of high 240 dose acetazolamide in adults. No such safety data is known in adolescents and t he principal 241 safety measures in the SIGHT will center on preservation of vision and surgical complications. 242 We will exclude pregnant women and prisoners. We anticipate that the cohort will be primarily 243 composed of women in their childbearing years that are overweight. Data available on the 244 prevalence of IIH in the US population is limited. The best information on the demographic 245 distribution of this condition comes from the IIHTT. Ninety -eight percent of trial subjects were 246 women with a mean age of 29 ± 7. 4 years. With regard to race, 65% of subjects were White, 247 25% were Black, and 10% reported another race. Thirteen percent of IIHTT subjects reported 248 being Hispanic or Latino. As was the case for IIHTT, there will be substantial diversity in the 249 types of en rollment centers used in SIGHT including private and university –based practices in 250 both urban and rural settings. Every effort will be made to enroll a diverse population in the 251 SIGHT. 252 1.3.2 Rationale for Medical and Surgical Treatment 253 1.3.2.1 Medical Therapy 254 Medical th erapy will consist of acetazolamide, furosemide when needed, and dietary 255 intervention. The dosage of acetazolamide will be titrated from eight tablets daily ( 2,000 mg 256 daily) to a maximum of 16 tablets daily (4 gm daily), as tolerated, taken in divided dose s (bid) 257 with meals. Four grams daily is the largest dosage used in clinical practice. In the IIHTT, the 258 mean dosage used was 2.5 gm/day; 40% of subjects could tolerate 4 gm/day. 259 If the subject has side effects that substantially interfere with activities o f daily living, we will 260 use the highest dosage of study medication tolerated with a minimum of 1/2 tablet (125 mg 261 acetazolamide) per day. Those failing to clinically improve by two weeks after achieving the 262 maximally tolerated dosage of acetazolamide will be titrated up to 80 -100 mg twice daily of 263 furosemide (minimum dosage 20 mg per day) with potassium supplementation of 20 meq for 264 each 40 mg of furosemide, as hypokalemia commonly occurs with this regimen.42-44 A diet rich 265 in potassium (fresh fruits and vegetables) will be encouraged for those taking furosemide and 266 further supplementation will be given as needed. 267"

The treatment plan will be individualized and 269 may include consultation with a dietician or referral to a formal weight loss program. Regression 270 of papilledema and sym ptoms often occurs with a weight loss of 6% of initial body weight that 271 may take months to achieve.2,45,46 The IIHTT demo nstrated that both the acetazolamide group 272 and the placebo group achieved a reduction in weight.2 The goal of the intervention in the 273 SIGHT will also be 6% weight loss at six months. 274 1.3.2.2 Optic Nerve Sheath Fenestrat ion 275 ONSF consists of either creating a window or making a series of slits in the optic nerve dural 276 sheath just behind the globe. This treatment has been used for patients with progressive visual 277 loss due to IIH. The demonstration of fistula formation6,7 and some improvement of papilledema 278 in the unoperated eye suggest that ONSF efficacy may be secondary to local decompression of 279 the subarachnoid space with filtration o f CSF into the orbit.8 CSF pressure may be modestly 280 lowered post -operatively, but the duration of this effect is unknown. In a meta -analysis of large 281 case series of ONSF for IIH (Table 2), post -operative visual acuity or visual field results were 282 equal to, or better than, pre -operative vision in 87% of patients reported. However, 13% of 283 patients had worse vision in the post -operative period. Up to 50% of patients have post -operative 284 headache relief with ONSF.5 A report on 75 eyes of 54 patients undergoing ONSF suggested that 285 patients undergoing ONSF may have substantial long -term failure rates.12 286 Table 2.

In general, the 289 indication for a CSF shunting procedure has been failed medical therapy or intractable headache. 290 The case series document efficacy in preserving vision in most cases (Table 3), but reveal a high 291 rate of shunt failure and, thus, shunt revisions were often needed.14-18 Compared to other 292 shunting approaches (e.g., lumbo -peritoneal shunts), stereotactic ventriculo -peritoneal shunts 293 (VPS) have lower failure and complication rates, and are easier to monitor and adjust.19-22 While 294 the shunting procedures preserved vision in many patients, long -term headache relief was 295 achieved in only 50% after 36 m onths in one study.19 296 Table 3.

Change in the PMD with stimulus 303 size V from baseline to the first of Month 6 or time o f treatment failure in the eye (s) qualifying 304 for study entry will be the primary outcome variable. 305 1.4.2 Secondary Objectives 306 Secondary objectives are to compare changes in the following from baseline to 6 months among 307 the three study groups: 308  PMD with stimulus s ize V in the best eye qualifying for study entry 309  Papilledema grade (Photographic Reading Center and site investigator ratings) 310  OCT measures of: 311  Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness 312  Retinal ganglion cell layer thickness 313  Peripapillary retinal pigment epitheli al (RPE)/Bruch’s membrane deformation 314  CSF pressure 315  Visual acuity 316  Quality of life (QoL) measures (NEI -VFQ -25 + 10 -item neuro -ophthalmic supplement 317 and the SF -36) 318  Headache disability (HIT -6 Inventory) 319  Headache severity 320 Other efficacy outcome variables, deter mined at Month 6, include treatment failure, surgical 321 failure, presence of headache, presence of transient visual obscurations, and visual field 322 examination ratings (improved, no change, worse) by the Visual Field Reading Center. 323 With the exception of CSF pressure, these outcome variables wil l also be examined at Months 324 12, 24 and 36 . 325 Of special interest and a very important outcome is the time from randomization to treatment 326 failure. Subjects will be followed for up to 3 years and the number of surgical fa ilures and 327 treatment failures will be analyzed. While a therapy may have a beneficial outcome at 6 months, 328 it may not have a good outcome 1 -3 years later; therefore, this is an important analysis. 329"
26,page_26,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 27 OF 87 Measures of safety include the following: 330  Adverse events 331  Serious adverse events 332  Procedure complications and transient malfunctions of surgical procedures 333  Blood pressure 334  Laboratory test results (CBC with platelet count, electrolytes, potassium, bicarbonate, and 335 liver function tests) 336 1.4.3 Other Outcomes 337  Anthropometric m easures (weight, waist circumference) 338 1.5 Potential Risks and Benefits of the Study Interventions 339 1.5.1 Known Potential Risks 340 1.5.1.1 Visual Loss 341 The primary risk of IIH is visual loss associated with papilledema. Subjects reaching treatment 342 failure criteria will remain in the study but will be managed by the site investigators. 343 1.5.1.2 Acetazolamide 344 Acetazolamide frequently causes paresthesias, altered taste sensation, asymptomatic metabolic 345 acidosis (low serum bicarbonate), and fatigue. There is a small risk of kidney stones, and , very 346 rarely, renal failure from acute tubular necrosis, liver enzyme changes, elevation of serum 347 amylase, blood dyscrasias, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, and aplastic anemia. Based on the IIHTT, 348 we anticipate that renal stones and allergic rashes will occur, though infrequently. Guidance on 349 management of liver enzyme changes and renal stones is provided in the MOP. While there was 350 minimal potassium loss in some IIHTT subjects treated with acetazolamide, there were no 351 instances of hypokalemia requiring potassi um supplementation. 352 Subjects will have laboratory studies throughout the study period to monitor their electrolytes. 353 Aplastic anemia can occur in an individual by an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction and 354 cannot be predicted by routine monitoring of t he blood count. Some patients may be allergic to 355 acetazolamide, developing a rash (most common reaction), angioedema, stridor, or rarely, 356 anaphylaxis. A history of sulfa allergy will not be an exclusion criterion due to the lack of 357 evidence for cross react ivity with acetazolamide.72 The study medication will be discontinued 358 immediately if there is any evidence of an allergic reaction. At the conclusion of the subject’s 359 participation in the study, their treating physician will arrange a treatment plan independent of 360 the study. 361"
27,page_27,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 28 OF 87 Hypokalemia: Epstein et al.73 showed no evidence of clinically significant hypokalemia in 92 362 patients on acetazolamide unless they were also taki ng other diuretics. We confirmed this in the 363 IIHTT.2 Since acetazolamide -induced hypokalemia is so uncommon, serum electrolytes will be 364 obtained at 1 month, 4 months, and 6 months (unless subjects develop sympto ms of 365 hypokalemia: weakness, fatigue, and muscle cramps). If a subject also requires treatment with 366 furosemide, he/she will have close monitoring of serum electrolytes (including serum sodium 367 and potassium) prior to each change in dosage, to be performed a t a local laboratory. The dosage 368 of furosemide will not be increased until it is documented that the potassium level is in the 369 normal range. Once the final furosemide dosage has been reached, electrolytes will be checked at 370 each visit. 371 Aplastic Anemia: Ace tazolamide -induced aplastic anemia is dosage independent, usually 372 delayed in onset, and usually fatal. According to prior studies74,75, the incidence has been 373 estimat ed as 1 per 15,000 patient years with a mean age of 71 years (range 56 -86 years). The 374 average onset is 3.5 months after initiation of treatment; it rarely occurs after six months of 375 treatment. Monitoring of CBCs is not the standard of care. We will obtain a CBC at baseline and 376 4 months , and 6 months . 377 1.5.1.3 Furosemide 378 Hypokalemia is the most common important side effect of furosemide. Supplemental potassium 379 chloride and, if required, an aldosterone antagonist are helpful in preventing hypokalemia and 380 metabolic alk alosis. Cases of tinnitus and reversible or irreversible hearing impairment and 381 deafness have been reported in people taking furosemide. Reports usually indicate that 382 furosemide ototoxicity is associated with rapid injection, severe renal impairment, the u se of 383 higher than recommended doses, hypoproteinemia or concomitant therapy with aminoglycoside 384 antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, or other ototoxic drugs. Excessive diuresis from furosemide can 385 occur that may require measures to prevent dehydration and hypoten sion. Asymptomatic 386 hyperuricemia can occur and gout may rarely be precipitated. 387 In summary, common side effects of furosemide are orthostatic hypotension and hypokalemia. 388 Less frequent side effects are hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, and 389 hypomag nesemia. Also infrequent are cramps, diarrhea, drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, 390 stomach cramps and photosensitivity. 391 1.5.2 Known Potential Benefits 392 Benefits from participation in the study include assignment to a treatment routinely used in 393 clinical prac tice, easy access to care for IIH, closer and more careful follow -up assessments 394 evaluating vision. Hopefully, in the future, other people might benefit from this study because of 395 the knowledge that may be gained about IIH. 396 1.5.3 Risk Assessment 397 The risk level i s considered to be research involving greater than minimal risk. 398"

A 423 maximum of 400 ind ividuals may be enrolled in the study in order to achieve this goal. Subjects 424 who have signed consent and started the screening process may be permitted to continue into the 425 trial, if eligible, even if the randomization goal has been reached. 426 All eligible subjects will be included without regard to gender, race, or ethnicity. There is no 427 restriction on the number of subjects to be enrolled by each site toward the overall recruitment 428 goal. Non-identifying information about individuals who are deemed inelig ible or decline to 429 participate in the study will be recorded. 430 Some subjects will have been diagnosed with IIH prior to being referred to the study, whereas 431 others may need to go through the diagnosis and screening process after consent is signed. 432 Neuroimag ing studies, diagnostic lumbar puncture, and blood tests are considered routine care 433 regardless of the timing. The patient may have already had a lumbar puncture and blood testing , 434 which may not need to be repeated if performed within 4-6 weeks of enrollme nt. 435 2.1.1 Informed Consent and Authorization Procedures 436 Potential eligibility may be assessed as part of a routine -care examination. Before completing 437 any procedures or collecting any data that are not part of usual care, written informed consent 438 will be obtain ed. 439 For potential study subjects, the study protocol will be discussed with the potential study subject 440 by study staff. The potential study subject will be given the Informed Consent Form to read. 441 Potential study subjects will be encouraged to discuss th e study with family members and their 442 personal physicians(s) before deciding whether to participate in the study. 443 A copy of the consent form will be provided to the subject and another copy will be added to the 444 subject’s study record. 445 As part of the inform ed consent process, each subject will be asked to sign an authorization for 446 release of personal information. The investigator, or his or her designee, will review the study - 447 specific information that will be collected and to whom that information will be d isclosed. 448 After speaking with the subject, questions will be answered about the details regarding 449 authorization. 450 A subject is considered enrolled when the informed consent form has been signed. 451"

Another set of OCT testing after the lumbar puncture is optional . 631 2.4.1.1 Visual Field Examinations 632 At the scree ning visit, a Humphrey visual field result with 24 -2 SITA -standard program using 633 stimulus size III may be performed prior to two size V tests if a recent size III result is not 634 available . The size III test can be used as a guide as to whether the subject is likely to have at 635 least one eye meet eligibility criteria when size V testing is done. 636  PMD using the size III stimulus should be approximately in range of -8.5 to -30 dB. 637 Two size V stimulus fields will be performed in each eye. 638  The two size V stimulus visual field examinations will be transmitted to the Visual Field 639 Reading Center which will evaluate the visual field results: In order for an eye to qualify 640 for the trial, the average PMD with stimulus size V will have to be equal to or worse than 641 -6 dB and better than -27 dB. 642  If the Visual Field Reading Center confirms that the subject is eligible for randomization, 643 it will document the average mean deviation of the two size V tests as well as which eyes 644 qualify as eligible eye s. 645  If the Visual Field Reading Center finds performance issues on the perimetry results, the 646 examination will need to be repeated for the subject to be considered for the randomized 647 trial. 648 Depending on the subject’s condition (e.g., suspected visual deterioration, fatigue ), perimetry 649 may be repeated later that day, or up to the 3 -day deadline for randomization; the only exception 650 being if a perimetry result is unreliable and requires a repeat examination, the site will have an 651 additional two working days to complete the vi sual field examination. These additional sets of 652 perimetry examinations will be submitted to the Visual Field Reading Center for 653 confirmation/denial of eligibility. 654 There will be times that perimetry results are not reliable and a repeat examination will b e 655 necessary. This may occur not only at the screening/baseline visit but also at any visit. Whenever 656 two examinations are required (baseline, 6 months, treatment failure protocol) the following 657 outcomes are possible: 658 1. Two examinations performed and: (1) per formance criteria are met and (2) 659 pathophysiologic appropriate visual field patterns match. The average of the mean 660 deviations is used for the outcome. Acceptable performance criteria are : the false positive 661 rate is less than 15%, the false negative rate is judged not to be excessive for the amount 662 of visual loss , and gaze tracking data confirms acceptable fixation. All data from eyes in 663 the study must meet these criteria; only results from eyes that do not meet these criteria 664"

Thus, the investigator must not proc eed to randomize an 689 individual until he/she is convinced that the individual is eligible and will accept whichever 690 treatment group is assigned through randomization. 691 Subjects will be randomly assigned with equal allocation to one of the three treatment gro ups. 692  medical therapy 693  medical therapy plus ONSF 694  medical therapy plus VPS 695 Using a permuted block design, randomization will be stratified by PMD (average of 2 size V 696 stimulus tests) in the eligible eye (s) (-6 dB to >-12 dB; -12 dB to >-20 dB; -20 dB to -27 dB). If 697 a subject has two eligible eye s, the average PMD of the two eyes will be used for stratification. 698 3.3 Instructions to Subjects 699 Subjects in all groups will be dispensed acetazolamide ( see section 4.1 ) and receive dietary 700 counseling ( see section 4. 1.6). Acetazolamide should be started on the day of randomization 701 unless the Site Investigator deems delays occurring during the screening /baseline examination 702 may be harmful to the patient. In this case, the acetazolamide titration according to section 703 4.1.1. 4 may be started prior to randomization . 704 For subject s in the two surgery groups , surgery should be performed as soon as possible, ideally 705 within 3 days of randomization , but not more than 7 days . 706"

The dosage may be subsequently decreased by one tablet every other day (or 738 sooner if the subject is substantially symptomatic) if the subject is unable to tolerate it. If the 739 subject is then a ble to tolerate the lower dosage, the daily dosage should be increased according 740 to the table above, or more slowly at the Site Investigator’s discretion. Additional attempts to 741 increase the acetazolamide dosage beyond 17 days may be initiated at the Site Investigator’s 742 discretion, but not above a total of 4 grams per day. The dosing level achieved by Day 90 will be 743 considered the subject’s final dosage. This dosage will be maintained through the remainder of 744 the treatment period unless the subject improves such that the dosage can be tapered or develops 745 intolerable side effects. 746 If the acetazolamide is not tolerated at a dosage of 250 mg, then 125 mg (1/2 tablet) will be tried. 747 If this is not tolerated, furosemide will be initiated as described in section 4.1.2. 748 4.1.1.5 Stopping the Dosage Titration 749 The Site Investigator can stop or decrease the dosage titration if the subject has reached maximal 750 benefit (in the SI’s opinion) or there is a safety concern .

If the decision is unclear, the 759 case should be discussed with the Study co -Director. 760 The furosemide dose will be increased up to a maximum of 80 mg bid unless adverse events 761 prohibit further dosage increase, with electrolytes checked ~4 days after each dose increase. 762 After ~4 days of furosemide treatment, electrolytes will be checked (including serum sodium and 763 potassium). If sodium and potassium are normal, the dose will be increased to 40 mg bid. Again 764 after ~4 days, electrolytes will be checked and if normal the dose will again be increased to 60 765 mg bid and then if after another ~4 days and normal sodium and potassium, the dose will be 766 increased to 80 mg bid and electrolytes checked after ~4 days. Subsequently, electrolytes will be 767 checked at every visit as long as furosemide is being taken.

For 790 example if the papilledema grade becomes < 1 in both eyes, and the PMD has improved 791 substantially and IIH symptoms are not interfering with activities of daily living, the taper could 792 begin. 793 The Site Investigator can also taper pharmacotherapy when subject safety dictates a change . 794 For subjects in the VPS group, the acetazolamide dosage should be tapered starting on the day of 795 the surgery . See the MOP for details . 796 Otherwise, i t is suggested that dosages of each drug be tapered in increments of 25% of the 797 maximum daily dose of one or both study drugs biweekly until either the patient is off 798 medications or reaches a dosage where there is recurrenc e or worsening of IIH. 799 The Site Investigator may consult with the Study co -Director at any time regarding tapering if 800 needed. 801 4.1.5 Discontinuation of Medical Therapy 802 Subjects who permanently discontinue taking study medication should be encouraged to remain 803 in the study off medication and continue to be seen according to their original study visit 804 schedule, but will not have routine blood testing performed. 805 Discontinuation of therapy will be reported on either a visit or phone contact form. 806 4.1.6 Dietary Consultatio n 807 All subjects will be advised to adopt a low sodium weight reduction diet with lifestyle 808 modification by the Site Investigator.

See MOP 813 for orbital surgeon qualifications. Either a medial or supero -medial lid crease approach may be 814 utilized (see MOP more detai ls). The surgery will make a window in the dural sheath of at least 4 815 mm in length under the operating microscope. The procedure will be considered successful if 816 CSF egress is noted at the time of fenestration. Post -operative visits will be performed accor ding 817 to the surgeon’s usual routine. 818  If both eyes meet study entry criteria, ONSF will be performed on the eye with the worst 819 PMD first, ideally within three days of randomization. If the other eye still meets eye- 820 level eligibility criteria at two weeks af ter surgery on the first eye, ONSF will be 821 performed on the second eye. If the second eye improves at two weeks after surgery on 822 the first eye and no longer meets eligibility criteria, ONSF will not be performed on that 823 eye. 824  If only one eye meets entry cri teria as a n eligible eye , ONSF will be performed on the 825 eligible eye ideally within three days of randomization. 826  If the second eye is not eligible for the study because visual field MD is too good, but 827 the eye worsens (i.e. PMD -6 dB or worse with size V p erimetry at any time during 828 study follow -up), ONSF will be performed on the non -eligible eye . Also, if the non - 829 eligible eye meets criteria for temporary treatment failure (see section 5.6.3 below), it 830 will be operated on even if the PMD is not worse than -6 dB. 831  If the second eye is not eligible for the study because visual loss is too severe, ONSF 832 will be considered at two weeks after surgery on the eligible eye. 833 834 See section 4. 6, Management of the Non -Eligible Eye , for exceptions. 835 836 Administration of intravenous and topical corticosteroids is permitted intra-operatively , but 837 systemic corticosteroids are not to be administered post-operatively (see MOP for details ). 838 Medical therapy will be continued until the Site Investigator believes that the dosage should be 839 stopped or decreased because the subject has improved ; he/she may contact the Study co- 840 Director to decide on how to proceed. See section 4.1. 4, Tapering of Medical Therapy. 841 4.3 CSF Shunting 842 CSF shunt surgery will occur ideally within 3 days of randomization by a certified neurosurgeon. 843 See MOP for surgeon qualifications.

The ventricular catheter will be connected to an adjustable valve and the 846 distal shunt system will be placed in the peritoneal cavity. Post -operative computed tomography 847 of the brain will be obtained to confirm shunt tip placement. Post -operative visits will be 848 performed according to the surgeon’s usual routine. 849 Since the purpose of this procedure is to normalize CSF p ressure, the Site Investigator will taper 850 medical therapy at the time of the surgery and then further if/when he/she is confident that the 851 VPS is working (see section 4.1. 4, Tapering of Medical Therapy). 852"

T he Study Director/co -Director will determine whether there is a potential 857 safety risk and whether study treatment need s to be discontinued . 858 Other treatments for IIH, including bariatric surgery and transver se sinus stenting, will not be 859 allowed during the first six months. 860 4.5 Concomitant Medications 861 4.5.1 Allowed Concomitant Medications 862 All concomitant medications must be used in accordance with approved labeling and as 863 prescribed unless they are commonly used off -label for the prescribed purpose. 864 Headaches may persist as a major management problem in IIH patients after study treatments 865 have been given.82,83 The headache can be treated with standard prophylactic vascular headache 866 remedies: non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and tricyclic antidepressants may be effective. 867 Low dosage amitriptyline is suggested; the initial dosage will be 10 mg at bedtime, gradually 868 increasing to a maximum of 50 mg at bedtime, if needed. Weight gain is a well -known side 869 effect of amitriptyline; by using a low dosage and monitoring the subject’s weight, we anticipate 870 minimizing this untoward effect. Acute headache may be treated with non -steroidal anti- 871 inflammatory drugs (naproxen 500 mg bid), but their use will be limited to no more than three 872 days per week to prevent analgesic rebound (medication overuse) headache. Table 8 below gives 873 the Site Investigator a group of medications from which to choo se. These medications should not 874 be used more than 3 days per week. 875 Table 8. Medications available for the symptomatic treatment of headache. 876 Medication* Maximum Daily Dosage** Naproxen sodium 1 gram Acetaminophen 1500 mg Aspirin 1950 mg Ibuprofen 1600 mg Acetaminophen with codeine 30 mg 4 tablets Butalbital/APAP or Butalbital/ASA 4 tablets * Acetaminophen, aspirin, and non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs are preferred. 877 ** Symptomatic treatment should be limited to 3 times weekly or less to preven t 878 analgesic rebound (medication overuse) headache. Subjects requiring symptomatic 879 headache treatment more than 3 times per week should be prescribed a preventive 880 medication. 881 There is no single agent that will be effective and tolerated by all subjects need ing prophylactic 882 headache therapy.

It is uncertain if the carbonic 891 anhyd rase inhibition associated with topiramate is sufficient to have potential therapeutic value 892 in IIH; this could confound the results of the study. 893 4.6 Management of the Non -Eligible Eye 894 In general , non-eligible eye s are treated the same as eligible eye s. The n on-eligible eye will have 895 the same evaluations as the eligible eye . The only difference between eligible and non -eligible 896 eyes is only the eyes that qualify at baseline (i.e. , eligible eye s) will be included in the primary 897 outcome analysis. 898 If a non -eligib le eye worsens, the protocol for worsening of a n eligible eye will be used.

The Site Investigator will determine at the end of 1017 each visit whether the subject appears to be worsening clinically [guidelines being: 1) subject 1018 report of progressive visual loss, 2) papilledema is worsening, 3) OCT measures are worsening, 1019 4) ETDRS acuity worsens more than 4 letters, or 5) PMD worsens more than 2 dB ]. If the Site 1020 Investigator is unsure how to proceed, he/she will review the case with the Study co -Direct or. 1021 5.5 Early Termination 1022 For subjects who are withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study, a final visit should be 1023 scheduled as soon as possible. 1024 Procedures to be performed during the visit are the same as those listed in section 5.1.3. 1025 5.6 Surgical Malfunction 1026 VPS and ONSF malfunction will be evaluated at every visit if symptoms and findings suggest it. 1027 If the Site Investigator, based on all clinical findings, believes that there may be a surgical 1028 procedure malfunction/failure, he/she will request an SMRC revie w. Similarly, if the Photo 1029 Reading Center or Visual Field Reading Center identify lack of improvement or worsening, a 1030 SMRC review can be triggered. 1031 5.6.1 Criteria for SMRC Review 1032 Any of the below can trigger an SMRC review: 1033 1. Either visual criteria for treatment failure are met (see section 5.7.1) 1034 2. Papilledema: failure of papilledema to improve from baseline or worsening of 1035 papilledema following improvement 1036 3. Site investigator believes there is substantial worsening of the subject’s condition even if 1037 none of the ot her criteria are met 1038 5.6.2 Surgical Malfunction Review by SMRC 1039 When triggered, the SMRC will review all available clinically -related information and reading 1040 center results to determine whether there is a non -disease associated cause (mechanical cause) 1041 for the l ack of improvement or worsening. The site surgeon and investigator will participate in 1042 the review process as needed. The SMRC may request that certain exams be repeated for further 1043 evaluation. The evaluation for VPS may include a radionuclide shunt study. The evaluation for 1044 ONSF may consider orbital MRI or echography. If the SMRC believes a surgical malfunction is 1045 likely, the subject’s surgical procedure will be evaluated to check the viability of the procedure. 1046 If the SMRC decides there was a proble m with the surgery or a surgical device malfunction, they 1047 will discuss the case with the site investigator, the surgeon, and the Study co-Director (or 1048 committee member) to determine whether re -operation is ind icated. 1049"

If the 1056 subject then recove rs vision and no longer meets the criteria for treatment failure, they will 1057 continue the protocol treatment. If repeat surgery is not successful in improving vision out of the 1058 treatment failure criteria range, the case goes to the Adjudication Committee to determine if 1059 treatment failure has occurred . 1060 5.7 Treatment Failure 1061 Possible treatment failure will be evaluated at every visit if symptoms and findings suggest it. If 1062 the Site Investigator, based on all clinical findings, believes that there may be a treatmen t failure, 1063 the worsening will be confirmed with a repeat visual field examination (and ETDRS acuity 1064 testing if needed) on the same day or within four days of the original visual field . If the Visual 1065 Field Reading Center identif ies lack of improvement or wo rsening, the site will be notified and 1066 repeat testing performed. If the worsening is confirmed (both visual field examinations having 1067 PMD that exceeds the cutoff value in 5.7.1 below), the case goes to the Adjudication Committee 1068 to determine if treatment failure has occurred. 1069 5.7.1 Treatment Failure Criteria 1070 If either of the below criteria for worsening are met, the subject will be considered for treatment 1071 failure by the Adjudication Committee : 1072 1. Worsening of Full Threshold Size V 24 -2 Perimetry. 1073 a. Average baselin e MD is equal to or better than -4 dB and visual function worsens 1074 more than 2 dB MD from the baseline average. 1075 b.

Average baseline MD is worse than -6 dB and visual function worsens more than 1078 4 dB MD from baseline average. 1079 2. Worsening of 2 or more lines of ETDRS visual acuity 1080 5.7.2 Treatment Failure Review by Adjudication Committee 1081 The Adjudication Committee will review possibl e treatment failures and determine if a treatment 1082 failure has occurred. The committee will be masked to treatment assignment and using all 1083 available clinically -related information, including fundus photo results, will decide whether the 1084 failure is most lik ely due to increased intracranial pressure or from another cause, such as 1085 perimetric artifact, poor subject effort, or the presence of another unrelated cause of visual loss. 1086"

A detailed statistical 1334 analysis plan will be written and finalized prior to viewing any outcome data. The analysis plan 1335 synopsis in this chapter contains the framework of the anticipated final an alysis plan. 1336 9.2 Intention -to-Treat Principle 1337 The primary statistical analyses for this trial will be performed according to the intention -to-treat 1338 principle and will include all randomized subjects and eligible eyes . Every effort will be made to 1339 retain subjec ts in this study, to promote adherence to the study protocol, and to collect all data at 1340 every visit. If a subject cannot tolerate study medication or refuses to receive the study 1341 intervention, we will continue to follow and evaluate that subject if he/she is willing. If a subject 1342 drops out, attempts will be made to bring the subject back for a final evaluation. Compliance 1343 with trial procedures, drop -outs/drop -ins, and reasons for subject withdrawal will be carefully 1344 tracked throughout the study. 1345 9.3 Analysis o f the Primary Outcome Variable 1346 9.3.1 Primary Statistical Model 1347 The primary outcome variable will be the change from baseline to the first of Month 6 or time of 1348 treatment failure in PMD in an eligible eye, with data from all eligible eyes included in the 1349 primary analysis. The primary statistical analysis will involve fitting a n analysis of covariance 1350 model using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with treatment group as the factor of 1351 interest and baseline PMD as a covariate. These analyses will accommodate co rrelation among 1352 the within -subject responses between the two eyes; an exchangeable working correlation 1353 structure will be used. Standard errors for the model parameters will be estimated using the 1354 robust “sandwich” estimators. The model also does not rely on the assumption of normality. 1355 This model will be used to determine Bonferroni -adjusted confidence intervals for the three pair - 1356 wise differences among the adjusted treatment group mean responses (treatment effects); 1357 likewise, tests will be per formed to co mpare the adjusted treatment group means using a 1358 Bonferroni -adjusted two -tailed significance level. An overall confidence coefficient of 98.3% 1359 and corresponding significance level of 1.7% for each comparison will be maintained, but as 1360 discussed in section 9.8.2 below, the confidence coefficient for interval estimation and 1361 significance level for hypothesis testing will be adjusted for the interim analysis for efficacy. 1362 Treatment of subjects who have reached criteria for treatment failure will be at the disc retion of 1363 the Site Investigator, and this treatment may yield a different outcome than randomized treatment 1364 (investigators are urged to employ treatments from another arm of the study before other 1365 treatments under these circumstances) . For this reason, the primary outcome variable for subjects 1366 who reach criteria for treatment failure prior to Month 6 will be the PMD measured at the time of 1367 treatment failure for purposes of the primary analysis. It is anticipated that no more than 15% of 1368 subjects will reach criteria for treatment failure prior to Month 6. As the most important of the 1369 secondary outcome variable analyses, A secondary outcome analysis will be performed that will 1370"
64,page_64,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 65 OF 87 include the PMD for these subjects that was obtained at Month 6, regardless of treat ment 1371 received after treatment failure. 1372 9.3.2 Adjustment for Baseline Characteristics 1373 If clinically important differences are found between the groups at baseline, particularly with 1374 regard to important variables such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, or visual acu ity, the primary 1375 outcome analyses will be repeated after statistically adjusting for these differences. These 1376 analyses will be considered secondary, however. 1377 9.3.3 Investigation of Treatment by Covariate Interactions 1378 We will investigate the interaction between t reatment group and selected baseline covariates 1379 (age, race/ethnicity, PMD, papilledema grade, RNFL thickness, total retinal thickness, optic 1380 nerve head volume, visual acuity, presence of transient visual obscurations, and the symptom of 1381 constant visual los s) separately by adding the appropriate main effect and interaction terms to the 1382 primary statistical model and testing for significance of the interaction. Since the power to detect 1383 potentially meaningful interactions will be limited, the magnitudes of mean responses to 1384 treatment in the relevant subgroups will be examined. The observation of clinically important 1385 subgroup differences in mean trea tment response will serve as hypothesis generation for possible 1386 future studies designed to address specifically the issue of differential therapeutic response. 1387 Although these analyses are purely exploratory, those involving papilledema grade, PMD, visual 1388 acuity, and race/ethnicity will be given higher priority. 1389 9.3.4 Verification of Model Assumptions 1390 The underlying assumptions of the statistical model to be used in the primary analysis will be 1391 thoroughly checked (e.g., linearity), and remedial measures (e.g., tra nsformations) may be taken 1392 if serious violations of these assumptions are detected. 1393 9.3.5 Treatment of Missing Data 1394 Multiple imputation will be used to deal with missing data. This will be applied using a 1395 regression -based imputation model. For subjects with comp lete data up to a particular visit, a 1396 multiple regression model will be fit that includes the outcome at that visit as the dependent 1397 variable and outcomes at previous visits and treatment group as independent variables. Separate 1398 models will be similarly co nstructed for each visit (Weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, and 26). Using these 1399 regression models, a missing value for a subject at a particular visit will be imputed as a draw 1400 from the predictive distribution given the outcomes at previous visits (some possibly imputed ) 1401 and treatment group. This will be done sequentially starting with the Week 1 visit and ending 1402 with the Week 26 (Month 6) visit. This process will be repeated 100 times, resulting in 100 1403 complete analysis data sets. The analyses will be performed separate ly for each of the 100 1404 complete analysis data sets, and the results will be combined into one multiple imputation 1405 inference (estimated treatment effect and associated confidence interval and p -value) using 1406 Rubin’s rules.93,94 This approach is appropriate for data sets that have a monotone missing data 1407 pattern. If the data set does not precisely have this pattern, the monotone data augmentation 1408 method using Markov -Chai n Monte -Carlo 95,96 will be used to impute the small amount of 1409 missing data that is require d to make the missing data pattern monotone before applying the 1410 multiple im putation algorithm described above. This approach should accommodate missing data 1411 in an appropriate way under the missing at random (MAR) assumption.88,89 1412"
65,page_65,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 66 OF 87 Separate se condary analyses may also be performed that, for example, may group subjects 1413 according to treatment actually received (whether or not this was the randomly assigned 1414 treatment) and/or exclude subjects who had incomplete follow -up, took less than a certain 1415 threshold of their medication, or had another major protocol violation. The identification of 1416 subjects to be excluded from these analyses will be determined before the masking is broken 1417 (i.e., before data analysis). Of course, such analyses may lead to bias ed estimates of the actual 1418 treatment effects, but they may provide an indication of the sensitivity of the analyses to drop - 1419 ins/drop -outs and noncompliance. Methods such as those based on propensity score 1420 stratification90 or inverse probability weighting91 can be employed in this setting in which non - 1421 randomized groups are to be compared. 1422 9.4 Analysis of the Secondary Outcome Variables for Efficacy 1423 The most important second ary outcome variable for efficacy will be change from baseline to 1424 Month 6 in PMD in an eligible eye, with data from all eligible eyes included in this analysis. 1425 This is in contrast to the primary outcome variable for efficacy that is change in PMD from 1426 baseline to the first of Month 6 or time of treatment failure in an eligible eye, with data from all 1427 eligible eyes included in this analysis. 1428 The following additional secondary outcome variables will be evaluated at six months: change in 1429 CSF opening pressu re measurement by lumbar puncture; change in papilledema grade (PRC and 1430 Site Investigator); changes in OCT measures (RNFL thickness, total retinal thickness, optic 1431 nerve head volume, ganglion cell layer thickness, optic nerve canal shape); changes in ETDRS 1432 visual acuity scores; changes in QoL assessments (SF -36, VFQ -25 and its 10 -item supplement), 1433 changes in headache assessments (HIT -6 Inventory and headache severity); Visual Field Reading 1434 Center (VFRC) determination by three visual field experts of whether the visual field 1435 examination has improved, remained the same, or worsened; treatment failure; and surgical 1436 failure (transient or otherwise depending on attempts to repair malfunctions). 1437 With the exception of CSF opening pressure, these outcome variables w ill also be examined at 1438 Months 12, 24, and 36. Of special interest is the outcome of time from randomization to 1439 treatment failure. Time from randomization to failure due to surgical malfunction (even if 1440 temporary) is also of interest in the long -term fol low-up phase. 1441 Treatment effects on secondary outcome variables for efficacy that are continuous will be 1442 analyzed using the same methods described above for the primary outcome variable, except that 1443 a working correlation structure will not be needed for var iables that are not eye -specific. 1444 Variables to be analyzed in this manner include CSF opening pressure, OCT measures, quality of 1445 life as measured by the NEI -VFQ -25 + 10 -item neuro -ophthalmic supplement and the SF -36, 1446 headache disability (HIT -6 Inventory), and headache severity. 1447 The model will be used to determine Bonferroni -adjusted 98.3% confidence intervals for the 1448 three pair -wise differences among the adjusted treatment group mean responses (treatment 1449 effects) at Month 6; likewise, tests will be perform ed to compare the adjusted treatment group 1450 means at Month 6 using a Bonferroni -adjusted two -tailed significance level of 1.7%. 1451 For categorical outcome variables that are dichotomous (e.g., presence of headache, surgical 1452 failure) or ordinal (visual field e xamination ratings by the VFRC, graded as improved, no 1453"
66,page_66,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 67 OF 87 change, or worse), logistic regression models (or proportional odds models for ordinal outcomes) 1454 will be used to assess treatment effects. These models will include treatment group as the factor 1455 of int erest and the baseline value of the outcome variable (for presence of headache) or baseline 1456 PMD (for surgical failure) as covariates. Likelihood -ratio tests will be performed for significance 1457 of the adjusted treatment group odds ratios representing pair -wise treatment group comparisons , 1458 and 98.3% confidence intervals will be constructed for these odds ratios. Other aspects of the 1459 analysis of the primary outcome variable (e.g., further adjustment for baseline factors, 1460 examination of interactions, verificatio n of model assumptions) will also be considered. 1461 For dichotomous outcomes that are measured repeatedly over time (e.g., presence of headache), 1462 if a subject is missing a response at a particular visit, missing data will be imputed using logistic 1463 regression -based multiple imputation.93 For subjects with complete data up to a particular visit, a 1464 logistic regression model will be fit that includes the outcome at that visit as the dependent 1465 variable and outcomes at pr evious visits and treatment group as independent variables. Separate 1466 models will be similarly constructed for each visit. Using these logistic regression models, a 1467 missing value for a subject at a particular visit will be imputed as a draw from the predict ive 1468 distribution given the outcomes at previous visits (some possibly imputed) and treatment group 1469 of the subject. This will be done sequentially starting with the Week 1 visit and ending with the 1470 Month 6 visit. This process will be repeated 100 times, res ulting in 100 complete analysis data 1471 sets. The analyses will be performed separately for each of the 100 complete analysis data sets, 1472 and the results will be combined into one multiple imputation inference (estimated odds ratios 1473 [treatment effects] and ass ociated confidence intervals and p -values) using Rubin’s rules.93,94 1474 9.5 Compliance Outcomes 1475 Data concerning compliance with acetazolamide (pill counts, serum bicarbonate levels) and 1476 surgical therapy will be summarized by treatment group and visit. Subjects with two eligible 1477 eyes will have this information summarized by eye as well as by treatment group and visit. 1478 Change in weight will be used as a summary of compliance with diet. 1479 9.6 Analysis of Safety and Tolerability Outcomes 1480 9.6.1 Adverse Events 1481 All reportable adverse events will be tabulated by treatment group in a listing of each reported 1482 Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) term and summarized over each 1483 MedD RA System Organ Class. Details will be provided in a listing of each event. 1484 In addition, the following will be tabulated by treatment group. When applicable, events will be 1485 tabulated by eye within person : 1486  Number of adverse events 1487  Number of subjects with a t least one event 1488  Number of serious adverse events 1489  Number of subjects with at least one serious adverse event 1490  Number of hospitalizations and reasons for the hospitalization 1491"

For counts, 1494 groups will be compared using Poisson regression. 1495 For each adverse event, the treatmen t groups will be compared in a pair -wise fashion regarding 1496 the occurrence of at least one event using Fisher's exact tests; numbers of individual events will 1497 also be described. The comparisons will be repeated excluding all mild symptoms. Similar 1498 analyses will be performed after grouping adverse events by body system using Medical 1499 Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding. All subjects will be included in these 1500 analyses. 1501 9.6.2 Tolerability Outcomes 1502 Tolerability will be primarily measured by ability to complete 6 months of follow -up on the 1503 originally assigned treatment. A complete accounting of subject disposition will be summarized 1504 by treatment group, including a tabulation of subject withdrawals, dosage reductions/ 1505 discontinuations of study medication due to adverse events (with reasons for each), receipt of 1506 surgery other than that randomly assigned, and surgical failures. 1507 9.6.3 Laboratory Test Results and Vital Signs 1508 Continuous measures of safety such as laboratory test results (e.g., CBC with platelet coun t, 1509 electrolytes, potassium, bicarbonate, and liver function tests) and vital signs and anthropometric 1510 measures (e.g., blood pressure, weight, and waist circumference) will be analyzed descriptively. 1511 Proportions of subjects with particular laboratory test a bnormalities will be compared between 1512 the treatment groups in a pair -wise fashion using Fisher’s exact tests. 1513 9.7 Analysis of Long -Term Follow -Up Data 1514 An important set of analyses will consider the outcome of time from randomization to treatment 1515 failure. The s tatistical analysis of this outcome variable will involve fitting a Cox proportional 1516 hazards regression model with treatment group as the factor of interest and baseline PMD in the 1517 best eligible eye as a covariate . This model will be used to determine Bonferroni -adjusted 98.3% 1518 confidence intervals for the adjusted hazard ratios for the three pair -wise treatment group 1519 comparisons; likewise, likelihood ratio tests will be performed for significance of these hazard 1520 ratios using a Bonferr oni-adjusted two -tailed significance level of 1.7%. Kaplan -Meier curves 1521 will be used to describe the cumulative probability of treatment failure over time in each 1522 treatment group. For subjects who do not experience treatment failure, event times will be 1523 censored at the last subject contact at which the subject was determined to not have experienced 1524 treatment failure (e.g., at the time of premature withdrawal from the trial or at the final trial 1525 visit). 1526 As described above for the primary outcome variable for efficacy , secondary analyses of time to 1527 treatment failure that adjust for additional baseline covariates may be considered depending on 1528 the comparability of the treatment groups at baseline, and examination of interactions between 1529"
68,page_68,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 69 OF 87 treatment group and sele cted baseline covariates will be performed using the Cox proportional 1530 hazards model. 1531 The underlying assumptions of the Cox proportional hazards models will be checked and a 1532 thorough analysis of the martingale residuals and other diagnostics will be perform ed102. 1533 Remedial measures (e.g., covariate transformation) will be taken if serious violations of these 1534 assumptions are detected. The proportional hazards assumption will be assessed graphically by 1535 plotting log( –log(Ŝ(t)) vs. log(time) for each of the treatment groups, and by plots of smoothed 1536 Schoenfeld residuals101. This assumption will also be examined by dividing the time scale into 6 - 1537 month periods and estimating th e treatment group hazard ratios separately in each of these 1538 periods through the use of time -dependent covariates103. The period length of 6 months may be 1539 adjusted prior to unmasking, based on the observed distri bution of event times, if relatively few 1540 events occur during 6 -month periods. Treatment group comparisons will be described in this 1541 manner if the proportional hazards assumption appears to be seriously violated. 1542 An additional important assumption of the me thods to be used to analyze time to treatment 1543 failure is the independence between the censoring time and the (unobserved) event time. 1544 Sensitivity analyses will be performed that treat subjects with event times that are censored prior 1545 to their scheduled end of follow -up as having experienced the event a short time (one week) after 1546 censoring. 1547 Analyses of the primary and secondary outcome variables for efficacy using data collected after 1548 the 6 -month visit will be analyzed according to the initial treatment str ategy using the same 1549 methods described above. This will include surgical procedure complications or transient 1550 malfunctions. More complex analyses may be performed that take into account the introduction 1551 of other treatments (e.g., surgery in those assig ned to medical therapy) depending on how often 1552 this occurs. It will necessarily be difficult to make inferences about the effectiveness of 1553 subsequent treatments; however, analyses using marginal structural models100,104 may prove 1554 useful for this purpose. Outcomes such as surgical failure and IIH recurrence (in those whose 1555 vision is initially restored) will be summarized descriptively over time. 1556 9.8 Interim Analyses 1557 9.8.1 Interim An alyses for Safety 1558 Interim analyses of safety data will be performed periodically throughout the trial. While the 1559 safety of subjects will be the primary concern of the DSMC, it is difficult to formulate precise 1560 stopping guidelines that would cover all of th e possible situations that might arise. Adverse 1561 events, particularly serious adverse events and surgical complications, will have to be considered 1562 carefully by the DSMC in terms of treatment group imbalances and severity. Events of particular 1563 concern inclu de the following: death, absence of light perception, hypokalemia (from Lasix use), 1564 surgery -associated visual loss (from either VPS or ONSF), fenestration failure and orbital 1565 infection (from ONSF), and shunt failure, infection, seizures, and subdural hemat oma (from 1566 VPS). If potential safety concerns are identified, the DSMC may require review of visual field 1567 data in order to evaluate the risk -benefit of continuing the trial as planned or modifying (or 1568 halting) the trial. 1569"
69,page_69,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 70 OF 87 9.8.2 Interim Analyses for Efficacy 1570 We pro pose to perform a single interim analysis for efficacy based on the primary outcome 1571 efficacy variable. This will be performed after 50% of the subjects have completed (or were 1572 scheduled to have completed, based on their randomization date) their Month 6 vi sit and will 1573 only include data from these 50% of subjects. Given that recruitment of the 180 subjects will 1574 take place over 3 years, assuming that recruitment is uniform over time, it is anticipated that 1575 slightly fewer than 70% of the subjects will be enrol led at the time of the interim analysis. 1576 The analysis will involve pair -wise comparisons among the treatment groups with respect to the 1577 primary outcome efficacy variable; the significance level used for each comparison will be that 1578 determined by an O’Brie n-Fleming α -spending function for a two -group comparison divided by 1579 3 (Bonferroni correctio n).99 In this case, the boundaries will be Z = 3.394 for the interim analysis 1580 and Z = 2.400 for the final analysis. Assu ming that there are 30 subjects per group and that the 1581 standard deviation is 6.5 dB at the interim analysis, the boundary will be crossed if a group 1582 difference exceeds approximately 5.7 dB. This monitoring procedure will have a negligible 1583 impact on the ove rall Type I error probability: the significance level at the final analysis 1584 corresponding to Z = 2.400 is α = 0.0164. Point and interval estimates of treatment effects , as 1585 well as reported p -values, will be adjusted for the interim analysis. The bias -adjusted mean will 1586 be used for point estimation and confidence intervals and p -values based on the MLE (sample 1587 mean) ordering of the sample space defined by the group sequential design 97,98 will be reported 1588 in this case. 1589 The efficacy boundary will be considered to be non -binding. We believe that it may be prudent 1590 to halt or modify the trial only if (1) two of the treatment groups are each shown to be superior to 1591 the third (in which case the third group may be dropped) or (2) one of the treatment groups is 1592 shown to be superior to each of the other two (in which case the trial may be halted). Of course, 1593 the relative safety profiles of the treatments would have to factor into these considerations as 1594 well. 1595 9.9 Baseli ne Characteristics 1596 Baseline characteristics of subjects will be summarized overall and by treatment group; formal 1597 statistical comparisons between treatment groups will not be performed. Continuous variables 1598 will be described using means, standard deviation s, medians, quartiles, and ranges, and 1599 categorical variables will be described using percentages. 1600 9.10 Sample Size Determination 1601 In this clinical trial, 180 subjects with newly diagnosed IIH and moderate to severe visual loss ( - 1602 27 dB ≤ PMD ≤ -6 dB) will be rand omly assigned to receive either medical therapy, ONSF + 1603 medical therapy, or VPS + medical therapy (60 per group). This sample size should provide high 1604 power to detect group differences when the true differences are of clinical significance, allowing 1605 for an anticipated 10% drop -out. The rationale for the choice of a clinically significant treatment 1606 group difference of 4.5 dB is explained in the last paragraph below. 1607 The primary outcome variable in this trial will be the change from baseline to the first of Month 1608 6 or time of treatment failure in PMD in an eligible eye. An eye is defined as eligible if it 1609 satisfied the requirement of -27 dB ≤ PMD ≤ -6 dB at baseline . The sample size considerations 1610"
70,page_70,"SIGHT: JAEB CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND NORDIC SIGHT PROTOCOL V4.0 11A PR2019 PAGE 71 OF 87 initially focus on data from the best eligible eye, since most subjects are expected to contribute 1611 only one eye to the primary analysis, but addition of the other eligible eye is also considered 1612 below. In 2012, the IIH Study Group performed a retrospective chart review of consecutive 1613 newly diagnosed patients that met the modified Dandy criteria for IIH27 at 30 of the 41 1614 participa ting sites. Data on PMD were available from 91 patients at two time points, before and 1615 after intervention, with the median follow -up time being 6.0 months (interquartile range 4.1 to 1616 7.0 months). Patients received either medical treatment (n = 43 ), ONSF (n = 24), or VPS (n = 1617 24). The mean (± standard deviation) changes in PMD (in dB) in the best eligible eye over the 1618 follow -up period were 5.5 ± 6.9 in the medical group, 2.0 ± 8.9 in the ONSF group, and 8.2 ± 8.0 1619 in the VPS group; overall these values were 5 .3 ± 8.0. The distribution of these changes was 1620 slightly more peaked than would be expected for a normal distribution, as illustrated in Figure 4a 1621 and 4b. 1622 1623 Figure 4a and 4b. Distribution of Changes in PMD in the Best Eligible Eye 1624 The figure on the left (a ) shows the distribution of changes in PMD in the best eligible eye according to 1625 baseline PMD and intervention. Most of the patients demonstrated improvement in PMD. The figure on the 1626 right (b) shows a histogram of the changes in PMD in the best eligible eye regardless of intervention. The 1627 distribution appears to be characterized by a high concentration of changes between 0 and 10 PMD and is 1628 more peaked than normal. 1629 Given the cross -sectional nature of the preliminary data, sample size determination based o n the 1630 use of GEE for the primary analysis is very similar to that based on the use of an analysis of 1631 covariance model. If an analysis of covariance model is fit to the preliminary data, with change 1632 in PMD as the outcome variable and treatment group and bas eline PMD as the independent 1633 variables, the standard deviation of the residuals is 6.3 dB. The differences between treatment 1634 groups in adjusted mean response are quite small in this analysis: -0.09 dB dif ference between 1635 the ONSF and medical groups, and 1.1 3 dB difference between the VPS and medical groups. 1636 Also, a GEE analysis produces identical adjusted group means and slightly different estimated 1637 standard errors than those from the analysis of covariance model. 1638 It may be noted that the standard deviation of the residuals in the above analysis of covariance 1639 model is substantially less than the standard deviations in the individual treatment groups, 1640 reflecting adjustment for the baseline value of PMD in the analysis of covariance model and the 1641 fairly strong correlation between the baseline and final PMD values (r = 0.52). When considering 1642"

The power remains above 80% even if the 1650 assumed standard deviation is as large as 7.1 dB. 1651 The inclusion of the worst eligible eye is expected to increase power, but the increase is expected 1652 to be small (approximately 3%) because the preliminary data from the chart review indicate that 1653 only ~40% of subjects will contribute a second eligible eye to the analysis and the correlation 1654 between the outcomes in the two eyes is quite high (0.82 in our sample). This assumes that the 1655 group difference will be comparabl e in the best and worst eligible eyes, as we anticipate. 1656 The chosen effect size of 4.5 dB is based on the following rationale. Visual field defects are 1657 similar in IIH and glaucoma1,85 and data on the relationship between vision -specific quality of 1658 life (as measured by the NEI -VFQ -25) and PMD from the better seeing eye are available from 1659 213 subjects with glaucoma in the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study86. A regression analysis 1660 yielded the finding that a change of 1 dB in PMD corresponded to an approximately one -unit 1661 score change on the NEI -VFQ -25 composite score.86,87 In another study, Suner et al. used data 1662 from two clinical trials in neovascular age -related macular degeneration and anchor -based 1663 methods to estimate the change in NEI -VFQ -25 composite score that corresponds to a change of 1664 ≥ 15 letters (~ 3 lines) in visual acuity, a value generally accepted as clinically significant.87 1665 They concluded that a change of 4 -6 points on the NEI -VFQ -25 composite score should be 1666 considered clinically signif icant. Taken together, the results of these two investigations suggest 1667 that a change in PMD of 4.5 dB corresponds to a change in NEI -VFQ -25 score that would be 1668 considered to be of minimal clinical significance. 1669 1670"
