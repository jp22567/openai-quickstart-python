15,page_15,"Novartis Confidential Page 16 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 Amendment 2 Amendment rationale The completed study CLCZ696B2314 (PARADIGM -HF) targeted patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (EFâ¤40%). Two ongoing studies (PARAGON and PARALLAX), and one completed phase 2 study (PARAMOUNT) in patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction include patients with EFâ¥45%. Therefore, this amendment will expand the EF inclusion criteria from current â¥45% to >40% in order to ensure that the LCZ696 clinical development program will cover the full EF spectrum. Due to the increasing importance of generating exercise capacity data in the HFpEF population , this amendment elevates change in six-minute walk distance (6MWD ) to a primary endpoint . The primary analysis was selected to be performed in a sub-set of patients with baseline six- minute walk distance (B6MWD) ranging from 100 meters to 450 meters . Similar criteria was used in other HF studies (Abraham et al 2002 , Abraham et al 2015, Redfield et al 2015 and Palau et al 2016 ). T heamendment also include sa strategy for the multiplicity testing of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints , as agreed with major Health Authorities . An additional 300 patients will be enrolled toensure that patients with LVEF >40% are represented in CLCZ 696D2302 study population without jeopardizing or compromising any key study objective or assessment, which have previously been agreed upon with key external stakeholders. Changes to the protocol The main cha nges in this amendment are : 1.

17,page_17,"Novartis Confidential Page 18 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem associated with a high mortality rate, frequent hospitalizations, and poor quality of life(QoL). Despite existing treatment options, HF remains a progressive syndrome with a high mortality rate, and an illness with an unmet need for new therapies to improve health outcomes ( McMurray et al 2012 ). Heart failure has been shown to occur with either reduced systolic function or preserved systolic function. HF with normal ejection fraction (EF) has been designated HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). HFpEF accounts for approximately half of HF cases, and i s associated with substantial morbidity , mortality and deteriorated QoL (Lam etal 2011 ). Moreover, the prevalence of HFpEF, as well as,its relative prevalence compared with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), has been increasing in recent years (Owan etal 2006, Borlaug and Paulus 2011). Compared with HFrEF, patients with HFpEF are older, predominantly female, more likely to have hypertension (HTN) and atrial fibrillation (AF) , and less likely to have coronary artery disease (CAD) (Lenzen et al 2004 ). Mechanisms implicated in HFpEF include abnormal diastolic function with resultant increase in ventricular filling pressures, increased vascular stiffness, and abnormal systolic function despite preserved EF (Tan et al 2009, TartiÃ¨re -Kesri et al 2012 ). Recently, these individuals have also been shown to have an impaired natriuretic and renal endocrine response to acute volume expansion early in the development of this sy ndrome ( McKie et al 2011 ). Unlike HFrEF, there is no proven pharmacologic therapy for patients with HFpEF ( McMurra y et al 2012). All four major outcomes trials (PEP -CHF, perindopril; CHARM -Preserved, candesartan; I -PRESERVE, irbesa rtan; TOPCAT, spironolactone) have failed to convincingly show a clinical benefit in HFpEF ( Yusuf et al 2003 ,Cleland et al 2006 ,Massie et al 2008 ,Pitt et al 2014). Since no treatment has yet been shown convincingl yto reduce morbidit y or mortality in patients with HFpEF ,the current focus is to alleviate sy mptoms and improve well - being. This has been reiterated in the latest European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines (Ponikowski et al 2016 ). Consequently , guidelines focus on treating symptoms with diuretics and treating comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), HTN, renal insufficiency , AFand CAD, which are common in HFpEF patients ( Hunt et al 2005, McMurray et al 2012 ). LCZ696 is a first -in-class, angiotensin receptor ne prily sin inhibitor (ARNI). Neprily sin(NEP) degrades biologicall y active natriuretic peptides (NPs), including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). LCZ696, through its dual mode of action potentiates natriuretic peptides ( NPs)via NEP inhibition while inhibiting the renin angiotensin s ystem (RAS) via angiotensin t ype 1 (AT 1) receptor blockade; both mechanisms are considered to act in a complementary and additive manner to improve survival in patients with chronic heart failure. Consistent with the theorized mechanism of action, LCZ696 was shown to be superior to enalapril in reducing cardiovascular deaths and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fracti on in the completed PARADIGM -HF trial. In addition, as compared with enalapril, LCZ696 significantl y decreased the symptoms and physical limitations of heart failure assessed by Kansas City Cardiomy opathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) clinical summary score (CSS), and"
18,page_18,"Novartis Confidential Page 19 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 reduced total HF hospitalization, all cause hospitalization and emergency room (ER)visit. LCZ696 is approved globally including the United States (US)and European Union ( EU)for the treatment of HFrEF with the trade name ENTRESTO. The mechanism of action of LCZ696 also suggests that LCZ696 may impact the suspected pathophy siology of HFpEF, in which it is believed that excessive fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy lead to abnormal left ventricular diastolic filling, impaired diastolic distensibilit y and/or increased vascular stiffness, with consequent elevated cardiac filling pressures (Krum and Abraham 2009). It was recently reported that patients with HFpEF have lower levels of myocardial cyclic guanosine monoph osphate (cGMP )concentration (and lower protein kinase G activity ) compared with patients with HFrEF or patients with aortic stenosis ( van Heerebeek et al 2012). Therefore, enhancing NPaction seems a reasonable potential therapeutic option. By augmenting the active NPs, neprilysin inhibition increases the generation of cGMP, thereb y, potentially , enhancing myocardial relaxation and reducing hypertrophy . Natriuretic peptides also stimulate natriuresis, and vasodilation, and may have additional antifibrotic and antisy mpathetic effects ( Potter et al 2006 , Gardner et al 2007). PARAMOUNT -HF(CLCZ696B2214) was a recentl y completed, phase II proof of concept (therapeutic validation) trial in HFpEF comparing LCZ696 with valsartan. It consisted of a 12week core study period and a 24 week extension period (Solomon et al 2012). The study demonstrated a 23% greater reduction in NT-proBNP (p=0.005) at 12 weeks (primary endpoint) for LCZ696 compared with valsartan. In addition, the study showed significant improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification along with great er reductions in all echocardiographic measures of left atrial (LA) size in the LCZ696 group compared with the valsartan group at 36 weeks. LCZ696 is currently being investigated in a phase III clinical outcomes study (PARAGON -HF) to confirm its efficacy i n HF patients with preserved EF ( left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF ] â¥45%). No therapy to date has convincingl y been shown to reduce morbidit y and mortality ( Yusuf et al 2003 ,Cleland et al 2006 ,Massie et al 2008 ). Since HFpEF patients are often elderl y and highl y sym ptomatic, and have a poor quality of life, akey goal of therapy is to alleviate sy mptoms ( Ponikowski et al 2016 ). No therapy other than diuretics has been shown to improve symptoms in this population. This study will evaluate the effect of LCZ696 on NT-proBNP, exercise capacity and symptoms in a large population of HFpEF patients . LCZ6 96 will be compared to physician individualized therap y for comorbidities and allow patients in the comparator arm to continue on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) oran angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB ),based upon their prior renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi )therap y. This study in approximately 2500 patients will complement the PARAGON -HFoutcomes study and represent the largest HF symptoms and exercise data set in HFpEF patients with EF > 40% and help further our understanding of what limits patients with this disease. 1.2 Purpose The purpose of this study isto demonstrat esuperiority of LCZ696 over individualized medical therap y for comorbidities in reducing NT -proBNP and improving exercise capac ity, symptoms andQoL in patients with HFpEF."

Patients will then be randomized 1:1 to receive either LCZ or comparator. Patients in the ACEi strata will be randomized to rec eive either LCZ696 or enalapril . Patients in the ARB strata will be randomized to receive either LCZ 696or valsartan, and patients in the no RASi strata will be randomized to receive either LCZ696 or placebo. Patients in the ACEi and ARB strata must have a history of HTN. There will be no designated proportion of patients in each strata, the strata will populat e based upon the patientâs prior treatment regimen. A screening epoch of up to 2 weeks will be used to assess eligibility . Patients on appropriate therap y for comorbidities will be eligible for the study . Patients will be required to have been on stable doses of baseline medications for at least four weeks prior to randomization. After randomization, patients will begin a 1to 4 week study drug up-titration epoch followed b y a 2 0 to 23 week maintenance epoch (Figure 3-1). Visits to assess safety and efficacy are scheduled at 4 to 6 week intervals during the maintenance epoch. The assessment to address the primary objective of reduction in NT-proBNP will be performed using data up toWeek 12, and the primary objective of change in 6MWD and allsecondary objectives will be performed using data up to Week 24. No interim anal ysis(IA) is planned."

A 6MWT will be performed at screening in all patients to familiarize patients with the assessment . A patient who enters screening but is determined not to be eligible will be considered a screen failure. The investigator may consider re -screening the patient at a later time if he/she believes that the patientâs condition has changed and they may potentially be eligible. A patient may be re-screened once .A minimum of 2 weeks must elapse between screen failure and re-screening . Randomized treatment epoch At the randomization visit (Visit 101), all patients who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be stratified based upon prior therapy as described above. Subsequent to stratification, patients will be randomized into either the LCZ696 or the comparator treatment group at a 1:1 ratio. Table 3-1categor izeslow and high total daily dosesfor commonl y used ACEis and ARB s . Study drug dose levels areoutlined in Table 3-2and study drug up-titration outlined in Figure 3-2.The goal of treatment is to ensure that each patient receives the maximal tolerated dose of study medication. ACEis arerequired to be discontinued 36 hours prior tothe randomization visit (Visit 101) to minimize potential risk of angio edema, and ARBs are required to be discontinued at the randomization visit. With the exception of ACEi, ARB or renin inhibitor, patients will continue on their prior medication for the treatment of comorbidities. All patients must be on stable doses of app ropriate therapy for comorbidities for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. For patients who are not currently treated with ACEi/ARB ,the starting dose should be dose level 1 for LCZ696 . Those patients previously treated with low dose of ACE i/ARB (Table 3-1) should be initiated at dose level 1 for LCZ696 ,enalapril and valsartan . For patients previously treated with high dose RASi , the starting dose is dose level 2for LCZ696 ,enalapril and valsartan .The target dose for LCZ696 is 200 mg bid,for enalapril is 10 mg bidand for valsartan 160mg bi d(dose level 3). However, maximal doses for study medication will be determined by the investigator based upon the patient âs clinical status. It is recommend ed that patients remain at each dose level during up -titration for 1 to 2 weeks such that patients initiated at dose level 1 reach target dose in 2to 4 weeks and those patients initiated at dose level 2 reach target dose in 1 to 2 weeks. In certain circumstances, longer up-titration periods may be required as deemed necessary by the i nvestigator. Patients must meet the safety criteria ( Table 3 - 3)before initiation of study drug and prior to an y up-titration. Patients will remain at the target dose (dose level 3) for the remainder of the study . If patients cannot tolerate the target dose of study medication (dose level 3), down titration to a lower dose is allowed (see Section 5.5.5). Patients should be re-challenged to the target dose of study medication when their condition permits up-titration based on their systolic blood pressure (SBP) , eGFR, potassium values, and at the investigatorâs discretion. However, patients can remain at low doses (level 1 or 2), based on their tolerability and clinical judgment of the investigator. The duration of the double- blind treatment period is 24 weeks ."

Eligible patients will be on appropriate medical therap y for comorbidities in the opinion of the investigator. Structural heart disease (LAE and LVH) is a key diagnostic criterion for HFpEF in the most recent guidelines (Ponikowski et al 2016). Left atrial (LA) size (an integrative measure of left ventricular diastolic pressure) is independently associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality (Zile et al 2011 ). Including echocardiographic evidence of structural heart disease consistent with HFpEF will help facilitate homogeneity of the study population . Both TOPCAT (Pitt et al 2014) and I - Preserve (Massie et al 2008 )used an EF lower boundary threshold of 45%. This is also the threshold used in PARAGON -HF, an ongoi nglarge outcomes study (4600 patients) comparing valsartan 160 mg bid to LCZ696 200mg bidin HFpEF. Elevated NT- proBNP levels aid in the diagnosis of HFpEF. Current guidelines include NT-proBNP >125 pg/mL as one of the criteria to be used for the diagno sis of HFpEF ( Ponikowski et al 2016 ).In this symptoms study , we have chosen a threshold for NT-proBNP of 220pg/mLwhich is consistent with prior guidelines (Paulus et al 2007 ) to increase the likelihood that patientsâ symptoms at baseline are related to HF rather than their comorbid conditions . NT-proBNP was the strongest independent predictor of mortality and subsequent HF hospitalization sin the I - PRESERVE study (Solomon et al 2007, Komajda et al 2011 )and was used as an inclusion criterion in TOPCAT . Patients with baseline AF are required to have higher NT-proBNP levels, as AF is strongl y associated with higher levels of NT-proBNP (McKelvie et al 2010). The number of patients with EF < 45% will be targeted to approximately 300 patients and the number of AF patients will be limited to approximately one -third in the current study (based on the Visit 1 electrocardiogram [ ECG ]) so that the proportion of patients with EF < 45% and AF in the study will be representative of the HFpEF population ( Massie et al 2008 , Steinberg et al 2012, West et al 2011, Tsuji et al 2017, Lund et al 2018 ). 3.2.2 Rationale for the pri mary endpoint s The study has two primary endpoint s: NT- proBNP and 6MWD. NT-proBNP : One of the primary endpoint sof this study is the change from baseline in NT- proBNP (in log scale) at Week 12. In a prior study in over 300 HFpEF patients, LCZ696 showed"
26,page_26,"Novartis Confidential Page 27 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 a significantly greater reduction in NT- proBNP at Week 12 as compared to v alsartan ( Solomon et al 2012 ). Aggregate clinical data have demonstrated that NT-proBNP not only provides value for the diagnosis, and helps the management of patients with HF, but also predicts clinical outcome (mortalit y and morbidity ). Studies suggest that NT-proBNP level sstrongl y correlate with adverse clinical outcomes in HF patients including death and hospital admission for chronic HF ( Hartmann et al 2004 ,Hunt et al 2005 ,Masson et al 2008 ,McMurray et al 2014 ). Across all stages of HF, elevated BNP/NT -proBNP concentration are the most robust prognostic predictor of mortality and cardiovascular events compared to other traditional outcome predictors (peak oxygen consumption, blood urea nitrogen (BUN ), SBP and pulm onary capillary wedge pressure) with increasing BNP/NT- proBNP concentration predicting worse prognosis in a linear fashion ( Sachdeva et al 2010 ). In this short term study in patients with HF, change of NT-proBNP is considered an appropriate surrogate endpoint for clinical outcomes of HF. We will use this data to determine the treatment effect of LCZ696 compared to individualized medical therapy for comorbidities on the risk and clinical status of the population. In addition, the NT-proBNP data from this study can be used as a bridge to the PARAGON -HF study where NT -proBNP is also measured. Six-minute walk distance (6MWD) : The other primary endpoint is change from baseline in 6MWD which is derived from a simple, inexpe nsive, and reproducible test (6MWT) for the assessment of exercise capacit y. It evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. The 6MWD correlates well with resu lts using formal treadmill exercise testing and has been shown to predict outcomes in patients with HF, particularly , in patients with more advanced HF (Pollentier et al 2010 ). Many different studies have investigated whether the distance walked during the walking test is a prognostic indicator in heart failure patients. The 6MWD correlates with changes in symptoms after HF therapy , suggesting that it may be useful as a measure of symptom benefit (Olsson et al 2005 ). Lower levels of exercise capacity (a distance < 300 meters d uring 6MWT) have proven to be predictive of mortalit y (total or cardiovascular) and morbidit y (hospitalization for worsening HF) both in patients with mild to moderate ( Bittner et al 1993, Roul et al 1998, Zugck et al 2000) and advanced HF (Cahalin etal 1996 , Shah et al 2001 ). In the SOL VD study , a 6MWD â¥ 450 meters indicated low mortality risk (Bittner et al 1993). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that a 6MWD < 450m constitutes impaired exercise capacity (Abraham et al 2015 ). More recently , 6MWT has been used in prior studies to assess the effect of therapeutic interventions in HFpE F patients ( Kamp et al 2009 , Kitzman et al 2010 , Redfield et al 2015 ). The primary analysis was selected to be performed in a sub-set of patients with baseline six- minute walk distance (B6MWD) ranging from 100 meters to 450 meters. The selected cut-off was chosen a) by expert opinion b) since < 450 meters indicates exercise impairment and c) because previous studies have used similar cutoffs (Abraham et al 2002, Abraham et al 2015, Redfield et al 2015 and Palau et al 2016 )."
27,page_27,"Novartis Confidential Page 28 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 3.2.3 Rationale for the secondary endpoints selection KCCQ : KCCQ is a valid, reliable and responsive health status measure for patients with heart failure and may serve as a clinically meaningful outcome in cardiovascular research, patient management and quality assessment (Green et al 2000). The KCCQ instrument includes a clinical summary score (CSS) that encompasses the physical limitation score and the total symptom score. The CSS is a combined score based upon the clinical symptoms and physical function domains of the question naire. CSS specifically , has been shown both to be predictive of outcomes and has been used to measure response to therapy in patients with HF rEF(Ekman etal 2011). Further, KCCQ has been shown to be a valid and reliable tool to measure health status and predict outcomes in patients with HFpEF ( Joseph et al 2013). Data from HF-ACTION suggest that a 5 -point schange in the KCCQ overall score corresponds to clinically significant changes in measures of exercise capacity (peak oxygen consumption and6MWT) (Flynn et al 2012 ). Importantly , analy sis of KCCQ scores in 1, 358 patients enrolled in the EPHESUS study showed a linear correlation with both all-cause mortalit y and the combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations, for each 5-point s decrease in KCCQ CSS (Kosiborod et al 2007). The proposed study will evaluate not only mean change from the baseline but also proportion of patients with â¥ 5-point schange including both improvement and deterio ration at the end of the study . NYHA : NYHA classification is an assess ment of a patientâs functional capacit y and symptomatic status of HF; it is a well-established and internationall y recognized prognostic indicator of outcomes. NYHA classification reflects the limitations that the patient with HF has to cope with on a daily basis because of his/her symptoms. Further, NYHA is used in daily clinical practice and clinical studies to record the patientâs current functional status and provide important information on disease progression in HF patients. In the recently issued draft guideline on drug development for the treatment of HF, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recognized the importance of the NYHA classification in the assessment of symptoms in patients with HF, and emphasized that NYHA class as an established standard that should be included to allow comparisons across trials ( European Medicines Agency , 2016 ). SF- 36:SF-36 is a generic health -related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument which comprises of 36 questions across 8 domains: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3)limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5)genera l mental health (psychological distress and well -being) ; 6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); 8) general health perceptions (Ware and Sherbourne 1992). The SF- 36 is considered to be a valid, reliable, concise generic measure of state of health and has demonstrated to detect clinical treatment benefits across medical conditions including chronic disorders such as HF (Ware and Gandek 1998, Frendl and Ware 2014 ,Nolte et al 2015 ,Karlstr Ã¶m 2016 )."
28,page_28,"Novartis Confidential Page 29 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 3.3 Rationale for dose/regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment LCZ696 200 mg twice daily is the dose that has been used across all HF studies in the LCZ696 program. Biomarker analy sis and modeling indicate that this dose of LCZ696 delivers approximately 90% of its maximal NEP inhibition. In addition, LCZ696 200mg delivers similar valsartan exposure (assessed by area under curve [ AUC ]) as DiovanÂ®(valsartan) 160 mg twice daily . Twice daily dosing schedule is considered necessary for sustained NEP inhibition over a 24-hour period and it is anticipated to reduce the incidence of hy potension in HF patients. The primary endpoint ofchange in NT-proBNP (in log scale )will be assessed at Week 12, consistent with the effect of LCZ696 seen in HFpEF in the PARAMOUNT- HFstudy (Solomon et al 2012). The primary endpoint of change in 6MWD and all secondary endpoints (including symptoms, and QoL)will be evaluated at Week 24, which has been shown to be sufficient time to demonstrate changes in HF status using these measures ( Green et al 2000). 3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator Presently , there is no evidence -based, guideline -recommended, pharmacologic therap y for HFpEF patients. However, there are guidel ine recommendations for the treatment of the comorbidities that are prevalent in HFpEF, such as HTN , DM, and CAD (Ponikowski et al 2016). ACEi and ARB are commonly used for treatment of comorbidities. Patients will be stratified into three strata based upon their prior RAS iuse (ACE i, ARB or no RAS i) and then randomized to active therap y with LCZ696 or comparator. In the comparator arm, patients previously treated with an ACE iwill receive enalapril. Patients previously treated with an ARB will receive valsartan. Patients not previousl y treated with RAS iwill not receive RAS i. Only patients with a history of HTN will be included in the ACEi and ARB strata. Background therap y for comorbidities (eg beta blockers, calciu m channel blockers) will be optimized in all patients throughout the study ; diuretics will be adjusted to manage the symptoms of heart failure as needed during the study. Enalapril is chosen as the angiotensin converting enzy me(ACE )comparator as it is a commonly prescribed ACE iin patients with HFpEF for treating prevalent comorbidities. The enalapril dose of 10 mg bid (total daily dose of 20 mg) is selected as the comparator target dose for this study because it is the recommended maintenance dose for hypertension (Enalapril SmPC 2003 ). Data from the EU HF registry indicates that the median dose of enalapril for HF in real world practice is about 10 mg/day with approximately only 46% of the patients achievin g the target dose of 20 mg/day (Maggioni et al 2010 ). Valsartan is chosen as the ARB comparator as it is the ARB component of LCZ696. Valsartan is an orall y active, potent and specific competitive type 1 angiotensin II rec eptor (AT 1) receptor antagonist. The exposu re delivered by LCZ696 200 mg bid is similar to valsartan 160 mg bid (320 mg total daily dose) , which is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA )and EMEA approved maximal and guideline recommended dose strength for the treatment of HTN . Thus , the target dose of valsartan chosen for the comparator arm is 160mg bid. The same dosing regimen of valsartan is also used in the PARAGON -HFstudy ."

Washout of prior RAS agents is ensured by the discontinuation of prior ACEi s at least 36 hours prior to randomization and discontinuation of prior ARBs on the day of randomization. If the patient is to be started on open -label ACEi during the study , study drug will be stopped â¥ 36 hours prior to initiating ACEi treatment. All patients will continue other individualized medical therap y for comorbidities as directed by the investigator . The risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria, study procedures, and close clinical monitoring (eg hypotension). In women of child- bearing potential, a possible risk of developmental toxicity cannot be excluded. Women of child -bearing potential should therefore ,use a highl y effective method of contraception during dosing and for 7 days after stopping of study medication . If there is any question that the patient will not reliably compl y, they should not be entered in the study . All patients in this study will be â¥ 45 years of age and therefore the risk of pregnancy during the trial is minimal. Clinical trial data in adults demonstrate that LCZ696 has an overall safety profile generall y comparable to other RASi agents. For patients participating in this study : the risks common to LCZ696, enalapril and valsartan include hy potension, hy perkalemia, worsening renal function and angioedema. Potential risks of LCZ696 also include hepatotoxicity , effects on bone growth and mine ralization, and changes in am yloid beta in the central nervous s ystem ( CNS ). Participating patients will benefit from careful monitoring and follow -up during the entire study duration regardless of whether they are receiving the study medication. 4 Populatio n The study population will consist of patients â¥ 45 years of age with a LVEF > 40% and evidence of structural heart disease (LAE and/or LVH), current symptoms of HF (NYHA class II-IV), use of diuretics within the prior 30 days, NT-proBNP > 220 pg/mL for patients with no AF or > 600pg/mL for patients with AF, and KCCQ CSS < 75.Eligible patients will be on appropriate medical therap y for comorbidities in the opinion of the investigator. 4.1 Inclusion criteria Patients eligible for inclusion in this study must fulfill all of the following criteria: 1.Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. 2.â¥ 45years of age, male ,or female 3.LVEF > 40% by echocardiograph y performed within 6 months prior to Visit 1 or during the screening epoch"

At the randomization visit (Visit 101), all patients who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be stratified based upon prior therapy as described above. Subsequent to stratification, patients will be randomized into either the LCZ696 or the comparator treatment group at a 1:1 ratio. Table 3-1categorizes low and high total daily doses for commonl y used ACEi sand ARBs. Study drug initiation isdependent on prior RASi dose. Study drug dose levels during up- titration are outlined in Table 3-2. The goal of treatment is to ensure that each patient receives the maximal tolerated dose of study medication up to the target dose of LCZ69 200 mg bid, enalapril 10 mg bid and valsartan 160 mg bi d (dose level 3). Background therapy for comorbidities will be optimized in all patients throughout the study ; diuretics will be adjusted to manage the s ymptoms of heart failure as needed during the study .

In addition, randomization will be stratified by region. The investigator or his/her delegate will contact the I RT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the patient, which will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the first package of investigational treatment to be dispensed to the patient. The randomization number will not be communicated to the caller. The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigator staff. A patient randomization list will be produced by the IRT provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of patient numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Novartis Drug Supply Management using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the investigational drug(s). The randomization scheme for patients will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Randomization Office . 5.4 Treatment blinding Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analy sts will remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock, using the following methods:"
35,page_35,"Novartis Confidential Page 36 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 ï·Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible b y anyone involved in the study with the following exceptions: ï·The independent unblinded statistician, programmer and data personnel who are involve d in preparing safety reports for the Data Monitoring C ommittee (DMC). These personnel will not be involved in an y other trial conduct related activities ï·The program level DMC members who will review safet y data in a n unblinded manner ï·The identity of the treatments will be concealed b y the use of investigational treatment that are all identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste and odor. ï·A double -dumm y design is used for the two RASi strata because the identity of the investigational treatment cannot be disguised due to their different forms. A single dummy will be used for the no RASi strata. Unblinding will only occur in the case of patient emergencies (see Section 5.5.9) and at the conclusion of the study . The appropriate personnel from the site and Novartis will assess whether study drug should be permanentl y discontinued for any patient whose treatment code has been broken inadvertently for an y reason. 5.5 Treating the patient Sponsor qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. 5.5.1 Patient numbering Each patient is uniquely identified by a Subject Number which is composed by the site number assigned b y Novar tis and a sequential number assigned by the investigator. Once assigned to a patient, the Subject Number will not be reused. Upon signing the informed consent form, the patient is assigned the next sequential number by the investigator. The investigator or his/her staff will contact the I RT and provide the requested identify ing information for the patient to register them into the IRT. The site must select the CRF book with a matching Subject Number from the electronic data capture ( EDC )system to enter dat a. If the patient fails to be treated for any reason, the IRT must be notified within 2 day s that the patient was not treated. The reason for not being treated will be entered on the Screening epoch Study Disposition eCRF. 5.5.2 Dispensing the study drug Each st udy site will be supplied with study drug in packaging of identical appearance. The study drug packaging has a 2-part label. A unique medication number is printed on each part of this label which corresponds to one of the 2treatment arms (LCZ 696vs compar ator) and a dose level . Investigator staff will identify the study drug package(s) to dispense to the"
36,page_36,"Novartis Confidential Page 37 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 patient by contacting the IRT and obtaining the medication number(s). Immediately before dispensing the package to the patient, investigator staff will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that patientâs unique subject number. 5.5.3 Handling of study and additional treatment 5.5.3.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by adesignated person at the study site, handled and stored safel y and properl y, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designees have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective Novartis CPO Qualit y Assurance. Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the patient except for the medication numb er. The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors during site visits or remotely and at the completion of the trial. Patients will be asked to return all unused study treatment and packaging at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of study treatment. At the conclusion of the study , and as appropriate during the course of the study , the investigator will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at each site. 5.5.3.2 Handling of additional treatment Not applicable. 5.5.4 Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose changes during the study must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record eCRF . Novartis will supply the investigators with all study medications required for the course of the study . Patients will be provided with medication packs containing study drug corresponding to their assigned treatment arm and dose level, sufficient to last until the next scheduled visit. In order to adequately blind the study , patients in the ACEi and ARB strata will be required to take a total of two tablets: one tablet from the LCZ696/matching placebo pack and one tablet from the enalapril /matching placebo or valsartan/ matching placebo pack ,twice a day for the duration of the study .Patients in the no RASi strata will be required to take one tablet from the LCZ696/matching placebo pack twice a day for the duration of the study . There will be three dose levels for LCZ696, enalapril and valsartan; and three dose level sfor each corresponding matching placebo."
37,page_37,"Novartis Confidential Page 38 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 Patients will be instructed to take their morning study drug doses at approximately 08:00 (8am) and their evening study drug dose at appro ximately 19:00 (7 pm). The study drugs should be taken with water, with or without food. If the patient misses taking an ystudy drug dose, he/she should take it as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the following scheduled dose. In this case, the patient should skip the missed dose and return back to his/her regular study drug administration schedule. All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose changes during the study must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record eCRF. All kits of study treatment assigned by the IRT will be recorded/databased in the IRT. The investigator must promote compliance by instructing the patient to take the study treatment exactly as prescribed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the patientâs safet y and the validity of the study . The patient must also be instructed to contact the investigator if he/she is unable for an y reason to take the study treatment as prescribed. 5.5.5 Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment For patients who are unable to tolerate the protocol -specified dosing scheme, dose level adjustments and interruptions of study treatment are permitted in order to keep the patient on study drug. The following guidelines should be followed: ï·Every attempt should be made to maintain patients at the target study drug dose level throughout the tr ial. If the patient does not tolerate the target study drug dose level, the investigator can adjust or stop concomitan t background medications for co morbid conditions to rectify the situation, before considering to down -titrate to the next lower study drug dose level. Adjustment of study drug dose level If despite adjustment of concomitant medications per the guidance provided the situation is not rectified, the investigator may consider down -titrating study drug dose level . As outline d previously , patients in the ACEi and ARB strata take two study medications while patients in the non RASi strata take one study medication. In the ACEi and ARB strata ,both study medications must be adjusted simultaneously . During the randomized treatment epoch, down titratio n of study drug at any time based on the judgment of the investigator will be allowed according to the safet y and tolerability criteria defined in Appendix 3, Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5. If down -titration is necessary , the patient should be down titrated to the ne xt lower study drug dose level . If down -titration occurs due to an (S)AE (Section 7.1 and7.2), then the appropriate reporting guidelines must be followed (Section 7.2.2). The patien t may continue receiving the lower dose level for a recommended period of 1 to 4 weeks before being re -challenged at the next higher dose level. For example, a patient who encounters tolerability problems at the target study drug dose level (dose level 3), should receive study drug at dose level 2 for 1 to 4 weeks at the discretion of the investigator. Then, he/she should be re -challenged with up -titration back to dose level 3.The maximal dose for study medication will be determined b y the investigator bas ed upon the patientâs individual clinical status ."
38,page_38,"Novartis Confidential Page 39 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 If the tolerability issues are not alleviated despite down titration by one dose level, the investigator may down titrate further to the next lower study drug dose level for 1 to 4 weeks, up to temporary discontinuation of the study drug. Again, once stable, the patient should be re - challenged with up-titration to the next higher dose level every 1 to 4 weeks in an attempt to bring back the patient graduall y to the target study drug dose level (dose level 3). The investigator may choose the next dose level for down -or up-titration according to his or her judgment . As discussed in Section 5.5.4, the IRT system should be contacted to register any changes in the patientâs study drug dose level, including in cases of temporary and permanent discontinuation of the study drug, and to obtain the medication numbers of the study drug supplies required for the new study drug dose level. In some instances, according tothe safet y and tolerability criteria and the investigatorâs judgment, dose level 1 or 2 could be maintained if he/she considers that the patientâs condition would not allow any further up titration to the target dose level of study drug (dose level 3). In this case, it would be acceptable to maintain the patient at dose level 1 or level 2, whichever is the higher and tolerated dose level b y the patient. Study drug restart after temporary treatment interruption Study drug should be reintroduced in those patients who temporarily discontinue it as soon as medically justified in the opinion of the investigator. Once the investigator considers the patientâs condition appropriate for receiving the study drug, the investigator should re-start the patient on the study drug at the most approp riate and allowable dose level per his/her medical judgment. If tolerated, the patient should be up-titrated a dose level every 1 to 4 weeks to the target dose level 3, as per the investigatorâs judgment. Should the patient not tolerate the re-start study drug dose level, he/she may be down titrated again (if appropriate) or temporaril y discontinue the study medication again and a new attempt to up-titrate or reintroduce the study drug could be considered by the investigator as soon as medically justified in his/her judgment. The use of an open -label ACEi , ARB or a renin inhibitor is prohibited while the patient is taking study drug. Should the patient receive open -label RASi or renin inhibitor during the study , study drug must be withdrawn and the patient continued to be followed within the study .Patients must wait 36 hours after last study drug administration prior to initiating open label ACEi. Whenever possible, as dictated by clinical status, p atients should resume study drug.Study drug re-initiation should be at the dose level deemed appropriate b y the investigator and u p-titration to target dose undertaken as described above.

Use of rescue medi cation must be recorded on the Concomitant M edications e CRF . 5.5.7 Concomitant medication The investigator should instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications he/she takes after the patient was enrolled into the study . All medications, procedures and significant non-drug therapies (including physical therap y and blood transfusions) administered after the patient was enrolled into the study must be r ecorded. Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited medication. If in doubt the investigator should contact the Novartis medical monitor before randomizing a patient or allowing a new medication to be star ted. Diuretics will be adjusted in all patients to manage the symptoms of heart failure as needed during the study . Changes in diuretic dose must be recorded in the Concomitant Medications e CRF. Management of comorbidities The patient should be receiving evidence based medical therap y for relevant comorbidities such as but not limited toHTN, DM, AF, dyslipidemia , COPD and CAD (including diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers as appropriate ).Medical management of comorbidities should be indiv idualized based upon the clinical profile of the patient ,taking into consideration age and the number and ty pe of comorbidities. During the course of the study , investigators should continue to optimize background medications for comorbidities based upon the patientâs clinical situation. Elevations in BP during the study should be treated by initiation or adjustment of non RASi therapies. Should the investigator feel that addition of open label RASi or renin inhibitor is required, study drug must be discontinued as outlined above in section 5.5.5 (initiation of open label ACEi should be deferred for 36 hours after discontinua tion of study drug). Patients who have discontinued study medication for this reason will continue to be followed within the study and study drug reinitiated as deemed appropriate by the investigator . HbA1 cand lipid profile will be performed pre-randomization and during the course of the study ;diabetes and lipid management should be optimized during the course of the study as appropriate. All c hanges in medical therapy for the treatment of comorbidities during the study will be recorded in the eCRF . Additional information will be collected from the investigator for those patients w ith poorly controlled blood pressure, diabetes and lipids, as to whether medications were adjusted and if not, the reason wh y no changes in medical therap y were made. Medications known to raise potassium levels Potassium -sparing diuretics, potassium suppl ements, MRAs and any other medications known to raise potassium levels should be used with caution while the patient is receiving the study drug due to the increased possibility of occurrence of hyperkalemia. The investigator is"
40,page_40,"Novartis Confidential Page 41 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 encouraged to assess patientsâ potassium levels regularl y, especially in those who are receiving these medications. Phosphodiesterase -5 (PDE -5) inhibitors PDE -5 inhibitors should be used with caution while the patient is receiving study medication due to the increased possibility ofthe occurrence of hy potension. Neseritide The concomitant administration of L CZ696 with neseritide has not been studied. In the event a study patient requires the concomitant administration of neseritide with the study medications, the investigator shoul d consider starting them at a lower dose or a slower infusion rate while monitoring the patientâs BP carefull y. HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors Caution is recommended when co-administering LCZ696 with atorvastatin or other statins (egsimvastatin, pravastatin ) that are substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 because of the potential to raise plasma statin levels. 5.5.8 Prohibited medication Use of the treatments display ed in Table 5-1is NOT allowed after the start of study drug due to safet y reasons, unless the actions specified are taken. Table 5 -1 Prohibited treatment Medication Action to be taken Any ACEI Temporarily d iscontinue study drug while on ACEi . The open label ACEi treatment must be stopped for â¥36 hours prior to re- initiation of study drug. Any ARB Temporarily d iscontinue study drug while on ARB. The open label ARB treatment must be stopped prior to re -initiation of study dr ug. Any renin inhibitor Temporarily d iscontinue study drug while on renin inhibitor . The open label renin inhibitor must be stopped prior to re -initiation of study drug. ACEIs, A RBs and renin inhibitors The concomitant use of open -label ACEi s, ARBs or a renin inhibitor is strictly prohibited while the p atient is receiving study drug. Should an investigator wish to give open label RASi during the study , study drug will be withdrawn and the patient will continue to be followed within the study .If the patient is to be started on open -label ACE i, study drug must be stopped â¥36 hours prior to initiating ACE itreatment . Study drug may be resumed after discontinuation of open label ACEi s, ARBs or a renin inhibitor as described above. 5.5.9 Emergency breaking of assigned treatment code Emergency treatment code breaks should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the patient safel y and efficaciously . Most often, study drug discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study patient who presents with an emergency condition. Emergency treatment code breaks are performed using the IRT. When"
41,page_41,"Novartis Confidential Page 42 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 the investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a patient, he/she must provide therequested patient identify ing information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the patient. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified patient and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the Novartis monitor for the site and the Study Lead or designee that the code has been broken. It is the investigator âs responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to I RT at any time in case of emergency . The investigator will provide: ï·protocol number ï·study drug name (if available) ï·patient number In addition, oral and written information to the subject must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of e mergency , or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure that unblinding can be performed at an y time. An assessment will be done by the appropriate site personnel and the Medical Lead (or designee) after an emergency treatment code break and the patient must di scontinue the study treatment. 5.6 Stud y completion and d iscontinuation 5.6.1 Study completion and post- study treatment A patient will be considered to have completed the study when the patient has completed the last visit planned in the protocol. The study will be complete dwhen the last patient enrolled has completed their last visit (24 weeks after randomization). Patients will continue to be followed in the study regardless of study drug discontinuation. The investigator must provide follow -up medical care for all patients who are prematurely withdrawn from study drug, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care. An open -label extension study may be available through the sponsor dependent on the results of the PARAGON -HFstudy . 5.6.2 Discontin uation of study t reatment Patients may voluntaril y discontinue study treatment for any reason at any time. However, study treatment discontinuation does not const itute withdrawal from the study , does not constitute withdrawal of consent and should not lead to the patient being withdrawn from the study . Patients who have discontinued study drug should be encouraged to attend all the protocol specified study visits and perform all measurements as stipulated in the visit schedule ( Table 6 - 1) and remain in follow up for the duration of the trial. If the y fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort should be made to contact them .The investigator must also contact theIRT to register the patientâs interruption from study treatment and record it on the Dosage Administration Record . If the patient does not attend the study visits, follow -up should continue according to the specified schedule by telephone to determine if any AEspre-specif ied in the protocol have"

The emergence of the following circumstances will require permanent study drug discontinuation: ï·Withdrawal of informed consent ï·Investigator thinks that continuation would be detrimental to the patientâs well -being ï·Suspected occurrence of angioedema (Section 6.5.7 ) . A patient with any signs or symptoms of clinically significant angi oedema should be thoroughl y evaluated b y the investigator ï·Pregnancy and post -pregnancy during lactation period ( Section 6.5.6 and Section 7.6) The emergence of the following circumstances will require temporary or permanent discontinuation (study drug may be restarted once these circumstances no longer exist): ï·Use of an open label ACE inhibitor, ARB, or renin inhibitor (Section 5.5.8) ï·Any laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator warrant discontinuation of study drug after taking into consideration the patientâs overall status (Section 6.5.4) Study drug may be discontinued at the investigatorâs discretion if an y of the following occurs: ï·Any severe suspected drug -related AE (Section 7.1 ) ï·Any other protocol deviation that resu lts in a significant risk to the patientâs safet y The appropriate personnel from the site and Novartis will assess whether study drug should be permanentl y discontinued for any patient whose treatment code has been broken inadvertently for an y reason. 5.6.3 With drawal of informed consent Subjects may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any time. Withdrawal of consent occurs onl y when a subject : ï·Does not want to participate in the study anymore ,and ï·Does not allow further collection of personal data In this situation, the investigator must make a reasonable effort (e.g.telephone, e-mail, letter) to understand the primary reason for the subjectâs decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. Further attempts to contact the subject are not allowed unless safety findings require communi cating or follow -up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the subjectâs study withdrawal should be made as detailed inthe assessment table."
43,page_43,"Novartis Confidential Page 44 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 02 Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 Novartis will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data resulting from the anal ysis of a subjectâs samples until their time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. For US and Japan: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further testing/analy sis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent form. For EU and Rest of the World (RoW ): All biological samples not yet analy zed at the time of withdrawal will no longer be used, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored according to applicable legal requirements. 5.6.4 Loss to follow -up For patient s whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the inves tigator must show ""due diligence"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A patient cannot be considered as lost to follow -up until the time point of his/her scheduled end of study (EOS) visit has passed. 5.6.5 Early study termination by the sponsor The study can be terminated by Novartis at any time fo r any reason. This may include reasons related to the benefit risk assessment of participating in the study , practical reasons, or for regulatory or medical reasons (including slow enrolment). Should this be necessary, the patient must be seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematurel y withdrawn patient. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to befollowed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patientâs interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRBs/IECs) of the early terminat ion of the trial. 6 Visit schedule and assessments Table 6-1 lists all of the assessments and indicates with an âxâ when the visits are performed. Patients must be seen for all visits on the designated day, or as close to it as possible. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Patients who prematurel y discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessmen ts listed for the final visit will be performed. At this final visit, all dispensed investigational treatment should be reconciled; all the AEs and concomitant medications also should be reconciled on the e CRF s. Patients who have discontinued study drug should be encouraged to attend all the protocol specified study visits and perform all measurements as stipulated in the visit schedule ( Table 6 - 1) and remain in follow up for the duration of the trial. Visit 101 will be considered the reference visit for all study visits during the treatment epoch. Regardless of the occurrence of any unscheduled visits, scheduled visits should be performed within the specified timeframe in relation to Visit 101 as outlined in Table 6-1. If a visit is completed earlier than scheduled or postponed, it should not result in the next visit being brought forward or postponed."

Adverse events that are not SAEs will be followed by the investigator and collected onl y in the source data. Re-screening A patient who enters screening but is determined not to be eligible will be considered a screen failure. The investigator may consider re -screening the patient at a later time if he/sh e believes that the patientâs condition has changed and they may potentially be eligible. In this case, a new patient number will be allocated to the subject and he/she will need to re-perform all Visit 1 procedures. A patient may be re-screened once . A minimum of 2 weeks must elapse between screen failure and re-screening . The patient must provide new written informed consent before they are re -screened. 6.2 Patient demographics/other baseline characteristics Patient demographic and baseline characterist ic data to be collected on all patients include: year of birth, age, sex, race, ethnicity and source of patient referral. A detailed medical history (including HF, CV and other conditions relevant to the study population to be enrolled) and current medical conditions present before the signing of the informed consent will be collected. Investigators will have the discretion to record abnormal test findings on the medical history eCRF whenever in their judgment, the test abnormality occurred prior to the inf ormed consent signature. 6.3 Treatment exposure and compliance Compliance will be assessed by the investigator and/or study personnel at each visit using pill counts and information provided by thepatient orcare giver. This information should be captured in the Study Treatment Compliance eCRF at each visit. The investigator and/or study personnel should counsel the patient if compliance is below 80% at any time during the study .

All pre-menopausal women who are not surgically sterile will have a serum pregnancy test at Visit 1and Visit 199/PSD.Additional pregn ancy testing might be performed if requested by local requirements. A urine dip -stick pregnancy test will be performed locally at all other visits. The urine dip-stick pregnancy test is not required for post-menopausal women. A positive urine pregnancy test requires immediate interruption of study drug. A positive urine test needs to be confirmed with serum pregnancy test. If positive, the patient must discontinue study drug . 6.5.7 Angioedema Angioedema is a ty pe of abrupt swelling that occurs under the skin and/ or mucous membranes and is often localized to the head, neck, throat, and/or tongue, but may occur elsewhere, including the genitalia and intestines. Severe cases may be associated with airway compromise. It is important that the investigator pays special attention to any swelling or edema that may resemble angioedema or angioedema -like events that may be reported by patients. If such an event occurs, the investigator will complete an Adjudication Questionnaire for an Angioedema - like Event form (provided byNovartis) to summarize the event, its treatment, and its ultimate outcome. This report along with the requisite medical documentation must be submitted to Novartis as soon as possible. Follow -up reports must be communicated to Novartis as soon as new information regarding the event becomes available. All hospital records related to the event must be communicated to Novartis. In addition, all appropriate angioedema eCRF sshould be completed. For suspected and confirmed angioedema, the study medication shoul d be discontinued."

The in vestigator or his/her delegated staff must complete the required forms and provide the required medical records for all such events, regardless of whether the investigator views the event in question as angioedema or not. All angioedema reports will be forwarded to an Angioedema Adjudication Committee by Novartis for assessment. Information regarding this committee is outlined in Section 8.5. Details on the procedures for reporting angioedema events will be provided to investigators in a manual. 6.5.8 Appropriateness of safety measurements The safet y assessments selected are standard for this indication/patient population. 6.6 Other assessments 6.6.1 Clin ical outcome a ssessments 6.6.1.1 Clinician reported o utcomes (ClinRO) NYHA classification is a subjective assessment of patientâs functional capacit y and symptomatic status and can change frequentl y over time.It is a well-established prognostic indicator of outcomes. Further, NYHA is used in daily clinical practice and rese arch to record the patientâs current functional status and provide important information on disease progression in HF patients. NYHA assessment will be performed by adelegated andtrained health care professional at every study visit. 6.6.1.2 Patient Reported Out comes (PRO) The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) The KCCQ is a self-administere d questionnaire that requires 4 to 6 minutes to complete. It contains 23 items, covering ph ysical function, clinical sy mptoms, social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and QoL. The CSS is a combined score based upon the clinical symptoms and physical function domains of the questionnaire .The CSS specificall y, has been shown both to be predictive of outcomes and has been used to measure response to therapy in patients with HF (Ekman et al 2011). In addition, the overall summary score (OSS) is derived from the physical function, symptom (frequency and severit y), social function and quality of life domains (Green et al 2000 ). Scores are transformed to a range of 0 -100, in which higher scores reflect better health status . A 5-point schange in the KCCQ corresponds to clinically significant changes in measures of exercise capacit y (Flynn et al 2012 ). Further, KCCQ scores show a linear correlation with all- cause mortalit y for each 5 -point sdecrease in KCCQ CSS (Kosiborod etal 2007). The proposed study wil l evaluate not only mean change from the baseline but also the proportion of patients with â¥ 5-point schange including both improvement and deterioration at the end of the stud y."

SF-36 Version 2 The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a widely used and extensive ly studied instrument to measure health -related quality of life among healthy patients and patients with acute and chronic conditions. It consists of eight subscales that can be scored individually : physical functioning, role-physical, bodil y pain, general health, vitality , social functioning, role-emotional, and mental h ealth (Ware et al 1993 ). Two overall summary scores, the p hysical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS) also can be compute d (Ware et al 1994 ). The SF-36 has proven useful in monitoring general and specific populations, comparing the relative burden of different disease, differentiating the health benefits produced by different treatments, and in screening individual patients. In this study the four week recall questionnaire will be used. Patients will require approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete this form. SF-36 will be completed at Visit 101, 106 and 199/PSD . Completion of Questionnaires All questionnaires will be completed in the language most familiar to the respondent, at the scheduled study visit prior to the patient seeing the investigator for any clinical assessment or evaluation. The patient should be given sufficient instruction, space, time and privacy to complete the questionnaire. The study coordinator should check the responses to the questionnaire for completeness and encourage the patient to complete an y missing responses. Under special circumstances, such as but not limited to illiteracy and poor vision, the completion of the questionnaires can be done with assistance ,by a caregiver or astudy coordinator not directly involved in the care of the patient, if a patient is unable to complete it on their own. This situation should be clearly noted both in source documents and as an investigator notification in the eCRF All patients will complete the PRO questions via an electronic tablet .If patients experience an y difficulties with submission after they complete the Patient Reported Outcome (PROs), the study staff should assist them with submitting their responses. Attempts should be made to collect responses to all PROs for all patients, including from those who prematurely discontinue prior to the study evaluatio n completion visit; however, if patients refuse to complete PROs, (after screening visit) , this should be documented in study source records. Patientâs refusal to complete study PROs are not protocol deviations and do not require the patient be discontinue d from the trial. Completed questionnaires will be reviewed and examined by the investigator for responses that may indicate potential AEs or SAEs . If AEs or SAEs are confirmed, then the physician must record the events as per instructions given in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 of the protocol."
54,page_54,"Novartis Confidential Page 55 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 6.6.1.3 Performance Outcomes Six-minute walk test (6MWT) The 6MWT is a simple, inexpensive, and reproducible method for the assessment of exercise capacity . The 6MWT has good reliability and a significant ability to predict functional capacit y in patients with HF(Pollentier et al 2010). Scoring is based on the total distance walked. Lower levels of exercise capacity (a distance < 300 m during 6MWT) have proven to be predictive of mortality andmorbidity in HF (Bittner et al 1993 , Roul et al 1998, Zugck et al 2000 ). The 6MWT also correlates with changes in symptoms after HFtherapy , suggesting that it may be useful as a measure of s ymptom benefit ( Olsson et al 2005 ). The 6MW T will be performed in accordance with the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society 2002 (American Thoracic Societ y, 2002 ). A detailed description of the 6MWT is provided in Appendix 6 . Patients will perform 6MWT at Visit 1, 101, 106 and 199/PSD . 6.6.1.4 Other Clinical Outcome A ssessments NT-proBNP Change from baseline in NT-proBNP (in log scale )at Week 12is one ofthe two primar y endpoint sfor this study . NT-proBNP provides value for the diagnosis, and helps in the management of patients with heart failure and predicts clinical outcome (mortality and morbidity ). NT-proBNP measurements will be performed by the central lab in all pat ients at Visits 1, 101 , 103, 105, and 199/PSD . Only the Visit 1 NT-proBNP results will be reported to the investigator and the sponsor. All other measurements will be blinded to the site and the Novartis clinical study team .Any, local measurements of BNP or NT -proBNP during the course of the study is strongl ydiscouraged . 7 Safety monitoring 7.1 Adverse events An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], sy mptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the end of study visit.Therefor e, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. In addition, all reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered an adverse event irrespective if a clinical even t has occurred. The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non -directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered b y the patient during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments."
55,page_55,"Novartis Confidential Page 56 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: ï·they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms, ï·they are c onsidered clinically significant, ï·they require therapy . Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline orthe previous visit, or values which are considered to be non-typical in patient with underly ing disease. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual patient and identify ing adverse events. Alert ranges for laboratory and ot her test abnormalities are included in Appendix 1 . Adverse events must be recorded in the Adverse Events eCRF under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by the following inf ormation: ï·the severit y grade ï·mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities ï·moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities ï·severe: prevents normal activities All adverse events must be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the following: ï·no action taken ( e.g. further observation only ) ï·[investigational] treatment dosage increased/reduced ï·[investigational] treatment interrupted/withdrawn ï·concomitant medication or non- drug therapy given ï·non-drug therap y given ï·patient hospitalized/patientâs hospitalization prolonged (see Section 7.2 for definition of SAE) ï·its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recoveri ng/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown) Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently , if necessar y) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Information about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safet y profile of the medicinal product that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an Investigator Notification (IN) or an Aggregate Safet y Finding. New information might require an update to the informed consent and has then to be discussed with the patient."
56,page_56,"Novartis Confidential Page 57 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 The investigator must also instruct each patient to report any new adverse event (beyond the protocol observation period) that the patient, or the patientâs personal physician, believes might reasonabl y be related to study treatment. This information must be recorded in the investigatorâs source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported to Novartis. 7.2 Serious adverse events 7.2.1 Definition of SA E An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing )] undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria: ï·is fatal or life -threatening ï·results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity ï·constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect ï·requires inpatie nt hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: ï·routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition (specify what this includes) ï·elective or pre -planne d treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent ï·treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission ï·social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patientâs general condition ï·is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or sur gical intervention. All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under âmedically significantâ if other seriousness criteria are not met. Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ( please refer to Annex I V, ICH -E2D Guideline ). Medical and scientific judgment should be exerc ised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require interv ention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dep endency or abuse ( please refer to Annex I V, ICH -E2D Guideline ). Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction."
57,page_57,"Novartis Confidential Page 58 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 7.2.2 SAE reporting To ensure patient safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent until either screen failure or until 30 days after the last study visit must be reported to Novartis safety within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Any SAEs exper ienced after the 30 day period after the last study visit should only be reported to Novartis safet y if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment . At a minimum, randomized patients will be contacted for sa fety evaluations during the 30 days following the last study visit or following the last administration of study drug, including a final contact at the 30-day point. Documentation of attempts to contact the patient should be recorded in the source documentation. Furthermore, under this category , SAEs experienced after the 30 days period should only be reported to Novartis if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to each specific component of study treatment, complete the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form within 24 hours to Novartis. Detaile d instructions regarding the submission process and requirements for signature are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site. Follow -up information is submitted as instructed in the investigator folder. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigatorâs Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment a Drug Safety and Epidemiology (DS&E) Department associate may urgentl y require further informa tion from the investigator for health authorit y reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees (EC) in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or asper national regulatory requirements in participating countries. 7.2.2.1 Adverse events that are commonly seen in the study population Investigators will report AEs or SAEs that are commonly seen in the study population (Table 7-1) but thesewill not be unblinded and will not be reported as SUSARs to regulatory agencies, ECs, or investigators during the study .

The following two categories of abnormalities / adverse events have to be considered during the course of the study (irrespective of whether classified/reported as (S)AE): ï·Liver laboratory triggers, which will require repeated assessments of the abnormal laboratory parameter ï·Liver events, which will require close observation, follow -up monitoring and completion of the standard base liver eCRF pages Please refer to Table 14-1 in Appendix 2for complete definitions of liver laboratory triggers and liver events. Every liver laboratory trigger or liver event as defined in Table 14-1 of Appendix 2should be followed up by the investigator or designated personal at the trial site as summarized below. Detailed information is outlined in Table 14 -2inAppendix 2 . For the liver laboratory trigger: ï·Repeating the liver function test (LFT) within the next week to confirm elevation."
59,page_59,"Novartis Confidential Page 60 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 These LFT repeats must be performed using the central laboratory if possible. If this is not possible, then the repeats can be performed at a local laboratory to monitor the safet y of the patient. Repeats laboratory must then be performed at central laboratory as soon as possible. If a liver event is subsequently reported, any local LFTs previousl y conducted that ar e associated with this event must be reported on the Liver CRF pages. ï·If the elevation is confirmed, close observation of the patient will be initiated, including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate. For the liver events: ï·Repeating the LFT to confirm elevation as appropriate ï·Discontinuation of the investigational drug if appropriate ï·Hospitalization of the patient if appropriate ï·A causalit y assessment of the liver event via exclusion of alternative causes (e.g., disease, co-medications) ï·An investigation of the liver event which needs to be followed until resolution. These investigations can include serology tests, imaging and pathology assessments, hepatologistâs consultancy , based on investigatorâs discretion. All follow -up information, and the procedures performed must be recorded on appropriate eCRF pages, including the liver event overview eCRF pages. 7.4 Renal safety monitorin g The following two categories of abnormal renal laboratory values have to be considered during the course of the study : ï·Serum event: ï·Serum events are outlined in detail in Appendix 3 ; surveillance situation ( decrease in eGFR â¥ 25% from randomization) and action situation ( decrease in eGFR â¥ 40% from randomization) are described ï·Urine event ï·new onset ( â¥ 1 +) proteinuria; confirmed b y doubling in the urinary albumin -creatinine ratio (ACR) or urinary protein -creatinine ratio (PCR) (if applicable) ï·new onset ( â¥ 1+), hematuria or gl ycosuria Every renal la boratory trigger or renal event as defined in Table 15 -1in Appendix 3 should be followed up b y the investigator or designated personnel at the trial site. 7.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient or consumer (EMA definition). Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriatel y used not in accordance with the protocol."

The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy must be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the local Novartis DS&E Department. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment. Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form. 8 Data revie w and database management 8.1 Site monitoring Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigatorâs meeting, a Novartis representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements (i.e. eCRFs) with the investigators and their staff. During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensurin g protocol and Good Clinical Practice ( GCP )compliance and the quality /integrity of the sitesâ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of data capture / data entry , the adherenc e to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each siteâs data may be performed by a centralized Novartis CRA organization. Additionally , a central analytics"
61,page_61,"Novartis Confidential Page 62 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis Clinical Teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medi cal information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the patient's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed conse nt form signed b y the patient (a signed cop y is given to the patient). The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry . Novartis monitoring standards requir e full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the patients will be disclosed. 8.2 Data collection The trial will be conducted in a fully validated Data Capture system which conforms to US CRF 21 Part 11 requirements. Investigator site staff will not be given access to the system until they have been trained. Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the Data Capture system. Automatic validation programs within the system check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs and by generating appropriate error messages, allow the data to be confirmed or corrected by the investigator staff. The investigator staff must certify that the data entered are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the patient data for archiving at the investigational site. 8.3 Database management and quality contro l Novartis staff ( or contract research organization [ CRO ]working on beha lf of Novartis) review the data entered into the eCRFs by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy and instruct the site personnel to make an y required corrections or addit ions. Queries are sent to the investigational site using an electronic data query. Designated investigator site staff is required to respond to the query and confirm or correct the data. If the electronic query system is not used, a paper Data Query Form w ill be faxed to the site. Site personnel will complete and sign the faxed copy and fax it back to Novartis staff that will make the correction to the database. The signed cop y of the Data Query Form is kept at the investigator site. Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the World Health Organization ( WHO )Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Concomitant procedures, non-drug therapies and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology . Laboratory samples will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronicall y to Novartis (or a designated CRO)."
62,page_62,"Novartis Confidential Page 63 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 Randomization codes and data about all study drug(s) dispensed to the patient and all dosage changes will be tracked using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). The system will be supplied by a v endor, who will also manage the database. The database will be sent electronically to Novartis (or a designated C RO). Each occurrence of a code break via I RT will be reported to the clinical team and monitor. The code break functionality will remain available until study shut down or upon request of Novartis. The occurrence of relevant protocol deviations will be det ermined. After these actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked and the treatment codes will be unblinded and made available for data analysis. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written agreement by Novartis Development management. 8.4 Data monitoring c ommittee Anestablished program level Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) independent of Novartis that reviews safet y data from LCZ696 studies will be used for this study . The DMC will review SAEs in an unblinded manner on a regular basis and determine if it is safe to continue the study . Any major recommendation from the DMC will be communicated to th e Executive Committee and must be reviewed and ratified by the Executive Committee in consultation with Novartis prior to its enactment. The membership of the DMC and the responsibilities of the DMC and Novartis will be defined in a separate document entitled the âData Monitoring Committee Charterâ. The DMC Charter will include information about data flow, purpose and timing of DMC meetings, guidance in the decision making process, communication strategy , procedures for ensuring confidentiality , procedures to address conflicts of interest and statistical monitoring guidelines. 8.5 Adjudication c ommittee Angioedema adjudication c ommittee If an angioedema or angioedema -like event occurs, the investigator will complete an Adjudication Questionnaire for an Angioedem a-like Event form (provided by Novartis). Details on the process of reporting angioedema and angioedema -like events are outlined in a manual provided to investigators. Submission of an angioedema report is not a substitution for the submission of an SAE re port. If an angioedema -like event satisfies the definition of an SAE, the investigator must submit an SAE report in addition to the Adjudication Questionnaire for an Angioedema -like Event. The membership and responsibilities of the Angioedema Adjudication Committee are defined in a separate document that will be provided to the sites. The project- level angioedema adjudication committee will be used for this trial ."

Any data analysis carried out independently by the investigator should be submitted to Novartis before publication or presentation. 9.1 Analysis sets The following anal ysis sets will be used for the statistical anal yses: The full analy sis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients with the exception of those patients who have not been qualified for randomization and have not received study drug, but have been inadvertently randomized into the study , and the exception of those patients who have been inadve rtently randomized within a wrong stratum (ACEi, ARB, No RASi) and have not received study drug. Following the intent -to-treat principle, patients will be analy zed according to the treatment to which they were assigned at randomization. Efficacy variables will be anal yzed based on the FAS as the primary set. The safet y (SAF) set will consist of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actuall y received. The SAF will be used fo r the anal yses of safet y variables. The perprotocol set (PPS) will be a subset of the FAS which will consist of the patients who do not have major deviations from the protocol procedures in the randomized treatment epoch. Major protocol deviations will bepre-specified prior to unblinding treatment codes for analyses. This supplemental efficacy set will be used to support the primary analy sis results. 9.2 Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics Baseline value is defined as the last non-missing assessment prior to the first dose of randomized study drug unless specified otherwise. Summary statistics will be provided by treatment group for demographics and baseline characteristics, including age, age group (<65 years vs. â¥65 years; <75 years vs. â¥ 75 years), sex, race, ethnicit y, weight, height, bod y mass index (BMI), category of prior CV medication, prior HF hospitalization, NYHA class, NT -proBNP, BNP, and vital signs. BMI will be calculated as weight (kg) / height2(m2) from the collected height and weight at Visit 1 (screening). Continuous variables will be summarized using n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. The FAS will be used for the above anal yses. 9.3 Treatments The overall duration on the randomized study drug will be summarized by treatment group using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Additionally , the number and percentage of patients will be summarized b y treatment group f or duration category . Mean doses and dose levels will be summarized by treatment group and visit."
64,page_64,"Novartis Confidential Page 65 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 Concomitant medications and significant non-drug therapies, prior to and after the randomization date respectively , will be summarized by therapeutic class, preferred term, and treatment group for the SAF. The number and percentage of patients on different CV background medications (egmineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, Î² -blockers, diuretics, and digoxin) will be tabulated by treatment at baseline and during the randomized treatment epoch. The FAS will be used for the above anal yses unless otherwise specified. 9.4 Analysis of the primary variables The primary objective sare to demonstrate that LCZ696 is superior to individualized medical therap y for comorbi dities in reducing NT-proBNP from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment , and/or in improving exercise capacit y as assessed by the 6MWT at Week 24 in a subset of patients with B6MWD ranging from 100 meters to 450 meters. 9.4.1 Primary variable s The primary efficac yvariable sarethe change from baseline in log (NT-proBNP) at Week 12, and the change from baseline in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) at Week 24. For patients who have died, the 6MWD after the death will be defined as zero. For patients who permanently discontinue from study treatment, assessment values collected after permanent discontinuation will generall y be included in the anal ysis. 9.4.2 Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analy sis Testing strategy The following primary null hy potheses will be included in the testing strategy . ï·H1: LCZ696 is no better than the comparator in change from baseline in log(NT -proBNP) at Week 12 in the overall study population ï·H2: LCZ696 is no better than the comparator in change from baseline in 6MWD at Week 24 in pat ients with B6MWD ranging from 100 meters to 450 meters. The following secondary null hy potheses will be included in the testing strategy . ï·H3: LCZ696 is no better than the comparator in change from baseline in KCCQ CSS at Week 24 in the overall study popula tion. ï·H4: LCZ696 is no better than the comparator in NYHA change from baseline at Week 24 in the overall study population. Each null hypothesis is tested against the one-sided alternative that LCZ6 96 is better than the comparator in the corresponding variable. In order to control the family -wise t ype-I error rate at the one -sided 0.025 significance level, a sequentially rejective multiple testing procedure based on the graphical presentation (Bretz et al 2009) will be employ ed, whereby H1and H2will be tested first at initially assigned level of one -sided (9/10) Ã Î± = 0.0225 and one -sided (1/10) Ã Î± = 0.0025, accordingly . If H 1and/or H 2 are rejected, the alpha for the rejected null hypotheses will be propagated to H3, such that, H3"

The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the patient source documents. Novartis will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent form that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study . Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by the investigator must be agreed to by Novartis before submission to the IRB/IE C, and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the Novartis monitor after IRB/ IEC approval. Women of child bearing potential must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement for the duration of the study . If there is any question that the patient will not reliably compl y, they must not be entered in the stud y. 10.3 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC Before initiating a trial, the investigator/institution must obtain approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC for the trial protocol, written informed consent form, consent form updates, subject recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements) and any other written information to be provided to patients/subjects . Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to Novarti s monitors, auditors, Novartis Qualit y Assurance representatives, designated agents of Novartis, IRBs/IECs, and regulatory authorities as required. If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authorit y, the investigator must inform Novartis imm ediately that this request has been made. 10.4 Publication of study protocol and results The key design elements of this protocol will be posted in a publicly accessible database such as clinicaltrials.gov. In addition, upon study completion and finalization of the study report the results of this trial will be either submitted for publication and/or posted in a publicly accessible database of clinical trial results. 10.5 Qualit y Control and Quality Assurance Novartis maintains a robust Quality Management (QM) system that includes all activities involved in quality assurance and qualit y control, including the assignment of roles and responsibilities, the reporting of results, and the documentation of actions and escalation of issues identified during the review of qua lity metrics, incidents, audits and inspections. Audits of investigator sites, vendors, and Novartis sy stems are performed by Novartis Pharma Auditing and Compliance Quality Assurance, a group independent from those involved in conducting, monitoring or performing quality control of the clinical trial. The clinical audit process uses a knowledge/risk based approach."
78,page_78,"Novartis Confidential Page 79 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 Audits are conducted to assess GCP compliance with global and local regulatory requirements, protocols and internal SOPs, and are performed according to written Novartis processes. 11 Protocol adherence This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure safety of patients should be administere d as deemed necessary on a case by case basis. Under no circumstances is an investigator allowed to collect additional data or conduct any additional procedures for any research related purpose involving an y investigational drugs under the protocol. Invest igators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. If an investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by Novartis and approved by the IR B/IEC and health authorities, where required, it cannot be implemented. 11.1 Protocol a mendments Any change or addition to the protocol can onl y be made in a written protocol amendment that must be approved by Novartis, health authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC prior to implementation. Only amendments that are intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately provided the health authorities are subsequentl y notified by protocol amendment and the reviewing IRB/ IEC is notified. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of an y pat ient included in this study, even if this actio n represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, the reporting requirements identified in Section 7 Safety Monitoring must be followed. 12 References Abraham WT, Fisher WG, Smith AL, et al (2002) Cardiac resynchronization in chronic heart failure.

Guidelines for the Management of Renal Dysfunction General principles: Glomerular filtration rate in HF patients depends on intrinsic renal function and on a balance between afferent and efferent glomerular arterial tonicit y. This tonicity is partly regulated by a stimulation of angiotensin II and could be affected by either study drug. Moreover, renal dysfunction may develop or may deteriorate in some patients after study drug administration. These recommendations have been developed to guide the investigators in managing patients with renal d ysfunction after randomization. Two types of response to serum creatinine increase are described: Surveillance situation If, at any time after randomization, eGFR decreases by â¥25% from randomization (Visit 1 01) (or if serum creatinine concentration increase to 2.5 mg/dL [221 Âµmol/L]), the investigator will check for potentiall y reversible causes of renal d ysfunction such as: ï·Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drug intake, antibioti cs, or other treatments known to affect creatinine ï·Volume decrease, including that resulting from excessive dosing of diuretics ï·Urinary infection ï·Urinary tract obstruction ï·Study drug"

The investigator may consider down -titration of study drugs . If the investigator judges that study drugs have to be stopped, he/she will have to contact the Novartis medical monitor or his/her designee. Thereafter, serum creatinine assessments will have to be repeated at least each week until levels return to acceptable values. If study drug was stopped, every effort will be done to restart it again, according to clinical conditions."

Any patient with a serum potassium *> 5.3 mmol/L (mEq/L) at any time after randomization requires the Investigator to confirm the potassium concentration in a non-he moly zed sample via an immediate repeat lab sample to both the clinic local lab and the study central lab. Regular, repeated checks of potassium concentration (beyond that prescribed in the protocol) should continue until it is clear that the potassium conc entration is stable and not rising into the range of concern ( â¥ 5.5 and < 6.0 mmol/L [mEq/L ]) or potential danger (â¥ 6.0 mmol/L [mEq/L ]).

All p atients will undergo the 6MWT at Visit 1 ( screening ),101, 106 & 199. The 6MWT is preferabl y performed indoors along a long, flat, straight, enclosed corridor with a hard surface that is seldom traveled. The walking course must be 25-30 meters in length; therefore, a corridor of at least 30 meters is required for the test. The beginning and end of the course should be m arked with a cone .The patient will be asked to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes timed on a stop watch. The number of complete course lengths walked will be recorded as well as any partial length walked. If the patient discontinues the test prematurel y, the time, distance and reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the eCRFs. During the study , the 6MWT should be performed about the same time of day on each occasion. Prior to the test, the patient should sit at rest in a chair, located near the s tarting position for at least 10 minutes and resting baseline heart rateandblood pressure measured . Then, have the patient stand and rate their baseline dyspnea and overall fatigue using the Borg scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, dyspnea and overall fatigue using the Borg scale should be repeated immediately after completion of the test . REQUIRED EQUIPMENT 1.Countdown timer (or stopwatch) 2.Two small cones or similar item to mark the turnaround points 3.A chair that can be easil y moved along the walking course 4.Sphy gmomanometer 5. Automated electronic defibrillator 6.Source Document Worksheet PATIENT PREPARATION 1. At screening visit assess eligibility as per Exclusion Criterion #8 and refer to the provided eligibility check list. 2. Comfortable clothing should be worn 3. Appropriate shoes for walking should be worn 4. Patients should use their usual walking aids during the test (cane, walker, etc.) 5. The patient's usual medical regimen should be continued 6. A light meal is acceptable before early morning or e arly afternoon tests 7. Patients should not have exercised vigorousl y within 2 hours of beginning the test"

T esting should be performed about the same time of day to minimize intraday variability 2.A ""warm -up"" period before the test should not be performed 3.The patient should sit at rest in a chair, located near the starting position, for at least 10 minutes before the test starts. During this time, check for contraindications, and make sure that clothing and shoes are appropriate. 4.Measure and r ecord baseline heart rate and blood pressure with the patient resting on a chair for at least 10 minutes 5.Have the patient stand and rate their baseline dyspnea and overall fatigue using the Borg scale 6. M ove to the starting point Instruct the patient as fol lows : ""The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes. You will walk back and forth in this hallway. Six minutes is a long time to walk, so you will be exerting yourself. You will probably get out of breath or become exhausted. You arepermitted to slow down, to stop, and to rest as necessary. You may lean against the wall while resting, but resume walking as soon as you are able. You will be walking back and forth around the cones. You should pivot briskly around the cones and continue back the other way without hesitation. Now I'm going to show you. Please watch the way I turn without hesitation."" Demonstrate b y walking one length yourself. Walk and pivot around a cone briskly. ""Are you ready to do that? Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE for 6 minutes, but don't run or jog. Start now, or whenever you are ready."" 7.Position the patient at the starting line. You should also stand near the starting line during the test. Do not walk with the patient. As soon as the pat ient starts to walk, start the timer. 8.Do not talk to anyone during the walk. Use an even tone of voice when using the standard phrases of encouragement. Watch the patient. Do not get distracted and lose count of the lengths. Each time the participant reach es a turnaround point , mark the completed length on the source document worksheet . After the first minute, tell the patient the following (in even tones): ""You are doing well. You have 5 minutes to go."" When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: ""Keep up the good work. You have 4 minutes to go."""
94,page_94,"Novartis Confidential Page 95 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2Clean ) Protocol No. CLCZ696D2302 When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: ""You are doing well. You are halfway done."" When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: ""Keep up the good work. You have only 2 minutes left."" When the timer shows only 1 minute remaining, tell the patient: ""You are doing well. You have only 1 minute to go."" Do not use other words of encouragement (or body language to speed up). If the patient stops walking during the test and needs a rest, say this: ""You can lean against the wall if you would like; then continue walking whenever you feel able."" Do not stop the timer. If the patient sits down, the test is over or ifthe patient stops before the 6 minutes are up and refuses to continue (or you decide that they should not continue), wheel the chair over for the patient to sit on, discontinue the walk, and note on the worksheet the distance, the time stopped, and the reason for stop ping prematurel y. When the timer is 15 seconds from completion, say this: ""In a moment I'm going to tell you to stop. When I do, just stop right where you are and I will come to you."" When the timer rings (or buzzes), say: ""Stop!"" Walk over to the patient . Consider taking the chair if they look exhausted. Mark the spot where they stopped b y placing a bean bag or a piece of tape on the floor. 9.Post-test: I mmediatel y after completion of the test ,record the post walk Borg d yspnea and fatigue levels and ask : âWhat if anything, kept you from walking farther (faster)?â 10. Measure and record heart rate and blood pressure while the patient is sitting 11.Record the number of lengths walked 12.Calculate the total distance walked, rounding to the nearest meter, and record it on the worksheet. 13. Congratulate the patient on good effort and offer a drink of water. Referenc e: American Thoracic Societ y, 2002"
