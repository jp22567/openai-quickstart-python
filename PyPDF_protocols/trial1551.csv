Upon completion of this study, participants may have the opportunity, subject to regulatory approval, to participate in an open-label extension study of up to 12 months, receiving the 0.3% concentration of drug product (ARQ-151-202). For subjects who enroll in ARQ-151-202, the week 12 visit will complete this study. Subjects who do not enroll in ARQ-151-202 will return for a follow-up visit (4 weeks post-treatment completion). Study Products: • ARQ-151 drug product will be supplied as a 0.3% and 0.15% cream • Matching vehicle cream will contain only excipients of ARQ-151 cream Planned Dose Level: Subjects will receive ARQ-151 cream 0.3% QD or ARQ -151 cream 0.15% QD or matching vehicle cream QD applied to all psoriatic lesions up to and including an area of 20% BSA. Application will be all areas affected including the face and intertriginous/genital regions (except for the scalp). Safety Assessments: Safety will be monitored through application site assessments, safety labs, 12-lead ECGs, PHQ-8, C- SSRS and AEs. Safety Analysis: The following analyses will be performed; however, no formal inferential statistics will be done on safety assessments. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative safety data and frequency counts will be compiled for classification of qualitative safety data. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the PHQ-8. The C-SSRS will be analyzed per the Scoring and Data Analysis Guide from the Columbia Lighthouse Project. Adverse Events: A subject-by-subject treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) data listing, including verbatim term, preferred term, treatment, severity, and relationship to study drug, will be provided. The number of subjects experiencing AEs and number of AEs will be summarized by treatment using frequency counts. Medical History and Physical Examinations: Medical history will be listed by subject. Physical examinations and 12-lead ECGs will be performed at screening, Week 4 and end-of-study. Vital signs will be collected at all study visits. Clinical Laboratory Results: Routine blood chemistries will be obtained at screening, baseline, week 4 and week 12. If Baseline is within 14 days of Screening, the Screening results may be utilized. Urine pregnancy tests will be obtained at screening, baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 12."

Approximately 100 subjects will receive ARQ-151 cream 0.3% QD; approximately 100 subjects will receive ARQ-151 cream 0.15% Q D; approximately 100 subjects will receive matching vehicle cream QD. The randomization scheme will be 1:1:1 (ARQ-151 cream 0.3% QD : ARQ-151 cream 0.15% QD : matching vehicle QD. The sample size was not powered based on data for the primary endpoint to provide statistical significance because of the absence of previous primary endpoint data. However, based on efficacy data from the proof of concept study, this Phase 2b study is expected to provide reliable information regarding the efficacy and safety of the drug products. Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection: PK draws will be done on days 1 (baseline), 29 (week 4) and 85 (week 12) pre-dose (trough) for all subjects. Approximately 30 subjects who enter the 4 week follow up period with greater than or equal to 5% BSA involvement will have the option to have additional PK draws at 72 hr (3 days), 120 hr (5 days), 168 hr (7 days), and 216 hr (9 days) after the last dose of drug. For the 72 hour timepoint, the PK draw should be +/- 2 hours of the last study drug application. The 5, 7 and 9 day draws should be completed in the morning before noon at the site. Statistical Analysis: Four analysis populations will be defined: • Safety population will include all subjects who are enrolled and received at least one confirmed dose of study medication; this population will be defined separately for each cohort. • Intent-to-Treatment (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects. • Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all subjects who are in the safety population, were at least 80% compliant with study medication, and showed no other serious deviations from the study protocol. • PK population will include all subjects receiving the active drug with quantifiable plasma concentrations of roflumilast. Descriptive statistics will be presented for the endpoint data collected in the clinical trial. Missing efficacy data will be estimated by a mixture of linear interpolation and last observation carried forward for the cases were linear interpolation is not computationally possible. The week 6 ‘IGA success’ endpoint will be analyzed with a logistic regression. Statistical comparison between the active treatment arms and vehicle arms will be facilitated by using contrasts."

Amendment 1.0 November 8, 2018 Confidential Page 19 of 83 7 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 7.1 Introduction Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4) inhibitor approved globally to reduce the risk of exacerbations in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) associated with chronic bronchitis. Roflumilast and its active metabolite, roflumilast N-oxide, are high affinity selective inhibitors of PDE -4 (a major cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-metabolizing enzyme), whose activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP. There are four different subtypes of PDE-4: PDE-4a, PDE -4b, PDE-4c, and PDE-4d, each with several isoforms (splicing variants). IC 50 values of both roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide for the different PDE-4 isoforms and subtypes are mostly sub-nanomolar and single digit nanomolar ( Hatzelmann 2010). The PDE-4 family of enzymes are the most prevalent phosphodiesterases in immune cells and inhibition of PDE-4 subtypes has been associated with anti-inflammatory effects in many biological systems. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by raised, well-demarcated, erythematous oval plaques with adherent silvery scales. Numerous past reports have suggested a deficiency of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in human psoriatic skin ( Brion 1986). More recently, various cytokines produced by Th1 and Th17 cells have been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. It has been postulated that the anti-inflammatory effects of PDE-4 inhibitors may provide a beneficial therapeutic intervention in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, and recently Otezla ® (apremilast) a PDE-4 inhibitor has been approved for the oral treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. The past 15 years have witnessed a transformation in the systemic treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis with the advent of biological therapies. However, for patients with milder forms of disease, best treated with topical options, the therapeutic landscape really has not changed in several decades. Topical steroids come in all shapes and forms, but the lower potency steroids are not effective and the higher potency steroids are beset with issues of local skin atrophy and the potential for hypothalamic-pituitary axis suppression when applied over larger body surface areas and for prolonged periods of time. Vitamin D has been the other staple of topical psoriasis treatment but it is irritating, not suitable for use on the face or intertriginous areas, and its efficacy is rather modest. Hence, there is substantial medical need for additional topical approaches in the treatment of psoriasis. The study sponsor is developing a topical formulation of roflumilast for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Our Phase 2a results suggest that ARQ-151 may be a highly efficacious and well-tolerated topical treatment for psoriasis. 7.2 Preclinical Studies Roflumilast was initially developed as a 500 µg tablet for oral therapy in patients with COPD, and as such has been thoroughly evaluated in nonclinical studies. The safety profile is well-established and the results of those studies are relevant to the dermal roflumilast (ARQ-151 cream) development program. Oral roflumilast (500 µg tablet) was approved by Health Canada as DAXAS ® in December 2010 and by the US FDA as DALIRESP® in February 2011 for the treatment of COPD."

21,page_21,"Protocol ARQ-151-201 Arcutis, Inc. Amendment 1.0 November 8, 2018 Confidential Page 21 of 83 Based on the data from this study, t he NOAEL in this strain of mice is the 20 mg/kg dose (2 mL/kg of a 1% w/w formulation). 7.2.2 Oral (Systemic) Studies of Roflumilast and N-Oxide Metabolite The repeat-dose toxicity studies of roflumilast has been evaluated in five animal species, with the longest duration being 6 months in mice, 6 months in rats, 3 months in hamsters, 12 months in dogs and 9-months in monkeys. The N-oxide metabolite has been studied for 6 months in mice, 1 month in rats and 12 months in dogs. Below is a summary of the drug- related effects seen in these studies. Dose-related changes in rodent olfactory mucosa consisted of disorganization and degeneration accompanied by basal cell hyperplasia and inflammatory changes of Bowman’s capsule and submucosa. The rat was the most sensitive species (NOAEL of 0.8 mg/kg/day), while mice and hamsters were less sensitive (NOAEL of 4 mg/kg/day). No equivalent changes were observed in the olfactory mucosa of dogs and monkeys, despite high systemic exposures to roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide. Nasal mucosa lesions in the olfactory region are attributed to a rodent-specific metabolite. Humans do not have the corresponding olfactory-specific enzyme. Gastrointestinal effects in rats (erosion, ulceration and/or inflammation) were seen primarily in the 4-week studies with roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide at the highest doses. Gastrointestinal effects seen in monkeys (inflammation in the pyloric region) were minimal and transient as they occurred after one month of treatment, but were absent after 9 months of dosing. In relation to the approved 500 µg dose, the safety margins (plasma AUC of free drug fraction) for any potential gastrointestinal effects are 3.7- and 7.4-fold for rats, and 15- and 9.3-fold for monkeys, for roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide, respectively. For mice, hamsters and dogs, the safety margins at the highest dose tested are 628-, 22- and 47-fold for roflumilast and 249-, 56- and 3.8-fold for roflumilast N-oxide, respectively. While these margins based on AUC may be somewhat less with topical administration if exposure to roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide is increased with topical administration at high BSAs, gastrointestinal effects are likely to be C max-mediated and thus should be mitigated by a lower, and slower ascent to, C max that occurs with topical administration. Epididymal spermiogenic granuloma as well as tubular dilation and degeneration of the testes were observed in rats treated with roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide at doses >0.8 mg/kg/day or >1.2 mg/kg/day, respectively. No drug-related changes in the testis or epididymis were noted in the other species. Cardiac lesions such as focal hemorrhages, hemosiderin deposits and lympho-histiocytic cell infiltration in the right atria/auricles were found in repeat dose toxicity with roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide in dogs. In a 6-month study in mice, peri-arteritis was seen in 1-2/40 mice at doses > 12 mg/kg/day. In a 1-month study in monkeys, myocarditis was seen in 1/3 monkeys at 0.25 mg/kg/day, but was not seen in a subsequent 9-month study at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The effects seen in the latter two species are not considered treatment related."

Amendment 1.0 November 8, 2018 Confidential Page 22 of 83 Decreased food consumption, reduced body weight gain and adrenal hypertrophy (in mice accompanied by a premature involution of the juxtamedullary x-zone) occurred in mice, rats and hamsters at high doses of roflumilast that produced exposure ratios exceeding 9- to 650-fold the human plasma levels of unbound roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide compared to the 500 µg oral dose.. 7.2.3 Reproductive Toxicity Roflumilast was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits following oral administration up to the highest doses of 1.8 mg/kg/day in rats and 0.8 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Administered at the same doses, roflumilast has been shown to induce mild retardation of embryo-fetal development (incomplete ossification) in the rat, but not in the rabbit. Exposure of pregnant rats to unbound roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide was 1.7 and 10.8 times higher, respectively, than exposure of women at the 500 µ g oral roflumilast dose. In one of three rat studies on fertility and embryo- fetal development, post-implantation losses were observed at oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day. Post-implantation losses were not seen in rabbits up to doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day. Rat and rabbit fetuses were exposed to roflumilast and the permeability of the placental barrier for drug-related material increased with the progression of pregnancy. Prolongation of gestation was seen in mice due to a potential tocolytic effect. There was no effect on female fertility up to the highest roflumilast dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day in rats. Slight reduction in male fertility was seen in conjunction with epididymal toxicity in rats dosed with 1.8 mg/kg/day. This finding is not considered relevant to humans. 7.2.4 Genotoxicity Roflumilast tested positive in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test, but negative in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes, in vitro HPRT test with V79 cells, in vitro micronucleus test with V79 cells, DNA adduct formation assay in rat nasal mucosa, liver and testes, and in vivo mouse bone marrow chromosome aberration assay. Roflumilast N-oxide was negative in the Ames test and the in vitro micronucleus test with V79 cells. 7.2.5 Carcinogenicity In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, roflumilast was administered by gavage at doses up to 18 mg/kg/day in males and 12 mg/kg/day in females. No compound-related tumors occurred. In the two 2-year carcinogenicity studies in hamsters, roflumilast was administered by gavage at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day. Nasal neoplasms (undifferentiated carcinomas of the olfactory epithelium and adenocarcinoma of Bowman’s gland) were observed at the high doses of roflumilast. No other treatment-related neoplastic findings were observed. Overall, the tumor-free level in the animals was 4 mg/kg/day. The significance of this finding to humans is unknown."

An extensive systemic toxicity program that evaluated both roflumilast and its active N-oxide metabolite in multiple species via the oral route of administration was conducted to support registration.

ARQ-151 cream 0.5% and 0.15% have been studied in a Phase 2a study (protocol # ARQ-151-101; NCT03392168) in patients with mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis in the United States and Canada. The study included two cohorts. Cohort 1 was a single dose study to 25 cm 2 of psoriatic plaque(s) in 8 psoriasis subjects. Cohort 1 subjects were then enrolled, if they met entry criteria, into Cohort 2 of the study. Cohort 2 was a parallel group, double blind, vehicle-controlled study in which ARQ-151 cream 0.5%, ARQ-151 cream 0.15% or vehicle cream was applied QD for 28 days to 89 subjects with at least 0.5% BSA of chronic plaque psoriasis; area for application was not to exceed 5.0% BSA. Cohort 2 subjects had at least one target plaque of psorias is of at least 9 cm 2 Target Plaque Area (TPA) in size and with a Target Plaque Severity Score ( TPSS) ≥ 4. However, all body psoriasis plaques were treated except for the face, scalp, intertriginous areas and palms/soles. Only safety and pharmacokinetics were evaluated for the single dose Cohort 1 subjects. In the parallel group assessment (Cohort 2), the Primary Efficacy Endpoint was: • Difference in mean percent change from baseline at week 4 in the product of TPSS x TPA between each dose concentration level of ARQ-151 cream and vehicle control. This was assessed as a sum of up to 3 target plaques per subj ect. Efficacy and safety results of ARQ-151-101 are as follows: • Figure 1 shows evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint at Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, with p values and standard error bars:"

Overall, the safety of oral roflumilast has been well established in its targeted population of mostly middle- and upper-aged individuals who currently smoke cigarettes or have smoked them extensively in the past. Adverse events (AEs) reported with roflumilast tablets have been consistent with those expected for oral PDE -4 inhibitors. In a pooled analysis of safety data from 6-month and 1-year clinical trials (N=8630), the most common AEs were diarrhea, weight loss and nausea. Other AEs reported more frequently with roflumilast treatment than with placebo were back pain, influenza, insomnia and decreased appetite (Michalski 2012 , Wedzicha 2016). In addition to the self-reported cases of weight loss in the 6-month and 1- year oral trials, clinically significant weight loss was also reported in two prospective studies that evaluated weight (Michalski 2012)."
27,page_27,"Protocol ARQ-151-201 Arcutis, Inc. Amendment 1.0 November 8, 2018 Confidential Page 27 of 83 Psychiatric-related AEs were also greater in patients treated with roflumilast tablets (5.9%) compared to those treated with placebo (3.3%). The most common psychiatric-related AEs were insomnia, depression and anxiety. A small number of cases of completed suicide and suicide ideation have been reported in patients taking oral roflumilast in clinicals trials and also during post-marketing experience ( Michalski 2012). The only contraindication to oral roflumilast, other than hypersensitivity to components of the product, is in patients with moderate to severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C), where systemic levels of roflumilast may become highly elevated. 7.4 Rationale for Development In 2016, Snape and colleagues performed a Phase 1 randomized clinical trial to assess the effect on skin inﬁltrate thickness and tolerability of topical phosphodiesterase inhibitors, including roflumilast, in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris using a modiﬁed psoriasis plaque test. The products evaluated were the active comparators calcipotriol 0.005% and betamethasone valerate 0.1% (both in their marketed cream formulations), and investigational cream formulations of roﬂumilast 0.5%, TAK -084 0.5% and 5%. A vehicle cream was used as a control (the vehicle cream and roflumilast formulations in this study were different from the ARQ-151 cream formulation). Each treatment was applied daily to different test sites located on a single psoriasis plaque of an individual for 3 weeks. Fifteen patients with psoriasis were studied. The primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in skin inﬁltrate thickness after 3 weeks of treatment showed statistically signiﬁcant improvements for all treatments: betamethasone valerate (-286.9 μm ), the selective PDE-4 inhibitors roﬂumilast 0.5% (-237.1 μm ), TAK-084 0.5% (-153.6 μm ), TAK-084 5% (-216.7 μm ) and calcipotriol 0.005% (-187.7 μm ) when compared with vehicle cream control (all p < 0.001) ( Snape 2016). 7.4.1 Dose Selection"

Amendment 1.0 November 8, 2018 Confidential Page 28 of 83 7.4.2 Risks and/or Benefits to Subjects Based on the Phase 2a study results, subjects randomized to active treatment groups are likely to see an improvement in their psoriasis with ARQ-151 cream at both the 0.3% and 0.15% dose levels. Subjects randomized to the vehicle arm may also see some improvement as the excipients in the vehicle appeared to have some benefit, likely because of a moisturizing effect on the subject’s psoriatic plaques. The safety monitoring practices employed in this protocol (i.e., physical examinations, vital signs/weight, 12-lead ECGs, local skin toleration assessments, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, PHQ -8, C-SSRS and AE questioning) are adequate to protect the subjects’ safety and should detect expected AEs. Oral roflumilast has now been used for almost a decade in the treatment of COPD exacerbations and its safety record has been well -documented. The known adverse effects of oral treatment in the COPD population (nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, psychiatric AEs; see Section 7.3.2) are monitorable, the current protocol is designed to detect these adverse events and others should they occur, and provides guidance for management, as necessary, to ensure patient safety."

A total of up to approximately 300 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 30 study sites in the United States and Canada. Subjects will be adult (≥18 y/o) males or females with chronic plaque psoriasis. Subjects must have an Investigator’s Global Assessment of disease severity (IGA) of at least Mild (‘2’) at Baseline. Subjects with an IGA of ‘ Mild’ (2) will be limited to 20% of total enrollment. Subjects with an IGA of ‘Severe’ (4) will be limited to 15% of total enrollment. Subjects must have at least 2% and no more than 20% Body Surface Area (BSA) of chronic plaque psoriasis. All psoriasis lesions on a subject will be treated including the face, trunk, genitals/skin folds, or limbs (excluding the scalp). The palms and soles will be treated but will not be counted towards any measurements of efficacy (IGA, BSA, mPAS I). For subjects with intertriginous area involvement, and with severity of the intertriginous area lesions at least ‘mild’ (IGA≥2) at Baseline, ‘I-IGA’ score will be recorded at weeks 4, 6, 8 and 12. The same IGA used for the primary endpoint (whole body) will also be used for ‘intertriginous area lesion IGA score’ (I -IGA) ), but only intertriginous areas will be evaluated for I-IGA, not the rest of the body. 9.2 Subject Participation Subject participation involves a minimum of seven clinic visits:eight clinic visits including Screening, Baseline and five visits at Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8 and Week 12 of treatment and a week 14 follow-up visit (2 weeks after last dose). The interval between the Screening and Baseline visits could be up to 35 days, therefore the anticipated maximum duration of subject participation is ~19 weeks. Upon completion of this study, participants may have the opportunity, subject to regulatory approval, to participate in an open- label extension study of up to 12 months, receiving the 0.3% concentration of drug product. The week 12 visit will be the Day 1 visit for ARQ-151-202.

Amendment 1.0 November 8, 2018 Confidential Page 36 of 83 Generally, the addition of new medications, including nonprescription medications, during the course of the study is discouraged. However, the short-term use of a medication may be authorized by the Investigator. The Investigator must make the decision to authorize the use of any such a medication only after consideration of the clinical situation, the potential for masking symptoms of a more significant underlying event, and whether the use of the medication will compromise the outcome or validity of the clinical investigation. If medication is required, the name, strength, frequency, duration of use, and reason for use will be recorded in source documents and transcribed to Case Report Forms. Medications which have been used chronically by subjects, in particular statins and anti-hypertensives, are allowed for use during the study, except as prohibited in ‘Exclusions’ ( Table 1). 9.5 Treatment 9.5.1 Drug Supplies, Packaging and Labeling ARQ-151 cream or vehicle cream will be in 45 gram squeeze tubes. The tubes will be packaged in kits, each containing 4 tubes of investigational product. The number of kits dispensed to a subject will be based on the BSA involvement of psoriasis. It is anticipated that the maximum number of kits dispensed to a subject will be four. The kits and tubes will be labeled in a blinded manner. The kit(s) dispensed to a subject will be labeled with a unique number. The Sponsor will supply sufficient quantities of the study drug (ARQ-151 cream 0.3%, ARQ-151 cream 0.15%, and matching vehicle cream) to each site to allow for completion of this study. Records will be made of the receipt and dispensing of the study drugs supplied. At the conclusion of the study, any unused study drugs will be returned to the Sponsor or designee, or destroyed, as per Sponsor instructions. 9.5.2 Blinding This is a double-blind study, therefore neither the subjects nor the Investigator and clinical personnel will be aware of which treatment an individual has received. 9.5.3 Treatment Administration At the randomization visit (Baseline visit), the study staff will demonstrate to the subject how to apply ARQ-151 cream or vehicle cream using the first tube from the kit that is assigned to the subject at randomization. Study site staff will be trained to ensure a unit dose (a pea size unit of ARQ-151 vehicle cream will cover approximately 1% BSA) is properly squeezed from the tube and applied to psoriatic lesion(s) as a thin film and rubbed in using the index and middle finger, rubbing in thoroughly but gently, until the ‘white’ has disappeared. The subject will then practice squeezing a similar amount onto their index and middle finger and apply a thin film to other psoriatic areas to be treated. The study staff will confirm that the subject’s application technique is correct."

Subjects will be instructed to apply study medication once daily. All subjects should apply medication each evening (except on clinic visit days) at least 15 minutes after showering or bathing (if they take an evening shower/bath) and then not wash areas where ARQ-151 cream or vehicle has been applied until at least 4 hours after study drug application and preferably not until the following morning. Study medication should be applied at least 20 minutes before going to bed. Subjects should continue to apply study medication to all treatment areas identified by the investigator at Baseline using a Body Diagram even if that area has cleared during the treatment period. New plaques that develop during the study should be treated as well. Each study medication tube will be weighed prior to dispensing at the baseline vi sit or subsequent visits. Study medication tubes must be returned by subjects at each study visit, both empty and full, and will be weighed. If the subject’s actual use is substantially different than the expected use for the subject’s BSA (see IP Manual), the subject will be retrained on the study drug application technique. 9.5.4 Treatment Compliance Study medication tubes will be weighed at each follow-up clinic visit. Subjects will complete a daily diary recording the date and time of each dose applied, any missed doses, and a comment section should the subjects have a comment, e.g., record potential AEs. Site personnel will review the diaries and use the information to question the subject regarding compliance and AEs and then record appropriate information in source documents and complete Case Report Forms ( CRFs). If a subject misses a dose, they should be instructed to return to the protocol study medication administration schedule (i.e. if subject forgets a dose they should wait until that evening and apply as usual). A subject will be considered compliant with the dosing regiment if the subject applies at least 80% of the expected applications during the study drug application period and does not miss more than 3 consecutive doses. Compliance will be assessed by review of the dosing diary. Weight of study medication applied will be measured for reporting purposes. If the diary shows less than 80% of expected use, the subject is using too little study drug and retraining must be conducted and documented. Compliance will be documented in source and in eCRF."

Modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (mPASI) is used for the measurement of severity of psoriasis. mPASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). The body is divided into four sections (head (h) (10% of a person's skin); arms (a) (20%); trunk (t) (30%); legs (l) (40%)). Each of these areas is scored by itself, and then the four scores are combined into the final mPASI. For each section, the percent of area (A) of skin involved is estimated and then transformed into a grade from 0 to 6 (A): 0. 0% of involved area 1. < 10% of involved area - see below for Modified PASI (mPASI) for this grade 2. 10–29% of involved area 3. 30–49% of involved area 4. 50–69% of involved area 5. 70–89% of involved area 6. 90–100% of involved area mPASI: for subjects with < 10% of an involved anatomic area, the mPASI will be calculated using the actual percentage of the anatomical area involved (e.g. 0.1 for 1%, 0.2 for 2%, 0.3 for 3%, … 0.9 for 9%), corresponding to the actual percentage of that particular anatomical area of involvement. Note: Palms and soles may be treated with study medication in this study, but will not be counted towards IGA, mPASI , or BSA assessments. Within each area, the severity is estimated by three clinical signs: erythema ( ‘E’; redness), induration ( ‘T’; thickness) and desquamation ( ‘S’; scaling). Severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 to 4, from none to maximum severity possible."

An SAE is any AE that in the view of either the PI or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Life-threatening is defined as an AE that in the view of the PI or Sponsor, places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. Hospitalization does not include the following: • Rehabilitation facilities, hospice facilities or respite care (e.g. caregiver relief) • Nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities • Emergency room visits • Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures) • <24 hour admissions for observation or evaluation Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: • Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen • Hospitalizations for cosmetic elective surgery, social, and/or convenience admissions • Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline documentation for the individual subject."
50,page_50,"Protocol ARQ-151-201 Arcutis, Inc. Amendment 1.0 November 8, 2018 Confidential Page 50 of 83 • Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs; however, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it occurs during the reporting period and meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as an AE, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. Unexpected is defined as an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current IND /CTA. If a SAE occurs to a subject on this study, contact the Sponsor personnel listed in Section 2 within one business day of knowledge of event. 10.4.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) This is defined as a serious adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the known study treatment information. A serious event or reaction is not defined as a SUSAR when: ‘it is serious but expected’ or it does not fit the definition of an SAE, whether expected or not. 10.4.4 Safety Review At each follow-up visit, subjects will be queried with an open-ended question such as: ‘How have you been feeling since your last visit?’ Additionally, the study staff will review subject diaries and, if it appears that a potential AE was recorded, study staff will query the subject and determine if an AE occurred. AEs (whether serious or non-serious) and clinically significant abnormal laboratory test value(s) will be evaluated by the PI and treated and/or followed up for up to one month after end of treatment until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by the PI. Where appropriate, medical test(s) and/or examination(s) will be performed to document resolution of event(s). Outcome may be classified as resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal or unknown (lost to follow-up). 10.4.5 Adverse Event Reporting The PI will review each event and assess its relationship to drug treatment (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, likely). Each sign or symptom reported will be graded on the NIH NCI CTCAE toxicity grading scale 5-point severity scale (Grade 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). The date and time of onset, time relationship to drug dosing, duration, and outcome (resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown/lost to follow-up) of each event will be noted. The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be assessed using the following definitions:"
51,page_51,"Protocol ARQ-151-201 Arcutis, Inc. Amendment 1.0 November 8, 2018 Confidential Page 51 of 83 Unrelated • The AE must clearly be caused by the subject’ s clinical state, or the study procedure/conditions. • Definitely not related to drug. • Temporal sequence of an AE onset relative to administration of drug not reasonable. • Another obvious cause of an AE. Unlikely • Time sequence is unreasonable. • There is another more likely cause for an AE. Possibly • Corresponds to what is known about the drug. • Time sequence is reasonable. • Could have been due to another equally, likely cause. Probably • Is a known effect of the drug. • Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable. • Ceases on stopping the drug. • Cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state. Likely • Is a known effect of the drug (e.g., listed in Physicians' Desk Reference, Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties, IB). • Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable. • Event stops upon stopping drug, event returns upon restarting drug. The following CTCAE toxicity grading scale 5-point severity sca le definitions for rating maximum severity will be used: Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age - appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.* Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living.** Note: An experience may be severe but may not be serious, e.g., severe headache). Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE. Note: A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade. *Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. **Self-care activities of daily living refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden."

If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and followed until the pregnancy comes to term. The investigator is responsible for reporting all available pregnancy information on the pregnancy report within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, although pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. Study treatment must be discontinued immediately in the event of a pregnancy. The subject should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Monitoring of the subject should continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy. Follow-up information detailing the outcome of the pregnancy and the health of the newborn should be reported as it becomes available. Partner pregnancies of a male subject do not need to be reported. Any pregnancy complication or premature terminations including miscarriage, spontaneous abortion or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an SAE, as described in Section 10.4.2. Should the pregnancy result in a congenital abnormality or birth defect, a separate SAE report must be submitted. Furthermore, all neonatal deaths that occur within 30 days of the birth should be reported as SAEs, without regard to causality. In addition, any infant death that occurs after the 30-day reporting period that the investigator suspects is related to the in-utero exposure to the study treatment should also be reported. 10.6 Treatment Stopping Rules If a subject has non-cutaneous adverse events of concern, clinically significant laboratory values or any condition that the investigator determines could possibly be related to the study drug, the Investigator should immediately contact the Medical Monitor to discuss if the subject should be discontinued from the study. Treatment for any individual subject will be discontinued if the subject: • Experiences a serious adverse event (SAE) or a clinically significant non-serious AE which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or Medical Monitor warrants discontinuation from the study for that subject’s well-being. • A severe (Grade 3) laboratory abnormality (confirmed by repeat sample and considered related to study drug). o See Appendix 6 for details. Dosing of study drug for an individual subject may be suspended for safety concerns other than those described above, at the discretion of the investigator if he/she feels the subject’s safety may be threatened."

Amendment 1.0 November 8, 2018 Confidential Page 53 of 83 A subject with a PHQ-8 score of ‘15’ or above should be referred promptly to a mental health care professional and consideration be given to discontinuation from study drug. A subject that is experiencing suicidal ideation and behavior should be referred immediately to a qualified mental health care provider and consideration given to discontinuation from study drug. As noted above, study treatment must be discontinued immediately in the event of a female subject’s pregnancy. Treatment should be interrupted: • If a subject develops an application site reaction with the clinical appearance of an ‘irritation reaction’, and with a severity of a Dermal Response Score of 5 (erythema, edema and papules) or greater on the scale of Berger and Bowman, treatment should be interrupted for up to one week and may then be resumed if the reaction has, in the opinion of the Investigator, adequately resolved. Treatment should be discontinued: • If the reaction reoccurs, treatment should be discontinued permanently, and the subje ct followed until the reaction resolves. Given the excellent local toleration in the Phase 1/2a study, such reactions are possible, but unlikely. 10.6.1 Emergency Unblinding If the situation requires emergency unblinding this will be done by investigator using the study IWRS system after discussion with Medial Monitor and the Sponsor’s CMO. 11 DATA ANALYSIS Data will be handled and processed according to the Contract Research Organization’s Standard Operating Procedures, which are written based on the principles of GCP. 11.1 Statistical Methods The methodology presented below is a summary of the more detailed analysis plan that will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized before the database is locked and unblinded. Any changes to the methods described in the final SAP will be described and justified in the clinical study report. All statistical processing will be performed using SAS ® (Version 9.4) unless otherwise stated. No interim efficacy analyses are planned. Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic results. For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be presented. The denominator for percentage will be based on the number of subjects appropriate for the purpose of analysis. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics"

Missing efficacy data will be estimated by a mixture of linear interpolation and last observation carried forward for the cases were linear interpolation is not computationally possible. P-values of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant based on a two-sided test unless otherwise specified. No adjustment will be made for multiplicity. 11.1.1 Determination of Sample Size A sample size of approximately 300 subjects are planned for the study. Approximately 100 subjects will receive ARQ-151 cream 0.3% QD; approximately 100 subjects will receive ARQ-151 cream 0.15% Q D; and approximately 100 subjects will receive matching vehicle cream QD. The randomization scheme will be 1:1:1 (ARQ-151 cream 0.3% QD: ARQ-151 cream 0.15% QD: matching vehicle QD). The sample size was not powered based on data for the primary endpoint to provide statistical significance because of the absence of previous primary endpoint data. However, based on efficacy data from the Phase 1/2a study, this Phase 2b study is expected to provide reliable information regarding the efficacy and safety of the drug products. 11.1.2 Subjects to Analyze Safety population will include all subjects who are enrolled and received at least one confirmed dose of study medication. This population will be defined separately for each cohort. The Intent- to-Treatment (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects. Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all subjects who are in the safety population, were at least 80% compliant with study medication application, and showed no other serious deviations from the study protocol. The PK population will include all subjects receiving the active drug with sufficient plasma concentrations of roflumilast to define a profile, as determined by the pharmacokineticist. This population will be defined separately for each cohort. 11.1.3 Interim Analysis No interim efficacy analyses are planned. 11.1.4 Background and Demographic Characteristics Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic characteristics (age, sex, and race) and background characteristics for the enrolled subjects.
