Secondary Objectives • To evaluate the safety of VX-445/TEZ/IVA • To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VX-445/TEZ/IVA Endpoints Primary Endpoint • Absolute change in CF Questionnaire -Revised (CFQ -R) respiratory domain score from baseline through Week 24 Key Secondary Endpoint • Absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV 1) from baseline through Week 24 Secondary Endpoints • Absolute change in sweat chloride (SwCl) from baseline through Week 24 • Safety and tolerability assessments based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry Number of Subjects Up to a pproximately 158 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to either the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group or the TEZ/IVA group. Study Population Male and female CF subjects who are 12 years of age or older and have an F/F genotype Investigational Drug During the TEZ/IVA Run -in Period, study drug refers to TEZ/IVA and IVA. During the Treatment Period, study drug refers to VX-445/TEZ/IVA and matching placebo, TEZ/IVA and matching pla cebo, and IVA. Active study drugs will be orally administered as fixed -dose combination (FDC) film-coated tablets (either VX-445/TEZ/IVA or TEZ/IVA) in the morning and as a film-coated IVA tablet in the evening. Active substance: VX-445/TEZ (VX -661)/IV A (VX -770)"

Study Design This is a Phase 3b, randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter study (Figure 2-1). Figure 2-1 Schematic of the Study Design IVA: ivacaftor; N: number of subjects; TEZ: tezacaftor Note: The Safety Follow -up Visit is not required for subjects who complete the Week 24 Visit and have enrolled in an open -label study within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. In the TEZ/IVA Run -in Period, all subjects will receive TEZ 100 mg once daily (qd)/IVA 150 mg every 12 hours (q12h). After completing the TEZ/IVA Run -in Period, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group or TEZ/IVA group for the Treatment Period (Table 2-1).

If the Day -14 ppFEV 1 value is not valid or not"
3,page_3,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 4 of 60 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated available, the most recent available ppFEV 1 value will be used for stratification. Assessments Efficacy: CFQ -R, spirometry PD: SwCl Safety: AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, ophthalmologic examinations, and physical examinations Statistical Analyses Statistical Methods/Analyses The baseline value, unless otherwise specified, will be defined as the most recent non-missing measurement collected before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit). The TEZ/IVA Run -in Period is intended to establish a reliable on -treatment (TEZ/I VA) baseline for comparison during the Treatment Period. The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in CFQ -R respiratory domain score from baseline through Week 24. The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in CFQ -R respiratory domain score from baseline through Week 24 is the same for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups. The null hypothesis will be tested at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05. Assuming a within -group SD of 18 and a treatment difference of 10 be tween VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA, a sample size of 71 subjects completing the Treatment Period in each group for a total of 142 subjects will have approximately 90% power for the CFQ -R respiratory domain score hypothesis testing, based on a 2 - sample t -test at a significance level of 0.05. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, up to approximately 158 subjects will be enrolled. The primary analysis for CFQ -R will be based on a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference through Week 24. The treatment difference at each post-baseline visit, obtained from the model , will also be provi ded. A hierarchical fixed -sequence testing procedure will be used to control the overall family -wise type I error for the testing of the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint. The safety endpoints include AEs, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry through the Safety Follow -up Visit. The safety analysis will be descriptive only."

CF affects more than 70,000 individuals worldwide1 (approximately 30,000 in the US2 and 45,000 in the EU3) . Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease .4, 5 CF is caused by decreased quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene .6 CFTR is an ion channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other ions across e pithelia in various tissues, including the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands.7 Decreased CFTR quantity or function results in the failure to regulate chloride transport in these tissues, leading to the multisystem pathology associated with CF .8 In the lungs, obstruction of airways with thick mucus, establishment of a chronic bacte rial infection in the airways, and damaging inflammatory responses are all thought to play a role in causing irreversible structural changes in the lungs, leading to respiratory failure. Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality .9 The most common disease-causing CFTR mutation is F508de l, which accounts for approximately 70% of the identified alleles in people with CF .10 Approximately 40% to 45% of pe ople with CF are homozygous for F508del (F/F), and approximately 85% ha ve at least 1 F508del a llele. 2, 3 Based on the understanding of the molecular defects caused by CFTR mutations, 2 complementary approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or func tion of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators increase the channel open probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport. With differing mechanisms of action, a combination of correctors and potentiators increases F508del CFTR-mediate d chloride transport more than either type of modulator alone. The therapeutic activity of CFTR modulators has been established with products developed by Vertex and approved for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco ), lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA (Orkambi®), and tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA (Symdeko /Symkevi®). VX-445 is a next-generation CFTR corrector. In vitro, the triple combination (TC) of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA ( VX-445/TEZ/IVA) increased CFTR chloride transport more than any of the dual c ombinations (VX-445/TEZ, VX-445/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) or individual components ( VX-445, TEZ , and IVA) when added to human bronchial epithelial cells derived from 2 groups of CF patients: those heterozygous for F508del with a second CFTR allele carrying a minimal function (MF ) mutation that is not responsive to TEZ, IVA, and TEZ/IVA (F/MF genotypes); and those homozygous for F508del (F/F genotypes). Additi onal information about VX-445 /TEZ/IVA can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 5.2 Rationale for the Present Study This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX-445/TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF who ha ve an F/F genotype. The potential for benefit in these patients is supported b y in vitro data and"
16,page_16,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 17 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Phase 3 clinical data in subjects with F/F genotypes. In addition, VX-445/TEZ/IVA is generally sa fe and well tolerated (refer to VX-445 Investigator’s Brochure). The primary endpoint of this study is a widely accepted quality of life measure for subjects with CF; these data are intended to enrich the body of evidence showing that VX - 445/TEZ/IVA pr ovides additional benefit to subjects with F/F genotypes over currently available CFTR modulators. 6 STUDY OBJECTIVES 6.1 Primary Objective To evaluate the efficacy of VX-445/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects, homozygous for F508de l (F/F). 6 .2 Secondary Objectives  To e valuate the safety of VX-445/TEZ/IVA  To e valuate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VX-445/TEZ/IVA 7 STUDY ENDPOINTS 7.1 Primary Endpoint  Absolut e change in CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain score from ba seline through Week 24 7 .2 Key Secondary Endpoint  Absolut e change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV 1) from baseline through Week 24 7 .3 Secondary Endpoints  Absolut e change in sweat chloride (SwCl) from baseline through Week 24  S afety and tolerability assessments based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry 8 STUDY POPULATION Eligibility will be reviewed and documented by an appropriately qualified member of the investigator’s team before subjects receive study drug on Day -28.

In the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period, all subjects will receive TEZ 100 mg once daily (qd)/IVA 150 mg every 12 hours (q12h). After completing the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period, subjects will be ra ndomized (1:1) to the TC group or TEZ/IVA group for the Treatment Period. Randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1 determined during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period (Day -14 a ssessment; <70 versus ≥70), age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and whether the subject is receiving CFTR modulator treatment at the Screening Visit (yes versus no). If the Day -14 ppFEV 1 value is not valid or not available, the most recent available ppFEV 1 va lue will be used for stratifica tion. The dosages for the Treat ment Period are shown in Table 9-1.

20,page_20,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 21 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Screening assessments will be used to confirm that subjects meet the eligibility criteria. The investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee) will obtain informed consent and assent, if applicable, from each subject before any study procedure takes place. 9.1.1.1 Repetition of Screening Assessment(s) Screening assessments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility. If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 9.1.1.2 Rescreening Subjects may be rescreened once. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated, except for:  C FTR genotyping  F ollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was in the postmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory performing the test during prior screening)  Ophthalmologic examination (if performed within 3 months of the date of informed consent, for subjects <18 years of age) If a subject is rescreened, a new screening window will begin when the first rescreening assessment has been initiated. 9.1.1.3 Extension of Screening Period Window A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks for the following reasons:  R epetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section 9.1.1.1)  Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria  S cheduling of ophthalmologic examination (for subjects <18 years of age on the date of informed consent, Section 11.5.6) 9.1.2 Tezacaftor/Iva caftor Run-in Period The TEZ/IVA Run-in Period has a 4-week duration and is designed to establish a reliable on-treatment (TEZ/IVA) baseline for the Treatment Period. The first dose of open-label TEZ /IVA will be administered at t he Day -28 Visit. The last dose of open-label TEZ/IVA will be administered in the evening on Day -1 (1 day before the Day 1 Visit). The Day -14 spirometry assessment will be used for stratification of randomization to the Treatment Period (Section 9.2). S ubjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period will not be randomized or participate in the Treatment Period (Section 9.1.5.1). 9.1.3 Treatment Period The Treatment Period will be randomized, double-blind, and active-controlled. It will last approximately 24 weeks (Day 1 to Week 24). Study drug administration details are provided in Section 9.6."
21,page_21,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 22 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Randomization will occur before the first dose of study drug during the Treatment Period and may occur on either Day - 1 or Day 1. Randomization and stratification details are provided in Section 9.2. To e nter the Treatment Period, subjects must have stable CF disease (as judged by the investigator) and have remained on a stable CF treatment regimen during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period. If these conditions are not met (for example, if the subject has an acute upper or lower respiratory infection, PEx, or changes in therapy [including antibiotics] for sinopulmonary disease within 28 days before the Day 1 Visit [first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period]), subjects may be rescreened once (Section 9.1.1.2) and re-enter the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period on Day -28. S ubjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period will remain in the study from the time of discontinuation of study drug treatment through the last scheduled study visit and complete the assessments for all study visits, as described in Section 9.1.5.2. 9.1.4 Follow- up The Safety Follow-up Visit will occur approximately 28 (± 7) days after the last dose of study drug for subjects who complete study drug dosing and for subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing, as described in Secti on 9.1.5. An ope n-label roll-over study will be available for subjects who complete the Week 24 Visit and are eligible. The Safety Follow-up Visit is not required for subjects who complete the Week 24 Visit and enroll in an open-label roll-over study within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 9.1.5 Early Termination of Treatment If a subject prematurely discontinues study drug treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (E TT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the decision to discontinue treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow-up Visit, approximately 28 days after their last dose of study drug. The assessments performed at the Safety F ollow-up Visit are listed in Table 3-2. If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or late r following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow-up Visi t, and a separate Safety Follow-up Visit will not be required. If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent or assent, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples collected before such withdrawal of consent or assent. 9.1.5.1 Discontinuation During the Run-in Period Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period will not be randomized or participate in the Treatment Period. These subjects will complete an ETT Visit and Safety Follow-up Visit (as applicable; see Section 9.1.5). The Safety Follow-up Visit will be their last visit in the study. 9.1.5 .2 Discontinuation During the Treatment Period Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period will continue to complete all scheduled study visits following completion of the ETT Visit, as"
22,page_22,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 23 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated detailed in Table 3-2. These subjects will complete an ETT Visit and Safety Follow-up Visit (as applicable; see Section 9.1.5 ). 9.1.6 Lost to Follow- up A subjec t will be considered lost to follow-up if both of the following occur:  The subject misses 2 consecutive study visits (telephone contact and/or clinic visit) and is subsequently unable to be contacted by telephone (3 documented attempts by telephone within 2 weeks following the second missed visit).  The subject does not respond within 2 weeks to a registered letter sent after the 3 attempted telephone contacts. 9.1.7 Comple tion of Study Participation Completion of study participation for each individual subject is defined as one of the following:  F or subjects who complete the Treatment Period and enter an open-label study within 28 days of the Week 24 Visit: the Week 24 Visit  F or subjects who complete the Treatment Period and do not enter an open-label study within 28 days of the Week 24 Visit: the Safety Follow-up Visit  For subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as applicable): The latest of the Week 24 Visit, ETT Visit, or Safety Follow-up Visi t (if required)  F or subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as applicable): the ETT or Safety Follow-up Visit (if required)  F or subjects who withdraw consent or assent: date of withdrawal of consent or assent, whichever is earlier (Section 9.9) If subjects are lost to follow-up (Sec tion 9.1.6), the date of completion of study participation will be defined as the date of the last contact. The e nd of study is defined in Section 13.2.8. 9.2 Method of Ass igning Subjects to Treatment Groups Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the VX-445/TEZ/IVA or TEZ/IVA group. Randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1 determined during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period (Day -14 a ssessment; <70 versus ≥70), age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and whe ther the subject is receiving CFTR modulator treatment at the Screening Visit (yes versus no). If the Day -14 ppFEV 1 value is not valid or not available, the most recent available ppFEV 1 va lue will be used for stratification. An interactive web response system (I WRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The randomization code list will be produc ed by Vertex Biometrics or a qualified randomization vendor."
23,page_23,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 24 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.3 Rationale for Study Elements 9.3.1 Study Design A randomized, double-blind, controlled study design was selected to assess the effects of VX-445/TEZ/IVA while avoiding observer bias. TEZ/IVA is considered an appropriate active c ontrol since TEZ/IVA (Symdeko/Symkevi) is approved to treat CF in this patient population. A 4-week TEZ/IVA Run-in Period was incorporated into this study to establish a reliable on-treatment (TEZ/IVA) baseline for comparison during the Treatment Period. The study will have a 24-week duration to allow for the collection of controlled efficacy and safety data. The extent of response to CFTR modulator treatment may depend on the subject’s ppFEV 1 value (a n index of disease severity) before the start of randomized study drug dosing. Some subjects in this study may be receiving treatment with LUM/IVA or TEZ/IVA at screening, while some subjects may not be receiving treatment with CFTR modulators. Therefore, randomization will be stratified by previous CFTR modulator use and ppFEV 1 value determined during the TEZ /IVA Run-in Period after at least 13 days of treatment with TEZ/IVA (Day -14 assessment). Randomization will also be stratified by age at screening. This will ensure a balanced evaluation of adult and adolescent subjects. 9.3.2 Study Population CF patients with the F/F genotype have continuing unmet needs despite the availability of CFTR modul ators, and are expected to respond to a TC regimen of VX-445/TEZ/IVA based on results fr om Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in this population. The VX-445 Phases 2 and 3 clinical safety and efficacy data support the enrollment of subjects ≥12 a nd <18 years of age in this study. 9.3.3 Study Drug Dose VX-445 Dosage A VX- 445 dose of 200 mg qd will be administered. This is the dosing regimen that was evaluated in Phase 3 studies of VX-445/TEZ/IVA. T EZ/IVA Dosage TEZ will be administered as 100 mg qd and IVA will be administered as 150 mg q12h. This is the a pproved dosing regimen for Symdeko/Symkevi. 9.3.4 Rationale for Study Assessments SwCl, spirometry, and CFQ-R endpoints are widely accepted and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of individuals with CF and were evaluated in previous registration studies of CFTR modulators. All safety assessments are standard measurements for clinical studies in drug development."

A non-exhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for medication will be pr ovided in the Study Reference Manual. Table 9-2 Prohibited Medications Medication Timing of Restriction Rationale Start of Restriction End of Restriction Moderate and strong CYP3A inducers None allowed within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug on Day -28 None allowed through completion of study participation VX-445, TEZ, and IVA are metabolized extensively via CYP3A4. Therefore, use of moderate and strong inducers of CYP3A and moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP3A, which have the potential to alter the exposure of VX-445, TEZ, or IVA, will be prohibited. Moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors (except ciprofloxacin)a None allowed within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug on Day -28 None allowed through completion of study participation Non-Vertex CFTR modulators (investigational or approved) None allowed within 28 days or 5 terminal half -lives (whichever is longer) before screening None allowed through completion of study participation These agents may confound the results of this study. Vertex CFTR modulators (investigational or approved), except for study drugs None allowed from the first dose of study drug on Day -28 None allowed until after the last dose of study drug These agents may confound the results of this study. CYP: cytochrome P450; IVA: ivacaftor; TEZ: tezacaftor a Ciprofloxacin is not a moderate CYP3A inhibitor on the basis of result s of a drug -drug interaction study conducted with IVA, a sensitive CYP3A substrate (Kalydeco [ivacaftor] US Package Insert). 9.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications Information regarding prior and concomitant medications, including CF medications, other medications, and herbal and na turopathic remedies, will be collected from each subject’s source documentation for medications t aken within 56 days before the Screening Visit through completion of study pa rticipation, as defined in Section 9.1.7. For subjects who a re screened, but are not subsequently randomized into the Treatment Period, details of prior medication will be documented only in the subjects’ source documents.  Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28 days before the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period/Da y -28 through completion of study participation. Stable treatment regimen is defined as the current treatment regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 28 days b efore the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period/Day -28. Subjects may remain on Vertex CFTR modulators (investi gational or approved) during the Screening Period and may transition directly to the TEZ/IVA Run-in/Day -28 without a washout ( Table 9-2). Subjects"
25,page_25,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 26 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated should not initiate long-term treatment with new medication from 28 days before th e TEZ/IVA Run -in Period/Day -28 through completion of study participation. Guidelines for stable treatment regimens for CF are as follows: o S ubjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. o S ubjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchroniz ed as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto the inhaled antibiotic. o S ubjects who alternate between 2 different inhaled antibiotics should remain on the same cycling schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics.  S ubjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days.  VX -445 may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which may increase the exposure of medicinal products tha t are substrates for these transporters. Substrates such as statins, glyburide, n ateglinide, and repaglinide should be used with caution.  I VA is a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Administration of IVA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, should be used with caution and appropriate monitoring.  I VA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore during coadministration with warfarin, additional monitoring of the international normalized ratio is recommended. Other medicinal products that are CYP2C9 subst rates for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these should be used with caution.  I nformation about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spirometry assessments performed according to the guidelines provided in Section 11.4.2 . 9 .6 Administration 9.6.1 Dosing Study drug will be administered orally. All subjects will receive the same number of tablets each day to maintain the blind. Additional information is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Study drug should be administered with a fat-containing meal or snack, such as a standard “CF” meal or snack or a standard meal. 1. I t is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack. 2. Study drug will be administered as fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet(s) (e.g., 2 VX-445/TEZ/IVA or matching placebo tablets; 1 TEZ/IVA or matching placebo"
26,page_26,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 27 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated tablet) in the morning and as 1 IVA tablet in the evening. For each subject, doses of study drugs should be taken at approximately the same time (± 2 hours) each day. 3. On da ys of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by the site for the morning dose of study drug. 4. I f a subject’s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be used:  If the dose in the clinic will be within 6 hours of the subject’s scheduled morning dose, the subjec t should withhold their morning dose of study drug and the morning dose will be administered in the clinic.  I f the dose in the clinic will be more than 6 hours after the subject’s scheduled morning dose, the subject should take the morning dose of study drug at home. 5. S ubjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate. 9.6.2 Missed Doses If 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the subject should take the mis sed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule. Morning dose: If more than 6 hours have passed since the missed morning dose, the subject should take the missed dose as soon as possible and should not take the evening dose. Evening dose : If more than 6 hours have passed since the missed evening dose, the subject should not take the missed dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual time. Morning and evening doses should not be taken at the same time. 9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed. Treatment may be interrupted; if any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing. 9.8 Study Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules In subjects who have interrupted study drug for >72 hours for any reason, the investigator should resume study drug only after a thorough investigation of the cause for interruption. The investigator should evaluate the subject’s clinical stability and only resume drug after the subject is clinically stable and there is no comorbidity or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject. The medical monitor should be notified of an interruption of study drug that lasts >72 hours for any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption. The medical monitor should be notified of any plan to discontinue study drug. 9.8.1 Liver Function Tests The central laboratory will notify the medical monitor of instances of ALT or AST >3 × ULN in a ssociation with total bilirubin >2 × ULN that are derived from centrally submitted samples."
27,page_27,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 28 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Subjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central l aboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of AL T, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. If a subject cannot return to the site for central laboratory confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (before confirmatory testing) if any of the following criteria are met:  ALT or AST >8 × ULN  A LT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  A LT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice A thorough inve stigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. Study drug administration must be discontinued if the following criterion is met:  Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, alcohol ingestion) is identified, reg ardless of whether transaminase levels have improved All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the dura tion of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified before resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat testin g within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 9.8.2 Rash Individuals who de velop a generalized rash will be monitored closely. Study drug dosing should be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that is considered a serious adverse event (SAE). The investigator will notify the medical monitor of any rash that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade 3 or higher (Section 13.1.1.4 ), or is an S AE. Investigators should consider additional evaluation including laboratory testing (e.g., complete blood count with differential, liver function tests), photographs of the rash, and dermatology consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug if considered clinically appropriate."

Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed, provided that the subject has not withdrawn consent (and assent, as applicable). In addition, a subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment if the subject meets any of the following criteria:  Ha s a screening CFTR genotype that does not confirm study eligibility if a previous CFTR genotype laboratory report was used to establish eligibility. These subjects must be discontinued from the study (Section 8.1)  Mee ts any of the stopping (discontinuation) criteria (Section 9.8)  B ecomes pregnant (Section 11.5.7.2) S ubjects who discontinue study drug treatment should return for study assessments, as noted in Section 9.1.5.2. If a subject does not re turn for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety Follow-up Visit, if applicable (see Section 9.1.5), and follow up with the subject regarding any unre solved AEs. If the subject withdraws consent or assent for the study, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study is over, and may use the samples and information in the development of the study compound, and for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If the subject withdraws from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will not be able to request t he withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from him/her during the study as long as those samples can be identified as his/her samples. 9.10 Replacement of Subjects Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn before the first dose of randomized study drug on Day 1 of the Treatment Period may be replaced.

The study monitor must review the drug accountability documentation on a regular basis. The study monitor will promptly communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he/she is unable to resolve with the site. 10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented. 10.6 Compliance To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug count. If a subject demonstrates continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational efforts, the investigator should consider discontinuing the subject from the study. 10.7 Blinding and Unblinding This will be a double-blind study. 10.7.1 Blinding All subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site personnel (including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the Vertex study team will be blinded to the treatment codes. Individuals who may be unblinded include only the following:  An y site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject in the event of a life-threatening medical emergency  Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject and her fetus in the event of a pregnancy  Ve rtex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE processing and reporting regulations  Ve ndor preparing the final (production) randomization list  Ve rtex IWRS Manager  Ve rtex Clinical Supply Chain"
31,page_31,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 32 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated A limited Vertex team may be unblinded if an interim analysis ( IA) is performed. Members of the lim ited Vertex unblinded team will not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the study to protect the integrity of the study (Section 12.3.5.1). Access to Spirometry and SwCl Results: During the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will not have access to the spirometry or SwCl results after the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. Shortly before any planned efficacy analysis is conducted, the spirometry and SwCl data will be reviewed for data cleaning purposes by a biostatistician who does not have access to the treatment codes. Individual SwCl test results will not be disclosed to the study sites with the exception of the screening values. Subjects and their parents/caregivers/companions should not be informed of study-related spirometry results until Vertex has determined that the study has completed (i.e., clinical study report [CSR] finalization), regardless of whether the subject has prematurely disconti nued treatment. 10.7.2 Unblinding At the initiation of the study, study site personnel will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The unblinding method will be either manual or electronic. Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Investigator for Medical Emergencies or Urgent Clinical Situations Unblinding of the individual subject’s treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject’s study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to discuss unblinding. If investigators deem it unnecessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the medical monitor to discuss unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding. Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be in a separate document. If a subject’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24 hours of the unblinding event. The reason and the dat e of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject’s study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with Vertex, the contract research organization, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the investigator will consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex GPS or designee, per Section 13.1.2 ."

In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety, unblind individual subjects at any time. Unblinding: Interim Analysis A limited Vertex team may be unblinded if an IA is performed. Members of the limited Vertex unblinded team will not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaini ng part of the study to protect the integrity of the study (Section 12.3.5.1 ) . Regardless of the outcome of the IA, subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site personnel (including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the Vertex study team will remain blinded until the final database lock. 11 ASSESSMENTS 11.1 Timing of Assessments The timing of assessments is shown in Table 3-1 and Ta ble 3-2. 11.2 Subject and Disease Characteristics Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, height, and weight. Medical history will be elicited from each subject and extracted from medical records during screening. Based on the medical history, the subjec t will be assessed for any disqualifying medical conditions as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history will include a complete review of systems, medical and surgical histories, and any allergies. 11.3 Pharmacodynamics: Sweat Chloride SwCl samples will be collected with an approved collection device. Each collection will occur before study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1). At each time point, 2 samples will be collected, 1 from each arm (left and right). Sweat samples will be sent t o a central laboratory for testing and interpretation of results. Specific instructions for the collection, handling, processing, and shipping of SwCl samples to the central laboratory will be provided separately. See Section 10.7.1 for information about access to SwCl results. 11.4 Efficacy 11.4.1 Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised The questionnaires provide information about demographics; general quality of life, school, work, or daily activities; and symptom difficulties (pertaining to CF). Subjects will be asked to complete the CFQ-R in their native language, if validated translations are available.16, 17 If there is no validated translation available in the subject’s native language, the subject will not complete the questionnaire. Copies of the CFQ-R used will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. Validated translations of the C FQ-R, if available, will be provided for participating centers in non-English-speaking countries.18, 19"

Subjects who are 12 and 13 years of age at the date of informed consent will complete the CFQ-R Child version themselves, and their parents/caregivers will complete the CFQ-R Parent version, at all visits, regardless of whether the subject subsequently turns 14 years of age during the study. Subjects 14 years of age and older at the date of informed consent will complete the Adolescent/Adult version of the questionnaire themselves at all visits. 11.4.2 Spirometry Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines/European Respiratory Society Guidelines12 and according to the additional guidelines that follow. P re-bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for subjects who have • withheld their shor t-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic (e.g., ipratropium bromide [Atrovent®]) for more than 4 hours before the spirometry assessment; • withheld their long -acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) for more than 12 hours before the spirometry assessment; and • withheld their onc e-daily, long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®]) for more than 24 hours before the spirome try assessment. During the Screening Period, s pirometry assessments may be performed pre- or post-bronchodilator. At all other visits, all spi rometry assessments should be performed pre-bronchodilator. During the Treatment Period, spirometry assessments must be performed before study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1) at approximately the same time at each visit. In the event that a subject forgets to withhold bro nchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed according to the following: • I f a subject’s Day 1 spirometry assessment is pre-bronchodilator but, on a subsequent visit, the subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a post-bronchodilator spirometry assessment will be obtained for that visit only, and the visit wil l not be rescheduled. • I f, on Day 1, the subject forgets to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, spirometry should be performed post-bronchodila tor, and all subsequent spirometric measurements (according to the schedule of assessments in Table 3-2) should be performed post-bronchodilator. • Ea ch spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre- or post-bronchodilator. All sites will be provided wit h spirometers to be used for all study assessments. Spirometry data will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality review. The investigator’s assessment of the spirometry results will be used for the screening assessment and determination of eligibility. See Section 10.7.1 for information about access to spirometry results. The measured spirometric values listed be low will be converted to percent predicted values using the standard equations of GLI .11"

Pregnancy (β-human chorionic gonadotropin) Tests for female subjects: All female subjects must have a serum pregnancy test at screening. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at the study site and analyzed at the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will either be performed and analyz ed at the site or, when there is no clinic visit scheduled, at home by using a home kit provided by the site. Results will be reported to the site by telephone. The urine pregnancy test on Day 1 must be negative before the first dose of study drug. Additional pregnancy tests may be required ac cording to local regulations and/or requirements. FSH: Blood samples for FSH will be measured as needed for any suspected postmenopausal female with at least 12 months of continuous spontaneous amenorrhea. Serum FSH levels must be in the postmenopa usal range as determined by the laboratory performing the test. CFTR Genotype (Screening Period Only): CFTR genotyping will be performed for all subjects. If the screening CFTR genotype result is not received before randomization, a previous CFTR genotype laboratory report may be used to establish eligibility. Subjects who have been randomized and whose screening genotype does not confirm study eligibility must be discontinued from the study (Section 9.9). Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate."
36,page_36,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 37 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise, only laboratory tests done in the c entral laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. 11.5.3 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessments will be performed at screening and select study visits (see Table 3-1 a nd Table 3-2 ). At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom-directed vital sign assessments will occur at any time if deemed necessary by the investigator or healthcare provider. A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs. Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate. These will be assessed before dosing and following at least a 5-minute rest. A consistent methodology should be used for repeat measurements of these parameters at a clinical site. 11.5.4 Pulse Oximetry Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be assessed following at least a 5-minute rest and before study drug dosing. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry will be collected before study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1). 11.5.5 Electrocardiogram s Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the schedule of assessments (Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 ). Additional standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. Subjects will be instructed to rest for at least 5 minutes before having an ECG performed. The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through completion of study participation will be recorded as AEs. To ensure the safety of the subjects, a qua lified individual at the study site will make comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60 msec from the baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2 to 4 mi nutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated E CGs remains above the threshold value (>60 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from"

Further de tails pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in the ECG Manual. 11.5.6 Ophthalmologic Examination Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted only for subjects who are <18 years of age on the date of informe d consent. The examination does not need to be completed if there is documentation of bilateral lens removal for the subject. All examinations will be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist and will include: • mea surement of best-corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and • pha rmacologically-dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp The screening examination does not need to be conducted if there is documentation of an examination meeting the protocol requirements that was conducted within 3 months before the date of informed c onsent. In addition to the screening ophthalmologic examination, subjects who are <18 years of age on the date of informed consent and who have completed at least 12 weeks of study drug treatment will have a sing le ophthalmologic examination at either the ETT or Week 24 Visit (whichever comes first), except for those subjects who have withdrawn consent or assent. This examination should be completed within 4 weeks before the Week 24 Visit, unless the subject prematurely discontinues study drug, in which case this examination should occur by the Safety Follow-up Visit (or ETT Visit for subjects who do not complete a Safety Follow-up Visit), as described in Table 3-2. An y c linically significant abnormal findings will be reported as AEs. 11.5.7 Contraception and Pregnancy The effects of VX-445 monotherapy or in combination with TEZ/IVA on conception, pregnancy, a nd lactation in humans are not known. VX-445, TEZ, and IVA did not show genotoxic potential in a standa rd battery of in vitro (Ames test, chromosomal aberration, or micronucleus in cultured mammalian cells) and in vivo (rodent micronucleus) studies. Reproductive toxicology studies of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA have not shown teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. 1 1.5.7.1 Contraception Contraception requirement for a couple is waived for the following: • Tr ue abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. True abstinence must be practic ed from the Screening Visit through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. • I f the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy).

Statistical analysis details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study and treatment unblinding. 12.1 Sample Size and Power Up to approximately 158 subjects will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) to the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group or the TEZ/IVA group. Information regarding the powering of primary a nd key secondary endpoints is provided below. Power for Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in CFQ- R re spiratory domain score from ba seline through Week 24. The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute c hange in CFQ-R respiratory domain score from baseline is the same for the 2 treatment groups, VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA. The null hypothesis will be tested at a 2-sided significance leve l of 0.05. Assuming a within-group SD of 18 and a treatment difference of 10 between VX-445/TEZ/IVA a nd TEZ/IVA, a sample size of 71 subjects completing the Treatment Period in each group for a tot al of 142 subjects will have approximately 90% power for the CFQ-R respiratory domain scor e hypothesis testing, based on a 2-sample t-test at a significance level of 0.05 (2-sided). Assumi ng a 10% dropout rate, up to approximately 158 subjects will be enrolled."
40,page_40,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 41 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Power for Key Secondary Endpoint The key secondary endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24. Assumi ng a within-group SD of 7 percentage points and a treatment difference of 5 between VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA, a sample size of 71 subjects completing the Treatment Period in ea ch group for a total of 142 subjects will have approximately 98% power for the ppFEV1 h ypothesis testing, based on a 2-sample t-test at a significant level of 0.05 (2-sided). Assuming a 10% dropout rate, approximately 158 subjects will be enrolled. All powe r calculations were based on EAST software Version 6.4. 1 2.2 Analysis Sets The following analysis sets are defined: All Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), and Safety Set. Additional analysis sets related to the Run-in Period will be defined in the SAP, as appropriate. The All Subjects Set will include all subjects who were randomized or received at least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set will be used for all individual subject data listings and disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified. The FAS will include all randomized subjects who carry the intended C FTR allele mutation and re ceive at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. The FAS will be used to summarize subj ect demographics and baseline characteristics, and for all efficacy analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group, unless otherwise specified. The Safety Set for the Treatment Period will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of stud y drug in the Treatment Period. This safety set will be used for all safety analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they receive, unless otherwise specified. The Safety Set for the Run-in Period will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of stud y drug in the Run-in Period. 12.3 Statistical Analysis 12.3.1 General Considerations Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the numbe r of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. The baseline value , unless otherwise specified, will be defined as the most recent non-missing mea surement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit). For ECG, baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment measurement (or the average of triplicate measurements, if the most recent pretreatment measurement is obtained in triplicate) before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit). Absolute change from baseline will be calculated as post-baseline value – baseline value. The Treatment-emergent (TE) Period for the Run-in Period will be from the first dose of stud y drug in the Run-in Period to (1) the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period for subjects who complete the Run-in Period and continue to the Treatment Period, or (2) 28 days"

The TE Period for the Treatment Period will include the time from the first dose date of study dr ug in the Treatment Period ( VX-445/TEZ/IVA or placebo + TEZ/IVA) to 28 days after the last dose of the study dru g or to the completion of study participation date (as defined in Section 9.1.7), whichever occurs first. 1 2.3.2 Background Characteristics 12.3.2.1 Subject Disposition The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomized, included in t he FAS, included in the Safety Set, completed Treatment Period, completed study, prematurely discontinued treatment or study with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation, and entered an open-label study) will be summarized overall and by treatment group. An additional subject disposition summary related to the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period will be defined in the SAP, as appropriate. 12.3.2.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographic, medical history, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive summary statistics. The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by treatment group for the FAS, and will include (but are not limited to): sex, race, age, baseline weight, baseline height, baseline body mass index, baseline CFQ-R, baseline ppFEV 1, and baseline SwCl. Medical history will be summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) for the FAS. 12.3.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug-Dictionary and categorized as follows:  P rior medication : any medication that was administered during the 56 days before the first dose of study d rug in the Treatment Period but not in the Run-in Period. For subjects who discontinue during the Run -in Period and whose first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period is not available, prior medication will be any medication that was administered during the 56 days before the last dose of study drug in the Run-in Period but before the first dose in the Run-in Period  Conco mitant medication during the Run-in Period : medication continued or newly received during the TE Period for the Run-in Period  Conco mitant medication during the Treatment Period : medication continued or newly received during the TE Period for the Treatment Period  P ost-treatment medication : medication continued or newly received after:"

If a medication has a missing or partially missing start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before the first dose of study drug, concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Period, it will be considered in all 3 categories of prior, concomitant, and post-treatment medication. Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively by Preferred Name based on the FAS. Post-treatment medications will be provided separately in an individual subj ect data listing. 12.3.2.4 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance Study drug exposure and compliance will be summarized for the Treatment Period only. Study drug exposure will be summarized overall and by treatment group, based on the Safety Set in terms of the duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as the last day – the fir st day of study drug plus 1, regardless of study drug interruption. Study drug compliance will be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the FAS, and will be calculated as: 100 × [1 - (total number of days of study drug interruption) / (duration of study drug exposure in days)]. A study drug interruption on a given day is defined as an interruption of any study drug on that day. 12.3.2.5 Important Protocol Deviations An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject’s rig hts, safety, or well-being. The rules for identifying an IPD will be described in the SAP. All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing and summarized, as appropriate. 12.3.3 Efficacy and Pharmacodynamic Analyses The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the efficacy of VX-445/TEZ/IVA. The analysis in this section will be based on the FAS, unless otherwise specified. 12.3.3.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the ab solute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score from baseline through Week 24 . The analysis of this endpoint will be performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R respiratory domain score at each post-baseline visit as the dependent variable. The model will include treatment group, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and will be adjusted for selected covariates as appropriate. Details will be described in the SAP. The model will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F test for fixed effects will be estimated using the Kenward-Roger approximation. An unst ructured covariance structure will be used to model the with in-subject errors. If the model"
43,page_43,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 44 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated estimation does not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used instead. Conditional on the observed data and covariates, missing data will be assumed to be missing at random; consequently, no imputation of missing data will be performed. The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference through Week 24 (defined as the average of Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24). The least squares ( LS) mean estimate with a 2-sided 95% CI and a 2-sided P value will be provided. The treatment difference at each post-baseline visit, obtained from the model, will also be provided. Additi onal or subgroup analyses if appropriate will be described in the SAP. 12.3.3.2 Analysis of Key Secondary Endpoint  Abso lute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24 The analysis of this endpoint will be based on an MMRM model similar to the CFQ-R endpoint above, with absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at each post-baseline visit as the dependent variable. The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference through Week 24 (defined as the average of Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24). Data obtained from the Day 15, Week 4, W eek 8, Week 16, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model. The Day 15 Visit will not be included in the estimation of the average treatment effect through Week 24. The LS mean estimate with a 2-sided 95% CI and a 2-sided P value will be provided. The treatment difference a t each post-baseline visit, obtained from the model, will also be provided. 1 2.3.3.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoint  Abso lute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 24 The analysis of this endpoint will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary endpoints above, with absolute change from baseline in SwCl at each post-baseline visit as the dependent variable. Data obtained from Week 4, Week 8, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model and all of these visits will be included in the estimation of the average treatment effect through Week 24. The treatment difference at each post-baseline visit, obtained from the model will also be provided. 12.3.3.4 Multiplicity Adjustment A hierarchical fixed-sequence testing procedure will be used to control the overall family-wise type I error at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 for the testing of the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. The testing order is as follows: 1. P rimary endpoint: Absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score from baseline through Week 24 2. Ke y secondary endpoint: Absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24 F or a test at any step to be considered statistically significant within the testing hierarchy, it must be statistically significant, and all previous tests (if any) within the hierarchy must be statistically significant. In other words, the key secondary endpoint (ppFEV 1) will only be tested if the primary endpoint is statistically significant."

This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) a fter the ICF is signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1. 1 3.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study asses sment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). An abnorma l study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of the following: • C oncomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment • F urther diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention • A c hange in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator. A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subjec t’s clinical status indicates a life-threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.7 All su bjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and sourc e document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE: • Description of the event"

The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer. gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm (Accessed F ebruary 2019). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” When c onsidering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death AE: adverse event 13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Causality Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table 13-2. Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a pla usible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug. Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of the investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics o f the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease. Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug."

Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow up) AE: adverse event 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE."
50,page_50,"Protocol VX18- 445-109, Version 1.0 P age 51 of 60 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: • F atal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug) • L ife-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred • I npatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization • P ersistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) • Congenital anomaly or birth defect • I mportant medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed a bove (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or a t home) If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that oc curred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 1 3.1.2.2 Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the completion of study participation, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS within 24 hours of identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the completion of study participation and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours of identification . For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the completion of study participation, the SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities."
