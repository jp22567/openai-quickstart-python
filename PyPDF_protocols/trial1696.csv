For Mexico only: The above will include the following responsibilities for the head of the Institution/Health Care Establishment, Ethics, Research and, when applicable, Biosafety Committees and sponsor within their scope of responsibility: a) Investigation follow-up b) Damages to health arising from the investigation development; as well as those arising from interruption or advanced suspension of treatment due to non-attributable reasons to the Subject; c) Timely compliance of the terms in which the authorization of a research for health in human beings had been issued; d)To present in a timely manner the information required by the Health Authority In this document, the term investigator refers to the individual responsible for the overall conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. Background information 3.1 3.1.1 Type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism. The pathogenesis is not fully understood but seems to be heterogeneous, involving environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by peripheral tissue insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion due to abnormal beta-cell function and abnormal glucose metabolism in the liver4. Optimal glycaemic control is the treatment goal in subjects with T2D in order to prevent long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia 5. Despite the availability of several antidiabetic drugs, a significant proportion of subjects with T2D do not achieve the recommended blood glucose (BG) target levels 6, 7. 3.1.2 Glucagon-like peptide-1 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone with a glucose-dependent stimulatory effect on insulin and inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets8, 9. Subjects with T2D have a decreased incretin effect10-13. However, the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 and thus, the ability to lower blood glucose (BG) levels, is preserved when GLP-1 is administered at supraphysiological levels14.In addition, supraphysiological levels of GLP-1 induce reduction in body weight15. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation16, 17. Physiologically, GLP-1 also has a pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric emptying; however this effect seems to diminish CONFIDENTIAL"

These mechanisms of action make glucagon- like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) an attractive pharmacological treatment for T2D18-20. 3.1.3 Semaglutide Semaglutide is a potent human GLP-1 analogue with a pharmacokinetic (PK) profile suitable for once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. It is structurally similar to liraglutide (Victoza®), a once-daily GLP-1RA developed by Novo Nordisk and approved worldwide for the treatment of T2D. The extended half-life of the semaglutide molecule is primarily obtained due to binding to albumin, which is facilitated by a large fatty acid derived chemical moiety attached to the lysine in position 26. The specific modifications in the molecule are: 1) a modification in position 8 (alanine to 2-aminoisobutyric acid) of the peptide backbone to increase stability against DPP-4, and a change in position 34 from a lysine to an arginine to limit the options for acylation to the one remaining lysine in the sequence; 2) a large hydrophilic spacer between the lysine in position 26 and the gamma glutamate whereto the fatty acid is attached; 3) a C18 fatty di-acid with a terminal acidic group21, 22. The spacer and the fatty acid both contribute to increased albumin binding, which results in a prolonged half-life of approximately 1 week, making semaglutide suitable for once weekly (OW) s.c. administration. 3.1.4 Non-clinical data 3.1.4.1 Semaglutide The nonclinical programme for semaglutide was designed according to the ICH M3 23guideline to support the clinical development. The standard nonclinical data package required to support phase 3 clinical trials has been completed. In addition, 2-year carcinogenicity studies and a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study have been completed. Semaglutide is generally well tolerated with expected GLP-1 effects on food intake and body weight being dose limiting in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Two potential safety issues have been identified and are detailed below. Thyroid C-cell tumours in rodents Thyroid C-cell neoplasia was seen in mice and rat 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Proliferative C- cell changes in rodents are a known effect following GLP-1 receptor activation by GLP-1 receptor agonists. The finding in rodents is caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. Recently published data have shown that the GLP-1 receptor is not expressed in the normal human thyroid, and accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor mediated C-cell changes in humans is considered to be low24. Embryo−foetal development toxicity Semaglutide adversely affected embryo −foetal development in the rat by a GLP-1 receptor- mediated impaired function of the inverted yolk sac placenta during a period of gestation when the CONFIDENTIAL"

In primates, the yolk sac does not invert to fully enclose the embryo, and it does not come in direct contact with the uterine wall to form a placenta as in rodents. Accordingly, the mechanism by which semaglutide adversely affects embryo-foetal development in the rat, is not likely to be of relevance to humans. Studies in cynomolgus monkeys confirmed that maternal dosing of semaglutide does not affect embryo −foetal development in this species. However, the initial maternal body weight loss caused by the pharmacological effect of semaglutide coincided with increased early pregnancy loss in one of three studies. In cynomolgus monkeys, the overall developmental no observable adverse event effect level (NOAEL) was determined to be 0.015 mg/kg/3 days, which provides an exposure equivalent to the human exposure at 1.0 mg/week based on area under the curve (AUC). A comprehensive review of results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the current edition of semaglutide (NN9535) Investigator’s Brochure (IB),25or any updates hereof. 3.1.5 Clinical data – semaglutide As of 1 August 2016, 16 clinical pharmacology trials (trials 1820, 3679, 3633, 3616, 3819, 4010, 3789, 3652, 3685, 3634, 3687, 3817, 3818, 3684, 3651 and 3635) and 1 phase 2 trial (trial 1821) and 8 phase 3a trials (NN9535-3623, 3624, 3625,3626, 3627, 3744, 4091, 4092) have been completed with semaglutide s.c.OW. Clinical pharmacology trials were conducted in healthy subjects, in subjects with T2D, in subjects with obesity and in subjects with renal- and hepatic impairment. Semaglutide phase 3a programme evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in a broad T2D population and covered the continuum of T2D care. The programme evaluated mono- and combination therapy with antiglycaemic therapies and compared semaglutide with the most important comparators at the time of initiating the phase 3a programme. In addition, the phase 3a programme included a long-term (104-week) cardiovascular outcomes trial (trial 3744) in a T2D population at high risk of cardiovascular events. 3.1.5.1 Pharmacokinetics The results from the completed clinical pharmacology trials confirm that semaglutide has PK properties compatible with once-weekly administration, having a flat concentration profile over time, with a median time to maximum concentration (t max) of 36−60 hours post-dosing and an elimination half-life (t ½) of approximately 1 week (149 −165 hours). The absolute bioavailability of semaglutide s.c. was estimated to be 89%. The PK properties of semaglutide appear comparable between healthy subjects, subjects with T2D and subjects with renal failure. Results from drug-interaction studies with warfarin, metformin, atorvastatin and digoxin indicate that no dose adjustment of the co-administered drugs is warranted when administered together with semaglutide. In addition, semaglutide does not decrease the exposure of oral contraceptives and hence, is not anticipated to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.CONFIDENTIAL"

The body weight loss observed with semaglutide was primarily from fat tissue and was considered to be explained by lowered appetite, both in the fasting and postprandial state, and lowered energy intake. In addition, semaglutide improved control of eating and reduced food cravings. Similar to other GLP-1 receptor agonists, semaglutide caused a minor delay of early postprandial gastric emptying. Both as monotherapy and as combination therapy, semaglutide significantly reduced HbA 1cand body weight in all phase 3a trials when compared with the trial-specific comparator, including the active comparators sitagliptin, exanatide extended release (exenatide ER) and insulin glargine. In the 5 global phase 3a trials (3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627), reductions in HbA 1cand body weight of up to 1.85 %-point and 6.42 kg, respectively, were obtained with semaglutide 1.0 mg. Significantly more subjects with semaglutide versus comparators reached the ADA and AACE- defined treatment targets of an HbA 1c<7% and ≤6.5%, respectively, and weight loss responses of ≥5% and ≥10%. The superior and clinically relevant beneficial effects of semaglutide on glycaemic control as estimated by change in HbA 1cwere substantiated by improvements in secondary glycaemia-related supportive endpoints.26-29 3.1.5.3 Safety Data from the 5 global phase 3a clinical trials (NN9535-3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627) showed that the safety and tolerability of semaglutide at doses up to 1.0 mg per week and administered for up to 56 weeks of treatment were consistent with other GLP-1RAs. Commonly reported adverse events (AEs) included nausea and vomiting, most of which were mild to moderate in severity. The escalation regimen utilized was associated with good tolerability and low numbers of discontinuation due to AEs. Accordingly, the most frequently reported AEs in subjects with T2D were gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea and vomiting), as were the most frequent AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation. Hypoglycaemia occurred infrequently in subjects receiving semaglutide and the events were mainly non-severe. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when semaglutide is combined with SU or insulin. In line with findings for other GLP-1RAs, an increase in heart rate and serum levels of lipase and amylase has also been observed in subjects exposed to semaglutide. As with all protein based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide may develop immunogenic and allergic reactions. However, only few subjects administered semaglutide experienced allergic reactions and injection site reactions. These have mainly been mild and transient of nature; however, more generalised reactions may occur. CONFIDENTIAL"

SUSTAIN 6 trial achieved its primary objective by showing non-inferiority of once-weekly s.c. semaglutide versus placebo on cardiovascular outcomes; moreover, s.c. semaglutide statistically significantly reduced cardiovascular risk versus placebo 30. In addition, results from the recently completed LEADER® trial (EX2211-3748) showed that treatment with the once daily liraglutide does not increase the risk of MACE as compared to placebo. In fact, treatment with liraglutide reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome consisting of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke by 13% versus placebo 31. A post-marketing cardiovascular outcomes trial on canagliflozin (CANVAS) is ongoing and results are expected in Q1 2017, see https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NC01032629. The overall safety profile of semaglutide in the SUSTAIN 6 trial (NN9535-3744) was consistent with previous semaglutide clinical studies. However, in this trial, the diabetic retinopathy complications were reported more frequently in the semaglutide-treated subjects compared with placebo. Please see Section 18for more details. Please see the current edition of semaglutide s.c. (NN9535) IB or any updates hereof for further details25. For an assessment of benefits and risks of the trial, see Section 18.1. 3.1.6 Canagliflozin The selected active comparator in this trial is canagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of the sodium- glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2), which is the predominant transporter responsible for glucose reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. Inhibition of SGLT-2 reduces BG levels by blocking renal glucose reabsorption, thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is dependent on the BG concentration and renal function. Canagliflozin was developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals and approved in 2013 in the US to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D. For further details, please see the current approved label for canagliflozin32. For an assessment of benefits and risks of the trial, see section 18.1. Rationale for the trial 3.2 The currently available treatment modalities for T2D are still not satisfactory and there is a significant proportion of patients not reaching the treatment targets 6.

Furthermore, the trial is designed to address and compare safety, tolerability, patient well-being and treatment satisfaction. Body composition will be measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in a subset of 174 subjects (87 subjects per treatment arm) at V1 and V10 or V10A. Semaglutide is administered as s.c. injections and canagliflozin as oral tablets. In order to fulfil blinding of the trial, a double-dummy design has been implemented. Accordingly, all subjects randomised to semaglutide s.c. will also receive canagliflozin placebo tablets, while subjects randomised to canagliflozin will also receive semaglutide placebo s.c. injections. The treatment duration is 52 weeks, considered adequate for assessment of effect, safety, tolerability and patient satisfaction. The follow-up period is 5 weeks to allow for wash-out of semaglutide. Treatment of subjects 5.3 Semaglutide treatment arm Treatment with semaglutide, once-weekly must follow a fixed dose escalation. The maintenance dose of semaglutide 1.0 mg is reached after 4 doses (4 weeks) of 0.25 mg, followed by 4 doses (4 weeks) of 0.5 mg. During the final maintenance period (V4-V10, see Table 5–1), doses must not be changed. . In addition, all subjects randomised to semaglutide will receive canagliflozin placebo once-daily. Canagliflozin treatment arm Treatment with canagliflozin, once-daily must follow a fixed dose escalation. The maintenance dose of canagaliflozin 300 mg is reached after 56 doses (8 weeks) of 100 mg. After the maintenance dose of 300 mg is reached the dose must not be changed during the course of the trial unless the eGFR falls <45mL/min/1.73 m2, see below. In addition, all subjects randomised to canagliflozin will receive semaglutide placebo once-weekly. Treatment with canagliflozin must be in compliance with current local prescribing information. Canagliflozin should be taken orally once a day, preferably before the first meal of the day. Tablets should be swallowed whole. Treatment with canagliflozin or canagliflozin placebo should be temporarily stopped in subjects who are hospitalized for major surgical procedures or acute serious medical illnesses. In subjects whose eGFR falls persistently <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the dose of canagliflozin or canagliflozin placebo should be reduced to 100 mg once-daily. The dose can be re- escalated to 300 mg once-daily in case the renal function improves (eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2) CONFIDENTIAL"

If the eGFR falls <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, treatment with all trial products should be discontinued (see section 6.6)1. 5.3.1 Background medication The only allowed diabetes background medication is metformin. After signing the informed consent, subjects must continue pre-trial dose ( ≥1500 mg or maximum tolerated dose as documented in the subject medical record and in accordance with current local label) of metformin throughout the entire treatment period, at the same dose level as given at trial entrance and with the same frequency, unless rescue criteria (see section 6.5) are met. Metformin Metformin is considered non-investigational medicinal product (NIMP) and will not be provided by Novo Nordisk, except if required by local regulations. Metformin should be used in accordance with standard of care in the individual country at the discretion of the investigator and in compliance to the current local label. Injection site 5.4 Semaglutide (and semaglutide placebo) is administered subcutaneously by injections in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm, at any time of the day irrespective of meals. Injections should be administered on the same day of the week during the trial. Injections should not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Missed dose 5.5 If a semaglutide dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as noticed, provided the time to the next scheduled dose is at least 2 days (48 hours) away. If a dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days (48 hours) away, the subject should not administer a dose until the next scheduled dose. A missed dose should not affect the scheduled dosing time of the week. If a canagliflozin dose is missed it should be taken as soon as the subject remembers; however, a double dose should not be taken on the same day. Treatment after discontinuation of trial product 5.6 When discontinuing trial products, either at the scheduled end of treatment visit or if trial product is discontinued prematurely, the subject should be switched to a suitable marketed product at the discretion of the investigator, while taking into consideration the long half-life of semaglutide. For Brazil only: At the end of the trial, all participant subjects should be assured the access to the best proved prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified during the trial.

The dose of 1.0 mg once-weekly has been chosen based on careful evaluation to strike a satisfactory balance of efficacy and safety that would satisfy the majority of subjects. Hence, the duration and the dose of the randomised treatments are considered adequate for obtaining meaningful information on effect and safety in accordance with the trial objectives. Subjects will be enrolled for a treatment period of 52 weeks in order to enable evaluation of the full effect and durability of the primary and secondary endpoints as well as reasonable safety assessment. For semaglutide, the three dose levels (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg), have been chosen based on data from the phase 2 dose-finding trial. This regimen has shown the optimal benefit-risk profile for further development for treatment of T2D in the SUSTAIN programme25. Canagliflozin has been chosen as active comparator since it is an established OAD within the drug class of SGLT-2 inhibitors and treatment will be initiated with 100 mg in accordance with the current approved EU-PI 32. Both s.c. semaglutide and oral canagliflozin will be dose escalated to their highest respective maintenance doses to investigate and compare the maximum efficacy of the two medications when added to metformin. The duration of randomised treatments is considered adequate to collect sufficient data on effect and safety in accordance with the trial objectives.CONFIDENTIAL"

Rescue criteria 6.5 Subjects with persistent and unacceptable hyperglycaemia should be offered treatment intensification and the conclusion of the consideration to be documented in the medical records. If any of the FPG values (see section 8.5.1 ) (including protocol scheduled fasting SMPG, see section 8.6.1 ) exceed the limits outlined below and no intercurrent cause of the hyperglycaemia can be identified, a confirmatory FPG (at central laboratory) should be obtained by calling the subject for a re-test. !13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) from week 8 to end of week 13 !11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) from week 14 to end of treatment In addition, subject should be offered rescue medication if: !HbA 1c(at central laboratory) >8.5 % (69.4 mmol/mol) from week 26 to end of treatment. If the confirmatory FPG also exceeds the value described above, the subject should be offered rescue medication (i.e. intensification of anti-diabetic background medication and/or initiation of new anti-diabetic medication). It is important for trial integrity that only subjects actually needing treatment intensification (as defined above) are started on rescue medication. Subjects that are started on rescue medication should continue to follow the protocol-specified visit schedule. Rescue medication should be prescribed at the investigator’s discretion as add-on to randomised treatment and according to American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines33, 34(excluding GLP-1RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors, amylin analogues and SGLT-2).

Criteria for premature discontinuation of trial product 6.6 All efforts should be made to keep the subject on trial product. However, the subject might be prematurely discontinued from trial product at the discretion of the investigator due to a safety concern. If so, all efforts must be made to ensure the subjects attend and complete all scheduled visit procedures. Subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule or missing assessments. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial will be considered as withdrawn from the trial (see Section 6.7). The subject must be prematurely discontinued from trial product, if the following applies: 1. Included in the trial in violation of the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria 2. Safety concern related to trial product or unacceptable intolerability at the discretion of the investigator 3. Pregnancy* 4. Intention of becoming pregnant* 5. Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial of an approved or non-approved investigational medicinal product. 6. If the eGFR falls persistently <45 mL/min/1.73m2, treatment with any trial product should be discontinued (see section 5.3) 7. Calcitonin ≥100 ng/L(see appendix A ) *No DXA scans can be performed on these subjects. See Section 8.1.8 for procedures to be performed for subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely.

Subject replacement 6.8 Subjects who discontinue trial product prematurely will not be replaced. Rationale for trial population 6.9 The trial population will include subjects with T2D treated with stable doses of metformin for at least 90 days prior to screening as changes in the background medication shortly before trial participation may potentially impact data interpretation. The HbA 1climits of 7.0-10.5% (53-91 mmol/mol) have been chosen to include subjects needing intensification of their anti-diabetic medication. FPG and HbA 1cwill be monitored throughout the trial and rescue medication should be initiated in subjects with persistent, unacceptable hyperglycaemia. No BMI or blood pressure restrictions are applied. Subjects with liver test abnormalities (ALT >2.5 x UNL) are excluded to avoid potential confounding of liver safety assessments. In addition, subjects with mild, moderate, severe or end-stage renal impairment are excluded due to restrictions in the labels of canagliflozin and metformin. As SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, subjects with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis are also excluded from this trial. Overall, the eligibility criteria will allow for enrolment of a relatively broad trial population resembling the target population in common practice while taking relevant safety precautions.CONFIDENTIAL"

These are also included in the flow chart (see Section 2) as well as visit numbers, timing of site and phone visits and windows during the trial period. Informed consent must be obtained before any trial related activity, see Section 18.3. For each Dispensing visit; interact with IWRS to obtain allocation of trial products, confirm dispensing of allocated trial products and, except for the randomisation visit, confirm trial products returned unused or lost. A treatment completion session must be performed in the IWRS after completion of V10.8.1.1 Investigator site log The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. Only subjects who have signed the informed consent form should be included on the logs. The subject screening log and subject enrolment log may be combined in one log. In addition, the investigator must keep a log of staff and a delegation of task(s) list at the trial site. Investigator must sign the log of staff and the delegation of task(s) at the trial site prior to the delegation of tasks. 8.1.2 Screening, Visit 1 At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address(es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to return the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. Each subject will be assigned a unique 6-digit subject number which will remain the same throughout the trial. 8.1.3 Screening failures For screening failures the screening failure form in the eCRF must be completed with the reason for not continuing in the trial. Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed by the investigator into the eCRF. Follow-up on serious adverse events must be carried out according to Section 12.

Fasting is defined as having consumed only water within the last 6 hours prior to the visit. If the subject does not attend the visit in a fasting state, the subject should be asked to attend a re- scheduled visit within the visit window to have the fasting assessments performed. Glucose lowering agents and trial product should not be taken until after blood sampling has been performed but other prescribed medication should be taken according to prescription. 8.1.6 Unscheduled visits Unscheduled visits can be performed at the investigators discretion if an AE requires additional follow-up or if required by the Novo Nordisk department responsible for safety. Unscheduled visits can take place at any time during the trial from screening until the last visit in the trial. Further, unscheduled visits for re-sampling can take place if laboratory samples are lost or damaged before arriving at the analysing laboratory. This re-sampling will be at the discretion of the Novo Nordisk medically responsible person in collaboration with the investigator. All assessments performed at any time during the trial can be performed during unscheduled visits with the exception of DXA body composition scan (only permitted if required due to DXA technical reasons), waist circumference and ePROs. Visits/contacts to the site not related to the trial do not need to be reported as an unscheduled visit. Contacts for re-dispensing of trial drug as replacement for lost or damaged trial drug do not need to be recorded as unscheduled visits but need to be recorded in the IV/WRS. 8.1.7 Phone contacts The phone contacts should be conducted as outlined in the flow chart (see Section 2). At V2, and V3 the investigator should instruct the subject how to dose escalate semaglutide/semaglutide placebo up to 1.0 mg once-weekly and also how to dose escalate canagliflozin up to 300 mg daily. At the planned phone contact (P5), the investigator should follow- up on any symptoms associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), any AEs as well as compliance and potential technical issues in regards to the dose escalation.CONFIDENTIAL"

P11A should be scheduled at least 5 weeks after the last date on trial product. If premature discontinuation of trial product is decided during a scheduled visit, the visit will be converted into a V10A and trial procedures must be performed accordingly. Subjects should continue with the originally scheduled site contacts after P11A and up to and including P11. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after P11A. However, all attempts should be made to ensure that V10 is performed as a site visit and includes all planned assessments. In summary, subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule, missing assessments or trial product discontinuation for any reason. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial should be considered as withdrawn from the trial (for withdrawal procedures see Section 8.1.9 ). The primary reason for premature discontinuation of trial product must be specified in the end-of- treatment form in the eCRF, and final drug accountability must be made. A treatment discontinuation session must be performed in the IWRS at V10A (see Section 10). 8.1.9 Withdrawal from trial If a subject withdraws consent, the investigator must aim to undertake procedures similar to those for V10A (End of treatment) as soon as possible. If a subject has already prematurely discontinued from trial product and previously attended visit V10A and visit P11A, no further visits should be attended. For withdrawn subjects the end-of-trial form and end-of-treatment form must be completed, including the primary reason for premature discontinuation of trial product, and final drug accountability must be performed even if the subject is not able to come to the trial site. A treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS, however if a subject has already prematurely discontinued from trial product and a treatment discontinuation session in IWRS has been done, no IWRS session should be completed. The case book must be signed. Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing consent, the investigator must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject’s rights.

For laboratory report values outside the reference range, the investigator must specify whether the value is clinically significant or clinically non-significant. All laboratory printouts must be signed and dated by the investigator on the day of evaluation. The signed laboratory report is retained at the site as source documentation. In case of abnormal clinical significant findings found as a result of screening procedures conducted at visit 1 or assessments revealing baseline conditions at visit 2, the investigator must state a comment in the subject’s medical record and record this in the concomitant illness form in the eCRF. At subsequent visits, any clinically significant changes or new clinically significant findings must be reported as an AE according to section 12. Investigator or trial site staff must review the diary to ensure that AEs, including overall changes in health and concomitant medication, are reported.

The investigator must ask the subject in the following way: “To what extent can you tell by your symptoms that your blood glucose is low?” The subject can answer never, rarely, sometimes, often or always. Subjects answering ‘never, rarely or sometimes’ are considered as having impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia. 8.2.4 Concomitant illness and medical history A concomitant illness is any illness that is present at the start of the trial as described in section 8.1.10 . Medical history is a medical event that the subject has experienced in the past. Only relevant medical history as judged by the investigator should be reported. The information collected for concomitant illness and medical history should include diagnosis, date of onset and date of resolution or continuation, as applicable. Any change to a concomitant illness should be recorded during the trial. A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness must be reported as an AE. It must be possible to verify the subject’s medical history in source documents such as subject’s medical record. If a subject is not from the investigator’s own practice; the investigator must make reasonable effort to obtain a copy of subject’s medical record from relevant party e.g. primary physician. The investigator must document any attempt to obtain external medical information by noting the date(s) when information was requested and who has been contacted. 8.2.5 Concomitant medication A concomitant medication is any medication, other than the trial product(s) which is taken during the trial, including the screening and follow-up periods.CONFIDENTIAL"

It should be recorded to the nearest ½ cm or ¼ inch using the same measuring tape throughout the trial. The waist circumference should be measured in a standing position with an empty bladder and wearing light clothing with accessible waist. The subject should be standing with arms down their side and feet together. The tape should touch the skin but not compress soft tissue. The subject should be asked to breathe normally and the measurement should be taken when the subject is breathing out gently. 8.3.3 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure Systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be measured in a sitting position after the subject has been resting for at least 5 minutes and by using standard clinical practice at the trial site. 8.3.4 Self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) At the screening visit, subjects will be provided with a blood glucose meter including lancets, plasma-calibrated test strips and control solutions as well as instructions for use. The blood glucose meters use test strips calibrated to plasma values. Therefore, all measurements performed with capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values, which will be shown on the display. Only the blood glucose meter provided by Novo Nordisk should be used for the measurements required in the protocol. Subjects should be instructed in how to record the results of the SMPG values in the diaries. The record of each SMPG value should include date, time and value. All data from the diary must be transcribed into the eCRF during or following the contact. If obtained via phone and a discrepancy is later detected, the values in the eCRF must be corrected. Occasional review by the investigator of the values stored in the memory of the blood glucose meter and correct reporting of these in the diary is advised in order to ensure adequacy of the data reported in the trial database. 8.3.5 7-point profile The subject will be asked to perform a 7-point SMPG profile, preferably within one week prior to site visit according to the flow chart, on days where the subject does not anticipate unusual strenuous exercise.

These scans will be performed in a sub-set of 174 randomised subjects (approximately 87 subjects per treatment arm). The overall process of image acquisition, transfer, central analysis, reporting of results and arching is described in an Imaging Charter prepared by the laboratory. The baseline DXA scan will be performed at screening (V1+5 days), this to allow the imaging laboratory to confirm the quality of the scan, prior randomisation. It is recommended the site confirms patient eligibility prior performing the DXA scans. At the end of treatment visit (V10 or V10A), the scans must be performed ± 5 calendar days. The quality of the baseline DXA scan obtained at V1 must be confirmed by the imaging laboratory before the subject can be randomised. The quality of the DXA scans will be evaluated by the imaging laboratory designated by Novo Nordisk for reading in a blinded manner. If a subject withdraws prematurely from the trial, an end of trial DXA scan should preferably be performed. Process for image acquisition is outlined in an Image acquisition guideline (IAG). Besides the two scans per subject described in this protocol a limited number of repeat scans might be acquired if required due to technical reasons. Repeated scans should not be performed if the subject has prematurely discontinued trial medication due to pregnancy or intention of becoming pregnant. A cross calibration using cross calibration phantom will be performed at least once at each site prior to the database lock (DBL) of the trial. Each trial site participating in the sub-study will receive an imaging manual prepared and distributed by the imaging laboratory which will include machine specific instructions for acquiring DXA scans. The manual will serve as reference tool for use during the trial and when training technologists. DXA technologist training will occur at the start of the trial and at any time deemed necessary to assure proper scan acquisition. Following DXA scan acquisition each trial site will be responsible for transferring each DXA scan to the imaging laboratory for quality review and analysis. DXA analysis data will include: !Total fat mass (kg) !Total fat mass (%) !Total lean mass (kg)CONFIDENTIAL"

The result should be available prior to randomisation. An ECG performed for any reason unrelated to this trial within 7 days prior to the screening visit is acceptable provided no clinical symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease have occurred in the meantime. If the ECG was performed as part of a routine clinical practice on/before the date when the subject has signed the informed consent, it must be documented in the medical records that the reason for performing the procedure is not related to this trial.CONFIDENTIAL"

It is allowed to perform the baseline fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy between the screening visit and the randomisation visit. Results of the baseline fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy must be available and evaluated by the investigator before randomisation. If the subject had a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed within 90 days prior to randomisation, the investigator may base their evaluation upon the results of that examination. However, the examination must be repeated before randomisation if the subject experienced worsening of visual function since the last examination. If the subject did not have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed within 90 days prior to randomisation, such examination must be performed by the investigator or other qualified health care professional prior to randomisation. If the applicable fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy was performed before the subject signed the informed consent form, it must be documented in the medical records that the reason for performing the examination was not related to this trial. In addition, dilated fundoscopy/fundus photography must be performed at V10. In the case of premature discontinuation, the assessments must be performed both at V10A and at V10. The assessments at V10A and V10 can be performed in the period between V10A and P11A, and between V10 and P11, respectively but the results should be available no later than at P11A and P11, respectively. The investigator should indicate whether the outcome of the eye examination was normal or abnormal, and, if abnormal, indicate whether clinically significant.

A randomisation session will be performed for all eligible subjects by using IWRS. At the randomisation visit (V2), eligible subjects will be randomised to one of the two parallel treatment groups in a 1:1 manner: !semaglutide 1.0 mg once-weekly + canagliflozin placebo !canagliflozin 300 mg once-daily + semaglutide placebo The randomisation will be stratified according to the participation in the DXA scan sub-study (yes or no) in order to ensure balanced treatment allocation within the sub-study. When a subject is randomised he/she must be assigned the lowest available randomisation number. Breaking of blinded codes 11.1 The IWRS will notify Novo Nordisk (monitor and the Global Safety department) immediately after the code is broken. However, if the code is broken by Global Safety, the monitor will not be notified. The code for a particular subject may be broken in a medical emergency if knowing the actual treatment would influence the treatment of the subject. Whenever a code is broken the person breaking the code must print the Code Break Confirmation Notification generated by the IWRS, and sign and date the document. The reason for code break should be documented in the medical record. When the code is broken, the treatment allocation will be accessible to the investigator and the Novo Nordisk Global Safety department. If IWRS is not accessible at the time of code break the IWRS helpdesk should be contacted. Contact details are listed in attachment 1 . If the code has been broken by the investigator, the subject must discontinue treatment with trial product and a treatment discontinuation session must be completed in IWRS.CONFIDENTIAL"

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. An AE includes: !A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. !A clinical laboratory adverse event (CLAE): a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. The following should not be reported as AEs: !Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product (pre-existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). !Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. !Non-serious hypoglycaemia is an AE, but is reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form instead of on an AE form, see Section 8.4.6 The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: !Severity –Mild – no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Moderate – marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Severe – considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities; unacceptable. !Causality Relationship between an AE and the relevant trial products ): –Probable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. –Possible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. –Unlikely - The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product.CONFIDENTIAL"

This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. oRecovered/resolved with sequelae - The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. oNot recovered/not resolved - The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. oFatal - This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. oUnknown - This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. 12.1.2 Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: !Death. !A life-threatening aexperience. !In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. !A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. !A congenital anomaly or birth defect. !Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be considered an SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. aThe term “life threatening” in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. bThe term “hospitalisation” is used when a subject:oIs admitted to a hospital or in-patient, irrespective of the duration of physical stay, or oStays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hours Medical judgement must always be exercised, and when in doubt, the hospital contact should be regarded as a hospitalisation.

The following adverse events must always be reported as an SAE using the important medical event criterion if no other seriousness criteria are applicable: !suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the trial product !risk of liver injury defined as ALT or AST >3 x UNL and total bilirubin >2 x UNL, where no alternative aetiology exists (Hy's law). Additional assessments should be made for events meeting the criterion of Hy’s law as stated above (see appendix B ). 12.1.3 Non-serious adverse event A non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE. 12.1.4 Medication errors A medication error concerning trial products is defined as: !Administration of wrong drug . Note: Use of wrong DUN is not considered a medication error. !Wrong route of administration, such as intramuscular instead of subcutaneous. !Administration of an overdose with the intention to cause harm (e.g. suicide attempt), misuse or abuse of trial product. !Accidental administration of a lower or higher dose than intended. The administered dose must deviate from the intended dose to an extent where clinical consequences for the trial subject were likely to happen as judged by the investigator, although they did not necessarily occur. Medication errors must be reported on an AE form and a specific event form, see Section 8.4.5.1 . 12.1.5 Adverse events requiring additional data collection AEs requiring additional data collection are AEs where the additional data will benefit the evaluation of the safety of the trial product.CONFIDENTIAL"

Reporting of adverse events 12.2 All events meeting the definition of an AE must be collected and reported. This includes events from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent (V1) until the end of the post-treatment follow-up period (P11). The events must be recorded in the applicable eCRF forms in a timely manner, see timelines below and Figure 12–1 . During each contact with the trial site staff, the subject must be asked about AEs and technical complaints, for example by asking: “Have you experienced any problems since the last contact?” All AEs, observed by the investigator or subject, must be reported by the investigator and evaluated. All AEs must be recorded by the investigator on an AE form. The investigator should report the diagnosis, if available. If no diagnosis is available, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs using separate AE forms. For SAEs, a SIF must be completed in addition to the AE form. If several symptoms or diagnoses occur as part of the same clinical picture, one SIF can be used to describe all the SAEs. For all non-serious AEs, the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved or at the end of the trial at the latest. Some events will undergo event adjudication by the Event Adjudication Committee (EAC), please refer to Section 12.7.2 . For AEs qualifying for event adjudication, the Adjudication Form will also have to be completed in the eCRF. The Adjudication Form is a checklist of clinical data to be provided from the site. Timelines for initial reporting of AEs: The investigator must complete the following forms in the eCRF within the specified timelines: !SAEs:The AE form within 24 hours and the SIF within 5 calendar days of the investigator’s  first knowledge of the SAE. !For SAEs requiring reporting on a specific event form: In addition to the above the specific  event form within 14 calendar days from the investigator’s first knowledge of the AE. !Events for adjudication: The adjudication form should be completed within 14 calendar days  of investigator’s first knowledge of the AE, see Section 12.7.2 .

Reporting of trial product-related SUSARs by Novo Nordisk: Novo Nordisk will notify the investigator of trial product-related suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) in accordance with local requirements and ICH GCP2. In addition, the investigator will be informed of any trial-related SAEs that may warrant a change in any trial procedure. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Novo Nordisk will inform the regulatory authorities, including EMA, of trial product-related SUSARs. In addition, Novo Nordisk will inform the IRBs/IECs of trial product-related SUSARs in accordance with local requirement and ICH GCP 2, unless locally this is an obligation of the investigator. Novo Nordisk products used as concomitant medication If an AE is considered to have a causal relationship with a Novo Nordisk marketed product used as concomitant medication in the trial, it is important that the suspected relationship is reported to Novo Nordisk, e.g. in the alternative aetiology section on the safety information form. Novo Nordisk may need to report this adverse event to relevant regulatory authorities. Follow-up of adverse events 12.3 The investigator must record follow-up information by updating the forms in the eCRF. Follow-up information must be reported to Novo Nordisk according to the following: !SAEs: All SAEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovered/resolved”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “fatal”, and until all queries have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved”. Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow-up period and is expected by the investigator to recover.

The semaglutide safety committee may recommend unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an independent ad hoc group will be established in order to maintain the blinding of the trial personnel. 12.7.2 Event adjudication committee An independent external EAC is established to perform validation of selected AEs according to pre- defined diagnostic criteria. The validation is based on review of pre-defined clinical data related to the specific AE. Pre-defined clinical data consist of copies of source documents collected and delivered by the investigational sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The events are reviewed by the EAC in a blinded manner. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact on trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The EAC works in accordance with written guidelines included in the EAC Charter describing in details the composition, tasks, responsibilities and work processes of the committee. The events outlined in Section 12.1.5 have been selected for adjudication in order to obtain an external independent validation of the diagnosis. In addition, cardiovascular events are being adjudicated according to Standardized Definitions45. The EAC will review copies in English (translated if necessary) of medical documentation received in the adjudication packages (e.g. x-ray, ECGs, ultrasound images, discharge summaries, pathology reports and death certificates). The investigator must provide medical documentation as soon as possible, when they receive the request from Novo Nordisk or the event adjudication vendor.CONFIDENTIAL"

Once data has been entered, it will be available to Novo Nordisk for data verification and validation purposes. The pregnancy forms are paper based CRFs. Also, the AE forms, technical complaint forms, and safety information forms will be provided in paper but are only to be used if for any reason the eCRF is unavailable. The investigator must ensure that data is recorded in these forms as soon as possible after the visit. At the end of the trial the investigator must ensure that all remaining data have been entered into the eCRF no later than 3 days after Last Patient Last Visit (LPLV) at the site in order to ensure the planned lock of the database. Site specific eCRF data (in an electronic readable format) will be provided to the trial site before access to the eCRF is revoked. This data must be retained at the trial site . Electronic collection of questionnaires 13.3 Novo Nordisk will use a tablet computer at sites for electronic recording of PRO questionnaires (see Section 8.6.2 ).

The first monitoring visit will be performed as soon as possible after FPFV at the trial site and no later than 4 weeks after, this will include a visit at the DXA radiology unit as well. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the eCRFs, the trial site's recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site to the protocol and GCP, but will not exceed 12 weeks until LPLV at the trial site. The on-site monitoring visit interval to the DXA radiology unit must not exceed 6 months at sites with active subjects. The monitor must be given direct access to all source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition the relevant trial site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. by telephone). All data must be verifiable in source documentation other than the eCRF. For all data recorded the source document must be defined in a source document agreement at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any time for any data element. Source data generated by the trial site can be corrected by another person than the person entering the source data if accepted by local regulations; any correction must be explained, signed and dated by the person making the correction. The original of the completed diaries and ePROs (tablets) must not be removed from the trial site, unless they form part of the CRF/eCRF and a copy is kept at the site. All data entered will be automatically transferred from the device to the ePRO database, hosted by the supplier. This database is considered as the source. The monitor will ensure that the eCRFs are completed and that paper CRFs are collected. The following data will be source data verified for screening failures: !Date for obtaining informed consent. !Reason for screening failure Monitors will review the subject’s medical records and other source data (e.g. the diaries and ensure ePROs are completed) to ensure consistency and/or identify omissions compared to the eCRF.

Data management may be delegated under an agreement of transfer of responsibilities to a CRO. In cases where data management activities are delegated to external vendors, there will be regular transfer of data during the trial. Appropriate measures, including encryption of data files containing person identifiable data, will be used to ensure confidentiality of subject data, when they are transmitted over open networks. Data from central laboratories will be transferred electronically. In cases where data is transferred via non-secure electronic networks, data will be encrypted during transfer. The subject and any biological material obtained from the subject will be identified by subject number and trial ID. Appropriate measures such as encryption or leaving out certain identifiers will be enforced to protect the identity of subjects in all presentations and publications as required by local, regional and national requirements. 16 Computerised systems Novo Nordisk will capture and process clinical data using computerised systems that are described in Novo Nordisk Standard Operating Procedures and IT architecture documentation.

If necessary, a statistical analysis plan (SAP) may be written in addition to the protocol, including a more technical and detailed elaboration of the statistical analyses. The SAP will be finalised before database lock. Laboratory values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be set to ½LLOQ. Results from a statistical analysis will be presented by the estimated treatment contrasts at week 52 with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals and p-values corresponding to two-sided tests of no difference if not otherwise specified. The comparison presented from a statistical analysis will be semaglutide 1.0 mg versus canagliflozin 300 mg If no statistical analysis is specified, data will be presented using relevant summary statistics. Data from all trial sites will be analysed and reported together. The regions used in the statistical analyses are defined as: !North America (USA and Canada) !Region Europe (UK, Ireland, I taly and Sweden) !International Operations (Lebanon, Malaysia, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, India) 17.1.1 Data transformations A number of the continuous parameters will be log-transformed prior to statistical analysis. The output tables and figures will show the results of the analysis back-transformed to the original scale, implying that log-treatment-differences are reported as treatment ratios. Confidence intervals for the treatment ratios will be calculated as exponentiated upper and lower limits for log-treatment difference confidence intervals. The standard errors (SE) of the back-transformed mean and ratio to baseline estimates are also provided; these SEs are calculated using the delta-method (first order Taylor approximation), whereby the SE on the original scale is calculated as the product of the SE on log-scale and the exponentiated estimate of the mean (geometric mean).CONFIDENTIAL"

This specifically implies that if a visit 2 assessment is missing (whether it was planned or not planned) then the screening assessment (from visit 1), if available, will be used as the baseline assessment. 17.1.3 Primary estimand To further detail the trial objective an estimand is defined which is a de-jure (efficacy) estimand: 1. Primary estimand !The treatment difference between semaglutide and canagliflozin at week 52 for all randomised subjects if all subjects completed treatment and did not initiate rescue medication This primary de-jure estimand is considered clinically relevant as it assesses the glycaemic benefit a person with T2D is expected to achieve if initiating and continuing treatment with semaglutide compared to canagliflozin. Accordingly, only data collected prior to discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication will be used to draw inference. This will avoid confounding from rescue medication. 17.1.4 Trial completion Unless subjects withdraw their informed consent, data collection will continue for the full duration of the trial. The full duration of the trial is defined as up to and including the follow-up visit (P11). Subjects completing the follow-up visit (P11) will be considered trial completers. 17.1.5 Missing data considerations at week 52 The actual rate of missing data at week 52 is expected to be maximum 10% based on the rate of trial completers from the subcutaneous semaglutide phase 3a clinical development program. The frequency of missing data is expected to be similar in the semaglutide and the canagliflozin groups. When estimating the primary estimand, the combined rate of missing data, subjects discontinuing treatment prematurely or initiating rescue medication on top of trial product, is expected to be maximum 30%. This is based on the results from the subcutaneous semaglutide phase 3a clinical development program. Based on these data, premature treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events is expected to be low but more frequent in semaglutide compared to canagliflozin. Other reasons for discontinuing treatment are assumed to be unrelated to treatment and therefore occur with similar rates, so overall the frequency of missing data or data not used at week 52 in the primary analysis is expected to be slightly larger in semaglutide as compared to canagliflozin.CONFIDENTIAL"

Sample size calculation 17.2 The primary endpoint, change from baseline to week 52 in HbA 1c(%) will be tested for non- inferiority and superiority of semaglutide vs. canagliflozin. The confirmatory secondary endpoints, change from baseline to week 52 in body weight (kg) and change from baseline to week 52 in total fat mass (kg) are planned to be tested for superiority of semaglutide vs. canagliflozin. The sample size calculation is made to ensure a power of at least 90% for meeting HbA 1c superiority of semaglutide vs. canagliflozin out of the four pre-specified confirmatory hypotheses shown in Table 17–1 . The closed testing procedure described in Bretz et.al. 201146combined with a hierarchical approach is used to control the overall type-1 error at a nominal two-sided 5% level. The statistical testing strategy is built on the following principle: !Glycaemic efficacy must be established by HbA 1cnon-inferiority before testing for added benefits in terms of superiority in terms of HbA 1c or body weight. !HbA 1cand body weight superiority must be established before testing for added benefits in terms of superiority in terms of total fat mass. The sample size is calculated using the calcPower function in the R package, gMCP47using 10,000 simulations. All of the four pre-specified confirmatory tests are assumed to be independent. Since some of these tests are positively correlated, the assumption of independence is viewed as conservative. The four hypotheses are: !HbA 1c non-inferiority of semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. canagliflozin 300 mg with a non-inferiority margin of 0.3 !HbA 1c superiority of semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. canagliflozin 300 mg !Body weight superiority of semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. canagliflozin 300 mg !Total fat mass superiority of semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. canagliflozin 300 mg The sample size assumptions for efficacy based on on-treatment data without rescue medication, a treatment effect based on in-trial data (see Section 17.3.1 ) and the standard deviations (SD) are given in Table 17–1 . The HbA 1c and body weight assumptions are based on the efficacy results and an observed reduction of approximately 20% and 15% respectively in in-trial treatment effect compare to efficacy in the subcutaneous semaglutide phase 3a clinical development programme28, 48-52. A similar reduction in the in-trial treatment effect compared to efficacy is assumed with canagliflozin as comparator. The total fat mass assumption is based on the relevant literature CONFIDENTIAL"

The observation period is a sub-set of the in-trial observation period. It starts at the date of first dose of trial product. Two slightly different end dates will be needed to cover all assessments appropriately according to the flow chart. For adjudicated events, ECG’s and AEs including hypoglycaemic episodes, the observation period ends at the first date of any of the following: !the follow-up visit (P11) !the follow-up prematurely discontinuation visit (P11A) !the last date on trial product + 42 days !the end-date for the in-trial observation period The follow-up visit is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after the last date on trial product corresponding to approximately five half-lives of subcutaneous semaglutide. The visit window for the follow-up visit is + 7 days, which is the reason for the 42 days specified in the bullet above. Hence, for those assessments this period reflects the period in which subjects are exposed. For efficacy and other safety assessments (laboratory assessments, physical examination and vital signs) the observation period ends at the last date on trial product + 7 days. This ascertainment window corresponds to the dosing interval and will be used to avoid attenuation of a potential treatment effect on endpoints for which the effect is reversible shortly after treatment discontinuation. Hence, for those assessments this period reflects the period in which subjects are treated. On-treatment without rescue medication: This observation period is a sub-set of the on- treatment observation period, where subjects are considered treated with trial product, but have not initiated any rescue medications. Specifically it starts at date of first dose of trial product and the observation period ends at the first date of any of the following: !the last dose of trial product +7 days !initiation of rescue medication The ’on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period will be the primary observation period for efficacy evaluations. The in-trial observation period will be considered supportive for efficacy evaluation. Safety will be evaluated based on the in-trial and the on-treatment observation periods unless otherwise specified. Data points collected outside an observation period will be treated as missing in the analysis. Baseline data will always be included in an observation period. For adjudicated events, the onset date will be the EAC adjudicated onset date. Before data are locked for statistical analysis, a review of all data will take place.

The subjects or observations to be excluded, and the reasons for their exclusion will be documented and signed by those responsible before database lock. The subjects and observations excluded from analysis sets, and the reason for this, will be described in the clinical trial report. Primary endpoint 17.4 The primary endpoint is change from baseline to week 52 in HbA 1c. 17.4.1 Primary analysis for the primary estimand The primary estimand will be estimated based on the FAS using post-baseline measurements up to and including week 52 from the ’on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period. Imputation of missing data will be handled using multiple imputation assuming that missing data is missing at random (MAR). Missing data will be imputed using observed data within the same group defined by the randomised treatment (semaglutide/canagliflozin). It is hereby assumed that the likely values of what the missing data would have been if available are best described by information from subjects who receive the same treatment. Technically missing values will be imputed as follows: !Intermittent missing values are imputed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, in order to obtain a monotone missing data pattern. This imputation is done for each of the treatment groups separately and 200 copies of the dataset will be generated !A sequential regression approach for imputing monotone missing values at planned visits will be implemented starting with the first visit after baseline and sequentially continuing to the last planned visit at week 52. A model used to impute missing values at each planned visit will be fitted for each of the treatment groups using observed data. The model will include stratification factor (sub-study, non-sub-study) and region as categorical effects and baseline and post- baseline HbA 1cvalues observed prior to the visit in question as covariates. !An ANCOVA with treatment, stratification factor (s ub-study, non-sub-study) and region as categorical effects and baseline HbA 1cas a covariate will be used to analyse HbA 1cvalues at week 52 for each of the 200 complete data sets generated as part of the imputation of missing values. Rubin’s rule will be used to combine the analysis results in order to draw inference. From this analysis, the estimated treatment difference between semaglutide and canagliflozin at week 52 will be presented together with the associated two-sided 95% confidence interval and unadjusted two sided p-values for testing non-inferiority and superiority.CONFIDENTIAL"

Let the mean treatment difference be defined as μ = (semaglutide minus canagliflozin): !Non-inferiority, using a non-inferiority margin of 0.3% oH0: μ≥0.3% against Ha: μ<0.3% !Superiority oH0: μ ≥0.0% against Ha: μ <0.0% Operationally the hypotheses will be evaluated by two-sided tests. The non-inferiority margin of 0.3 is chosen based on the diabetes guideline56, 57and the effect of canagliflozin on glycaemic effect seen in a similar trial (DIA3006) where canagliflozin was used as add on to metformin. In this trial canagliflozin showed an HbA 1c treatment difference to placebo of -0.77% Hence, based on this trial, the chosen margin of 0.3 provides assurance that semaglutide has an effect compared to placebo greater than 0 with a clinically relevant size. With regards to the constancy assumption, controlled clinical trials have consistently established that canagliflozin is an effective anti-diabetic drug. Therefore, lack of trial sensitivity with canagliflozin as comparator is not anticipated to be an issue in this trial. 17.4.3 Multiplicity and criteria for confirming hypotheses The Type-I error for testing the four confirmatory hypotheses related to the HbA 1c, body weight, and fat mass endpoints will be preserved in the strong sense at 5% (two-sided) using the weighted Bonferroni-based closed testing procedure described in Bretz et. al.46and outlined in Figure 17–1 . The first hypothesis to be tested is non-inferiority of HbA 1c. It will be tested at the overall significance level (5%) while allocating 0% local significance level to the remaining three hypotheses. For this hypothesis, and in general, if a hypothesis is confirmed the significance level will be reallocated according to the weight and the direction of the edges going from the confirmed hypothesis to the next hypotheses as specified in Figure 17–1 . Total fat mass will be tested at the overall significance level if each of the other 3 hypotheses is confirmed, otherwise its local significance level will remain 0%. Each of the following hypotheses will be tested at their local significance level ( α-local). This process will be repeated until no further hypotheses can be confirmed. Non-inferiority and subsequent superiority will be considered confirmed if the mean treatment difference is supporting the corresponding alternative hypothesis and the two-sided p-value from the primary analysis of the primary estimand is strictly below its local two-sided significance level as defined by the closed testing procedure in Figure 17–1 .

In this analysis, subjects from the semaglutide group with missing observations will be given a penalty, i.e., it is assumed that subjects with missing observations who are randomised to semaglutide will receive a treatment that is worse than subjects with observed values who are randomised to semaglutide. The idea is to gradually increase the penalty to evaluate at which level the superiority conclusion of the analyses in terms of statistical significance is changed. The tipping point is the penalty level, at which the magnitude of efficacy reduction in subjects with missing data creates a shift in the treatment effect of semaglutide from being statistically significantly better than canagliflozin to being non-statistically significantly better for the superiority test and similarly for the non-inferiority test.

Missing data will be imputed using the same approach as described for the primary analysis of the primary estimand. However the imputation will be done within the same group defined not only by the randomised treatment (semaglutide/canagliflozin) but also by the status of treatment completion (still on randomised treatment at week 52 yes/no) (4 groups in total). It is hereby assumed that the likely values of what the missing data would have been if available are best described by information from subjects who at week 52 are similar in terms of randomised treatment and treatment completion status. In addition in the imputation step stratification factor and region is not included in the model in order to avoid potential issues with sparse data. This analysis could be considered addressing an effectiveness estimand. !PP analysis based on the PP data set using the ‘on-treatment without rescue’ observation period . This analysis will be carried out for non-inferiority testing only. The statistical analysis will be the same as the primary analysis for the primary estimand.

The sections below describe the important identified and potential risks and precautions associated with semaglutide treatment. These are based on findings in nonclinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1RAs. For each of these risks and precautions, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. 18.1.2 Identified risk Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1RAs, the most frequently reported AEs in clinical trials with semaglutide have been gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and constipation). Clinical trials have indicated that a low starting dose and gradual dose escalation mitigates the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Consequently, a low starting dose and dose escalation with 4 week dose-escalation steps have been implemented in the trial. 18.1.3 Potential risks Medullary thyroid cancer The human relevance of the proliferative C-cell changes found in rodents treated with GLP-1RAs is unknown, but data suggest that rodents are more sensitive to the mode of action of GLP-1RAs for induction of C-cell tumours. However, as a precaution, subjects with a family or personal history of Multipel Endokrin Neoplasi type 2 (MEN 2) or Medullary thyroid cancer will not be enrolled in the trial. During the trial, calcitonin will be measured at randomistion visit, visit 8 and at V10/V10A, and the guidance for investigators on further evaluation and action on elevated calcitonin concentrations is included in appendix A . Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in subjects treated with GLP-1RAs including semaglutide. As a precaution, subjects with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. Also, subjects will be informed about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and serum levels of lipase and amylase will be monitored throughout the trial. Pancreatic cancer Patients with T2D have an increased risk of certain types of cancer such as pancreatic cancer. There is currently no support from nonclinical studies or clinical trials or post marketing data that GLP-1- based therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, pancreatic cancer has been CONFIDENTIAL"

Pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1RAs by EMA. Allergic reactions and injection site reaction As in the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, treatment with semaglutide may evoke allergic reactions. These may include localized injection site reactions or generalized reactions, including urticaria, rash, pruritus as well as anaphylactic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance if suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction to the trial product occurs. Hypoglycaemia Based on current knowledge about the GLP-1RA drug class, there is a risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when semaglutide is combined with SU or insulin. Acute kidney injury In subjects treated with GLP-1RAs, including semaglutide, gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may lead to significant dehydration and secondary acute kidney injury. Subjects with gastrointestinal AEs are recommended to drink plenty of fluids to avoid volume depletion. Also, serum creatinine and other markers of kidney function will be monitored throughout the trial. SGLT-2 inhibitors have also been associated with volume depletion. It is recommended to monitor renal function and for signs and symptoms of fluid loss during therapy. Severe dehydration may be a risk factor for ketoacidosis. Impaired renal function may increase the risk of metformin associated lactic acidosis when GLP- 1RAs are co-administered with metformin. As a precaution, serum creatinine will be measured regularly. In subjects treated with metformin who experience prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, the investigator should monitor serum creatinine, and if clinically indicated, withhold metformin until resolution of renal dysfunction. The use of the background medication should be in accordance with the current, approved labels. 18.1.4 Other safety considerations Teratogenicity (embryo-foetal development toxicity) Semaglutide caused embryo-foetal malformations in the rat through a GLP-1 receptor mediated effect on the inverted yolk sac placenta leading to impaired nutrient supply to the developing embryo. Primates do not have an inverted yolk sac placenta which makes this mechanism unlikely to be of relevance to humans. However, as a precaution, females who are pregnant, breast-feeding CONFIDENTIAL"

In addition, pregnancy tests will be performed at all visits, including screening and follow-up and at any time during the trial if a menstrual period is missed, or as required by local law. Diabetic retinopathy A transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy is a recognised complication in selected patients with diabetes after initiation of intensive anti-diabetic treatment61-63. Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in blood glucose may be an additional aggravating factor. Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression 5, 64even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening62. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo. As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed before enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. As part of good diabetes management the investigator is encouraged to ensure adequate monitoring and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in subjects enrolled into the trial 65. General precautions All subjects will be included after a thorough evaluation with regards to in- and exclusion criteria defined in order to ensure that subjects are eligible for trial treatment. There are also strict glycaemic rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial. If rescue medication is required, it should be in accordance with ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes33, 34(excluding GLP-1RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors, amylin analogues and SGLT-2).It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care according to the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 65. Further details with regards to safety of trial product are described in the current edition of the IB for semaglutide (NN9535) 25or any updates thereto or in the current approved label of the relevant SGLT-inhibitors. Canagliflozin Subjects should be considered suitable for treatment with canagliflozin and the use of canagliflozin should be in accordance with the current, approved label. It is important to monitor renal function and for signs and symptoms of volume depletion during therapy. Serum creatinine will be measured regularly for monitoring of renal function. The most common adverse reactions reported with canagliflozin are female genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections and increased urination. Other events include hypoglycaemia CONFIDENTIAL"

Canagliflozin and other SGLT-2 inhibitors have also been associated with a risk of urinary tract infections and ketoacidosis. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, general malaise and shortness of breath. Ketoacidosis associated with the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors can occur even if blood sugar levels are only relatively elevated or non-elevated. If ketoacidosis is suspected, canagliflozin or canagliflozin placebo should be discontinued and appropriate treatment should be instituted promptly. 18.1.5 Benefits In this trial, subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 manner to one of two treatment arms involving an active add-on treatment regimen anticipated to be more efficacious than the treatment they receive at the time of entry into the trial (metformin only). Based on the results of the completed clinical trials, semaglutide is expected to provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight in subjects with type 2 diabetes. In addition, it is expected that all subjects, will benefit from participation through close contact with the trial site, with close follow-up of their T2D and a careful medical examination, all of which will most likely result in an intensified management of their T2D. Finally, data from two cardiovascular outcomes trials investigating treatment with GLP-1RAs compared to placebo have indicated that there might be a potential beneficial effect of these drugs on cardiovascular outcomes when added to standard of care in subjects with T2D at high risk of cardiovascular events (see Section 3.1.5.3 ).

Completed clinical trials with semaglutide provided clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight. Safety and efficacy will be monitored regularly and acceptable glycaemic control will be reinforced at all times during the trial.

A voluntary, signed and personally dated informed consent must be obtained from the subject before any trial-related activity. The responsibility for seeking informed consent must remain with the investigator, but the investigator may delegate the task to a medically qualified person, in accordance with local requirements. The written informed consent must be signed and personally dated by the person who seeks the informed consent before any trial-related activity. If information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participating in the trial, the investigator must inform the subject in a timely manner, and a revised written subject information must be provided and a new informed consent must be obtained. In order to avoid missing data, the subjects will be informed about the importance of completing the trial also if the subjects discontinue treatment with trial product.CONFIDENTIAL"

If data is used, it will always be in accordance with local regulations and IRBs/IECs. Information to subjects during trial 18.5 All written information to subjects must be sent to IRB/IEC for approval/favourable opinion and to regulatory authorities for approval or notification according to local regulations. Premature termination of the trial and/or trial site 18.6 Novo Nordisk, the IRBs/IECs or a regulatory authority may decide to stop the trial, part of the trial or a trial site at any time, but agreement on procedures to be followed must be obtained. If the trial is suspended or prematurely terminated, the investigator must inform the subjects promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow-up. The investigator and/or Novo Nordisk must also promptly inform the regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs and provide a detailed written explanation. If, after the termination of the trial, the benefit-risk analysis changes, the new evaluation must be provided to the IRBs/IECs in case it has an impact on the planned follow-up of subjects who have participated in the trial. If it has an impact, the actions needed to inform and protect the subjects should be described.CONFIDENTIAL"

If deviations do occur, the investigator must inform the monitor and the implications of the deviation must be reviewed and discussed. Deviations must be documented and explained in a protocol deviation by stating the reason, date, and the action(s) taken. Some deviations, for which corrections are not possible, can be acknowledged and confirmed via edit checks in the eCRF. Documentation on protocol deviations must be kept in the investigator trial master file and sponsor trial master file. Prevention of missing data 19.2 The importance of subject retention will be addressed by Novo Nordisk in the training and communication with the trial sites. The subjects will be carefully informed about the trial procedures before signing informed consent, so that they know the implications of participating in the trial. Close surveillance of subject retention will be performed throughout the trial by Novo Nordisk with focus on reasons for premature discontinuation of trial product or withdrawal of consent to secure early mitigations in collaboration with the trial sites. The investigator will make every effort to ensure that all assessments are performed and data is collected. If missing data does occur the reason will be collected via the protocol deviation process, see Section 19.1. Novo Nordisk will monitor protocol deviations on an on-going basis throughout the trial followed by appropriate actions (e.g. re-training of site staff). 20 Audits and inspections Any aspect of the clinical trial may be subject to audits conducted by Novo Nordisk or inspections from domestic or foreign regulatory authorities or from IRBs/IECs. Audits and inspections may take place during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as Novo Nordisk staff have an obligation to cooperate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving auditors and inspectors direct access to all source documents and other documents at the trial site relevant to the clinical trial. This includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are relevant to the evaluation of the trial.CONFIDENTIAL"

If any tasks are delegated, the investigator must maintain a log of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated specified trial- related duties. The investigator must ensure that there is adequate and documented training for all staff participating in the conduct of the trial. It is the investigator’s responsibility to supervise the conduct of the trial and to protect the rights, safety, and well-being of the subjects. A qualified physician, who is an investigator or a sub-investigator for the trial, must be responsible for all trial-related medical decisions. The investigator will follow instructions from Novo Nordisk when processing data. The investigator is responsible for filing essential documents (i.e. those documents which individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced) in the investigator trial master file. The documents including the subject identification code list must be kept in a secure locked facility, so no unauthorized persons can get access to the data. The investigator will take all necessary technical and organisational safety measures to prevent accidental or wrongful destruction, loss or deterioration of data. The investigator will prevent any unauthorised access to data or any other processing of data against applicable law. The investigator must be able to provide the necessary information or otherwise demonstrate to Novo Nordisk that such technical and organisational safety measures have been taken. During any period of unavailability, the investigator must delegate responsibility for medical care of subjects to a specific qualified physician who will be readily available to subjects during that time. If the investigator is no longer able to fulfil the role as investigator (e.g. if he/she moves or retires), a new investigator will be appointed in consultation with Novo Nordisk. The investigator and other site personnel must have sufficient English skills according to their assigned task(s).CONFIDENTIAL"

All information supplied by Novo Nordisk in connection with this trial shall remain the sole property of Novo Nordisk and is to be considered confidential information. No confidential information shall be disclosed to others without prior written consent from Novo Nordisk. Such information shall not be used except in the performance of this trial. The information obtained during this trial may be made available to other physicians who are conducting other clinical trials with the trial product, if deemed necessary by Novo Nordisk. Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled, Novo Nordisk may grant access to information obtained during this trial to researchers who require access for research projects studying the same disease and/or trial product studied in this trial. Novo Nordisk may publish on its clinical trials website a redacted clinical trial report for this trial. One or two investigators will be appointed by Novo Nordisk to review and sign the clinical trial report (signatory investigator) on behalf of all participating investigators. The signatory investigator will be appointed based upon the criteria defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for research publications 66. Communication of results 23.1 Novo Nordisk commits to communicating, and otherwise making available for public disclosure, results of trials regardless of outcome. Public disclosure includes publication of a paper in a scientific journal, abstract submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting, or disclosure by other means. The results of this trial will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to international and national regulations, as reflected in the Novo Nordisk Code of Conduct for Clinical Trial Disclosure35. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of data until specified milestones are reached, for example when the clinical trial report is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may influence the results of the entire trial. At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property.CONFIDENTIAL"

All authors will be given the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports needed to evaluate the planned publication. In the event of any disagreement on the content of any publication, both the investigators’ and Novo Nordisk opinions will be fairly and sufficiently represented in the publication. Where required by the journal, the investigator from each trial site will be named in an acknowledgement or in the supplementary material, as specified by the journal. Novo Nordisk maintains the right to be informed of plans by any investigator to publish and to review any scientific paper, presentation, communication or other information concerning the investigation described in this protocol. Any such communication must be submitted in writing to Novo Nordisk before submission for comments. Comments will be given within four weeks from receipt of the planned communication. 23.1.1 Authorship Authorship of publications should be in accordance with the Uniform Requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors66(sometimes referred to as the Vancouver Criteria). Novo Nordisk will appoint investigator(s) to prepare publications in collaboration with Novo Nordisk. 23.1.2 Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s) For a multi-centre clinical trial, analyses based on single-site data usually have significant statistical limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare professionals or subjects, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. It is a Novo Nordisk policy that such individual reports do not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to prior review of such publications. Further to allow for the primary manuscript to be published as the first, Novo Nordisk asks for deferment of publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. As Novo Nordisk wants to live up to the industry publication policy, submission of a primary publication will take place no later than 18 months after trial completion. Investigator access to data and review of results 23.2 As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database. CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator must agree to archive the documentation (this includes both electronic and paper- based records) pertaining to the trial in an archive after completion or discontinuation of the trial if not otherwise notified. The investigator should not destroy any documents without prior permission from Novo Nordisk. If the investigator cannot archive the documents at the trial site, Novo Nordisk can refer the investigator to an independent archive provider that has a system in place to allow only the investigator to access the files. The investigator must be able to access his/her trial documents without involving Novo Nordisk in any way. Site-specific CRFs and other subject data (in an electronic readable format or as paper copies or prints) will be provided to the investigator before access is revoked to the systems and/or electronic devices supplied by Novo Nordisk. These data must be retained by the trial site. If the provided data (e.g. the CD-ROM) is not readable during the entire storage period, the investigator can request a new copy. A copy of all data will be stored by Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk will maintain Novo Nordisk documentation pertaining to the trial for at least 20 years after discontinuation of the marketing authorisation, termination of the trial or cancellation of the research project whichever is longest. The files from the trial site/institution must be retained for 15 years after end of trial as defined in section 7, or longer if required by local regulations or Novo Nordisk. In any case trial files cannot be destroyed until the trial site/institution is notified by Novo Nordisk.

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (greater than 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !smoking !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various co-morbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells.CONFIDENTIAL"

The subject should remain in the trial; however, all medications suspected to relate to this condition must be discontinued until diagnosis has been established. Background: These values were found in 9 (0.15%) of a population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1. All of these patients were diagnosed with MTC, resulting in a positive predictive value of 100%. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !fine needle aspiration of any nodules >1 cm !potentially, surgery with neck dissection In case a subject is diagnosed with MTC, it is common clinical practice to explore the family history of MTC or MEN2 and perform a genetic test for RET proto-oncogene mutation. 2.2 Calcitonin ≥50 and <100 ng/L Action: The subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. The subject should remain in the trial and continuation on trial product should be based on the evaluation done by the thyroid specialist. Background: These values were found in 8 (0.14%) of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1. Two of these subjects were diagnosed with MTC and two were diagnosed with C-cell hyperplasia, resulting in a positive predictive value of a C-cell anomaly of 50%. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !if available, and if there are no contraindications, a pentagastrin stimulation test should be done. For subjects with positive pentagastrin stimulation test, surgery should be considered. !if pentagastrin stimulation test is not available, thyroid ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy may add important clinical information about the need for surgery. 2.3 Calcitonin ≥10 and <50 ng/L Action: The subject can continue in the trial on trial product. Continue sampling of calcitonin according to the protocol. If the value is from the last sample taken in the trial, the subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation.CONFIDENTIAL"

The predictive value of a C-cell anomaly for this calcitonin level was 8.3%. However, the likelihood of having a medullary carcinoma >1 cm with calcitonin in this range is extremely low. For calcitonin values between 10-20 ng/L Costante et al. 1identified 216 (3.7%) patients. One patient out of the 216 had a subsequent basal (unstimulated) calcitonin value of 33 ng/L, and had C- cell hyperplasia at surgery. Two other studies used a cut-off of calcitonin > 10 ng/L to screen for C- cell disease, but they do not provide sufficient information on patients with basal CT >10 and <20 ng/L to allow conclusions2, 3.CONFIDENTIAL"

The onset of the pain may be swift, reaching maximum intensity within 30 min, is frequently unbearable, and characteristically persists for more than 24 hours without relief2.The pain is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination usually reveals severe upper abdominal tenderness at times associated with guarding. In general, both amylase and lipase are elevated during the course of acute pancreatitis. The serum lipase may remain elevated slightly longer than amylase. The level of the serum amylase and/or lipase does not correlate with the severity of acute pancreatitis2. In general, serum lipase is thought to be more sensitive and specific than serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis, the trial product should promptly be interrupted (no treatment discontinuation call should be made in IWRS before diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed). Appropriate additional examinations must be performed, including local measurement of amylase and lipase. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features3: !abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back) !serum lipase activity (and/or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the upper normal limit !characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging. If acute pancreatitis is ruled out, trial product should be re-initiated. If acute pancreatitis is confirmed, appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated. The subject must be discontinued from trial product (treatment discontinuation call in IWRS), but should remain in the trial (see Section 6.5 and 8.1.6 ). 1.7 Renal event If a renal event is observed during the trial, the following additional information must be reported if available: !Signs and symptoms of renal failure !Specific laboratory tests supporting the diagnosis !Imaging performed supporting the diagnosis !Kidney biopsy results Risk or confounding factors identified including exposure to nephrotoxic agentsCONFIDENTIAL"

Risk-mitigation strategy for the risk of lower limb amputations potentially associated with canagliflozin, currently under review by the FDA and the EMA. This strategy includes additional exclusion and premature discontinuation criteria, physical examination of legs and feet at every site visits and description of this potential risk. 2. Update of identified risks for semaglutide 3. Other minor corrections and clarifications 1.1 Risk-mitigation strategy for the risk of lower limb amputations potentially associated with canagliflozin, currently under review by the FDA and the EMA. This strategy includes additional exclusion and premature discontinuation criteria, physical examination of legs and feet at every site visits and description of this potential risk. Protocol sections updated: 1, 2, 6.3, 6.6, 8.4.1, and 18.1.4. The European Medicines Agency (EMA)1and The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)2 have started a review of the diabetes medicine canagliflozin after an increase in amputations, mostly affecting toes, based on data emerged from the ongoing clinical trial called Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) sponsored by Janssen Research & Development, LLC. In the CANVAS trial an increased risk of leg and foot amputations have been identified. The amputations occurred about twice as often in patients treated with canagliflozin compared to patients treated with placebo. An interim analysis showed that over a year’s time, the risks of amputation for patients in the trial were equivalent to: !7 out of every 1,000 patients treated with 100 mg daily of canagliflozin !5 out of every 1,000 patients treated with 300 mg daily of canagliflozin !3 out of every 1,000 patients treated with placebo Based on feedback from several National Health Authorities (HAs) for trial NN9535-4270, a full risk-mitigation strategy has been implemented in this trial, which includes: !an additional exclusion criterion !a premature discontinuation criterion !legs and feet examinations at every clinic visit !additional information on this potential new risk associated with canagliflozin !Information to this potential new risk is added to the Subject Information/Informed Consent (SI/IC).CONFIDENTIAL"

In addition, a new paragraph describing the new identified risk of cholelithiasis has been added, based on recent analyses of the SUSTAIN phase 3a development program. 1.3 Other minor corrections and clarifications Canagliflozin treatment arm Protocol section updated: 5.3 This protocol section is updated to align with section below. Number of subjects Protocol section updated: 6.1 This protocol section is updated due to a subject re-allocation between countries participating in this trial. The number of subjects to be randomised for Mexico has increased by 5 subjects, hence a total number of 50 subjects are planned to be randomised in Mexico. Milestones Protocol section updated: 7.0 This protocol section is updated to accommodate for the potential delay in approving this amendment and thereby the trial start in some countries. Reporting of adverse event (Novo Nordisk assessment of AE expectedness) Protocol section updated: 12.2 This protocol section is updated to align with the current process in place in Novo Nordisk.

Canagliflozin and other SGLT-2 inhibitors have also been associated with a risk of urinary tract infections and ketoacid osis. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, t iredness, general malaise and shortness of breath. Ketoacidosis associated with the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors can occur even if blood sugar levels are only relatively elevated or non-elevated. If ketoacidosis is suspected, canagli flozin or canagliflozin placebo should be discontinued and appropriate tr eatment should be instituted promptly.
