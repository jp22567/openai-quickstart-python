MR can have many underlying etiologies, but the majority of these can be divided into two major categories: degenerative and functional. Degenerative mitral v alve regurgitation (DMR), also known as primary MR, refers to regurgitation resulting from str uctural abnormality of the mitral valve leaflets and/or valve apparatus. The most common causes of DMR is mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic disease, and endocarditis. In contrast, fun ctional mitral regurgitation (FMR), also known as secondary MR, occurs when the valve and/or valve apparatus are structurally normal, but dysfunction, distortion, or dilation of the left atrial or ventricular chambers results in tethering of leaflets and/or mitral annular dilation that preve nt leaflet coaptation. FMR can occur in the setting of underlying ischemic heart disease or heart fa ilure with dilated cardiomyopathy. 3.2 Prevalence of Mitral Regurgitation Mitral regurgitation is the most common valvular heart disease after aortic stenosis. Approximately 2% of the population is affected, with 250,000 new diagnoses annually. The prevalence and severity of MR increases with age, with signific ant MR affecting nearly 10% of the U.S. population aged >75 years and associated with increase d morbidity and mortality in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure sympt oms 1, 2. Amongst those with severe MR, the predominant mechanism of MR h as been shown to be up to 74% functional and 21% degenerative3. In patients with severe heart failure, the onset of FMR increases the hemodynamic stress on the failing left ventricle resulting in a cycle of progressive dilation and dysfunction and volume overload. Between 54 and 6 0% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have been reported to have FMR 4. 3.3 Morbidity and Mortality Related to Mitral Regurgitation Chronic MR imposes volume overload on the left ventricle (LV) w hich results in LV remodeling and cyclical worsening of MR. This may lead to worsening of left ventricular failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation and increased mortality.1 Although MR may be tolerated for a long time in some patients, in others, progression of heart failure with LV muscle dysfunction may be more rapid5. The natural course of severe MR depends on many factors inclu ding, but not"
16,page_16,"EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES LLC The CLASP Study Clinical Investigational Plan Study #2016-05 Page 17 of 90 limited to, the type of MR, presence of symptoms, LV function a nd presence of atrial fibrillation or pulmonary hypertension6. Symptomatic patients with severe MR have an annual death rate o f 5%7. The risk of death in subjects aged ≥70 years old with moderate/severe MR has been sh own to be more than four- fold higher than that of age and sex matched subjects with abse nt/mild MR8. Nearly 50% of patients with ischemic FMR develop heart failure or cardiac death within 5 years (three times more likely than post-MI patients without MR) 9. In patients with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies and heart failure, MR independently predicts increased mortality, and mortality is directly associated with the degree of regurgitation7. FMR has a 50% composite rate of mortality and heart failure (HF ) hospitalization at 3 years, compared with 30% in HF patients without FMR10. 3.4 Current Treatment of Patients with Mitral Regurgitation 3.4.1 Medical Therapy For chronic DMR patients without heart failure, medical treatme nt is limited to diuretics and nitrates to reduce afterload. Medical therapy for FMR patients with heart failure is focused on symptom relief from left-ventricular dysfunction. This include s diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. Although these drugs have been shown to improve the symptoms of heart failure and some have been shown to improve survival, there are no data that show that current medical therapies will reduce the severity or consequences of functional MR or reverse the progression of the underlying pathology. 11-13 3.4.2 Surgical Treatment For DMR, surgical mitral valve repair or replacement is indicat ed in patients with symptoms and LVEF>30%, or in asymptomatic patients with LVEF between 30 and 60% or LVESD ≥40mm. Surgical repair of abnormal structural valve apparatus includes prolapsed leaflet resection, chordae reconstruction, leaflet augmentation, and cleft closure. Surgical options for treatment of symptomatic severe FMR include partial or complete annuloplasty and/or edge-to-edge leaflet repair. Surgery for FMR is generally only recommended w hen patients become unresponsive to optimal medical therapy and have adequate LV function (>30% LVEF), as the clinical benefit of surgical treatment for FMR is controversial 15"
17,page_17,"EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES LLC The CLASP Study Clinical Investigational Plan Study #2016-05 Page 18 of 90 Surgical mitral valve repair is preferred over replacement if a successful and durable repair can be achieved. Mitral valve replacement surgery is associated wi th a high incidence of complications including valve failure and bleeding due to the need for anticoagulants14. Although surgical repair and replacement options have been show n to be the standard treatment for MR in the surgically eligible population, it has been estimated that nearly 50% of patients with severe MR are not referred for surgery because they are prohibitively high risk due to advanced age, impaired left ventricular function or the pres ence of comorbidities 15. In practice, isolated surgery for FMR is performed in less than 15 % of eligible patients16. 3.4.3 Novel therapies 3.4.3.1 Cardiac resynchronization Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may provide benefit for patients with chronic severe FMR in the presence of conduction abnormalities that may cause cardiac wall motion that exacerbates the MR. While this therapy has been shown to impro ve quality of life and exercise tolerance, it is applicable only to those with conduction abnormalities. 3.4.3.2 Percutaneous valve replacement Several percutaneous mitral valve replacement technologies, either via trans-apical, trans-atrial, or trans-septal approaches, are in early stages of pre-clinical and clinical evaluation17-20 indicating a trend in catheter based therapies to treat the hig h surgical risk MR patient population. None are yet commercially available. 3.4.3.3 Percutaneous valve repair Percutaneous mitral valve repair therapies have raised interest due to the minimally invasive nature of the procedures. Various technologies have emerged and can be grouped by the treatment area: leaflet repair, direct annuloplasty or indirect annuloplasty via the coronary sinus, and chamber (LV) remodeling 17, 18. The MitraClip System (Abbot Vascular, Menlo Park, CA) is a catheter-based technology that delivers a clip to grasp and COAPT the native mitral valve leaf lets, based on the edge-to-edge surgical repair technique which approximates the mitral posterior and anterior leaflets to create a double orifice. MitraClip received CE mark 2008 (indicated fo r MR) and FDA approval in 2013 (indicated for severe symptomatic DMR in high-surgical risk pop ulation only). To date, the MitraClip has been implanted in more than 40,000 patients."
18,page_18,"EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES LLC The CLASP Study Clinical Investigational Plan Study #2016-05 Page 19 of 90 The MitraClip has demonstrated rates of procedural success greater than 90%, a good safety profile, left ventricular reverse remodeling, and improved clin ical outcomes in a randomized study and large multi-center registries21-25. The U.S. EVEREST II randomized controlled trial compared the MitraClip to conventional surgical treatment of MR in 258 patients in an operable population with mostly DMR. The study concluded that MitraClip was superior to surgery for safety but less effective in the reduction of MR. 23 Five-year results have recently been published and have shown that between 1- and 5-year follow-up, showing comparable and low rates of surgery for mitral valve dysfunction between the group s, strengthening the evidence for durability of MR reduction. At 1- and 5-year follow up, the mo rtality rates were similar between both groups (at 1-year 6% vs. 6% for MitraClip and Surgery, res pectively; p=1.0 and at 5-years 20.8% vs. 26.8% for MitraClip and Surgery, respectively; p=0.36 ), but residual moderate or severe MR was higher in the MitraClip group (12.3% vs. 1.8%; p= 0.02)26. Glower et al27 reported results from the prospective multi-center EVEREST II high-risk registry (n=78) and the REALISM continued access high risk arm (n=273). Twelve-month data showed that MitraClip treatment significantly reduced MR, improved cli nical symptoms and decreased left ventricular dimensions in this high-risk cohort. The ACCESS-EU was a prospective, multi-center, nonrandomized po st-approval study conducted in 567 patients in Europe. In this patient population , the procedure was effective with low hospital mortality and low adverse event rates24. In these studies, it was observed that 30-day safety performanc e outcomes after MitraClip implantation are similar to those at one year. Only complications related to the underlying disease such as mortality and re-hospitalizations continually i ncrease. Glower at al discussed “In these high-risk patients, the results of MV (mitral valve) device placement appear to be very stable from 30 days to 12 months”. Additionally, Feldman et al26 discussed: “The landmark analysis of this device demonstrated that the clinical failures primarily occurred within the first 6 months, most of which were caused by inadequate MR reduction du ring the index procedure or early SLDA (single-leaflet device attachment).” Other recent commercially available (in select regions) Mitral Valve repair devices include percutaneous direct annuloplasty using Cardioband (Valtech Cardio, Israel, recently acquired by Edwards, Irvine, CA, USA; CE mark 2015), direct annuloplasty us ing Mitralign (Mitralign Inc., Tewksbury, MA; CE mark 2016), indirect annuloplasty using Carillon (Cardiac Dimensions, Kirkland, WA; CE mark 2009), and percutaneous chordal repair using NeoChord (NeoChord, Minneapolis, Minnesota; CE mark 2013)."

Additionally, as previously stated, nearly 50% of patients with severe MR are no t referred or denied to surgery due to prohibitive risks, and the uncertainty of benefit form s urgical repair or replacement. Percutaneous therapy provides an alternative treatment option f or these high risk surgical candidates and in those whom medical therapy is suboptimal. Edwards has developed a catheter-based technique for the delive ry of a permanent implant to the mitral valve via a trans-septal access to grasp and approxi mate the anterior and posterior leaflets, creating a double orifice and thereby reducing MR, mu ch like surgical repair and the MitraClip System procedure. The MitraClip procedure has alrea dy been shown to be a viable alternative for high risk MR patients. However, MitraClip trea tment is limited to specific anatomies, and often requires multiple devices (at least 40% of cases require ≥2 devices21, 24, 25) to treat large regurgitant jets, which adds to clinical risk and increases procedural time. Additionally, MitraClip often leav es significant residual MR as previously discussed. The Edwards PASCAL Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair (TMVr) System is designed to address some of these limitations, including: a larger implant with wid er paddles and independent Clasp control to address complex anatomies and regurgitant jets and t o potentially reduce the number of implants required for adequate MR reduction; a Spacer in the center of the implant to act as a filler in the regurgitant orifice for reduction of MR; working length that allows maneuverability even with higher septal puncture heights; ergonomic controls si milar to other Edwards transcatheter product lines which are already familiar to many interventional cardiologists."

Prior to performing any study specific activities/evaluations, except the standard assessments for this population, the patient must be thoroughly informed ab out all aspects of the study and the patient must have provided written informed consent. If local IRB approval is obtained, a screening consent form may be implemented to enable the collection of standard assessments for this population (e.g., TEE and TTE.). Data collected from screening assessments may be used to simultaneously assess the patient’s anatomic eligibility for this Study using the PASCAL repair device or ot her Edwards Clinical Studies using a transcatheter mitral repair or replacement study device. If local IRBs do not allow the use of a screening consent form, all screening assessments will be described under the applicable standard study Informed Consent Form. 7.8.2 Study Informed Consent Process The patient must sign the Study Informed Consent Form that is c urrently approved by the institution’s overseeing IRB/EC prior to participation. Failure to provide Study informed consent renders the patient ineligible for the study. Study Informed co nsent must be obtained prior to any study related procedures. It has to be emphasized that a patient's participation in the t rial is voluntary and that the patient may refuse to participate or withdraw from the trial, at any ti me, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the patient is otherwise entitled. Signed Screening Consent Form (where applicable) and Study Info rmed Consent Form must be retained by the Investigational Center for verification during on-site monitoring visits. The"

The consent forms will be written in the native language/langua ges of the patient and administered only by the Investigator or authorized designee. The Principal Investigator or delegated person administering the consent must sign and date t he Study Informed Consent Form to indicate that the purpose, risks and benefits of the st udy were explained to the patient and that their signature was witnessed. The Investigator will retain the original consent form(s), a copy will be filed in the patient’s medical record, and a copy of the Screening Consent Form (where applicable) and Study Informed Consent Form will be provided to the patient. As the Study Sponsor, Edwards Lif esciences must approve any mod ifications to the Screening Consent (where applicable) and Study Informed Consent Form prio r to submission to the ethics committee (EC)/institutional review board (IRB), and/or Compete nt Authority (as required). 7.8.3 Patient Enrollment The enrollment overview is shown in Figure 1 in Section 1.2. A patient will be considered a “patient” and “provisionally enrolled” when they have signed the informed consent form. Provisionally enrolled patients will be reviewed by the Heart T eam to assure that all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are met at which point the patient will be considered “eligible”. If a patient has signed the informed consent but are deemed not eligible, the patient is considered a “screen failure” and exit the study. Eligible patients will be screened for imaging and anatomical s uitability and if pre-procedural lab criteria are met. Once these criteria are met, the patient is considered “enrolled”. A Screening/Enrollment Log provided by the Sponsor, will be mai ntained at the study site. All patients assessed for study participation will be entered on the screening log. “Screen failures” will be recorded on the log with a failure reason. The screening of patients qualifying for this study should be c arried out in a sequential, prospective manner, such that all patients are offered the possibility of participating in the study and are therefore, evaluated according to the selection criteri a defined in this protocol.

Severity of baseline MR shall be defined as described in Section 18.0 and confirmed by the echo core lab prior to enrollment. 7.8.7 Recommended Antiplatelet / Anticoagulation Therapy Recommendations for antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy are detailed in the following sections. Alternative anticoagulation/antiplatelet regimens may be considered according to the needs of individual patients or a hospital’s standard practice; these wi ll not constitute a protocol deviation. 7.8.7.1 Pre Procedure Therapy All patients are recommended to receive aspirin (at least 75-100 mg daily) prior to implant procedure. Patients on warfarin should be asked to discontinue use prior to implant procedure. 7.8.7.2 Procedural Therapy Heparin will be administered at procedure start. During the procedure, activated clotting time (ACT) will be monitored. It is recommended that Heparin will b e administered during the procedure as needed to maintain the patient’s ACT at ≥ 250 seco nds. The sheaths may be removed when ACT level is appropriate (e.g., reaches < 150 seco nds) after implantation of the study devices. 7.8.7.3 Post Procedure Therapy  Patients without other indication for therapeutic anticoagulation should receive antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (acetylsalicyclic acid; ASA) (100 mg daily ) for at least 6 months. Additionally patients should receive a combination of Clopidogr el (75mg daily) and ASA (100mg daily) for the first month post-intervention.  In patients with other indications for therapeutic anticoagula tion treatment (e.g. atrial fibrillation), triple therapy is not recommended for the first month post-intervention."

An adverse event can be related both t o procedures and the investigational device. Complications of procedures are conside red not related if the said procedures would have been applied to the patients also in the absence of investigational device use/application. In some particular cases the event may not be able to be not adequately assessed because information is insufficient or contradictory and/or the data cannot be verified or supplemented. The sponsor and the Investigators will make the maximum effort to define and categorize the event and avoid these situations. 8.2.8 Sponsor Assessment of Adverse Events All AEs will be reviewed by the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety depar tment. Each AE will be assessed as to its relationship to the study device and/or implant procedure, whether it was anticipated or not anticipated, (based on the list of potential risks provided in section 6), and whether it qualifies as an SAE. 8.2.9 Device Deficiency and Malfunction Device deficiency is defined in ISO 14155:2011 as an inadequacy of a medical device with respects to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, saf ety or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors and inadequate labeling. Device malfunction is defined in ISO 14155:2011 as a failure of an investigational medical device to perform in accordance with its intended purpose when used in accordance with the IFU. All reported device observations, malfunctions or deficiencies for the Edwards PASCAL System are required to be documented on the appropriate eCRF.

A total of 60 patients will be enrolled in the study. This sample size is adequate to evaluate the safety and performance of the PASCAL System. Recent studi es for CE marking of novel mi tral repair technologies (listed in Table 8 below) have used sample size of 30 to 35 pat ients. A sample size of 30 patients is therefore appropriate to reasonably assess the safety profile and technical performance of the PASCAL device. The analysis population will consist of 60 patients. No site will be allowed to enroll more than 20% of the analysis population in the primary cohort. In addition, the study allows for 0 to 3 roll- in patients per site, for a total maximum of 60 roll-in patients. The overall study therefore allows for up to 120 patients: 60 in the analysis population, and up t o 60 additional roll-in patients. Table 8.

The study Sponsor will review each situation to determine when a site may start enrolling in the ITT populat ion. The PP population will be the primary analysis population for p erformance and safety assessment. The ITT population will be used for additional saf ety analysis. Subgroup analysis by etiology may be performed. For patients with mixed etiology, the echo core lab will determine the dominant etiology for analysis. 9.3 Statistical Analysis A first analysis will be performed when 30 patients complete 30-day follow-up, and a second analysis when all patients in the primary cohort complete their 30-day follow-up. A pooled analysis of all patients from the primary cohort and additional cohort will also be performed. Descriptive statistics will be presented for all primary and se condary endpoints. For quantitative variables, the mean values, standard deviation, maximum and min imum will be calculated. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean will be calculated wh en relevant. For qualitative variables, absolute and relative frequencies ar e determined. Exact binomial 95% confidence interval for proportions will be calculated when rel evant. For combined and individual clinical endpoints the survival rate (and 95% CI) will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will also be presented when relevant."

Coagulopathy A pathologic condition that affects the ability of the blood to coagulate. Examples include hemophilia, drug-induced clotting disorder, thrombocytopenia and Von Willebrand's disease Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) (STS) Diagnosis requires physician documentation or report of any of the following:  Unusual dyspnea on light exertion  Recurrent dyspnea occurring in the supine position  Fluid retention; or the description of rales, jugular venous distension  Pulmonary edema on physical exam, or pulmonary edema on chest x-ray presumed to be cardiac dysfunction A low ejection fraction alone, without clinical evidence of hea rt failure does not qualify as heart failure. An elevated BNP without other supporting documentation should not be reported as CHF Death (M-VARC 2015 Definition and Hicks JACC 2014) All events with an outcome of death will be classified to determine whether the death was related to cardiovascular (CV) or non-cardiovascular (non-CV) cause. Although categorizing the initiating or proximate cause of cardiovascular death may be difficult, major complications contributing to death should be identified. A diagnosis of non- cardiovascular death requires the primary cause to be clearly related to another condition (e.g., trauma, cancer, or suicide) . For this study purpose, all deaths that are not unequivocally related to a non-cardiovascular condition are considered cardiovascular death. CV Death The primary cause of CV death will be categorized using the following choices: o Arrhythmia and/or conduction system disturbance o Cardiovascular infection and sepsis (e.g. Endocarditis) o Device failure o Heart failure o Major bleeding o Myocardial Infarction"

Rehospitalization (M-VARC 2015 Definition and Sponsor) Rehospitalization For the purpose if this trial, rehospitalization is defined as any unplanned admission to the hospital (including an emergency department visit) for either a diagnostic or therapeutic purpos e following discharge from the index hospitalization. ER (Emergency Room) visits will be explicitly presented separately from the inpatient hospitalizations. Rehospitalizations will be classified as either: o Admission to an inpatient unit (treated by a physician in a hospital for at least a 24 hour period) OR o Visit to an ER unit (typically less than 24 hours) AND diagnostic procedure and/or therapeutic intervention Additionally, duration of admission will be indicated as lastin g: o < 24 hours OR o ≥ 24 hours All rehospitalizations will be classified to determine whether the hospitalization was related to:"
82,page_82,"EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES LLC The CLASP Study Clinical Investigational Plan Study #2016-05 Page 83 of 90 o CHF (Congestive Heart Failure) hospitalization: a hospital stay for ≥ 24 hours with signs and/or laboratory evidence of worsening heart AND administration of intravenous or mechanical heart failure therapies. An ER stay for ≥ 24 hours would qualify as a CHF hospitalization endpoint, even absent formal hospital admission, as such a prolonged stay represents a severe episode of heart failure. o Other CV hospitalization: hospitalization due for coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion, atherosclerosis, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease without qualifying heart failure. o Non-CV hospitalization: hospitalization that is not due to heart failure or other cardiovascular causes, as defined above. Diagnostic Criteria of Heart Failure The diagnosis of worsening heart failure is on the basis of: 1) Symptoms of worsening heart failure such as increased dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and/or history of weight gain 2) Physical examination evidence of worsening heart failure such as neck vein distention, the presence of a third heart sound, pulmonary rales, ascites or pedal edema, and/or hypotension or signs of worsening end-organ perfusion; and/or 3) Diagnostic evidence of worsening heart failure such as radiographic pulmonary congestion, natriuretic peptide levels greater than the upper limit of normal in the absence of conditions known to affect these values (e.g., renal dysfunction, infection), arterial oxygen desaturation or increasing oxygen requirements, and/or acidosis. No single finding is necessarily diagnostic, and classification should be on the basis of all available clinical evidence. Examples of intravenous Heart Failure therapies contributing to this definition would include: o Bolus or continuous infusion of loop diuretic agents o Continuous infusion of vasodilators such as Nitroglycerin, Nitroprusside, or Nesiritide"
83,page_83,"EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES LLC The CLASP Study Clinical Investigational Plan Study #2016-05 Page 84 of 90 o Inotropic agents such as Dobutamine o Inodilators such as Milrinone o Beta-agonists o Vasopressors such as Dopamine, Epinephrine, and Norepinephrine Also included would be other invasive or mechanical heart failu re treatments such as: o Ultrafiltration o CRT (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) o Hemodynamic assist devices including intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation or left ventricular (LV) or biventricular assist devices Treatment with intravenous antiarrhythmic medications or electrical cardioversion and/or ablation in the absence of othe r intravenous or invasive heart failure treatments would not per se constitute criteria for CHF hospitalization (but would qualify as a cardiovascular hospitalization). Similarly, a CHF exacerbation that can be managed solely by augmentation of oral heart failure therapies does not meet the pre-defined criteria for he art failure hospitalization. Patients hospitalized with heart failure meeting these criteria should further be subclassified into: o Primary (cardiac related) heart failure : this may be due to any cardiac cause, including primary LV dysfunction with or without medication or dietary noncompliance, acute MI, arrhythmias, and worsening valve dysfunction o Secondary (non-cardiac related) heart failure : when a non-cardiac primary condition is present such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or renal failure, which results in fluid overload or myocardial failure. Investigator may need to determine which diagnosis is of prevailing importance (e.g., exacerbation of COPD with bronchospasm and some element of heart failure, or major heart failure exacerbation with secondary bronchospasm). Only primary heart failure should be considered a valid criterion for heart failure hospitalization.
