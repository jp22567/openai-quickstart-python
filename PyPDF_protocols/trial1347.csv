Number:Apremilast Protocol CC-10004-SPSO-001 Celgene Corporation Confidential and Propri etary 8 CC-10004- SPSO-001 Amendment 1 Final: 30 Nov 2017Length of Study The study is designed as a 32-week study with a four-week Post-treatment Observational Follow-up visit and consists of 4 phases as described above. Please refer to Section 3for details. The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the post-treatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as pre-specified in the protocol, whichever is the later date. Study Treatments All IP will be provided in blister cards throughout the entire study. Apremilast will be provided as 10, 20, or 30 mg tablets by the study Sponsor, Celgene Corporation. Placebo will be provided as identically appearing 10, 20, or 30 mg tablets. Investigational product (IP) will be taken or ally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, without restriction of food or drink. To mitigate potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, dose titration will be implemented in the first week of this study and at Week 16 for subjects initially randomized to placebo when they switch to apremilast 30 mg BID treatment. During Week 0 (Days 1 to 7), subjects will be dispensed dose titration blister cards with 10, 20, and 30 mg apremilast tablets or identically appearing placebo tablets. The blister cards will contain all IP required for 4 weeks of treatment, with the first 7 days containing the titration supplies or matching placebo (see Table 4 : Treatment Schema for Dose Titration at Visit 2 [Week 0]) which details the titration supplies from Day 1 to Day 7 in the Placebo-controlled Treatment Phase. IP will be dispensed as indicated below: !Weeks 0 to 16: Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Treatment Phase: Apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo BID. âWeek 0 to 1: subjects will be dose titrated as described above. !Weeks 16 to 32: Apremilast Extension Phase: Apremilast 30 mg BID. âWeek 16 to 17: subjects will be dose titrated as described below. At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized using a permuted block randomization in parallel 2:1 to receive either apr emilast 30 mg BID or placebo, using a centralized Interactive Re sponse Technology (IRT). Starting at Week 16, all subjects will be switched to, or will continue with apremilast. Subjects originally randomized to placebo at Week 0 will be switched to apremilast 30 mg BID at Week 16 (see Table 5 Treatment Schema for Dose Titration at Visit 7 [Week 16]) which details the titration supplies from Day 1 to Day 7 in the Apremilast Extension Phase. Dose titration blister cards will be used for subjects switching from placebo to apremilast; dummy titration blister cards (dosing at 30 mg BID directly) will be used for subjects initially randomized to receive apremilast 30 mg BID. At all other visits during the Apremilast Extension Phase, all subjects will r eceive apremilast 30 mg tablets which are to be taken twice daily. Dose modifications are not permissible in this study.

With this sample size, a chi-square test at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level will have 90% power to detect a minimum treatment difference of 18% (38% for apremilast 30 mg BID versus 20% for placebo) between the two arms for proportions of subjects achieving ScPGA response at Week 16 (defined as ScPGA score of clear [0] or almost clear [1] with at least a 2 point reduction from baseline at Week 16). Analyses for efficacy endpoints will be mainly on the intent-to-treat (ITT ) population, defined as all randomized subjects. Statist ical comparisons will be made b etween the two treatment arms.

The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be hierarchically ranked for testing in order to c ontrol the overall type I error rate in claiming statist ical signif icance at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level. The primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects who achieved ScPGA response at Week 16 between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo, will be compared using CochranâMantelâHaenszel (CMH) test adjusted by stratification factors in randomization. Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed using the multiple imputation (MI) method as the primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses will be performed us ing the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method and the non-responder imputation (NRI) method. The binary secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint. The analysis for the continuous secondary endpoint will be performed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The ANCOVA model will use the change from baseline as the dependent variable and will include treatment group and stratification factor as independent variables and the baseline value as a covariate variable. All efficacy endpoints will be summarized by study visit for both the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32). When appropriate, exploratory endpoints at Week 16 will also be analyzed using CMH or ANCOVA methods similar to the primary and secondary endpoints. The safety analyses will be performed using th e safety population defi ned as all subjects who received at least one dose of IP. Safety will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including treatment-emergent adverse ev ents (TEAEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. Data from safety assessments will be summarized descriptively for the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Exposure Period. Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification system. All TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to IP. TEAEs leading to death or to IP withdrawal and serious TEAEs will also be summarized and listed separately.

Disease Background Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder. Plaque psoriasis, the most common form of psoriasis, is typically characterized by raised, demarcated erythematous plaques covered by a silvery scale ( Lebwohl, 2003a ). The scalp is the most frequent area affected by plaque psoriasis, occurring in up to 80% of patients ( van de Kerkhof, 1998 ). These lesions can affect the hair- bearing areas of the scalp, extending past the hair line, as well as in the retroauricular area and on the neck. The lesions and associated flaking can be visible as well as highly pruritic, causing a negative impact on the patientâs quality of life ( Kragballe, 2013; Szepietowski, 2016 ). The presence of scalp hair makes application of topical therapies or use of phototherapy difficult and inconvenient, limiting their effectiveness as well as compliance ( Warren, 2008; Feldman, 2003 ). Currently approved topical corticosteroids and calcipotriene preparations may be limited by short treatment durations and poor treatment compliance. In addition, potent topical corticosteroid therapies can be associated with side effects such as tachyphylaxis, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and hypothalamic-pitui tary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression ( van der Vleuten , 2001 ; Hogan, 1989 ). Other topical therapies, such as coal tar and anthralin preparations have cosmetically unappealing formulations, foul odor, limited efficacy, and potential carcinogenic risk ( Chan, 2009 ). Second-line therapies such as phototherapy and systemic medications have been used, however, safety and efficacy d ata from c ontrolled clinical trials for these agents is limited ( Chan, 2009 ). Efficacy data from controlled clinical trials involving treatment with biologics, such as ixekizumab has only recently been published ( Reich, 2016 ). Thus, there remains an unmet medical need in treating plaque psoriasis of the scalp, particularly in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp. 1.2. Compound Background Apremilast (CC-10004) is a specific phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor under development for use in the treatment of inflammat ory conditions. PDE4 is one of the major phosphodiesterases expressed in leukocytes. PDE4 inhibition by apremilast elevates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in immune cells, which in turn down-regulates the inflammatory response by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosing factor (TNF)- Î±, interleukin (IL)-23, IL-17, and other inflammatory cytokines, and increasing the production of anti-inflammatory mediators. In completed Phase 3 studies in subjects with m oderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis, treatment with apremilast was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple efficacy measures. On the basis of these studies, apremilast (OTEZLA Â®) is approved in approximately forty countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Apremilast remains under further clinical development for the treatment of inflammatory/ autoimmune disorders including BehÃ§etâs disease, and ulcerative colitis. Further studies within the approved indications of plaque psorias is and psoriatic art hritis are also ongoing.

Rationale 1.3.1. Study Rationale and Purpose Plaque psoriasis of the scalp is often challenging to treat. Scalp skin is also relatively inaccessible, making topical therapies difficult to apply and inconvenient to use ( Ortonne, 2009 ). Given the visibility of the lesions and the scaling/ flaking as well as the itch associated with the disease, patients with plaque psoriasis of the scalp often experience considerable physical, psychological and social impacts to quality of life. There remains an unmet medical need in treating p laque psoriasis of the scalp as currently approved topical corticosteroids and calcipotriene preparations may be limited by short treatment durations, poor treatment compliance, limited efficacy, and cosmetic appeal. As well, potent topical corticosteroid therapies can be associated with side effects such as tachyphylaxis, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and hypothalamic-pitui tary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Other topical therapies, such as coal tar and anthralin preparations, have the additional risk of carcinogenesis. Second-line therapies for plaque psoriasis of the scalp include phototherapy and systemic medications, however safety and efficacy data from controlled clinical trials for most of these agents is limited. Efficacy data from controlled clinical trials involving treatment with biologics, such as ixekizumab has only recently been published. Apremilast (CC-10004) is a specific phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved for the treatment of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthriti s. In Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, apremilast demonstrated efficacy in treating subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Furthermore, exploratory analyses performed in these studies showed that apremilast also provided si gnificant benefit in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp. This study is intended to directly assess the sa fety and efficacy of apremilast 30 mg twice daily (BID) in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp. 1.3.2. Rationale for the Study Design Exploratory analyses from the two pivotal Phase 3 studies of apremilast in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Study PSOR-008 and Study PSOR-009) demonstrated that apremilast 30 mg BID provided a treatment benefi t in the subset of subjects who also presented with plaque psoriasis of the scalp of moderate or greater severity at baseline using a six-point Scalp Physician Global Assessment (ScPGA). The 6-point ScPGA scale ranged from 0 (clear), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe), to 5 (very severe). This study will directly investigate the safe ty and efficacy of apremilast 30 mg BID, compared with placebo, in the treatment of subjects with mode rate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who achieved ScPGA response at Week 16 (defined as ScPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16), based on th e intent-to-treat (ITT ) population. Based on Health Authority feedback, this study will us e a 5-point ScPGA scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clea r), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), instead of the 6-point scale used in prior CCI&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21009009)). hh the the hh cal, cal, s currents current ly ed by shorted by sho eal.

This modified 5-point ScPGA scale is static, limited in the number of categories, and has categorical descriptions that are distinct and non-overlapping. The primary endpoint will be assessed at Week 16 as results from prior studies suggest that a treatment effect over placebo can be demonstrated by this time point. The use of placebo for 16 weeks has been acceptable in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis clinical trials. A total treatment duration of 32 weeks was selected in order to assess longer term effect of apremilast in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp psoriasis. The study will also investigate the efficacy of apremilast 30 mg BID, compared with placebo, in the improvement of itch. The data from the two pivotal Phase 3 studies of apremilast in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Study PSOR-008 and Study PSOR-009) demonstrated improvement in itch severity using a Visual An alog Scale (VAS). In this study, improvement of itch will be assessed using Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) as these are considered to have better reliability and precision, and lesser potenti al for missing values, than the VAS ( Phan, 2012 ). The first secondary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects with â¥4-point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the Whole Body Itch NRS score at Week 16. It is anticipated that approximately 80% of the subjects would be evaluable for this analysis, based on prior experience in Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009 as well as other clinical trials in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ( Griffiths, 2015 ). Eligible subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive either apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo in order to reduce exposure to placebo without gr eatly increasing num bers of subjects exposed to IP, while maintaining the statistical power of the study. Randomization will be stratified by baseline ScPGA score in order to ensure balance between treatment arms with respect to baseline severity of scalp psoriasis. 1.3.3. Rationale for Dose, Schedule and Regimen Selection Exploratory analyses from the two pivotal Phase 3 studies (PSOR-008 and PSOR-009) demonstrated that apremilast 30 mg BID provided a treatment benefit in subjects with plaque psoriasis of the scalp of moderate or greater seve rity. This study will directly investigate the safety and efficacy of this dosing regimen in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp. 1.3.4. Rationale for Choice of Comparator A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled design was chosen in order to measure the absolute treatment effect of apremilast 30 mg BID in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp. The placebo-controlled design also minimizes subject and investigator bias in evaluating the efficacy and safety of apremilast in the selected patient population (Food and Drug Administration [ FDA] Guidance for Industry E10 ).

Overall Study Design This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp. Approximately 300 subjects with moderate to seve re plaque psoriasis of the scalp will be randomized 2:1 to r eceive either apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo for the first 16 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by baseline Scalp Physician Global Assessment (ScPGA) score (moderate [3], severe [4]) to ensure balance between treatment arms with respect to baseline severity of scalp psoriasis. !Subjects randomized to the apremilast 30 mg BID treatment group will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily for the first 16 weeks !Subjects randomized to the placebo treatment group will receive placebo tablets (identical in appearance to apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally twice daily for the first 16 weeks !All subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily after the Week 16 Visit through the end of the Apremilast Extension Phase of the study The study will consist of four phases: !Screening Phase â up to 35 days !Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase â Weeks 0 to 16 Subjects will receive treatment with one of the following: !apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID or !placebo tablets (identical in appearan ce to apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally BID !Apremilast Extension Phase â Weeks 16 to 32 !All subjects will be switched to (or continue with) apremilast 30 mg BID at Week 16. All subjects will maintain this dosing through Week 32. !Observational Follow-up Phase !Four-week Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase for all subjects who complete the study or discontinue from the study early. After all subjects have completed the Week 16 Visit (or discontinued from the study), a Week 16 database lock will be performed; the primary data analysis will be conducted . However, unblinded data will only be made available to select Sponsor and Contract Research Orga nization (CRO) team member s involved with analysis of the data . All other Sponsor, site, and CRO personnel directly involved with the conduct of the study, will remain blinded to treatment assignments until the final database lock at the conclusion of the study.

Efficacy Assessments The following assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Table of Events, Table 3 : !Numeric Rating Scale Assessments Whole Body Itch Numeric Rating Scale Assessment Prior to any other procedures or a ssessments being performed during the treatment period, the subject w ill be asked to assess whole body itch and select a number on a scale of 0-10, where â0â represents no itch, and â10â represents the worst imaginable itch. The number selected by the subject will be recorded in the database. SeeAppendix C . The Whole Body Itch NRS scale has been validated among patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and a 4-point change from baseline was shown to be optimal for demonstrating a level of clinically meaningful improvement in itch severity (Kimball, 2016 ). Scalp Itch Numeric Rating Scale Assessment After completing the Whole Body Itch NRS, the subject will be asked to assess scalp itch and select a number on a scale of 0-10, where â0â represents no itch, and â10â represents the worst imaginable itch. The number selected by the subject will be recorded in the database. See Appendix D . The Scalp Itch NRS was derived from the Whole Body Itch NRS. !Scalp Physician Global Assessment The ScPGA is a measurement of overall scalp involvement by the Investigator at the time of evaluation. The ScPGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall scalp severity, the Investigator should factor in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0) and not just evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity of each sign is averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions.

Safety Assessments !Contraception Education The risks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremilast are not known at this time. Results of animal and in vitro studies can be found in the IB. All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved contraceptive options as described in Section 4.2while on IP and for at least 28 days after administration of the last dose of the IP. The female subjectâs chosen form of contraception must be effective by the time the female subject is randomized into the study (for example, hormonal contraception should be initiated at least 28 days before randomization). At screening and at baseline, and at any time during the study when a female subject of childbearing potentialâs contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant changes, the Investigator will educate the subject regarding contraception options and correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy. !Serum and Urine Pregnancy Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential (FCBP) A serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of â¤ 25 mIU/mL will be required for FCBP subjects at screening and at the Early Termination or Last Treatment Visit. In addition, a local urine pregnancy test kit will be provided by the central laboratory and will be performed at the site on all FCBP subjects at the Baseline Visit, prior to dosing. An unscheduled pregnancy test s hould be performed if the FCBP subject has missed a menstrual period. !Chest Radiograph (CXR) A CXR is required during Screening. A PA v iew is required; an additional lateral view is strongly recommended but not required. Alternatively, PA or PA/lateral radiographs that were taken within the 12 weeks prior to screening will be accepted. Chest radiographs should be perfor med as indicated by local treatment guidelines or practice for monitoring while on immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy. If such guidelines are not available/applicable, routine CXRs should be performed when clinically indicated. !Hepatitis B and C Hepatitis testing will include hepatitis B su rface antigen and anti-hepatitis C antibody.

This test result must be negative within one month prior to first administration of IP or prior completed treatment was documented. !Vital Signs, Height, and Weight Vital signs, including temperature, pulse, and seated blood pressure, will be taken during the visits indicated in Table 3. Height will be measured and recorded at Screening; weight will also be measured and recorded at screening and then as indicated in Table 3 . Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated at Screening. !Complete Physical Examination A complete physical examination includes evaluations of skin, nasal cavities, eyes, ears, lymph nodes, and respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. The complete physical examination is done at screening and at the Early Termination or Last Treatment Visit (Visit 10). !Vasculitis Assessment The PDE4 inhibitors, including apremilast, have been shown to produce inflammatory perivascular histopathological changes in animal studies (eg, rodent toxicology studies). The Investigator should be watchful for any signs and symptoms of vasculitis at all times. Any suspicion of vasculitis must be thoroughly investigated by taking pertinent patient history, doing a physical examination, reviewing adverse events, and performing diagnostic procedures, as clinically indicated. A subject with signs and symptoms of possible vasculitis should receive a thorough evaluation as described above, be managed as medically appropriate, and continued with follow-up until the signs and symptoms of vasculitis have resolved. !Psychiatric Evaluation Apremilast prescriber information (eg, Summary of Product Characteristics, Package insert) includes a warning regarding depression and suicidal thoughts. Patients with chronic diseases may be prone to depression. The risks and benefits of starting or continuing treatment with apremilast should be carefully assessed if patients report previous or existing psychiatric symptoms or if concomitant treatment with other medicinal products likely to cause psychiatric events is intended. At any time during the study (post-randomization), subjects who have suicidal thoughts or behavior should be evaluated. If the psychiatrist deems the subject not to be a risk for suicide, the subject may remain in the study, but if a risk of suicide is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from the study. If the subject is discontinued, the subject should return for the Observational Follow-up Visit. A copy of the psychiatric evaluation report must be in the subjectâs source documentation, especially if the subject is confirmed not to be at risk for suicide and is continuing in the study.

ECGs will be performed at screening as indicated in Table 3. ECGs will be evaluated by a central reader. !Clinical Laboratory Evaluations Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed by a central laboratory and as indicated in Table 3. Clinical laboratory evaluations include complete blood count (red blood cell [RBC] count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count and differential, absolute WBC counts, platelet count); serum chemistries (total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorous, glucose, total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C ], adiponectin, uric acid, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase [AST; serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, SGOT], alanine aminotransferase [ALT; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, SGPT], sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate [carbon dioxide, CO 2], blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and magnesium); as well as Hemoglobin A1C at the Screening Visit, and dipstick urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, ketones, protein, blood, bilirubin, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and urobilinogen). Dipstick urinalysis will be performed by the central laboratory; microscopic urinalysis (epithelial cells, RBC, WBC, and casts) will be performed only if the dipstick urinalysis is abnormal. Fasting is not required. However, if significant elevation of serum lipid(s) is observed, a fasting re-test should be requested to determine whether or not elevation was caused by eating. !Psoriasis Flare Assessments Psoriasis flare represents an atypi cal or unusual worsening of disease during treatment ( Carey, 2006 ). It is defined as a sudden intensification of psoriasis requiring medical intervention or a diagnosis of new generalized erythrodermic, inflammatory, or pustular psoriasis. A m ore typical, gradual worsening of plaque psoriasis would not be recorded as an adverse event (AE). !Adverse Events Details of AE reporting may be found in Section 10.1.

Patient Reported Outcomes Questionnaires should be completed by the subject after the who le body itch NRS and scalp itch NRS efficacy assessments and in the order that they are described below and as indicated in Table 3 . ! !Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) During the treatment phase (see Table 3 ), DLQI ( Finlay, 1994 ) will be assessed by the subject upon arrival at the site, after completing the Whole Body Itch NRS, S calp Itch NRS, and prior to any other procedures or assessments being performed. The DLQI was developed as a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease ( Finlay, 1994 ). The instrument contains 10 items dealing with the subjectâs skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the subject responds on a four-point scale, ranging from âVery Muchâ to âNot at All.â Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the subjectâs skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No), and if âNo,â then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being âA lot,â âA little,â or âNot at all.â The DLQI Total score has a possible range from 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst health-related quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best score. The developers suggest that the DLQI can be grouped into six subscales: symptoms and feelings; daily activities; leisure; work/school; personal relationships; and treatment. Scores for four of the subscales (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, and personal relationships) range from 0 to 6; scores for two of the subscales (work/school and treatment) range from 0 to 3. Higher scores correspond to poorer health-r elated qu ality of life. See Appendix F .

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENTS 7.1. Description of Investigational Product(s) The chemical name of apremilast (CC-10004) is acetamide, N-[2-[(1S)-1-(3-ethoxy-4- methoxyphenyl)-2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-1,3-dioxo-1H-isoindol-4-yl]. Apremilast will be supplied by the Sponsor, Celgene Corporation, and labeled appropriately as investigational product for this study. All IP will be provided in blister cards throughout the entire study. Apremilast will be provided as 10, 20, or 30 mg tablets. Placebo will be provided as ident ically appear ing 10, 20, or 30 mg tablets. Apremilast, the investigational product (IP), will be taken orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, without restrict ion of food or drink. To mitigate potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, dose titration will be implemented in the first week of this study (see Table 4 ). During Week 0 (Days 1-7), subjects will be dispensed dose titration blister cards with 10, 20, and 30 mg apremilast tablets or identically appearing placebo tablets. The blister cards will contain all IP required for 4 weeks of treatment, with the first 7 days containing the titration supplies or matching placebo (see Table 4 Treatment Schema for Dose Titration at Visit 2 [Week 0] which details the titration supplies from Day 1 to Day 7). At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized using a permuted block randomization in parallel 2:1 to receive either apre milast 30 mg BID or placebo, using a centralized Interactive Response Technology (IRT). IP will be dispensed as indicated below. !Weeks 0 to 16: Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Treatment Phase: Apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo BID. âWeek 0 to 1: subjects will be dose titrated as described above and detailed in Table 4 . !Weeks 16 to 32: Apremilast Extension Phase: Apremilast 30 mg BID. âWeek 16 to 17: subjects will be dose titrated as described below and detailed inTable 5 . Starting at Week 16, all subjects will be switched to, or will continue with apremilast. Subjects originally randomized to placebo at Week 0 will be switched to apremilast 30 mg BID at Week 16. Dose titration blister cards will be used for subjects switching from placebo to apremilast; dummy titration blister cards (dosing at 30 mg BID directly) will be used for subjects initially randomized to receive apremilast 30 mg BID. At all other visits during the Apremilast Extension Phase, all subjects w ill receive apremilast 30 mg tablets which are to be taken twice daily.

Treatment Administration and Schedule Investigational product will be taken orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, without restriction of food or drink. To mitigate potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, dose titration will be implemented in this study. During Week 1 (Days 1-7) and Week 16 (when placebo subjects are switched to receive apremilast 30 mg BID), subjects will be dispensed blister cards with 10, 20, and 30 mg apremilast tablets or identically appearing placebo for the dose titration. At all other visits where IP is dispensed, a premilast will be provided in blister cards as 10, 20, and 30 mg tablets or identically appearing placebo tablets. The treatment schema for dose titration at baseline and Week 16 is shown in Table 4 and Table 5. Blister card configurations are pictured in Appendix M , Appendix N , and Appendix O . 7.3. Overdose Overdose, as defined for this protocol, applies to protocol-required dosing of the investigational product(s) only. Therefore, for a drug to be subject to the overdose definition it must be both required and an investigational drug. In this study the only required and investigational drug is apremilast and the control arm drug (ie, placebo), he nce overdose definition will apply to only apremilast (or matching pl acebo). Other required or optional non-IP intended for prophylaxis of certain side effects, etc, are excluded from this definition. Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingestion of 4 or more 30 mg apremilast (or matching placebo) tablets in any 24-hour period whether by accident or intentionally. On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as dosing more than 4 times during any 24-hour peri od. 7.4. Method of Treatment Assignment At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized using a permuted block randomization in parallel 2:1 to receive either apr emilast 30 mg BID or placebo, using a centralized Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Designated research personnel at the investigational sites will be assigned passw ord protected, coded identification numbers, which gives them authorization to enter the IRT to randomize subjects. The system will present a menu of questions by which the research center personnel will identify the subject and confirm eligibility. When all questions have been answered and the subject deemed eligible, the IRT will assign a randomization identification number. Confirmation of the randomization will be sent to the investigational site, Celgene, and/or its representative. The confirmation reports should be maintained as source documents. During the study visits, the pharmacy or authorized study pers onnel at the investigational site will dispense coded IP kits in accordance with the rando mization number assigned by the IRT. 7.5. Packaging and Labeling The label(s) for IP may include, but may not be limited to, Sponsor name, address and telephone number, the protocol number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per container, lot number, expiry date (w here applicable), medication identification/kit number, dosing instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or CCI&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ions ions the investthe invest igi ioon nitit mmustustmmm nd investid investi ga finitnitioion wilnw i IPPintendeende as ingestingest ioio periperiod whod wh verdose is dverdose i ignmentgnment entryentry cricriytetii ve eitve eit her apher TechnoTechn loogyg igned passwgned passw enter the IRenter the a menu oa menu o f rm eligibilim eligibi he IRT willhe IRT wil of f ththe rande ran ive.

Addition al information may be included on the label as applicable per local regulations. 7.6. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal The Investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for accounting for all IP that is issued to and returned by the subject during the course of the study. The Investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of IP received, and comparing it with the accompanying IP accountability form. The Investigator(s) or Pharmacist(s) will verify the accuracy of the information on the form, sign and date it, retain a copy in the study file, and return a copy to Celgene. At the study site, all IP will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent unauthorized access. The IP should be stored as directed on the package label.Celgene (or designee) will review with the Inve stigator and relevant site personnel the process for IP return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus Celgene (or designee). 7.6.1. Record of Administration Accurate recording of all IP administration (including dispensing and dosing) will be made in the appropriate section of the subjectâs eCRF and source documents. 7.7. Investigational Product Compliance Study personnel will review the instructions printed on the package with the study subjects prior to dispensing the IP. Investigational product will be dispensed as noted in the Table of Events,Table 3. The subjects will be instructed to return the IP containers, including any unused medication, to the study site at each visit for tablet counts and reconciliation. Subjects will be asked whether they have taken their IP as inst ructed at each study visit. Any problems with IP compliance will be reviewed with the subject. If a subject misses 4 or more consecutive days of dosing, Celgene should be contacted to decide whether dosing should resume or whether the subject should be terminated from the Treatment Phase of the study, and enter into the Observational Follow-up Phase. Gross compliance problems (eg, missing 4 or more consecutive days of dosing or taking less than 75% of the doses between study visits) are prot ocol deviations and should be discussed with Celgene.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1. Overview This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp. Treatment assignment will be stratified by baseline ScPGA score [moderate (3), or severe (4)]. The objective of the statistical analysis will be to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast 30 mg BID versus placebo for 16 weeks, and to evaluate the effects of apremilast 30 mg BID as a treatment for up to 32 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp. After all subjects have completed the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16), the primary analysis will be performed. At the study comple tion, ie, when all subjects have also completed the Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32) and the Observational Follow-up Phase, the final analysis will be performed. To maintain the blind at the site and subject level, the individual subject treatment assignments will not be revealed to the investigators until after the final database lock following the study completion. 9.2. Study Population Definitions The safety population will consist of all subjects who are randomized and received at least one dose of IP (IP). Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the IP they actually receive. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all sub jects who are randomized. Subjects will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized. The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all subjects included in the ITT population who receive at least one dose of IP (IP), have both baseline and at least one post-treatment ScPGA evaluation, and have no protocol deviations which may affect analyses in the Placebo-controlled Phase. 9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations The sample size est imation is based on the results of the Phase 3 and 3b studies, including CC- 10004-PSOR-008, PSOR-009 and PSOR-010 which demonstrated positive treatment effectsbetween apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo in the proportion of subjects achieving ScPGA response at Week 16 (range 18% to 29%). Approximate ly 300 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo. With this sample size, a chi-square test at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level will have 90% pow er to detect a minimum treatment difference of 18% (38% for apremilast 30 mg BID versus 20% for placebo) between the two arms for proportions of subjects achieving ScPGA response at Week 16 (defined as ScPGA score of clear [0] or almost clear [1] with at least a 2 point reduction from baseline at Week 16). If at least 60% of the approximate 300 randomized subjects would be evaluable for the whole body itch NRS an alysis, the subset sample size of 180 subjects will provide 90% power to detect a treatment difference of 25% (45% for apremila st 30 mg BID and 20% for placebo) in the CCI&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21st BID asID as he scalp.he scalp. e primary e primary also comalso com plplm oow-w-up Phasup Pha ect level, thct level, th until after thuntil after andomizedndomize ent group cent group of f all all subjesubje ich theych they areareyy nsist of all snsist of all s vebothboth basas viatiiationons s whw and Pownd Pow ttioion n is basis bas PSORSOR --009 009 ast 30 mg Bast 30 mg B Week 16 (rek 16 (r aa apremilastapremilast 05 siignificagnific (38% for (38% for a oportioporti ons oons o [0]0]or almalm at ltl"

Background and Demographic Characteristics Subjectâs age, height, weight, and baseline char acteristics will be summar ized using descriptive statistics, while sex, race and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency tabulations. Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulations by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term. 9.5. Subject Disposition Subject disposition (analysis population allocat ion, entered, discontinued, along with primary reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency tabulations and percent for the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32). A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be provided. Protocol deviations will be summarized using frequency distributions. 9.6. Efficacy Analysis 9.6.1. Efficacy Evaluation for the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) Statistical comparisons will be made between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo. All statistical tests will be at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level and the corresponding p-values will be reported. Data summaries will be provided for the two randomized treatment arms (apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo). 9.6.1.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary endpoint is the proportions of subjects who achieving ScPGA response at Week 16 (defined as ScPGA score of clear [0] or almost cl ear [1] with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16). It will be analyzed using the ITT population. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the PP population. The treatment difference between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo will be compared using CMH (CochranâMantelâHaenszel) test adjusting for the stratification factor at randomization. The 2-sided p-values from the CMH test, the adjusted treatment difference in proportion using the weighted average of the treatment differences across the strata with the CMH weights, along with the associated 2-sided 95% CIs using a nor mal approximation to the weighted average will be provided. Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed using the multiple imputation (MI) method (SAS Institute Inc. 2008) as the primary analysis, with sensitivity analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) met hod and the non-responder imputation (NRI) method. The SAS procedure MI will be used to impute missing ScPGA scores at the scheduled assessments in the Placebo-controlled Phase (Week s 0-16) to create M=25 complete data sets. The missing data patterns will be checked by treatment and stratification factor at Baseline (Week 0), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. If there are non-monotone missing patterns, two separate imputation procedures will be used to complete the imputation process.

Number:Apremilast Protocol CC-10004-SPSO-001 Celgene Corporation Confidential and Propri etary 53 CC-10004- SPSO-001 Amendment 1 Final: 30 Nov 2017In the first step, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will be used to impute missing scores by treatm ent and stratif ication factor to create M=25 imputed data sets with monotone missing patterns. The minimum and the maximum values for imputation will be 0 and 4, which correspond to the lowest and the highest Sc PGA scores. The seed will be set to 804529, the imputed values will be rounded to integers and a single chain will be used to produce imputations. In the second step, the predictive mean matching method will be used to impute the remaining missing values for the 25 data sets with monotone missing patterns. The MONOTONE REGPMM statement will be used with seed 447159. The missing values at each visit will be imputed based on treatment, stratification factor, and ScPGA scores at baseline and previous visits. The number of closest observations to be used in the selection will be K=2. After the completion of imputation, the same CMH method will be used to analyze the 25 complete data sets and the SAS procedure MIANALYZE will be used to combine the results for the statist ical inferences. 9.6.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints For the binary endpoints defined as â¥4-point reduction (improvement) from the baseline visit in either the whole body pruritus NRS score or the scalp pruritus NRS score at post-baseline visits, the analyses will be based on subjects in th e ITT population with ba seline whole body pruritus NRS score â¥4 or baseline scalp pruritus NRS score â¥4, respectively. For the continuous secondary endpoint (ie, change from baseline in DLQI total score at Week 16), the analyses will be based on ITT population. Unadjusted 2-sided p-values and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported. In order to evaluate the onset of effect of apremilast 30 mg BID compared to placebo for itch, the following secondary endpoints are specified (Section 2): !Proportion of subjects with â¥4-point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the whole body itch NR S score at Week 16 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4-point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the scalp itch NRS score at Week 16 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4-point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the overall body itch NRS score at Week 12, Week 8, Week 4, and Week 2 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4-point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the scalp itch NRS score at Week 12, Week 8, Week 4, and Week 2 Statistical analyses for the ten e ndpoints will be performed one by one downward from Week 16 to Week 2. Multip licity adjustment is sp ecified in Section 9.6.1.3 . The binary endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint. The treatment difference at each time point between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo will be compared using CMH (CochranâMantelâHaenszel) test adjusting for the stratification factor at randomization.

Missing values will be imputed using the similar MI method as the primary endpoint, with sensitivity analysis using the LOCF method and NRI method. The continuous endpoint (ie, change from bas eline in DLQI total score at Week 16) will be analyzed based on the ITT population using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The ANCOVA model will use the change from baseline as the dependent variable and will include treatment group and stratification fact or as independent variables and the baseline value as a covariate variable. Within- group least-squa res (LS) mean changes from baseline at Week 16, the associated standard errors (SEs) and 2-sided 95% CIs, treatment differences in LS mean changes from baseline, and the associated 2-sided 95% CIs and p-values, will be derived from the ANCOVA model. Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed using the MI method, with sensitivity analysis using the LOCF method. 9.6.1.3. Multiplicity Adjustment The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be hierarchically ranked for testing in order to control the overall type I error rate in claiming statistical significance at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level. Specifically, for the primary efficacy endpoint (ScPGA response at Week 16), if the 2-sided p-value from the comparison between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo is below 0.05, the outcome will be considered statistically significant and apremilast 30 mg BID will be declared effective. For any secondary endpoint, statistical significance will be claimed only if its 2-sided p-value is below 0.05 and tests for the primary endpoint and all previous secondary endpoints are significant at the 2-side d 0.05 level. The proposed test sequence for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints is listed as the following: !Proportion of subjects with ScPGA score of cl ear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the whole body itch NR S score at Week 16 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the scalp itch NRS score at Week 16 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the whole body itch NR S score at Week 12 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the scalp itch NRS score at Week 12 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the whole body itch NR S score at Week 8 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the scalp itch NRS score at Week 8 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the whole body itch NRS score at Week 4 !Proportion of subjects with â¥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the scalp itch NRS score at Week 4 CCI&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21es es h for testing for testing the 2the 2 -siided PGA responGA respo 30 mg BID0 mg BID nt and apreand apr ical significcal signi imary endpmary end evel. vel.

Safety Analysis The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population as defined in Section 9.2. Safety will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG measurements; no inferential testing for statist ical signif icance will be performed. Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification system. Adverse events will be tabulated for the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Expos ure Phase in the study.

Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomi tant impairment of the subjectâs health, including laboratory test values (as specifi ed by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse ch ange in the frequency or intensity of a pre- existing condition) should be cons idered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the case report form (CRF) rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose CRF. (See Section 7.3for the definition of overdose.) Any sequela of an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an AE on the AE CRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported as an SAE itself. In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for apremilast overdose. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician. All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of any or all of the following parameters: the subjectâs clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings , physical examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures. All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator from the time the subject signs informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of IP as well as those SAEs made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. AEs and SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF and in the subjectâs source documents. All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigatorâs knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 10.2.1. Seriousness An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that: !Results in death; !Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is at immediate risk of death from the AE); CCIed on d on of f ththe e reported aseported as n AE shoulAE shou ose.)ose.)

Severity/Intensity For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/ intensity of the event based on the descriptions listed below. Mild !Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only !Intervention not indicated !Activities of daily life (ADLs) minimally or not affected !No or minimal intervention/therapy may be required Moderate !Symptom(s) cause moderate discomfort !Local or noninvasive intervention indicated !More than minimal interference with ADLs but able to carry out daily social and functional activities. !Drug therapy may be required Severe (could be non-serious or serious) !Symptoms causing severe discomfort/pain !Symptoms requiring medical/surgical attention/intervention !Interference with ADLs including inability to perform daily social and functional activities (eg, absenteeism and/or bed rest) !Drug therapy is required The term âsevereâ is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is notthe same as âseriousâ which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subjectâs life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations. 10.2.3. Causality The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of the IP and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below: Not suspected: a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP administration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying c onditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP caused the adverse event. âReasonable possibilityâ means there CCI&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21y out daily y out daily ttention/intttention/in nability to pability to p r bed rest)r bed rest) describe thescribe th ; the event ; the event headache). eadache). come ome or oacac ning. ning. veritrity,y, serv serv ausalityusality tigator musgator mus ence of an Ance of an A Not Not"

Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available information. Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available. If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provide the name of the manufacturer when reporting the event. 10.2.4. Duration For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the event. 10.2.5. Action Taken The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable (eg, discontinuation, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the event. 10.2.6. Outcome The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subjectâs participation in the study must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to the SAE). 10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality: !results in discontinuation from the study; !requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic intervention; or !is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing condition. Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion need to be documented as a serious adverse event. If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be r ecorded as the AE. If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be r ecorded as a medical term and not simply as an abnormal laboratory result (eg, record throm bocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).

Pregnancy All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in a female subject of childbearing potential are immediately reportable events . Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated Î²-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin [ Î²-hCG] or positive pregnancy test in a female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the sub ject is on IP, or within 28 days of the subjectâs last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable events. Investigational product is to be discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of the IP to the investigator. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by email, phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equivalent form. The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist or another appropriate healthcare professional for further evaluation. The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, or approved equivalent form. If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigatorâs knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant deat h after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigatorâs knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigatorâs knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. This instruction pertains to initial SA E reports as well as any follow-up reports. The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent. This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study (from the time the subject signs i nformed consent until 28 days after the last dose of IP) or any SAE made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured. The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary of hospital records and other relevant documents.

Any fo llow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety. Where required by local legislation, the Investigator is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE information on file including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC. 10.5.1. Safety Queries Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via facsimile or electronic mail. The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business days. Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by phone. 10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to a premilast based on the Investigator Brochure. In the United States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32. Celgene or its authorized represe ntative shall notify the Investigator of the following information !Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP in this study or in other studies that is both serious and unexpected (eg, SUSAR); !Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. Where required by local legislation, the Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects. The Investigator must keep copies of all pe rtinent safety information on file including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC. (See Section 14.3 for record retention information).

Emergency Contact In emergency situations, the Investigator should contact the responsible Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor or designee by telephone at the number(s) listed on the Emergency Contact Information page of the protocol (after title page). In the unlikely event that the Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor or designee cannot be reached, please contact the global Emergency Call Center by telephone at the number listed on the Emergency Contact Information page of the protocol (after title page). This global Emergency Call Center is available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. The representatives are responsible for obtaining your call-back information and contacting the on-call Celgene/contract research organization Medical M onitor, who will then contact you promptly. Note: The back-up 24-hour global emergency contact call center should only be used if you are not able to reach the Clinical Research Physician(s) or Medical Monitor or designee for emergency calls. 12.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opinion of the Investigator, it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject. If it is medically imperative to know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discontinued if, in the opinion of the Investigator, continuing IP can negatively affect the outcome of the subjectâs treatment. The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibility of the treating physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor. However, the Investigator may contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the interest of the subject. The Investigator should ensure that the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol. The Investigator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented by the Investigator in the subjectâs source documentation. Emergency unblinding should only be performed by the Investigator through the IRT by using an emergency unblinding personal identification number (PIN), and the Investigator should contact IRT for unblinded dose information.

REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 13.1. Good Clinical Practice The procedures set out in this study protocol pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and documentation of this study are designed to ens ure that Celgene, its authorized representative, and Investigator abide by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities. 13.2. Investigator Responsibilities Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations. Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select their staff. The Investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions, including obligations of confidentiality of Celgene information. The Investigator should maintain a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study-related duties. The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent form (ICF) and are screened for entry into the study . Subjects who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in the subjectâs source documents. The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigatorâs staff, must be available during monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study-related charts) for source data verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries. The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the exception of the information provided by Celgene on public registry websites) is considered Celgene confidential information. Only information that is previously disclosed by Celgene on a public registry website may be freely disclosed by the Investigator or its institution, or as outlined in the Clinical Trial Agreement. Celgene protocol, amendment a nd IB information is not to be made publicly available (for example on the Investigatorâs or their institutionâs website) without express written approval from Celgene. Information propos ed for posting on the Investigatorâs or their institutionâs website must be submitted to Celgene for review and approval, providing at least 5 business days for review. At the time results of this study are made available to the public, Celgene will provide Investigators with a summary of the results that is written for the lay person. The Investigator is responsible for sharing these results with the subject and/or their caregiver as agreed by the subject.

Subject Information and Informed Consent The Investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subjectâs legal representative prior to any study related procedures. Documentation that informed consent occurred prior to the study subjectâs entry into the study and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subjectâs source documents including the date. The original ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person consenting the study subject prior to the study sub jectâs entry into the study, must be maintained in the Investigatorâs study files and a copy given to the study subject. In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impacts on the content of the informed consent, the ICF must be revised. Study subjects participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented must be re- consented with the revised version of the ICF. The revised ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person consenting the study s ubject must be maintained in the Investigatorâs study files and a copy given to the study subject. 13.4. Confidentiality Celgene affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in compliance with ICH and other local regulations (w hichever is most stringent). Celgene requires the Investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws. Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the subjectâs signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate i ndividual. 13.5. Protocol Amendments Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by the Celgene Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor. Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval. Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs. The written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically reference the Investigator name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC for information purposes. 13.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review and Approval Before the start of the study, the study protoc ol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with local legal requirements. IP can only be supplied to an Investigator by Celgene or its authorized representative after documentation on all ethical a nd legal requirements for starting the study has been received by CCI&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ol is ol is Study Study re- the studythe study Investnvest igatoigato privacyivacy ananydd ost stringenst stringen necessary, necessa cords relevcords relev iver or authver or au InvestInve igatoiga st be approvt be app endments wndments ned beforened before mm the IRB/E the IRBmm tlle and ameand re do not ree do not re poses.poses. nstitutionnstitution anand Appd App e the e the start oart o submitted tubmitted t dates of issdates of iss sought. ought al"

This documentation must also include a list of the members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. Formal approval by the IRB/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number (if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be officially signed by a commi ttee membe r. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all ethical and legal requirements must be met. The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the ICF should also be revised. The Investigator must keep a record of all comm unication with the IRB/EC and, if applicable, between a Coordinating Investigator and the IRB /EC. This statement also applies to any communication between the Investigator (or Coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and regulatory authorities. Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by Celgene and the IRB/EC prior to use. 13.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board/ Ethics Committee If required by legislation or the IRB/EC, the Investigator must submit to the IRB/EC: !Information on serious or unexpected adverse events as soon as possible; !Periodic reports on the progress of the study; !Deviations from the protocol or anything th at may involve added risk to subjects. 13.8. Termination of the Study Celgene reserves the right to terminate this st udy prematurely at any time for reasonable medical or administrative reasons. Any premature discontinuation will be appropriately documented according to local requirements (eg, IRB/EC, regulatory authorities, etc.). In addition, the Investigator or Celgene has the right to discontinue a single site at any time during the study for medical or administrative reasons such as: !Unsatisfactory enrollment; !GCP noncompliance; !Inaccurate or incomplete data collection; !Falsification of records; !Failure to adhere to the study protocol.

QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE All aspects of the study will be carefully moni tored by Celgene or its authorized representative for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and SOPs. 15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after the study. All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Investigator and the staff at a study initiation visit and/or at an Investigatorsâ Meeting. Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a Celgene representative will review the protoc ol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/ SAEs with the Investigator. Monitoring will include on-site visits with the Investigat or and his/her staff as well as any appropriate communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone. During monitoring visits, the facilities, investigational product storage area, CRFs, subjectâs source documents, and all other study documentation will be inspected/reviewed by the Ce lgene representative in accordance with the Study Monitoring Plan. Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation. Any resulting discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Any necessary corrections will be made directly to the CRFs or via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified. Additional monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan. 15.2. Audits and Inspections In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance unit exists within Celgene. Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research activities in accordance with Celgene standard operating procedures (SOPs) to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for audits and inspections by IRB/ECs, regulatory authorities (eg, FDA, European Medicines Agency [EMA], Health Canada) and company authorized representatives. The Investigator should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections. If the Investigator is contacted by any regulatory aut hority regarding an in spection, he/she should contact Celgene immediately.

PUBLICATIONS As described in Section 13.2, all protocol- and amendment-related information, with the exception of the information provided by Celgene on public registry websites, is considered Celgene confidential information and is not to be used in any publications. Celgene protocol- related information proposed for use in a publication must be submitted to Celgene for review and approval, and should not be utilized in a publication without express written approval from Celgene, or as described in the Clinical Trial Agreement. Celgene will ensure Celgene-sponsored studies are considered for publication in the scientific literature in a peer-reviewed journal, irrespective of the results. At a minimum, this applies to results from all Phase 3 clinical studies, and a ny other study results of significant medical importance. This also includes results relating to investigational medicines whose development programs have been discontinued. Study results may also be presented at one or more medical congresses, and may be used for scientific exchange and teaching purposes. Additionally, this study and its results may be submitted for inclusion in all appropriate health authority study registries, as well as publication on health authority study registry websites, as required by local health authority regulations. Eligibility for external authorship, as well as selection of first authors hip, will be based on several considerations, including, but not limited to, contribution to protocol development, study recruitment, data quality, participation in data analysis, participation in study steering committee (when applicable) and contribution to abstract, presentation and/or publication development.
