13,page_13,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 13 3 INTRODUCTION 3.1 Background and Rationale An estimated 3.2 million people in the United States are currently infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Since 1990, when the US introduced screening of the blood supply for HCV, injection drug use has been the primary mode of HCV transmission in the United States. It is widely recognized that addressing the HCV epidemic among people who inject drugs (PWID) depends on increasing access to: 1) clean injection equipment; 2) opioid substitution therapy (OST); 3) curative HCV treatment; and 4) assistance with comorbid psychiatric conditions and social issues (Robaeys, C et al, 2013). Nevertheless, access to HCV treatment among current and former injection drug users is thought to be limited by several factors including: 1) insufficient number of infectious dis ease and gastroenterology providers and 2) provider and third -party payor concerns about adherence to medication and the risk of reinfection (Aspinall, EJ et al, 2013). Strategies to increase access among current and former injection drug users to direct a cting antiviral drugs are urgently needed. The purpose of the current study is to assess the impact of co -treating chronic hepatitis C infection and opioid dependence within the context of an outpatient addiction clinic staffed by psychiatrists. The partial μ-agonist, buprenorphine, is effective treatment for opioid dependence. Buprenorphine is typically co -formulated with naloxone and prescribed as buprenorphine/naloxone in a physician’s office by providers who have undergone specialized training and lice nsure as proscribed by the Drug Abuse Treatment Act of 2000. Currently, there are more than 20,000 licensed buprenorphine/naloxone providers in the United States (Anson, 2013). Importantly, buprenorphine/naloxone patients are usually required to see thei r buprenorphine/naloxone providers for a new buprenorphine/naloxone prescription at least monthly, if not more frequently, and the adherence to these visits is extremely high. Moreover, buprenorphine/naloxone therapy is often prescribed through multidisciplinary clinics which are highly effective at retaining patients in care because comorbid psychiatric conditions and social problems are also addressed. The beneficial impact of co -treating opioid dependence and an infectious illness has been demonstrated in the case of HIV infection. Altice and colleagues conducted an obs ervational study of HIV -infected opioid -dependent patients who were offered OST with buprenorphine/naloxone at 10 different HIV clinics. Subjects initiating buprenorphine/naloxone were more likely to initiate or remain on antiretroviral therapy (Altice, 20 11). The Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) program has demonstrated that with proper training and mentorship, primary care providers with no prior experience in managing HCV are able to treat the disease effectively. The ECHO project empl oyed video conferencing technology to provide specialist run didactic sessions and consultation to primary care physicians in rural areas and prisons of New Mexico. Between 2004 and 2008, 146 treatment -naïve subjects were treated at the HCV clinic at UNM, and 261 treatment naïve subjects were treated at ECHO sites. Sustained virologic response rates were similar at the academic medical center clinic and ECHO sites ( 57.5% at UNM HCV clinic versus 58.2% at ECHO sites, P = .89). At the UNM HCV clinic, 13.7% of patients had serious adverse events, as did 6.9% of those treated at ECHO sites (Arora et al, 2011) . Since the publication of the ECHO study, the treatment of HCV has become considerably less complicated due to the widespread availability of safe, highly effective single tablet regimens , such as Epclusa . We believe that treatment of HCV is now well within the grasp of physicians and other healthcare providers without training in internal or family medicine. We propose a single arm pilot study"
14,page_14,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 14 of HCV treatment with Epclusa at an outpatient addiction clinic in Somerville , Massachusetts staffed by psychiatrists . We hypothesize that: • With proper training and mentorship, psychiatrists who are also licensed buprenorphine/naloxone providers will be able to effectively assess liver health and treat chronic hepatitis C infection with Epclusa • Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection on buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance therapy who are treated for HCV by a psy chiatrist during regularly scheduled visits to an addiction clinic will have high rates of o adher ence to HCV treatment o SVR 12 Given that subjects will receive standard of care evaluation and treatment for their chronic hepatitis C infection, we believe that study participation poses minimal risk. Indeed, we believe that subjects will benefit from improved access to this important treatment which will be provided at a convenient location by a known physician under the guidance of an infectious di sease physician with extensive experience treating HCV infection . 3.2 Epclusa Epclusa is a two -drug fixed -dose combination product that contains 100 mg of velpatasvir and 400 mg of sofosbuvir in a single tablet. The recommended dosage of Epclusa is one tablet taken orally once daily with or without food for 12 weeks . Velpatasvir is a pangenotypic HCV NS5A inhibitor and sofosbuvir is a pangenotypic nucleotide inhibitor of HCV NS5B RNA -dependent RNA polymerase. Epclusa was approved by the FDA in 2016 for t he treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C infection genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. It is recommended as first line therapy for treatment naïve and pegylated -ribavirin -experienced adults with chronic hepatitis C infection genotypes 1 -6 (AASL D and IDSA HCV Guidelines, October, 2016) . Safety and tolerability data for Epclusa is based on data from three Phase 3 clinical trials (ASTRAL -1, ASTRAL -2, and ASTRAL -3) which enrolled a total of 1035 subjects who either did not have cirrhosis or who had compensated cirrhosis (Epclusa Package Insert) . Overall, 0.2% of subjects in the three studies discontinued Epclusa due to adverse events. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) during 12 weeks of treatment with Epclusa were headache and fatigue. ASTRAL -1 was a randomized placebo -controlled trial which enrolled 740 subjects with genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 chronic HCV. Nineteen percent of these subjects had compensated cirrhosis and 32% were treatment experienced. The table below lists adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the Investigator, all grades) observed in ≥5% of subjects in ASTRAL -1. The majority of adverse reactions were of severity grade 1. Importantly, each of these reactions occurred at a similar frequency or more frequently in the control arm, with the exception of asthenia which occurred in 5% subjects on Epclusa and 3% of subjects on placebo."
15,page_15,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 15 Reaction Frequency in A STRAL -1 Headache 22% Fatigue 15% Nausea 9% Asthenia 5% Insomnia 5% Co-administration of amiodarone with Epclusa is not recommended because post -marketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, as well as fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is co -administered with sofosbuvir . The concomitant use of Epclusa with P-gp inducers and/or moderate to potent CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, St. John’s wort , carbamazepine ) may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of v elpatasvir and/or sofosbuvir and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of EPCLUSA . Therefore, the use of Epclusa with P -gp inducers and moderate to potent CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 is not recommend ed. Velpatasvir solubility decreases as pH increases. Drugs that increase gastric pH are expected to decrease the concentration of v elpatasvir. Epclusa and antacid administration must be separated by at least 4 hours. H -2 receptor antagonists may be admin istered simultaneously with or 12 hours apart from Epclusa at a dose that does not exceed famotidine 20 mg BID. Co -administration of Epclusa and p roton pump inhibitor s is not recommended. However, if it is medically necessary to administer Epclusa and a proton pump inhibitor, Epclusa should be taken with food 4 hours before omeprazole at a dose which does not exceed 20 mg. Epclusa interacts with several medications commonly used by our target popu lation . Efavirenz and tipranavir/r should not be co -adminis tered with Epclusa because these HIV medications decrease velpatasvir and/or sofosbuvir levels. Renal function should be monitored in patients taking ten ofovir DF with Epclusa. Epclusa increases levels of the HMG- CoA reductase inhibitors, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. Patients on atorvastatin and rosuvastatin should be monitored closely for evidence of myopathy ; and the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg and the dose of atorvastatin should not exceed 20 m g. Epclusa should not be administered in conju nction with the following medications: − Proton pump inhibitors (other than omeprazole 20 mg as above) − Amiodarone − Digoxin − Topotecan − Carbamazepine − Phenytoin − Phenobarbital − Oxcarbazepine − Rifabutin − Rifampin − Rifapentine − Efavirenz − Tipranavir/ritonavir"

It is a combination of two medications, buprenorphine and naloxone, in a 4:1 ratio. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the μ -opioid receptor with a high affinity and slow dissociation from these receptors. In individuals undergoing withdrawal from full opioid agonists, such as heroin, buprenorphine ameliorates withdrawal symptoms by partially activating the μ-opioid receptors."
17,page_17,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 17 Naloxone is a potent opioid antagonist at the μ -opioid receptor and precipitates opioid withdrawal when administered parenterally in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists. Naloxone has limited sublingual absorption such that the inclusion of naloxone in buprenorphine/naloxone reduces the p otential for parenteral abuse of buprenorphine (i.e. by crushing and dissolving tablets or dissolving film for intravenous injection). Buprenorphine/naloxone is available as both a sublingual film and a tablet. Buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is sup plied as an orange rectangular sublingual film with a white printed logo in four dosage strengths: • buprenorphine/naloxone 2 mg/0.5 mg • buprenorphine/naloxone 4 mg/1 mg • buprenorphine/naloxone 8 mg/2 mg • buprenorphine/naloxone 12 mg/3 mg Buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets are supplied in 2 dosage strengths: • buprenorphine/naloxone 2 mg/0.5 mg • buprenorphine/naloxone 8 mg/2 mg Typical maintenance doses range from 8 -16 mg of buprenorphine with 2 to 4 mg of naloxone. The safety of buprenorphine/naloxone is su pported by clinical trials of buprenorphine (Subutex) sublingual tablets and buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual solution and buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets. In total, safety data from clinical studie s are available from over 3000 opioid -dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in the treatment of opioid dependence. The most common side effects of buprenorphine/naloxone include dizziness, drowsiness, abdominal pain, nause a, constipation, headache, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, and flushing. The sublingual film product may also cause numbness, burning, tingling of the mouth. Buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the IV route, in combination with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system ( CNS) depressants (including alcohol), has been associated with significant respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post -marketing reports regarding coma and death associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and be nzodiazepines involved misuse by self - injection. Deaths have also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine with other depressants such as alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs. 3.4 Compliance This study will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and all applicable regulatory requirements. 4 OBJECTIVES 4.1 Primary Objective: • To assess the effectiveness, as measured by SVR -12, of HCV treatme nt with Epclusa administered by psychiatrist /licensed buprenorphine/naloxone provider s during regularly"
18,page_18,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 18 scheduled visits to an outpatient addiction clinic for buprenorphine/naloxone replacement therapy and mental healthcare. 4.2 Secondary Objective s: • To assess the impact of HCV treatment on health -related quality of life among subjects on buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. • To assess adherence to Epclusa therapy in subjects administered treatment in the context of visits to an outpatient addiction clinic for buprenorphine/naloxone replacement therapy an d mental healthcare. 4.3 Exploratory Objective: • To design and assess a curriculum and mentorship program to support psychiatrists with managing HCV infection. For the purpose of this study , the curriculum will be tailored to the management of HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and treatment with Epclusa . 5 STUDY DESIGN 5.1 Treatment Plan and Regimen This is a single arm pilot study of administering HCV treatment at an outpatient addiction clinic staffed by psychiatrists at Cambridge Health Alliance . Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled and treated with Epclusa tablet once daily for 12 weeks . 5.2 Subject Recruitment Patients with HCV infection already engaged in addic tion treatment at Cambridge Health Alliance will be identified by members of the study team and/or the psychiatrist- buprenorphine/naloxone providers and approached regarding participation. Importantly, HCV status will already be recorded in the medical record as all patients are routinely screened for hepatitis C infection upon entry into the OAS program. Psychiatrist -buprenorphine/naloxone prescribers will be approached by study investigators to participate based on meeting the entry criteria as providers employed at the outpatient addiction clinic at Cambridge Health Alliance. 5.3 Visit Schedule All study visits will take place at the outpatient addiction clinic at Cambridge Health Alliance. A study coordinator employed by Community Research Initiative will conduct the study visits in conjunction with the psych iatrist -buprenorphine/naloxone provider at Cambridge Health Alliance. Subjects will complete all of the following visits: Screening, Baseline/Day 1, On -Treatment Visits approximately biweekly throughout treatment, and Post- Treatment Visits at Weeks 4 and 1 2 (from time of last dose of study drug. ) Screening assessments will be completed within 28 days of the Baseline/Day 1 Visit. The screening window may be extended to 42 days prior to Day 1 for subjects with in extenuating circumstances, if approved by Medi cal Monitor . The assessments performed at each visit are described in Section s 8.2 and 8.3."

The tablets are debossed with “GSI” on one side and “7916” on the other side. The Epclusa tablets contain the following inactive ingredients : copovidone, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose , iron oxide red, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and titanium dioxide."
22,page_22,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 22 7.2.2 Packaging and Labeling Epclusa tablets are packaged in standard 28 -tablet medication vials compatible with the M EMSCap™ Medication Eve nt Monitoring System that will be utilized as an adherence monitoring method in addition to traditional pill counts. The TrackCap® product features integrated microcircuits that records the date and time whenever the medication vial is opened. The electr onic data collected in the medication event monitoring system will be downloaded into a designated, secure d, limited access study computer for immediate review and later analysis. All Epclusa packaging will be labeled to meet all applicable requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Annex 13 of Good Manufacturing Practices: Manufacture of investigational medicinal products (July 2010) and/or other local regulations as applicable. 7.2.3 Storage and Handling Epclusa 28-tablet medication vials will b e stored at controlled room temperature until required for administration. Controlled room temperature is defined as 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit); excursions are permitted between 15 and 30 degrees Celsius (59 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). All d rug products will be stored in a securely locked area, accessible only to authorized site personnel. To ensure the stability of the study drug and to ensure proper product identification, the drug product will not be stored in a fashion other than the blis ter package in which they are supplied. Consideration should be given to handling, preparation, and disposal through measures that minimize drug contact with the body. Appropriate precautions should be followed to avoid direct eye contact or exposure throu gh inhalation when handling Epclusa . 7.2.4 Dosage and Administration of Epclusa One Epclusa tablet is to be administered once daily with or without food. Each subject will be given instructions to maintain approximately the same daily dosing interval between stu dy drug doses. For a missed dose of Epclusa , subjects will be instructed to take the missed dose of study drug as soon as possible within 12 hours of the missed dose . Subjects will also be cautioned never to double the next dose with a missed dose of study drug under any circumstances. 7.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications Concomitant medications taken within 30 days prior to screening, up to and including 30 days after the last dose of study drug, need to be recorded in the source documents and case repor t form(s) (CRFs). The following medications are prohibited during the screening period and for a minimum of 28 days prior to the Baseline/Day 1 Visit through the end of study: • Proton pump inhibitors (other than omeprazole 20 mg as below ) • Amiodarone • Digoxin • Carbamazepine • Phenytoin • Phenobarbital • Oxcarbazepine • Rifabutin • Rifampin • Rifapentine • Efavirenz"
23,page_23,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 23 • Tipranavir/ritonavir • Sofosbuvir as a single agent • St. John’s w ort, echinacea, milk thistle • Rosuvastatin at a dose exceeding 10 mg • Atorvastatin at a dose exceeding 20 mg The following medications will be used with caution during the study: Velpatasvir solubility decreases as pH increases. Drugs that increase gastric pH are expected to decrease the concentration of v elpatasvir. Therefore, patient who are currently on acid lowering therapy including Antacids (Tums, Mylanta, Maalox, Rolaids etc .), Famotidine/Pepcid, Ranitidine/Zantac, Esomeprazole/Nexium, Omeprazole/Prilosec, Lansoprazole/Prevacid, Pantoprazole/Protonix and who mus t continue acid lowering therapy must agree to one of the three acid lowering treatment regimens . − Tums as needed separated from Epclusa by at least 4 hours − Zantac at a dose no higher than 150 mg once daily to be separated from Epclusa by 12 hours − Omeprazole at a dose no higher than 20 mg once daily. For patients on omeprazole, Epclusa must be taken with food 4 hours prior to omeprazole dosing. Renal function should be monitored in patients taking ten ofovir DF with Epclusa. Epclusa increases levels of the HMG- CoA reductase inhibitors, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. Patients on atorvastatin and rosuvastatin should be monitored closely for evidence of myopathy. The dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg and the dose of at orvastatin should not exceed 20 mg. Medications for disease conditions excluded from the protocol (e.g., active cancer, transplantation) are not listed under this Concomitant Medication section and are disallowed in the study. 7.4 Monitoring Accountability and Study Drug Adherence for Epclusa The Sponsor -Investigator is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability of all used and unused study drug. This includes acknowledgement of receipt of the shipment of study drug (quantity and condition) , detailed inve ntory documentation, and detailed dispensation and excess medication return documentation Epclusa will be stored at the CRI facility in accordance with CRI SOPs, in a temperature controlled, secure, limited -access location. Epclusa will be transported to the study conduct location, Cambridge Health Alliance, in a private vehicle (i.e. l ivery or privately o wned automobile) in the direct possession of the study coordinator and in a securely locked carry -case . If any study drug transported to the study location is not dispensed, it will be returned to secure storage at CRI in the same manner. Temperature of drug environment during transportation will be monitored and recorded. Any excursion from acceptable sto rage temperature will result in quarantine from the dispensable supply. Subjects will be instructed to bring back all study drug original containers at every post- baseline study visit through the end of treatment . Study drug will be reconciled using study drug pill count at every post -baseline visit by the Sponsor - Investigator, Sub -Investigator(s) or designee (i.e. study coordinator) in order to monitor the subject’s adherence with the study drug regimen."
24,page_24,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 24 Epclusa accountability records will be maintained in order to: • Record the date, subject number, subject initials, the study drug dispensed. • Record the date, quantity of used and unused study drug for returned Epclusa , along with the initials of the person recording the information. Adherence will be further monitor ed through MEMSCap™ Medication Event Monitoring System . The TrackCap® features integrated microcircuits that records the date and time whenever the medication vial is opened. The electronic data collected in the medication event monitoring system will be downloaded via a dedicated MEMs reader o nto a designated, secure d, limited access study computer for review during the study visit and for later analysis. At every post- baseline study visit the Investigator or designee will download the electronic adherence monitoring data and review with the participant, providing adherence counseling as needed. To ensure consistent access to study drug, at baseline, a 28 day supply of medication will be dispensed along with a 28 day back -up supply. In the event that a subject misses a regularly scheduled visit, s/he will be contacted by study staff to reschedule as soon as possible, and will be counseled on use of the back -up medication supply if necessary (see Section 7.2.4). Accountability for the ba ck-up supply will be monitored at each study visit, any doses taken recorded, and the back -up supply will then be redispensed to the subject. 8 STUDY PROCEDURES The study procedures to be conducted for each subject enrolled in the study are presented in tabu lar form in Appendix 2 and described in the text that follows. All study procedures will take place at the outpatient addiction clinic at Cambridge Health Alliance. The Sponsor -Investigator must document any deviation from protoco l procedures and notify the IRB, per the IRB’s reporting requirements. 8.1 Informed Consent Prior to any protocol required procedures as outlined in Section 8, informed consent must be obtained. Patients identified by study team investigators or participating psychiatrist -buprenorphine/naloxone prescribers will be approached to potentially participate in the study. They will be given a copy of the informed consent and provided the opportunity to meet with study staff as many times as they would like, to review the details of the study, and the consent document. They may also take it home and share it with friends, family and other medical providers, as they consider participation. Once the subject feels all their questions have been answered, and study staff have assessed that they comprehend the study information presented in the informed consent document, the consent will be signed by the study subject and cosigned by the study staff explaining the study. Study staff will ensure that the process was compli ant with CRI SOP for obtaining consent and will ensure the following essential components of consent: • Process was not coercive • Consent obtained before protocol procedures initiated • Information about the study including all available options was provided in a language understood by the subject"

They will be offered the opportunity to review the consent with study investigators by telephone or in face- to-face meetings with a study investigator or study team member. I f they agree to consent, the signing of the consent will occur in the presence of a study team member, who will cosign the document. A copy of the signed consent will be provided to each psychia trist-buprenorphine/naloxone prescriber. The original will be kept in a secure, locked study file at the CRI facility. Study consent procedures consistent with CRI SOP for informed consent will be followed (outlined in detail in section 8.1)."
29,page_29,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 29 After conse nting to participate, but p rior to screening the first subject, the psychiatrists at the outpatient addiction clinic will undergo a training session with the Sponsor -Investigator which will address the management of HCV . The following topics will be addre ssed: • Pathogenesis of HCV infection • Goals of therapy/benefits of curing HCV • Pre-treatment assessment, including diagnosis of c irrhosis • Usage of Epclusa The session will be based on the teaching slides in Appendix 6. In addition, the Sponsor -Investigator will provide regularly scheduled weekly telephone support to the psychiatrists . The psychiatrists’ comfort level with providing care for patients with HCV infection will be determined by a questionnaire administered pr ior to the training session , after the training session, and after 4 months of actively treating subjects (Appendix 3) . All responses to these questionnaires will be kept strictly confidential. 8.7.6 Location of Study Activities This protocol is intended for st udy and implementation within the outpatient addiction clinic at Cambridge Health Alliance . The Community Research Initiative Sponsor -Investigator and study team will collaborate with the psychiatry team at the outpatient addiction clinic to implement the study and collect study data at the addiction clinic location on pre -specified days . All procedures with study participants will take place at the outpatient addiction clinic and at a phlebotomy lab one flight downstairs from the addiction clinic . No study -related records or study drug will be stored at the outpatient addiction clinic . For each day session of study visits at the Sub - Investigator’s clinic, study staff will transport documentation and study drug, on the day of the session, for only the subjects scheduled for visits that day. Study staff will bring blank source documentation worksheets, questionnaires, and informed consents as needed. Study staff will transpor t investigational drug securely to the clinic for the subjects scheduled, per CRI SOPs. Refer to section 7.4 for further detail on stor age and transportation of study -related medication. Upon completion of source documentation worksheets, questionnaires, and ICFs, the study coordinator will immediately transport these study documents and returned study medication containers to the CRI office for secur e storage. To ensure maintenance of subject confidentiality, the following procedures with study records will be followed: • Any documentation from the subject medical record that contains subject identifying information will be faxed from the clinic to Community Research Initiative via secure fax, for inclusion in the subject source document. These items will b e certified copies of the original faxed documents. • Informed consent documents must include patient names and signatures and in accordance with the regulations, must be original documents. These documents will be transported by the study coordinator direc tly from the clinic to Community Research Initiative for secure storage. They will be transported in a private vehicle (i.e. l ivery or privatel y owned automobile) in the direct possession of the study coordinator and in a securely locked carry -case. • To ma intain subject confidentiality, all other source documentation worksheets completed at study visits will not have patient names or identifying information. These documents will be"

Community Research Initiative will maintain and store all essential documents and study medication for this study. All study data entry into the eCRF will occur at the CRI office by trained study staff. Ong oing regulatory filing, maintenance of essential documents and monitoring of study data will occur at the CRI office and be conducted by trained study staff. 9 ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT Given that subjects will receive standard of care evaluation and treatment for their chronic hepatitis C infection, we believe that study participation poses minimal excess risk. Indeed, we believe that subjects will benefit from improved access to this important treatment which will be provided at a convenient location by a known physician under the guidance of an infectious disease physician with extensive experience treating HCV infection. Potential risks to study participation may include 1. Increased frequency of appointments at the outpatient addiction clinic for those who are usually seen less frequently than every 2 weeks. 2. Increased duration of the appointments at the outpatient addiction clinic for completion of study procedures. 9.1 Definitions of Adverse Events, Adverse Reactions, and Serious Adverse Events 9.1.1 Adverse Events An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom, or dise ase temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs may also include pre- or post -treatment complications that occur as a result of protocol specified procedures, lack of efficacy, overdose, drug abuse/misuse reports, or occupational exposure. Preexisting events that increase in severity or change in nature during or as a consequence of participation in the clinical study will also be considered AEs. An AE does not include the following: • Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, and transfusion. The condition that led to the procedure may be an adverse event and must be reported. • Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before the Screening Visit that do not worsen • Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospitalization for elective surgery, social and/or convenience admissions) • Overdose without clinical sequelae • Any medic al condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol -associated procedure is not an AE. It is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented on the medical history CRF. 9.1.2 Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event that, at any dose, results in the following:"
31,page_31,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 31 • Death • Life-threatening (Note: The term “life- threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the s ubject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) • In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity • A congenital anomaly/birth defect • A medically important event or reaction: such events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one o f the other outcomes constituting SAEs. Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised to determine whether such an event is a reportable under expedited reporting rules. Examples of medically important events include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; and development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from contaminated medicinal product will b e considered a medically important event and subject to expedited reporting requirements. Clarification of Serious Adverse Events: • Death is an outcome of an adverse event, and not an adverse event in itself. In reports of death due to ""Disease Progression "", where no other information is provided, the death will be assumed to have resulted from progression of the disease being treated with the study drugs. • All deaths, regardless of cause, must be reported for subjects on study and for deaths occurring withi n 30 days of the last study evaluation. • ""Occurring at any dose"" does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at the time of the event. Dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or interrupted temporarily prior to the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event. • ""Life -threatening"" means that the subject is at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, if it had occurred with greater severity. • Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AE's. If a complication prolongs hospitalization, it is an SAE. • ""Inpatient hospitalization"" means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospital for medical reasons, for any length of time. This may or may not be overnight. It does not include presentation and care within an emergency department. • The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms NOTE: The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs: • A visit to the emergency room or other hospital department lasting less than 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an “important medical event” or a life -threatening event) • Elective surgery planned before signing consent • Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure • Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., routine colonoscopy)"
32,page_32,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 32 • Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state that was planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases. • Admission encountered fo r another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative). 9.1.3 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance are not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) that req uire medical or surgical intervention or lead to study drug interruption, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, x -rays, vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, record the syndrome or diagnosis (e.g., anemia), not the laboratory result (i.e., decreased hemoglobin). For specific information on handling of clinical laboratory abnormalities in this study, please refer to Section 9.5. 9.2 Asses sment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Investigator or qualified Sub -Investigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causality and severity, and for final review and confirmation of accuracy of event information and assessments. 9.2.1 Assessment of Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures The Investigator or qualified Sub -Investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship to study drug treatment using clinical judgment and the following considerations: • No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug. For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (e.g., pre -existing condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication). • Yes: There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational medicinal product. It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causally related in the context of adverse event reporting. The relationship to study procedures (e.g., i nvasive procedures such as venipuncture or biopsy) should be assessed using the following considerations: • No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study procedure. • Yes: The adverse event occurred as a result of protocol pro cedures, (e.g., venipuncture) 9.2.2 Assessment of Severity The severity grading of AEs will be assessed as Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4 using the GSI Grading Scale for Severity of Adverse Events and Laboratory Abnormalities ( Appendix 4). For AE s associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality."
33,page_33,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 33 9.3 Sponsor -Investigator Requirements and Instructions for Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events All SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, that occur after the subject first consents to participate in the study (i.e., signing the informed co nsent) and throughout the duration of the study, including the protocol -required post -treatment follow -up period, will be reported to CRI as instructed. This also includes any SAEs resulting from protocol- associated procedures performed from screening onwa rds. All AEs, regardless of cause or relationship, that occur from initiation of study drug until 4 weeks after last administration of study drug shall be reported to the CRF/eCRF database as instructed. Any SAEs and deaths that occur after the Post -Treatm ent follow -up visit OR within 30 days of the last dose of study drug (whichever is longer), regardless of causality, shall also be reported. All AEs should be followed up until resolution or until the adverse event is stable, if possible. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after the 30 day period. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAEs that occur after study participation has concluded and the event is deemed relevant to the use of study drug, he/she should promp tly document and report the event for further assessment by CRI study team. CRI has requirements for expedited reporting of serious adverse events which meet specific requirements of worldwide regulatory authorities. The reporting period begins when a sub ject signs the informed consent, and ends 30 days after discontinuation of dosing or completion of the subject’s participation in the study if the last scheduled visit occurs at a later time. CRI and W IRB (or local IRB if not using the central IRB) will be notified within 24 hours of the Sponsor -Investigator’s knowledge of an event. The procedures for Investigators and study staff reporting all serious adverse events, regardless of causal relationship, are as follows: • Study staff notify the CRI Medical Monitor and Princip al Investigator via 617 -502-1799. • The study staff will complete the IRB Promptly Reportable Information Form and MedWatch 3500A. The Principal or Sub -Investigator must sign and date the form. If only limited information is available, follow up reports are required. If the Investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the investigational product but is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), th e potential relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE report. If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to the investigational product, a follow up SAE report will be filed within 24 hours of awareness. As foll ow-up information becomes available, it should be sent immediately using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization. The original SAE form must be kept on file at the study s ite. • Record the event on the AE eCRF • For fatal or life -threatening events, also fax copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents with subject personal identifying information redacted. • Additional information may be requested to ens ure the timely completion of accurate safety reports. Any medications necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded onto the concomitant medication section of the subject’s eCRF and the event description section of the SAE form."
34,page_34,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 34 9.4 CRI Reporting Require ments Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. To prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse ev ents. If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather than its individual symptoms. The following information should be captured for all AEs: onset, duration, intensity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, ac tion taken, and treatment required. If treatment for the event was administered, it should be recorded in the medical record. The Sponsor -Investigator must retain and notify the IRB with any additional information requested, notably for reported deaths o f subjects. In accordance with relevant local legislation or regulations, including the applicable US FDA Code of Federal Regulations, the Sponsor -Investigator will report all serious adverse events, including reports of pregnancies, overdose and cancer th at may or may not be associated with an adverse event to the FDA via filing of a FDA MedWatch 3500A form. Assessment of expectedness for SAEs will be determined using reference safety information specified in the Investigator’s Brochure. Gilead Sciences, Inc. will provide timeline notification of relevant SUSAR reports. The S ponsor - Investigator must ensure notification of all study staff of the contents of the SUSAR reports, and will notify the IRB/IEC of SUSAR reports in accordance with the IRB/IEC polic y. 9.5 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (e.g. clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) independent of the underlying medical condition that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to investigational medicinal product interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, X -rays, vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, record the syndrome or diagnosis (i.e., anemia) not the laboratory result (i.e., decreased hemoglobin). Severity should be recorded and graded accordin g to the GSI Grading Scale for Severity of AEs and Laboratory Abnormalities ( Appendix 4). For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the clinical severity in the context of the un derlying conditions; this may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality. 9.6 Subject Stopping Rules The Medical Monitor should be consulted prior to dose discontinuation of Epclusa unless the Investigator believes that immediate action is warranted to ensure the continued safety of the subject. Due to a clinical or laboratory event, administration of all study drugs(s) may be discontinued. There is no option for Epclusa dose reduction. If Epclusa is stopped for toxicity, it must not be restarted Post- Treatment Weeks 4 and 12 Visits must also be scheduled. Subjects who meet any of the following laboratory criteria must stop all study drug(s): • Elevation of ALT and/or AST >5x Baseline/Day 1 or nadir, confirmed by immediate repeat testing"
35,page_35,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 35 • Abnormal elevation of ALT >3x Baseline/Day 1 and total bilirubin >2 x ULN, confirmed by immediate repeat testing • Elevation of ALT >15 x ULN, confirmed by immediate repeat testing • Any Grade 3 or greater rash associated with constitutional symptoms • Any Grade 4 adverse event or laboratory abnormality assessed as related to Epclusa 9.7 Special Situations Reports 9.7.1 Definitions of Special Situations Special situation reports include all reports of medication error, abuse, misuse, overdose reports and pregnancy reports regardless of an associated AE. These a lso include reports of adverse reactions in infants following exposure fro m breastfeeding, and reports of adverse reactions associated with product complaints and reports arising from occupational exposure. • A pregnancy report is used to report any pregnancy following maternal or paternal exposure to the medicinal product. • Medica tion error is any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the health care provider, subject, or consumer. • Abuse is defined as persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of a medicinal product by a subject. • Misuse is defined as any intentional and inappropriate use of a medicinal product that is not in accordance with the protocol instructions or the local prescribing information. • An overdose is defined as an accidental or int entional administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose as per protocol or in the product labeling (as it applies to the daily dose of the subject in question). In ca ses of a discrepancy in drug accountability, overdose will be established only when it is clear that the subject has taken the excess dose(s). Overdose cannot be established when the subject cannot account for the discrepancy except in cases in which the I nvestigator has reason to suspect that the subject has taken the additional dose(s). • Product complaint is defined as complaints arising from potential deviations in the manufacture, packaging, or distribution of the medicinal product. 9.8 Reporting Special Sit uations 9.8.1 Instructions for Reporting Pregnancies Any pregnancy of a woman participant or female partner of a male study participant should be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor and Sponsor- Investigator. All pregnancies will be reported to the IRB/I EC within 24 hours of notification, and followed -up through the end of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes will be recorded and reported to the IRB/IEC. The Sponsor -Investigator will collect information on all pregnancies that are identified after the subje ct first consents to participate in the study ( i.e., signs the informed consent) and throughout the study, including the post study drug follow -up period. The pregnancy itself is not considered an AE nor is an induced elective abortion to terminate a pregn ancy without medical reasons. Any premature termination of pregnancy ( e.g., a spontaneous abortion, an induced therapeutic abortion due to complications or other medical reasons) will be reported by the Sponsor- Investigator within 24"
36,page_36,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 36 hours as an SAE to the IRB/IEC. The underlying medical reason for this procedure should be recorded as the AE term. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as an SAE to the IRB/IEC. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy out come post study will be reported to the IRB/IEC. The subject should receive appropriate monitoring and care until the conclusion of the pregnancy. The outcome of the pregnancy, whether the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study has been completed or during study participation, will be recorded. Outcomes that meet the definition of reportable to the IRB/IEC and FDA will be reported by CRI. Pregnancies of female partners of male study subjects exposed to the study drug will also be followed closely and relevant information will be collected. Monitoring of the partner will continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy. The outcome will be collected and may be reported to the IRB/IEC and FDA. Refer to the study operations manual for pregnancy information collection and reporting instructions. AEs and SAEs related to the pregnancy that affect the mother and/or the fetus will be reported via FDA Med Watch Form 3500a when the Sponsor -Investigator assesses the adverse even to be possibly associated with the stu dy product used during pregnancy. Instances of reportable pregnancy related SAE/AEs include but are not limited to: fetal death, miscarriage, spontaneous abortion, fetal adverse reaction, congenital anomaly and defect. Additional reporting of pregnancy and outcomes to the study drug manufacturer may also occur. 9.8.2 Reporting Other Special Situations All other special situation reports must be reported on the special situations report form and forwarded to the CRI Medical Monitor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the situation. These reports must consist of situations that involve study drug, but do not apply to concomitant medications. Except for situations that result in AEs, special situations involving concomitant medications will not be repor ted. Any inappropriate use of medications prohibited by this protocol should not be reported as “misuse,” but may be more appropriately documented as a protocol deviation. Refer to the study operational manual for full instructions on the mechanism of spec ial situation capture and collection. Note: All clinical sequelae in relation to these special situation reports will be reported as AEs or SAEs at the same time using the AE eCRF and/or the SAE report form. Details of the symptoms and signs, clinical mana gement, and outcome will be reported, when available. In addition to reporting SAEs and special situations to the IRB/IEC and regulatory authorities per the applicable recommendations and regulations, the Sponsor -Investigator will notify Gilead Sciences, I nc. of all safety information, including SAEs and special situation reports within 15 days of awareness of the safety information and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. All reports will be addressed to Gilead at the attention of: Gilead S ciences, Inc. Drug Safety & Public Health 333 Lakeside Dr. Foster City, CA 94404 Fax: 650- 522-5477"

Treatment- emergent data will be analyzed and defined as data collected from the first dose of study drug through the date o f last dose of study drug plus 30 days. 10.3 Data Handling Conventions Missing data can have an impact upon the interpretation of the trial data. Other than the endpoints discussed below, values for missing data will not be imputed. For the analysis of post -baseline categorical efficacy endpoints, if a data point is missing and is preceded and followed in time by values that are deemed successes, then the missing data point will be termed a success; otherwise the data point will be termed a failure. Any subject with missing data due to premature discontinuation of the study drug will be considered a failure at the date of premature discontinuation and all time points subsequent to the date of premature discontinuation if there are no observed values available. If no HCV RNA values are obtained after the last dose of study drug, the subject will be considered a treatment failure for the SVR endpoints. Where appropriate, safety data for subjects that did not complete the study will be included in summary statistics. 10.4 Demographic Data and Baseline Characteristics Demographic data will include sex, self- identified race, self- identified ethnicity, and age. Baseline characteristic data will include HCV RNA level, calculated FIB- 4 index, and Fibrosis Score on FibroSure ®. Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics: means and standard deviations for continuous characteristics such as age and frequencies/ percentages for categorical measures such as sex and race. HCV RNA level will be reported as the categories “below LLOQ” or “detectable .” 10.5 Primary Analysis The primary efficacy endpoint is SVR -12 (HCV RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after discontinuation of study treatment). The percent of patients achieving SVR -12 and its 95% confidence interval of SVR -12 will be reported. 10.6 Secondary Analysis Adherence: • Percentage of patients who miss 1 -4% of doses, 5 -9% of doses, and 10 -20% of doses and > 20% of doses and the 95% confidence interval will be reported. The percentage of doses tak en out of total doses prescribed will be reported with its 95% confidence interval."

41,page_41,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 41 • Documentation that subject meets eligibility criteria, i. e. history, physical examination, and confirmation of diagnosis (to support inclusion and exclusion criteria); • Documentation of the reason(s) a consented subject is not enrolled • Participation in study (including study number); • Stud y discussed and date of informed consent; • Dates of all visits; • Documentation that protocol specific procedures were performed; • Results of efficacy parameters, as required by the protocol; • Start and end date (including dose regimen) of study drug, including dates of dispensing and return; • Record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and including causality and severity); • Concomitant medication (including start and end date, dose if relevant , dose changes); • Date of study compl etion and reason for early discontinuation, if it occurs. All clinical study documents will be retained by the Sponsor- Investigator until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been notified. 11.6 Case Report Forms For e ach subject consented, an eCRF will be completed by an authorized study staff member whose training for this function is documented according to study procedures. eCRF will be completed within three days of the subject visit to enable the Sponsor -Investiga tor to perform central monitoring of safety data. Subsequent to data entry, a study monitor will perform source data verification for select data points in accordance with the monitoring plan within the EDC system. Original entries as well as any changes t o data fields will be stored in the audit trail of the system. Prior to database lock (or any interim time points as described in the clinical data management plan), the Sponsor- Investigator will use his/her log in credentials to confirm that the forms hav e been reviewed, and that the entries accurately reflect the information in the source documents. The eCRF capture the data required per the protocol schedule of events and procedures. System -generated or manual queries will be issued to the investigative site staff as data discrepancies are identified by the monitor or internal CRI staff, who routinely review the data for completeness, correctness, and consistency. A read -only archive copy of the case report form will be stored in accordance with the records retention requirements outlined in Section 11.5. Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap electron ic data capture tools hosted by Boston Computing Network (Harris et al. 2009). REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capt ure) is a secure, web - based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedur es for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources. It satisfies HIPAA -Security guidelines and is 21 CFR Part 11 capable, with compliance assured by the Community Research Initiative In formation Technology Department and Boston Computing Network . Data will be exported from REDCap to the statistician for statistical analysis will be de -identified. 11.7 Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability and Return All used and unused study drug supplies will be destroyed by the study monitor or designee in accordance to the Sponsor -Investigator standard operating procedures. The Sponsor -Investigator must maintain accurate records for all study drug destroyed. Record s must show the identification and"
42,page_42,"CRI 15 -05 Protocol 13SEP2017 Page 42 quantity of each unit destroyed, the method of destruction, and the person who disposed of the study drug. Upon study completion, copies of the study drug accountability records must be filed at the site. 11.8 Protocol Complia nce The Sponsor -Investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this protocol. 11.9 Protocol Modifications All protocol modifications will be submitted to the IRB/IEC in accordance w ith local requirements and receive documented IRB/IEC approval before modifications can be implemented. 11.10 Study Monitoring In accordance with regulations and guidelines, the Sponsor -Investigator is responsible for assuring ongoing monitoring of the study. The designated study monitor will have direct access to the Sponsor - Investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the accuracy of the data recorded in the eCRF. The monitor is responsible for routine review of the eCRF at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered on them. The monitor will have access to any subject records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF. 11.11 Study Auditing or Inspections Representatives of regulatory authorities may conduct inspections or audits of the clinical study. If the Sponsor -Investi gator is notified of an inspection by a regulatory authority the Sponsor- Investigator will notify the CRI Medical Monitor and Regulatory Sponsor staff immediately. The Sponsor- Investigator will make available all source documents and other records for this trial to appointed study monitors, to IRBs/IECs or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors. 11.12 Study Discontinuation The Sponsor -Investigator reserves the right to terminate the study at any time. Should this be necessary, discontinuation pro cedures will be arranged and the appropriate regulatory authority(ies), IRBs, and IECs will be notified. In terminating the study, the Sponsor -Investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests. 11.13 Finan ce and Insurance No funds have been set aside for payment of treatment of any injury or illness that occurs as a direct result in a subject’s participation in this study. No funds have been appropriated for other associated losses such as lost wages, disability or discomfort related to an injury or illness as a result of a subject’s participation in this study. In the event that a subject experiences an injury or illness as described above, they should be immediately referred to their primary care provide r for treatment. The subject will be responsible for payment of cost of treatment. 11.14 Study Report and Publications A clinical study report will be prepared and provided to the regulatory agency(ies). The Sponsor- Investigator will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3). Note that an abbreviated report may be prepared in certain cases."

However, there are no clinical studies of Epclusa in pregnant women. Please refer to the latest version of the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information. Definition of Female of Childbearing Potential and Contraceptive Requirements for Female Subjects (and their male partners) Women >54 years of age with cessation for ≥12 months of previously occurring menses, or women of any age who have had a hysterectomy, have had both ovaries removed, or have had medically documented ovarian failure will be considered to be of non- childbearing potential. Women who are ≤ 54 years of age (including those with amenorrhea of any duration) who have not had a hysterectomy, have not had both ovaries removed, and have not had medically documented ovarian failure will be considered to be of childbearing potential. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at s creening an d a negative urine pregnancy test on the Baseline/Day 1 visit prior to enrollment. They must also agree to one of the following from 3 weeks prior to Baseline/Day 1 until 30 days after last dose of study drug: 1) Complete abstinence from intercourse.
