Confident ial and Propri etary 6 CC-10004- PSOR -020 Amendment 3FINAL : 01 May 2020PROTOCOL SUMMARY Study Title A phase 4, mult i-center, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled study of the impact of apremilast (CC -10004) on qualit y of li fe, efficacy, and safet y in subjects with manifestations o f plaque psori asis and impaired qualit y of life. Indication Psori asis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory immuno logic disorder whi ch manifests primarily in the skin. It is characterized by sharply de marcated areas of affected skin which appear thickened, red, and scaly. The scalp, elbows, knees, lower back, hands, and feet are commo nly affected sites. About 80% of affected patients complain of pruri tus (Gottlieb, 1998). T he psoriatic appearance of the skin is init iated by an antigen present ing cell (APC) – T-cell interact ion leading to the release of mult iple inflammatory cytokines ( Nestle, 2009). In time, this leads to an increased rate of ep idermal pro liferat ion with impaired different iation of kerat inocytes, result ing in a thickened epidermis covered by a thickened, parakeratotic stratum corneum. Dermal capillaries beco me tortuous and dilated, and there is infiltrat ion of both epidermis and dermis with immuno logically active cells ( Lowes, 2007 ). According to a European consensus statement on the definit ion of treatm ent goal s for pati ents with plaque psori asis, mild psori asis is defined as body surface area (BSA) ≤ 10% and Psoriasis Area Severit y Index (PASI) ≤ 10 and Dermatology Life Qualit y Index ( DLQI) ≤ 10. However, patients wi th mild psori asis, as indicated by the somat ic scores, BSA and PASI, may present with disease manifestations not adequately controlled by topical therapy alone which, in addit ion, may lead to a significant ly impaired qualit yof life. These m anifestati ons can include the following: involvement of visible areas, invo lvement of major parts of the scalp, invo lvement of genitals, involvement of palms and/or soles, ony cholysis or onychodystrophy of at least two fingernails, pruri tus leading to scratching, and presence of single recalcitrant plaques. The presence of any o f the previously ment ioned manifestations alters the classificat ion of mild psori asis to m oderate to severe psoriasis in need of sy stemic therapy due to si gnifican tly impaired qualit y of life ( Mrowi etz, 2011 ). Objectives Primary Object ive To assess the impact of apremilast 30 m g twice daily (BID) , com pared to pl acebo, on Heal th-related Quali ty of Life (QOL) in subjects with manifestati ons of plaque psori asis and impaired qualit y of life at Week 16 Secondary Object ives To assess the efficacy and safet y of apremilast 30 mg BID, compared to placebo in subjects wi th manifestati ons of plaque psoriasis and impaired qualit y of life at Week 16 To assess the long- term effects of apremilast 30 mg BID, with respect to qualit y of life, efficacy , and safet y at Weeks 32 and 52 Approved"

Confident ial and Propri etary 7 CC-10004- PSOR -020 Amendment 3FINAL : 01 May 2020Study Design The study will be conducted in com pliance wi th Internati onal Council for Harm onisat ion (ICH) Good Clin ical Pract ices ( GCPs ). Thi s is a Phase 4, mult i-center, randomized, placebo -controlled, doubl e-blind study of the impact of apremilast on qualit y of life, efficacy, and safet y in subjects with manifestati ons of plaque psoriasis and impaired qualit y of life. Approximately 255 subjects will be randomized 2 (apremilast):1 (placebo) in approximately 6 to 10 countries in Western Europe. Subjects will be block -randomized to each of the 5 manifestations of plaque psoriasis. If subjects present wi th multiple manife stations, they will be allocated to the manifestation which is most severe, as determined by the subject . However, all manifestations will be assessed for efficacy at each study visit. After a 5 -day t itration wit h apremilast, subjects will receive apremi last 30 mg tablets or matching placebo orally twice daily (BID) for 16 weeks. Subjects rando mized to the apremilast treatment group will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily for 52 weeks. Subjects rando mized to the placebo treatment group wi ll receive placebo tablets (identical in appearance to the apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally twice daily for 16 weeks. Beginning at Week 16 and after a 5- day titration with apremilast, subjects initially randomized to pl acebo will be swi tched to receive apr emilast 30 mg BID for an addit ional 36 weeks (52 weeks total). The study will consist of 4 phases: Screening Phase –up to 5 weeks (35 days) Doubl e-blind Pl acebo -controlled Phase –Weeks 0 to 16 Subjects will receive treatment with eit her: Apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID, or Matched placebo tablets orally BID Apremilast Extensio n Phase – Weeks 16 through 52 All subjects will be switched to (or continue wit h) apremilast 30 mg BID at Week 16 (after a 5 -day titration for subjects init ially randomized to pl acebo). All subjects will maintain this dosing to Week 52. Post-treatm ent Observational Fo llow-up Phase 4-week post -treatment observat ional fo llow -up for all subjects who com plete the 52-week study treatm ent or di scont inue from the study treatm ent early Study Population Adult subjects ≥ 18 years of age with manifestations o f plaque psori asis and impaired qualit y of life. Length of Study The study is desi gned as a 52 -week study , with a 4-week post-treatment observat ional follow -up. Visits will be scheduled at screening (no more than 5 weeks prior to randomizat ion), Week 0 Approved"

A post- treatm ent observat ional follow-up will be conducted by telephone at Week 56 or 4 weeks after subject discont inues from the study treatm ent. The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the post-treatm ent follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is requi red for primary, secondary , and/or expl oratory analysis, as pre -specified in the protocol, whichever i s the l ater date. Study Treatments Subjects will be dispensed blister cards with 10, 20, and 30 mg apremilast tablets, or ident ically appearing placebo, f or the dose titration, at the baseline visit (Week 0). The treatment schema for dose ti tration at Baseline is shown in Appendix P . Starti ng at Week 16, all subjects will be switched to, or will continue with, apremilast. Subjects originally rando mized to placebo at Week 0 will be switched to apremilast at Week 16. Dose titration blister cards will be used for subjects switching from p lacebo to apremilast; blister cards with dummy ti tration (dosing at 30 mg BID direct ly) will be used for subjects originally rando mized to apremilast. Beginning wit h the Week 20 visit, all subjects will receive open label high-densit y polyethylene (HDPE) b ottles of investi gational product (IP) tablets. All subjects will maintain this dosing through Week 52. Apremilast tablets will be taken orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, through the last treatm ent visi t. Overview of Key Efficacy Assessme nts Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥ 4-point reduction fro m baseline in the DLQI in subjects receiving apremilast compared to placebo at Week 16.

Assuming a placebo DLQI Responder proportion of 0.50 at Week 16, a minimum total sample size of 210 subjects (140 allocated to apremilast 30 mg and 70 allocated to placebo) is needed to detect a 0.20 difference in the DLQI Responder proportions between apremilast and placebo with at least 0.80 7power using a two- sided test at the 0.05 level o f significance. This sample size calculat ion was determined using the commercial software EaST, Version 6.3. Allowing for a n 18% di scontinuati on rate pri or to Week 16, the sample size was revised from a total of 210 subjects to a final sample size of 255. The primary analysis for the primary endpoint at Week 16 will be the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for the stratificat ion factor at rando mizat ion (ie, the 5 m anifestati on ty pes). This form of the CMH test will use t he sample sizes in each of the strata as weights when estimat ing the adjusted difference in the treatment proportions, constructing 95% Wald confidence intervals for the difference, and conducting a statist ical test of no difference between the treatment p roporti ons ( ie, H 0: πAPR– πPBO= 0 as the null hypothesis). All reasonable attempts will be made to prevent missing data from occurring in this study , especially at Week 16. However, in the case of missing data at Week 16 a mult iple imputation (MI) m ethod will be incorporated into the primary analysis. The aim of the mult iple imputation approach i s to incorporate a representative rando m sample in place o f the missing data such that unbiased est imation and valid statist ical inferences ( ie, confidence inter vals and hypothesis testing) can be made.

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Disease Background Psori asis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory immuno logic disorder whi ch manifests primarily in the skin. It is characterized by sharply demarcated areas of affected skin which appear thickened, red, and scaly. The scalp, elbows, knees, lower back, hands, and feet are commo nly affected sites. About 80% of affected patients complain of pruritus ( Gottlieb, 1998 ). The psoriatic appearance of the skin is init iated by an antigen present ing cell (APC) – T-cell interact ion leading to the release of mult iple inflammatory cytokines ( Nestle, 2009). In time, this leads to an increa sed rate of epidermal pro liferat ion with impaired different iation of kerat inocytes, result ing in a thickened epidermis covered by a thickened, parakeratotic stratum corneum. Dermal capillaries beco me tortuous and dilated, and there is infiltrat ion of both epidermis and dermis with immuno logically active cells ( Lowes, 2007 ). According to a European consensus statement on the definit ion of treatm ent goal s for pati ents with plaque psori asis, mild psori asis is defined as body surface area (BSA) ≤ 10% and Psoriasis Area Severit y Index (PASI) ≤ 10 and Dermatology Life Qualit y Index (DLQI) ≤ 10. However, patients wi th mild psori asis, as indicated by the somat ic scores, BSA and PASI, may present with disease manifestations not adequately controlled by topical therapy alone which, in addit ion, may lead to a significant ly impaired quali ty of life. These m anifestati ons can include the following: involvement of visible areas, invo lvement of major parts of the scalp, invo lvement of genitals, involvement of palms and/or soles, ony cholysis or onychodystrophy of at least two fingernails, pruri tus leading to scratching, and presence of single recalcitrant plaques. The presence of any o f the previously mentioned manifestations may alter the cl assificat ion of mild psoriasis to moderate to severe psoriasis in need of systemic therapy due to si gnifi cantly impai red quali ty of life ( Mrowi etz, 2011 ). 1.2. Compound Background Apremilast (CC -10004) i s a specific phosphodiesterase ty pe 4 (PDE4) inhibitor under development for use in the treatment of inflammatory condi tions. PDE4 is one of the major phosphodiesterases expressed in leukocy tes. PDE4 inhibit ion by apremilast elevates cy clic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in immune cells, which in turn down -regul ates the inflammatory response by reducing the expressio n of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, interleukin (IL) -23, IL -17, and other inflammatory cytokines, and increasing the production of ant i-inflammatory mediators. In com pleted Phase 3 studi es in subjects with moderate to severe plaque p soriasis and active psori atic arthrit is, treatment with apremilast was associated with statist ically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in mult iple efficacy measures. On the basis of these studies, apremil ast (OTEZLA) i s approved wi thin Eur ope for the treatm ent of m oderate to severe chronic plaque psori asis in pat ients who failed to respond to or who have a contraindicat ion to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including cyclosporine, methotrexate or psoralens and long-wave ul traviolet radiat ion (PUVA) and alone or in co mbination wit h disease -modifying antirheumat ic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of active psoriat ic arthrit is in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD.

Further studies within the approved indicat ions of plaque psori asis and psori atic arthrit is are als o ongoing. Please refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed informat ion concerning the available pharmaco logy, toxi cology, drug m etabo lism, clinical studies, and adverse event profile of the investigat ional product (IP). 1.3. Rationale 1.3.1. Study Ration ale and Purpose Psori asis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory immuno logic disorder whi ch manifests primarily in the skin. It is characterized by sharply demarcated areas of affected skin which appear thickened, red, and scaly. The scalp, elbows, knees, lowe r back, hands, and feet are commo nly affected sites. About 80% of affected patients complain of pruritus ( Gottlieb, 1998). The psoriatic appearance of the skin is init iated by an APC – T-cell interact ion leading to the release of multiple inflammatory cytokines ( Nestle, 2009 ). In time, this leads to an increased rate of epidermal proliferat ion with impaired different iation of keratinocytes, result ing in a thickened epidermis covered by a thickened, parakeratotic stratum corneum. Dermal capillaries beco me tortuous and dilated, and there is infiltrat ion of both epidermis and dermis wit h immuno logically active cells ( Lowes, 2007 ). According to a European consensus statemen t on the definit ion of treatm ent goal s for pati ents with plaque psori asis, mild psori asis is defined as BSA ≤ 10% and PASI ≤ 10 and DLQI ≤ 10. However, many pat ients may present wi th BSA ≤ 10% and PASI ≤ 10 but due to the presence of disease manifestations that are difficult to control with topical therapy alone, may have a significant ly impaired qualit y of life (DLQI > 10). These manifestations can include the following: invo lvement of visible areas, invo lvement of major parts of the scalp, invo lvement of genitals, invo lvement of palms and/or soles, ony cholysis or ony chodystrophy of at least two, fingernails, pruritus leading to scratching, and presence of single recalcitrant plaques. The presence of any of the previ ously mentioned manifestati ons may alter the classificat ion of mild psori asis to m oderate to severe psoriasis in need of sy stemic therapy due to si gnificantly impaired qualit y of life ( Mrowi etz, 2011 ). 1.3.2. Rationale for the Study Design This is a Phase 4, mult i-center, r andomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to assess the impact of apremilast on healt h-related qualit y of life, efficacy, and safet y in pat ients with manifestations of plaque psoriasis and impaired qualit y of life. The primary endpoint in this study is the proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥ 4-point change in the DLQI at Week 16 compared to pl acebo. The study populati on will be very heterogeneous and consist of subjects with a variet y of clinical manifestati ons of psori asis, such as scalp, nail, palmoplantar, and genital psoriasis and lesio ns in visible locations. Commo n among pat ients with any o f these manifestations is a high impairment in Qualit y of Life ( QOL); therefore, assessing the proportion of subjects who achieve a minimal clinically imp ortant difference in the DLQI is clinically meaningful. Alt hough the DLQI is the gold standard QOL assessment in psoriasis and other derm atologic diseases, as a patient -reported outcome, it is often associated with a high placebo Approved"

OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Study Design This is a Phase 4, mult i-center, randomized, placebo -controlled, doubl e-blind study of the impact of apremilast on qualit y of life, efficacy, and safety in subjects with manifestations o f plaque psori asis and impaired qualit y of life. Approximately 255 subjects will be randomized 2 (apremilast):1 (placebo) in approximat ely 6 to 10 countries in Western Europe. Subjects will be block -randomized to each of the manifestations of psori asis (scalp psoriasis, nail psoriasis, palmoplantar psoriasis, genital psoriasis, and psoriasis in visible locat ions). If subjects present with multiple manifestations, they will be allocated to the manifestation which is most severe, as determined by the subject . However, all manifestations will be assessed for efficacy at each study visit. After a 5 -day t itration wit h apremilast, subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets or matching placebo orally twice daily (BID) for 16 weeks. Subjects rando mized to the apremilast treatment group will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily for 52 weeks. Subjects rando mized to the placebo tre atment group will receive placebo tablets (identical in appearance to the apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally twice daily for 16 weeks. Beginning at Week 16 and after a 5- day titration with apremilast, subjects initially randomized to pl acebo will be swi tched to receive apremilast 30 mg BID for an addit ional 36 weeks (52 weeks total). The study will consist of 4 phases: Screening Phase –up to 5 weeks (35 days) Doubl e-blind Pl acebo -controlled Phase –Weeks 0 to 16 Subjects will receive treatment with eit her apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID, or matched placebo tablets orally BID Apremilast Extensio n Phase – Weeks 16 through 52 All subjects will be switched to (or continue wit h) apremilast 30 mg BID at Week 16 (after a 5 -day titration for subjects init ially randomized to pl acebo). All subjects will maintain this dosing through Week 52. Post-treatm ent Observational Fo llow-up Phase 4-week post -treatment observat ional fo llow -up phase for all subjects who complete the study on treatm ent or di scontinue from the st udy treatm ent early After all subjects complete the Week 16 Visit (or discontinue prematurely fro m the study ), selected members of the Amgen study team and external partner who do not have direct interact ion with subjects will be unblinded for the analysi s of the Week 16 data.

Efficacy Assessments The fo llowing assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Table of Events, Table 3. 6.4.1. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) The DLQI (Finla y, 1994 ) will be assessed by the subject upon arrival at the site before any other procedures or assessments are performed. The DLQI was developed as a simple, compact, and practical quest ionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limit ations rel ated to the impact of skin disease ( Finla y, 1994 ). The instrum ent con tains 10 i tems pertaining to the subject’s skin. Wit h the except ion of Item Number 7, the subject responds on a four -point scale, ranging fro m “Very Much” to “ Not at All.” Item Number 7 is a mult i-part i tem, the first part of which ascertains whether the subject’s skin prevented them fro m working or studying (Yes or No), and if “No,” then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has Approved"

The develope rs suggest that the DLQI can be grouped into six subscales: symptoms and feelings, daily activit ies, leisure, work/school, personal relationships, and treatment. Scores for four of the subscales (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, and person al relationships) range from 0 to 6; scores for two of the subscales (work/school and treatm ent) range fro m 0 to 3. Higher scores correspond to poorer qualit y of life. See Appendix B . 6.4.2. Static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA) of Visible Locations The sPGA is the assessment by the Investi gator of the overall disease severit y at the time of evaluat ion. The sPGA is a 5- point scale ranging fro m 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severit y of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevat ion. In this study , sPGA is used to evaluate psori asis only in visible locations , defined as dorsal hand, face, neck and hairline . When making the assessment of overall severit y, the invest igator should factor in areas that have already been cleared (i e, have scores of 0) and not just evaluate remaining l esions for severi ty, ie, the severi ty of each sign is averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesio ns. In the event of different severit ies across disease signs, the si gn that i s the predominant feature of the disease should be used to help determine th e sPGA score. See Appendix C for grading criteria. 6.4.3. Scalp Physician Global Assessment (ScPGA) The ScPGA will assess scalp invo lvement. See Appendix D for grading criteria. The 5-point ScPGA scale ranges fro m 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe). 6.4.4. Nail Assessments/Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) The number of fingers wit h psoriasis nail invo lvement, defined as onycho lysis and onychodystrophy ,will be counted. The N APSI will assess one target thumb nail or fingernail representing the worst nail psori asis invo lvement at Baseline. See Appendix E for grading criteria. 6.4.5. Modified static Physicians Global Assessment of Genitalia (Modified sPGA- G) The m odified sPGA -G is the assessment by the Investi gator of the overall disease severit y at the time of evaluat ion of the genital regions. The assessment area includes the vulvar region in women, fro m the clitoral prepuce to the perineum, and the penis , scrotum , and perineum in men. It does not include the pubis, inguinal fo lds, peri -anal region, or gl uteal cleft; however, in this study , the assessment will be modified to also include the peri -anal region and gl uteal cleft. As wi th the sPGA, i t is a 5 -point scale, rangi ng from 0 (cl ear) to 4 (severe) . Note that not all three individual features will always be present on evaluat ion.

Appendix F . 6.4.6. Palmoplantar Psoriasis Physicians Global Assessment (PPPGA) The PPPGA is the assess ment by the Invest igator of the overall disease severit y at the time of evaluat ion of palms and so les (Leonardi, 2007 ). The scale ranges from ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). See Appendix G . 6.4.7. Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) The Itch NRS is a single -item patient-reported outcome that asks subjects to assess the worst severit y of itch over the past 24 hours. Subjects indicate itch severit y by circling the number that best describes the worst leve l of itching due to psoriasis in the past 24 hours on an 11- point scale anchored at 0, represent ing ‘no itching’ and 10, represent ing ‘worst itch imaginable’ ( Naegeli, 2015 ). See Appendix H . 6.4.8. Skin Discomfort/Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) The subject will be asked to place a vertical stroke on a 100 mm VAS on which the left-hand boundary represents no skin discomfort/pain, and the right -hand boundary represents skin discomfort/pain as severe as can be imagined. The distance from the mark to the left -hand boundary will be recorded. See Appendix I . 6.4.9. Body Surface Area (BSA) Body surface area is a m easurement of invo lved skin. The overall BSA affected by psori asis is estimated based on the palm area o f the subject’s hand (ent ire palmar surface or “handprint”), which equates to approximately 1% of total BSA. 6.4.10. Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) The PASI will be determined for all subjects throughout the study . The PASI calculat ion is described in Appendix J . The PASI is a measure of psoriat ic disease severit y taking into account qualitat ive lesion characteri stics (ery thema, thi ckness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regio ns. The PASI is a validated instrument that has beco me standard in clinical trials for psoriasis. The PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflect ing greater disease severit y (Fredrikss on, 1978 ). Ery thema, thi ckness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regio ns of the body : head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of invo lvement on each of the 4 anatomic regio ns is scored on a scale of 0 (no invo lvement) to 6 (90% to 100% invo lvement). The total qualitat ive score (sum o f erythema, thi ckness, and scaling scores) is mult iplied by the degree of invo lvement for each anatomic regio n and then mult iplied by a constant. These values for each anat omic region are summed to yield the PASI score. Approved"

Patient Benefit Index (PBI) The PBI is a validated patient -reported instrument to assess patient -relevant benefit s of psori asis treatm ent (Feuerhahn, 2012 ). Pri or to starting th erapy , subjects are asked to assess their treatment expectations by co mpleting the Patient Needs Questionnaire (PNQ) (See Appendix K ). After a peri od of treatment, subjects are then asked to assess the benefit s of treatment by completing the Patient Benefit Quest ionnaire (PBQ) (See Appendix L ). The Pati ent Benefi t Index represents the subject benefit s realized as a funct ion of most important subject needs. The PBI score ranges from 0 (no benefit) t o 4 (m aximum benefit). 6.4.12. The European Quality of Life 5- Dimension Questionnaire (EQ -5D) EQ-5D (The EuroQol Group, 1990) measures the subject’s general health state as a vertical VAS and 5 qualit y of life do mains as mult iple-choice quest ions: m obilit y, self-care, m ain act ivity (work, study , housework, family/leisure act ivities), pain/ disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on, the combinat ion of which generates 243 possible healt h states. See Appendix M . 6.4.13. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Psoriasis (WPAI: PSO) The WPAI: PSO questionnaire is a validated, 6 -item self-administered instrum ent used to assess the impact of disease on work productivit y in psori asis due to general healt h or a specified healt h probl em (Reilly, 2012 ; Appendix N ). 6.4.15.

Psychiatric Evaluation Treatment with apremilast is associated with an increase in ad verse react ions of depressio n. Before using apremilast in subjects with a history of depressio n and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior , the Invest igator should carefully weigh the risks and benefit s of treatment with apremilast in such patients. Subjects shoul d be advised of the need to be alert for t he emergence or worsening o f depressio n, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to con tact the Invest igator . If a patient suffers fro m new or worsening psychiatric symptoms, or suicidal ideat ion is ident ified, it is reco mmende d todiscont inue the subject participation to the study . Subjects who are identified by the Invest igator as having attempted suicide must be immediately withdrawn from the study (see Secti on11). 6.5.5. Severe Diarrhea, Nausea and Vomiting There have been post -marketing reports of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vo miting associ ated wi th the use of apremilast. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases, patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medicat ions that can lead to volume deplet ion or hypotension may be at a hi gher risk of complicat ions.Subjects shoul d be m onitored f or severe diarrhea, nausea and vo miting.If patients develop severe di arrhoea, nausea, or vomiting, discont inuat ion of treatment may be necessary (see Section11). 6.5.6.

Method of Treatment Assignment After the informed consent is signed, subjects will be assigne d a subject i dentificat ion number using a centralized interactive response techno logy (IRT). At the Baseline Visit, a centralized schema will be applied to assign subjects who meet the eligibilit y criteria in a 2:1 rati o to receive either apremilast 30 m g tablets orally BID or identically -appearing pl acebo tabl ets using the IRT. Subjects will be block -rando mized to each of the manifestations of plaque psoriasis specified in the protocol. If subjects present with mult iple manifestations, they will be all ocated to the manifestation which is most severe, as determined by the subject at the screening and baseline visits. However, all manifestations will be assessed for efficacy at each study visit. Designated research personnel at the invest igational sites will be assigned password protected, coded i dentification numbers, which gives them authorizat ion to enter the IRT to rando mize subjects. The system will present a menu of quest ions by which the research center personnel will ident ify the subject and confirm subject eligibilit y. When all questions have been answered and the subject deemed eligible, the IRT will assign a rando mizat ion identificat ion number. Confirmation o f the randomization will be sent to the invest igational site, Amgen , and/or i ts representa tive. The confirmat ion reports should be maintained as source documents.

Overdose Overdose, as defined for this protocol, applies to protocol -requi red dosing of the invest igational product(s) (IPs) only . Therefore, for a drug to be subject to the overdose definit ion it must be both required and an investigational drug. In this study the only required and investi gational drug i s apremilast and the control arm drug ( ie, placebo), hence overdose definit ion will apply to only apremilast (or m atching pl acebo).

Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingest ion of 4 or more 30 mg apremilast (or matching placebo) tablets in any 24 -hour peri od, whether by accident or intentionally . On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as dosing more than 4 times during any 24 -hour peri od. Adverse Events associated with an overdose must be co llected on the Adverse Events page of the eCRF ( see Secti on10.1) for all overdosed subjects, but the overdose itself is not conside red an AE.

Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures Subjects m ay take any medicat ion that i s not restricted by the protocol and woul d not be expected to i nterfere wi th the conduct of the study or affect asses sments. Chronic medicat ion shoul d be dosed on a stable regimen. All medications (prescript ion and non -prescripti on), treatments, and therapies taken by the subject from signing the informed consent throughout their entire participation in the study , includ ing those init iated prior to signing the informed consent and continued through the start of the study , must be recorded on the subject’s source document and on the appropriate page of the eCRF. The dose, unit, frequency, route, indicat ion, the date the me dicati on was started, and the date the medication was stopped (if not ongoing) must be recorded. During the study , the init iation of new conco mitant m edicat ions or a change of exist ing concomitant medicat ions may potentially indicate the presence of a new adverse event or the worsening of an exist ing condit ion. If appropriate, such events should be recorded in the eCRF. The fo llowing topi cal therapies will be permitted throughout the study : Unmedicated skin mo isturizers will be permitted for body lesions only. Permi tted skin m oisturizers may not contain urea or salicylic acid. 8.2. Concomitant Medications Not Recommended Co-administration of the strong cy tochrom e P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme inducer, rifampicin, resul ted in a reducti on of systemic exposure of apremilast, which may result in a loss of efficacy of apremilast. Therefore, the use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (eg ,rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, pheny toin and St. John’s Wort) with apremilast is not recommended during the study . 8.3.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1. Overview The obj ective o f this study is to eval uate the healt h-related qualit y of life, efficacy, and safet y of apremilast compared to placebo, for 16 weeks, and evaluate the long -term effects of apremilast on qualit y of life, efficacy , and safet y for up to 52 weeks in subjects wit h manifestations of plaque psori asis and impaired qualit y of life. 9.2. Study Population Definitions Four analysis populations will be defined for this study . These popul ations include the safet y popul ation, the intent to treat (ITT) populat ion, the per protocol (PP) populat ion, and the apremilast exposure populat ion. The Safet y popul ation will consist of all subjects who are randomized and receive at least one dose of investigational product (IP). This set of subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the IP they actually receive. This will be th e popul ation for all safet y analyses on data from the Placebo -controlled Phase. The ITT population will consist of all subjects who are randomized. This will be the primary popul ation for the primary endpo int and all other qualit y of life and efficacy analyses. Baseline summaries will also be based on the ITT populat ion. The PP populat ion will consist of all subjects who are in the ITT populat ion, complete the Placebo -controlled Phase, and have no major protocol vio lations. The PP popul ation will only be used to suppl ement the primary endpoint ITT analysis. The apremilast ( APR )exposure populat ion will consist of only those subjects who receive at least one dose of apremilast treatment. The APR exposure populat ion will only be used for the purposes of safet y reporting including all safet y data during apremilast treatment. 9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations Using an exploratory analysis on a subset of subjects meet ing the fo llowing cri teria: 1) ScPGA ≥ 3 at baseline or 2) NAPSI ≥ 1 at baseline or PPPGA ≥ 3 at baseline and DLQI ≥ 10 at baseline in the PSOR -008 and PSOR -009 P hase 3 studies, it was est imated that the proportion of subjects who achieved a ≥ 4-poin t reducti on from baseline in DLQI was 0.50 (97 responders out of 193 subjects) and 0.83 (337 respond ers out of 406 subjects) for placebo and apremilast 30 mg , respectively . Assuming a placebo DLQI Responder proportion of 0.50 at Week 16, a minimum total sample size of 210 subjects (140 allocated to apremilast 30 mg and 70 allocated to placebo) is needed to detect a 0.20 difference in the DLQI Responder proportions between apremilast and placebo with at least 0.807 power using a two -sided test at the 0.05 level o f significance. This sample size calculat ion is based on an unpooled variance, and was determi ned using the commercial software EaST, Version 6.3. Allowing for a 18% discont inuation rate prior to Week 16, the sample size was revised from a total of 210 subjects to a final sample size of 255. If there are no discontinuat ions pri or to Week 16, then t he power with a sample size of 255 subjects would Approved"

Hence when addressing missing data due to discont inuat ions wi th multiple imputati ons, we woul d expect the power to be in between the bounds of 0.807 (based on 210 subjects) and 0.872 (bas ed on 255 subjects), as the analysis that incorporates mult iple imputation under a missing at random assumpt ion will always be more efficient compared to the observed analysis when the missing data is actually m issing completely at random. 9.4. Background and D emographic Characteristics Subjects’ age, height, weight, and baseline characterist ics will be summarized using descript ive statist ics, while sex, race, and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency tabul ations. The disease characterist ics at baseline will also be summarized using appropriate descript ive statistics. These descript ive statist ics will be summarized by the randomized treatm ent group using the ITT populat ion. 9.5. Subject Disposition The distribut ion of enrollment by site will be provided. Subject disposit ion (analysis populat ion allocat ion, entered, completed, discont inued, along with primary reason for discont inuat ion) will be summarized using frequency and percent for the Placebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the apremila st Ex tension Phase (Weeks 16 to 52). Protocol deviat ions will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions. 9.6. Efficacy Analysis Statistical co mpar isons will be made between apremilast and placebo at Week 16. The statist ical test on the primary endpoint will be at a 2 -sided 0.05 si gnificance level wit h treatment effect estimates and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) b eing reported. Any p -values reported other than for the primary endpoint analysis will be considered as summary statist ics. Descript ive statistic summaries for the observed data will also be provided by visit and rando mized treatment group. 9.6.1. Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥ 4 point reduction fro m baseline in DLQI at Week 16. It will be analyzed using the ITT populat ion. However, a supplemental analysis will be performed using the PP populat ion. The primary analysis for the primary endpo int at Week 16 will be the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for the stratificat ion factor at rando mizat ion (ie, the 5 difficult to treat manifestation ty pes). This form of the CMH test will use the sample sizes in ea ch of the strata as weights when est imating the adjusted difference in the treatment proportions, constructing 95% Wald confidence intervals for the difference, and conducting a statist ical test of no difference between the treatment proportions ( ie, H 0: πAPR– πPBO= 0 as the null hypothesis). All reasonable attempts will be made to prevent missing data from occurring in this study , especially through Week 16. However, in the case of missing data at Week 16 a mult iple imputati on (MI) m ethod will be incorporated i nto the primary analysis. Im putati ons will be made on the continuous- like scale o f the total DLQI score, and then dichotomized according to the primary endpoint definit ion prior to performing the CMH analysis.

ADVERSE EVENTS 10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study . It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury , or any concomi tant impai rment of the sub ject’s healt h, including laboratory test val ues (as specified by the cri teria in Secti on 10.3), regardl ess of eti ology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensi ty of a pre - exist ing condit ion) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE/SAE page of the eCRF rather than the i ndividual signs or symptoms o f the diagnosis or syndro me. Abuse, wi thdrawal , sensi tivity, or toxicit y to an investigational product should be reported as an AE. Overdose, accidental or intent ional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be repor ted on the overdose eCRF. (See Section 7.7for definit ion of overdose.) Any sequela of an accidental orintentional overdose of an invest igational product should be reported as an AE on the AE eCRF. If the sequela of an overdose is a seri ous adverse event (SAE ), then the sequela must be reported on the paper SAE report form and on the AE eCRF. The overdose resul ting in the SAE should be ident ified as the cause of the event on the paper SAE report form and eCRF, but shoul d not be reported as an SAE itself. In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific ant idote for apremilast overdose. Actual treatm ent shoul d depend on the severit y of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience o f the treating physician. All subjects will be mo nitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of any or all o f the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms; laboratory , pathol ogical, radiological , or surgi cal findings; physical examination findings; or findings from other tests and/o r procedures. All AEs will be recorded by the Investi gator f rom the time the subject signs informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of IP as well allSAEs made known to the Invest igator at any time following the protocol -requi red reporti ng period or after end of study . All adverse events (serious/non -serious) will be recorded on the eCRF , the paper SAE report form (for SAEs ) and in the subject’s source documents. All SAEs must be reported to Amgen Glo bal Pat ient Safet y within 24 hours of the Inv estigator’s knowledge of the event by recording on the eCRF submitt ing the SAE informat ion using the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form by facsimile/email directly to Amgen Glo bal Pat ient Safety. 10.2.

Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life-threate ning or result in death, hospitalization, or disabilit y, but may jeopardi ze the subject or requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether s uch an AE shoul d be considered serious. Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizatio ns for: A standard procedure for protocol therapy administrati on. However, hospitalizat ion or prol onged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of therapy administration will be reported as an SAE. Routine treatment or monitoring o f the studi ed indicati on not associ ated wi th any deteri oration in condit ion. The administration of blood or platelet transfusio n as routine treatment of studied indicat ion. However, hospitalizat ion or prol onged hospitalization for a complication of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE. A procedure for protocol/disease -related invest igatio ns (eg, surgery , scans, endoscopy , sam pling for l aboratory tests, bone m arrow sam pling). However, hospi talization or prolonged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of such procedures remains a reportable SAE. Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion for technical, practical, or social reasons, in absence of an AE. A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study ); must be docum ented in the source document and the eCRF.

This criterion is notthe sam e as “serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associ ated wi th events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or funct ioning. Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory obligat ions. 10.2.3. Causality The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration o f IP and the occurrence of a n AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below: Approved"

Suspected: There is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the IP and the adverse event. Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available inform ation. Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional inform ation beco mes available. If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a compara tor, ancillary, or addit ional IP that has not been manufactured or provided by Amgen , please provi de the name of the manufacturer when reporting the event. 10.2.4. Duration For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates o f the event. 10.2.5. Action Taken The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable (eg, di scont inuat ion, or interruption, or dose reductio n of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or addit ional treatment s were given for the event. 10.2.6. Outcome The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs. All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study must be fo llowed until recovered (returned to baseline) , recovered with sequelae, or death (due to the SAE ). 10.3.

The pregnancy , suspected pregnancy , or posi tive pregnancy test must be reported to Amgen Global Pat ient Safet y , or desi gnee, immediately by email, , f acsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Notificat ion Form or approved equivalent form (refer to Appendix T). The Pregnancy Notificat ion Form must be submitted to Amgen Glo bal Patient Safet y within 24 hours of l earning of a subject’ s pregnancy . (Note: Si tes are not requi red to provi de any informationon the Pregnancy Notificat ion Form that vi olates the coun try or regions l ocal privacy laws). After obtaining the female subject’s signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant healt h inform ation, the invest igator will collect pregnancy and infant he alth informat ion and complete the pregnancy questi onnai re for any female subject who becomes pregnant while taking IP through 28 day s of the subject’s last dose of IP. This informat ion will be forwarded to Amgen Global Patient Safet y. Generally , infant fol low-up will be conducted 12 months after the birth of the child (if applicable). The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician- gyneco logist or another appropriate healt hcare professio nal for further evaluat ion. The Investigator will mo nitor the pro gress of the pregnancy of a female subject, and must notify Amgen Glo bal Pat ient Safet y immediately about the outcom e of the pregnancy (either normal or abnorm al outcom e).

The Investigator may also contact the responsible Clinic al Research Physician/Medical Monitor or designee by telephone at the number(s) listed on the Emergency Contact Information page of the protocol (after title page). In the unlikely event that the Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor or designee cann ot be reached, the invest igator may also contact the Amgen Medical Informat ion number at 1 -800-77- AMGEN (1800-772-6436). The representatives are responsible for ob taining y our call -back inform ation and contacting the on -call Amgen/contract research orga nizat ion Medical Monitor, who will then contact y ou prom ptly. 12.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opinio n of the Invest igator, it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject. If it is medically imperative to know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discont inued if, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, con tinuing IP can negat ively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment. The deci sion to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibilit y of the treating physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor. However, the Invest igator may contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unb linding, mainly in the interest of the subject. The Investigator should ensure that the code is broken only in accordance wit h the protocol. The Invest igator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the reason for breaki ng the blind, which should be clearly documented by the Invest igator in the subject’s source documentation. Emergency unblinding shoul d only be perf ormed by the Invest igator through the IRT by using an emergency unblinding personal ident ification number (P IN), and the Investigator should contact IRT for unblinded dose information.

Subject Information and Informed Consent The Investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative prior to any study -related procedures. In addit ion to the main consent for the research study , the subjects will be given the opportunit y to consent to two optional sub -studi es, ie,the and, at sel ected si tes only , photography . Docum entati on that inform ed consent occurred prior to t he study subject’s entry into the study and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents, including the date. The original ICFsigned and dated by the study subject and by the person consent ing the study subjec t prior to the study subject’s entry into the study , must be m aintained in the Invest igator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject. In addi tion, if a protocol is amended and i t impacts on the content of the informed consent, the ICFmust be re vised. Study subjects participat ing in the study when the am ended protocol is implemented must be re - consented with the revised versio n of the ICF. The revised ICFsigned and dated by the study subject and by the person consent ing the study subject m ust be maintained in the Invest igator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject. Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study and sub -studies at any time and for any reason. Subject information already obtained as part of the study and sub -studies will be retained for analysis subject to applicable law. The Invest igator shall ensure that all appropriate processes regarding research ethics and subject consent have been fo llowed in accordance wit h applicable law and will notify Amgen in the event that any subject whose data i s stored at or otherwise processed by Amgen withdraws consent. The subject data shall be key- coded (the direct ident ifierswillhave been rem oved or replaced with a subject code) prior to being transferred to the Sponsor or t hird parties. In particular, appropriate protective mechanisms shall be implemented to ensure that photographs from the sub-study do not contain any subject ident ifiers (for example, scars, tattoos, etc) when shared with the Sponsor. 13.4. Confidentiality Amg enaffirms the subject’s right to protection against invasio n of privacy and to be in compliance wi th ICH and other l ocal regul ations (whichever i s most stringent). Amgen requi res the Invest igator to permit Amgen ’s representatives and, when necessary , repr esentatives from regul atory authori ties, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws.
