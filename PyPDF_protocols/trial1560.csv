It is required to maintain a 4-week gap between V1 and V2 during the screening/run-in period. Patients will be provided with an electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) device to record symptoms throughout the study (see Section 8.1.1 Clinical outcome assessments ). Patients who continue to meet eligibilit y criteria will be randomized 1:1 at Visit 3 (Day 0) to receive either placebo or benralizumab 30 mg SC every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses (Weeks 0, 4 and 8) and every 8 weeks thereafter (Weeks 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48). A total of 8 doses will be administered. An EOT visit will be conducted at Week 56. Patients will return to the study site at dos ing visits and at EOT during the treatment period for evaluation of efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), ADA, sample collection of blood and nasal secretion for exploratory biomarkers. Throughout the entire study period, participants will continue to receive daily MFNS. If at any po int a patient meets IP discontinuation (IPD) criteria, an early IPD visits will be performed (see Section 7.1 Discontinuation of study treatment ). At selected clinical sites, nasal polyp tissue will be obtained by biopsy according to the schedule of activities (SoA). A baseline biopsy will be obtained prior to randomization, at visit 2 (V2). Another biopsy of nasal polyp tissue will be obtained at Week 56 (EOT) (see Section 8.9 Biomarkers ). At selected clinical sites, CT scans will be performed. A baseline CT scan will be done at V2 or V3 and the next one at the EOT/IPD visit (Week 56) (see Section 8.1.3 Sinus Computed Tomography ). The first approximately 200 patients who complete the 56-week treatment will have a 24- week follow-up (FU) period without dosing to assess durability of benefit. These patients will have the FU for the final safety assessments at week 80. The remaining patients will have a last FU visit 12 weeks after last dose for final safety assessments at week 60. If for any reason a patient in the first set of randomized patients as described above is not willing to participate for a full 24-week FU period and would like to terminate participation in the study, the follow-up discontinuation ( FUD) visit should be performed. The FUD visit should occur as soon as it is convenient to the patient and site, but not prior to Week 60 (visit 12). For an overview of the study design, see Figure 1 , Section 1.2 Schema .

Fertile and sexually active patients or their partners should use effective contraceptive methods throughout the study and 16 weeks after last dose of the IP. Male patients should refrain from fathering children or donating sperm from the time of informed consent, to 16 weeks after last dose of the IP (see Inclusion criterion 15). 2. Patients must abstain from donating blood and plasma from the time of informed consent, to 16 weeks after last dose of the IP. 5.4 Screen failures Screen failures are defined as patients who signe d the ICF to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomized and must not be assigned to the study treatment. These patients must be withdrawn from the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure patients to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries form regulatory authorities (RAs). Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE. These patients should have the reason for st udy withdrawal recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) as “Incorrect Enrolment” (ie. Patient does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria). This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures (not randomized patients). 5.4.1 Re-s creening Re-screening is allowed only once for a patient. Rescreening and/or up to 14 days extension of the screening period, is allowed for transient reasons (including but not limited to equipment/procedure failure, e.g. problems with the ePRO device impacting availability of data or documenting compliance with INCS, or unforeseen personal events that result in a missed visit). For patients who require SCS and/or antibiotics for an asthma exacerbation or worsening of nasal polyp symptoms during the screening period (prior to V2), the screening period may be extended for up to 6 weeks, provided the treatment duration with SCS and/or Ab is ≤ 14 days. The next regular study visit (Visit 2) will be delayed and may proceed no sooner than 4 weeks after the last dose of SCS and/or Ab. If the duration of treatment with SCS and/or Ab is >14 days, or asthma exacerbation/ worsening of nasal polyp symptoms occurred after V2, patients should be screen failed, but can be considered for re-screening. Patients who fail to meet the required total NP score at V1 or V2, may be considered for re- screening once an appropriate time interval, as deemed by the investigator, has elapsed."

The Investigator or designee must confirm a ppropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit and storage for all study treatment receiv ed and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study treatment. Only patients enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorised site staff may supply or administer study treatment. Before investigational product administration Prior to each IP administration: ! Investigator/authorized delegate will assess injection site as per standards of medical care; ! For WOCBP, urine pregnancy test will be done; IP will be administered only when the result of the test is negative."
53,page_53,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 54 (125)Further details on IP administration are described in the IP Handling Instruction provided to study sites. Investigational product administration must be carried out in line with the Instruction. After investigational product administration After IP administration, the patient should be observed for a minimum of 1 hour in case of any acute drug reactions. Conditions requiring investigational product administration rescheduling If any of the following occur, the Investigator should reschedule the visit and the IP should not be administered until the rescheduled visit: ! The patient has an intercurrent illness, that in the opinion of the Investigator may compromise the safety of the patient in the study (e.g. viral illnesses); ! The patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, is experiencing an acute or emerging asthma exacerbation; ! The patient is febrile ( ≥38°C; ≥100.4°F) within 72 hours prior to the IP administration. 6.2.2 Storage All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator and authorised site staff. The temperature should be monitored on a daily basis and documented in the temperature monitoring log. The investigational product must be kept in the original outer container and under conditions specified on the label (between 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F), protected from the light). In the following cases, the site staff should not use affected IP and should immediately contact an AstraZeneca representative for further guidance: ! Temperature excursion upon receipt or during storage at the study; ! Damaged kit upon receipt; ! Damaged syringe/cartridge. Damaged IP should be documented via In teractive Web Response System/ Interactive Vo ice Response System (IWRS/IVRS; refer to IWRS/IVRS manual for further details)."
54,page_54,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 55 (125)6.2.3 Accountability The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for st udy treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). An AstraZeneca site monitor will account for all study treatments received at the site, for unused study tr eatments , and for appropriate destruction or return of unused study treatments. Certificates of delivery, destruction, and/or return should be signed. In the case of a malfunctioning accessorized prefilled syringe (APFS), the site should contact the study monitor to initiate a product complaint process according to applicable guidelines. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatm ent are described in the Pharmacy Manual provided to the sites. 6.3 Measures to minimise bias: randomization and blinding 6.3.1 Methods for a ssigning treatment groups Patients will be stratified by region (US vs non-US) and by baselin e comorbid as thma status (yes vs no). It is expected that at most 50% of the randomized patients will not have comorbid asthma. The corresponding strata will be closed for randomization (see Section 7.3.1 Withdrawal due to recruitment completion in a randomization stratum ). All patients will be centrally assigned to randomized study treatment using an IWRS/IVRS. Before the study is initiated, the telephone number and call-in dir ections for the IVRS and/or the log-in information and dir ections for th e IWRS will be provided to each site. Randomization codes will be assigned strictly seque ntially in each stratum as patients become eligible for randomization. Patients who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria should not, under any circumstances, be enrolled or receive study treatment. There can be no exceptions to this rule. If a randomized patient withdraws from the study , then his/her enrolment/randomization code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. 6.3.2 Methods for e nsuring blinding This is a double-blind study. AstraZeneca staff involved in the study, the patients, and the Investigators involved in the treatment of patients or in their clinical evaluation will not be aware of treatment allocation. Placebo solution will be visually matched with benralizumab solution. Both benralizumab and placebo will be provided in an APFS."

In order to mitigate potential unblinding on this basis, per protocol haematology will be run by the central laboratory. After Visit 3, eosinophil, basophil and monocyte counts will be redacted from any central laboratory reports sent to investigative sites to prevent the Principal Investigator (PI)/designee from possibly deducting the ‘eosinophil + basophil + monocyte’ contribution to the complete blood count (CBC). If the Investigator orders any local safety laboratory assessments, the requested tests should be restricted to the question at hand. For example, if haemoglobin (Hb) is desired the Investigator should avoid ordering a complete blood cell count with differential. 6.3.2.2 Handling of labs obtained during the study period but ordered outside of the clinical trial. Site staff who are directly involved in the patient’s management should remain blinded to any eosinophil, basophil and monocyte results include d as part of outside lab reports. To help ensure this, each investigational site will designate an individual (e.g. administrator or another ancillary person) not directly involved in pa tient management, to receive and blind any eosinophil, basophil and monocyte results prior to the report being handed over to the site staff involved in the patient’s management and prior to filing as a source document. Similarly, eosinophil and basophil results must be red acted from all communications with AstraZeneca. In cases where the Investigator requires an eosinophil, basophil, or monocyte count for managing safety issues he/she may order these tests. AstraZeneca should be notified of all such cases, but should not be informed about lab results. 6.3.3 Methods for unblinding Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomizatio n for each randomized patient, will be available to the Investigator(s) or Pharmacists at the study site from the IWRS/IVRS. Further detail on how to unblind a patient’s treatment allocation will be described in the IWRS/IVRS user manual provided to each study site. The randomization code s hould not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment rando mization. The Investigator documents and reports the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the treatment given to the patient to the AstraZeneca staff. AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to Regulatory Authorities (RAs). Randomization codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluab ility of the data from each individual patient have been made and documented."

All patients will receive study provided standardized MFNS for a minimum of 4 week s prior to V2, con tinued through out the screening and study period. Mometasone furoate (50 micrograms/actuation) nasal spray is contained in a bottle that contains 120 actuations for US and 140 actuations for all other countries. Two doses (50mcg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily (total daily dose of 400 mcg) will be administered, unless there is a medical rationale to use the lower dose (QD) regimen. Each patient will receive enough background medication to cover the need until the next on site visit. Intranasal corticosteroids dispen sation will be performed according to the SoA table (Table 1 ). Intranasal corticosteroid compliance will be recorded by the patient in the ePRO diary and should be checked by Investigators during th e study pe riod. If a subject cannot tolerate MFNS during screening period, the subject should be screen failed. The Principal Investigator should ask patients about SCS (oral, parenteral) use for NP at each visit and record in the eCRF. If medically just ified, a short course of SCS (3-14 days) is allowed for NP worsening during the study, at PI’s discretion, according to local standard of care. If SCS is used for ≤ 14 days between V1 and V2, the screening may be extended for maximum 6 more weeks.

DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT AND PATIENT WITHDRAWAL 7.1 Discontinuation of study treatment Patients may be discontinued from IP in the following situations. Note that discontinuation from study treatment is NOT the same th ing as a complete withdrawal from the study: 1. Patient decision. The patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment. 2. AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates further dosing. 3. Severe non-compliance with the CSP. 4. Risk to patient as judged by the Investigator or AstraZeneca. 5. Pregnancy. 6. IP unblinding (PI). 7. Development of any study specific criteria for discontinuation: ! Anaphylactic reaction to the IP requiring administration of epinephrine; ! Development of helminth parasitic infestations requiring hospitalization; ! If 2 doses of the IP are missed during course of the study; ! A respiratory-related event requiring mechanical vent ilation. 7.1.1 Procedures of di scontinuation of study treatment At any time, patients are free to disconti nue IP without prejudice to further treatment. A patient that decides to discontinue IP should always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. All patients who prematurely discontinue IP should return to the study site and complete the procedures described for premature IPD visit within 8 weeks after the last dose of IP. At that visit, although no longer on IP, patients should be encouraged to remain in the study to complete all subsequent study visits, pro cedures, and assessments. Data collection should continue according to the study protocol. Note that in this case, the IPD visit replaces the nearest regular visit while the following visits continue as possible. If the patient does not agree to complete all subsequent visits and procedures, the patient should be encouraged to stay in the study, keep the daily diary (ePRO device), and continue selected visits until Week 56."
60,page_60,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 61 (125)If the patient does not agree to continue in-person study visits, telephone visits should be performed to ensure the co llection of endpoints and safety information. Patients will be encourage to keep the ePRO device and do assessments, participate in the telephone visits, and return ePRO handheld device at the end of the study. If a patient is not willing to complete ePRO procedures, device should be returned at the IPD visit and the telephone FU should be continued. A patient that agrees to modify FU is not considered to have withdrawn consent or to have withdrawn from the study. If a patient is not willing to participate further in the study after the IPD visit, the ePRO will be returned at the IPD visit. The patient should be asked to return for a FU visit 12 weeks after the last dose of IP for final study-related assessments. The reason for premature discontinuation of IP should be recorded in the eCRF. See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 7.2 Lost to follow-up A patient will be considered poten tially lost to follow-up if he or she fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The patient is considered lost to follow-up wh en any of the following attempts to contact fails: 3 attempts of either phone calls, faxes, or emails; having sent 1 registered/certified mail; or 1 unsuccessful effort to check the vital status of the patient using publicly available sources, if allowed, by local regulations. The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: ! The site must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule; ! Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient or next of kin by e.g. repeat telephone calls, certified letter to the patient´s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods. These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record; ! Efforts to reach the patient should continue until the end of the study. Should the patient be unreachable at the end of the study the patient should be considered to be lost to follow-up with unknown vital status at end of study and censored at latest follow-up contact."

If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, AstraZeneca may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a patient withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records. A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. The Investigator will follow up patients as medically indicated. The patient will return ePRO devices to the site staff. See SoA ( Table 2 ) for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. All Study treatment should be returned by the patient. 7.3.1 Withdrawal due to recruitment completion in a randomization stratum When a specific stratum is full, patients in the completed stratum will not be randomized and will be withdrawn from the study. The reason of the withdrawal should be documented in the source and eCRF as a development of study specific criterion for discontinuation. Same as with screen failures, no further study rel ated follow-up of these patients is required.

There can be no exceptions to this rule. Patients who are enrolled, but subsequently found not to m eet all the eligibility criteria must not be randomized or initiated on treatment, and mu st be withdrawn from the study. Where a patient does not meet all the eligibilit y criteria but is randomized in error, or incorrectly started on treatment, the Investigator should inform the AstraZeneca Study Physician immediately, and an agreement should be made between the AstraZeneca StudyPhysician and the Investigator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the patient from treatment. The AstraZeneca St udy Team must en sure all decisions are appropriately documented."

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRF. Medidata Rave Web Based Data Capture system will be used for data collection and query handling. The Investigator ensures the accuracy, and completeness, of the eCRFs including: the legibility and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement. The Investigator will sign the completed eCRF. A copy of the completed eCRF will be archived at the study site. Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with AstraZeneca immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the patient should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the study design requirements, includi ng those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential patients meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Additional data to assess the impact of study disruption caused e.g. by COVID-19 pandemic will be collected in additional eCRF modules. For more information please refer to the recent version of eCRF instruction. 8.1 Efficacy assessments 8.1.1 Clinical outcome assessments Patients will complete all patient-reported outcomes (PRO) assessments using a handheld ePRO device. The ePRO device will be the only accepted source of patient reported data. The Investigator will ensure that patients are properly trained on the use of this device and the importance of completing assessments as scheduled. The ePRO device will be used to capture symptoms (Nasal Polyposis Symptom Screening Assessment) and health-related quality of life [(HRQoL) SNOT-22] screening data at Visit 1. If the patient does not meet the screening requirements, the device will be deactivated and retained at the site. If eligible to continue, the patient will receive additional training on the device regarding at-home use. The ePRO device will be programmed at Visit 1 with reminder alarms for the daily diary. Study site staff will be able to adjust alarms for specific patient needs as required. The patient will be required to complete a training module before taking the device home. If a patient fails to meet eligibility criteria after V1 (for exam ple regarding total NPS), the patient will be scheduled to return to the site, return the ePRO device and will be screen failed at that time."

Patient compliance should be checked weekly (at minimum) to ensure that the patient is completing the assessments as scheduled. Monitoring of patient adherence to th e diary is critical during the baseline period (Study day -13 to Day 0) to ensure that the patient meets applicable criteria for randomization. Continued weekly monitoring of adherence throughout the study and follow-up with patients via phone and at the visits is required to ensure sufficient data is available for supporting the co-primary endpoint of this study. All PRO assessments should be completed prior to any other interventional study procedure (e.g. laboratory tests, endoscopy, CT-scan) with the exception of informed consent at Visit 1. The at-home PRO assessments scheduled for V3 will be completed at the site once the site staff enable the visit on the device. If a scheduled at-home assessment has not been completed at the time of the visit it will be completed at the site prior to other study procedures. 8.1.1.1 Nasal Polyposis Symptom Diary The patient will complete an 11-item NP symp tom diary (NPSD) each morning throughout the screening, treatment and follow-up periods. The p atient is asked to consider their experience with NP / nasal polyps over the past 24 hours when responding to each question. Patients are asked to report their experience with NP symptoms (nasal blockage, nasal congestion, runny nose, postnasal drip (mucus drainage down the throat), headache, facial pain, facial pressure, and difficulty with sense of smell) and symptom impacts (difficulty with sleeping due to nasal symptoms and difficulty with daily activities due to nasal symptoms). Patients report the severity of each symptom and symptom impact at its worst using a 4-point verbal rating scale (0-None to 3-Severe). A Total Symptom Score (TSS) is calculated by taking the sum of the 8 equally weighted symptom items. A single item to capture INCS compliance (yes or no) will be administered after the symptom and symptom impact items. A 2-week recall version of the diary (Nasal Polyposis Symptom Screening Assessment) will be used to evaluate minimum symptom criteria at Visit 1. This screening assessment has one additional item about consistency of symptoms over the past 12 weeks and omits the INCS compliance item; otherwise concepts measured are the same as the daily diary. The NPSD will be completed on the ePRO device per the SoA. 8.1.1.1.1 Nasal Bloc kage Score One of the co-primary endpoints of the study is the change from baseline in the bi-weekly mean of NBS at Week 40 (change from baseline at Week 56 is a key secondary endpoint). NBS is captured by an item in the NPSD asking patients to rate the severity of their worst nasal blockage over the past 24 hours using the following response options: 0 – None; 1 –Mild; 2 – Moderate; 3 – Severe. Baseline will be the mean of daily responses from Day -13 to Day 0. Bi-weekly (14-day) mean NBS will be calculated if at least 8 days in each 14-day period has evaluable data; otherwise the bi-weekly mean is set to missing."

DSS is captured by an item in the NPSD asking p atients to rate the severity of their worst difficulty with sense of smell over the past 24 hours using the following response options: 0 –None; 1 – Mild; 2 – Moderate; 3 – Severe. Baseline will be the mean of daily responses from Day -13 to Day 0. Bi-weekly (14-day) mean DSS will be calculated if at least 8 days in each 14-day period has evaluable data; otherwise the bi-weekly mean is set to missing. 8.1.1.2 SinoNasal Outcome Test 22 item One of the key secondary endpoints of the study is the change from baseline in SNOT-22 total score at Week 40 (change from baseline at Week 56 is also a key secondary endpoint). The SNOT-22 is a condition-specific HRQoL assessm ent which captures patie nt-reported physical problems, functional limitations, and emotional consequences of sinonasal c onditions (Piccirillo et al 2002 ; Hopkins et al 2009 ). Patient-reported symptom severity and symptom impact over the past 2 weeks are captured via a 6-point scale (0- No Problem to 5- Problem as bad as it can be). The total score is the sum of item scores and has a range from 0 to 110 (higher scores indicate poorer outcomes). A Minimal Clinical Importance Difference (MCID) of 8.90 has been established for individual score change ( Hopkins et al 2009 ). The SNOT-22 will be completed on the ePRO device per the SoA. 8.1.1.3 Short Form 36-item Health survey, version 2 The Short Form 36-item Health survey, Vers ion 2 (standard recall) (S F-36v2) is a 36-item, self-report survey of functional health a nd well-being, with a 4-week recall period (QualityMetr ic 2011 ). Responses to 35 of the 36 items are used to compute an 8-domain profile of functional h ealth and well-being scores. The r emaining item, referred to as the ‘Health Transition’ item, asks p atients to rate how their current state of health compared to their state of health 1 year ago, and is not used to calculate domain scores. The 8-domain profile consists of the following subscales: Physical Functioning (PF), Role Limitations due to Physical Health (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health Perceptions (GH), Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role Limitations due to Emotional Problems (RE), and Mental Health (MH). Psychometrically-based physical and mental health component summary scores (PCS and MCS, respectively) are computed from subscale scores to give a broader metric of physical and mental HRQoL. Two types of thresholds have been developed for interpretation of SF-36v2 scores. The first type is suitable for comparing group mean score s and is generally referred to as the MCID. The second type is suitable for interpreting change at the individual level and is referred to as the responder threshold or responder definition ( QualityMetr ic 2011 )."

Four booklets each with 10 odorants each are used for the test. Patients ar e asked to identify the odor using multiple choice format which lists different possib ilities. The test is forced-cho ice; i.e., the patient is required to mark one of the four alternatives even if no smell is perceived. Scores are based on number of correctly identified odors (score range 0 to 40). Please note that the UPSIT smell test will be performed in all countries participating in the study except Denmark. No Danish version of the test is available. 8.1.2 Nasal Polyp Score One of the co-primary endpoints of the study is the change from baseline in bilateral endoscopic total NPS at week 40 (change at week 56 is a key secondary endpoint). The score (maximum 8) is the sum of the right and left nos tril scores, as evaluated by nasal endoscopy. Total NPS is graded based on polyp size described in Table 7 . Nasal endoscopy may be preceded by local administration of anaesthetic drugs in combination with a decongestant, as per local medical pract ice. Standard video sequences will be sent to centralized reader. Centralized imaging data assessments and scoring by an independent physician reviewer for the imaging data will be performed for all endoscopies. To confirm elig ibility at V3, the V1 and V2 central reading results will be made available to the site. The sites will remove patient-identifying infor mation from the imaging data header prior to sending the imaging data to the central reader. Further details on nasal endoscopy will be available in a separate Imaging Site Guide provided to the sites.

Baseline CT will be performed at V2 or V3 and a final CT will be performed at EOT (or IPD if 24 weeks passed since baseline CT). Baseline CT should be performed after the nasal polyp biopsy (biopsy and CT can be performed on separate days) and before nasal polyp biopsy at EOT/IPD. Sinus CT images will be used to derive LMSs based on the visual assessment by independent central readers (see Section 8.1.3.1 Lund-Mackay score ), and for quantitative estimation of a sinus severity score (see Section 8.1.3.2 Quan titative measurement of sinus disease burden on sinus computed tomography ), which is representative of sinus disease burden. The sites will remove patient-identifying i nformation from the image data (DICOM) header prior to sending the imaging data to the central lab.

This is defined as: Sinus severity score = sinus mucosal volume / (sinus mucosal volume + sinus air volume) *100%. The following parameters used to cal culate the sinus severity score: ! sinus air volume (mL); ! sinus mucosal volume (mL). Image analysis will be performed centrally and baseline and EOT will be compared. 8.1.4 Nasal polyp surgery Nasal polyposis surgery is defined as any procedure involving instruments resulting in incision and removal of tissue (e.g. polypectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery). Surgery procedures performed for NP during the study, including reason for surgery and information whether the surgery was performed as an outpatient or inpatient (i.e. including an overnight stay in the hospital) procedure, should be recorded in the Nasal Polyp Surgery eCRF. Administration of IP post NP surgery is discretionary and subject to assessment by the Investigator. If the patient is scheduled for NP surgery, an unscheduled visit, should ideally be performed prior to the surgery to assess safe ty and efficacy (incl uding total NPS, SNOT-22, SF-36v2, PGI-S, PGI-C, ACQ-6 [for asthma patients only] and UPSIT)."

The assessment should be performed before interventions with the patient (eg, endoscopy, blood draw). An independent reader will provide overall interpretation as normal or abnormal and assess the clinical significance of any potential ECG findings. A reassessment ECG may support evaluation of clinical significance, when uncertain. A patient with a clinical significant abnormal fi nding on the ECG, assessed by PI, should be screen failed. 8.2.5 Other assessments 8.2.5.1 Weight and height Weight and height will be measured in accordance with schedules provided in the SoA. The patient's weight will be recorded in kilograms; height will be recorded in centimetres. Weight and height measurements will be performed in light clothing and with shoes off. 8.3 Collection of adverse events The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix B . Adverse event will be reported by the patient (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the patient's legally au thorized repre sentative).

However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a d eath, at any time after a patient’s last visit and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, th e Investigator may notify AstraZeneca. The method of recording, evaluating, and a ssessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix B . 8.3.3 Follow-up of adverse events and serious adverse events After the initial AE/SAE report, the Invest igator is required to proactively follow each patient at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the patient is lost to follow-up. Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the Investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.4 Adverse event data collection The following variables will be collected for each AE: !

Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure* the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix B to the CSP. *Note: NP surgery is not a planned study procedure. 8.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?’, or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests The results from the CSP mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).

Any new or aggravated, clinically relevant, abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease-under study (DUS) (see Section 8.3.9 Diseas e-under study (DUS) ). 8.3.8 Hy’s Law (HL) Cases where patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with TBL ≥ 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix E for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of HL. 8.3.9 Disease-under study (DUS) Symptoms of DUS are those which might be expected to occur as a direct result of NP or the nasal endoscopy procedure. Events which are unequivocally due to disease under study should not be reported as an AE during the study unless there is a deterioration or worsening of the expected symptoms that led to discontinuation of the investigational product OR the events meet SAE criteria. Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations due to NP planned during the study are not considered SAEs. If the condition unexpectedly deteriorated after NP surgery, the reported SAE term should be the reason for hospitalizat ion/prolongation of hospitalization. NP surgery should not be reported as the SAE term. NP surgery is a clinical endpoint and assessment of subject discontinuation from IP should not be based on the NP surgery.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1 Statistical hypotheses The co-primary efficacy endpoints are the change from baseline in total NPS at Week 40 and the change from baseline in bi-weekly mean NBS at Week 40. The primary analysis is to compare the changes from baseline in total NPS and in NBS of benralizumab with placebo (change from baseline for both endpoints at week 56 are included as key secondary endpoints). The null hypothesis is that the change from baseline in total NPS and/or the change from baseline in NBS are similar between benralizumab and placebo. The alternative hypothesis is that both of the change from baseline in total NPS and the change from baseline in NBS are different between benralizumab and placebo. The type I error will be controlled across co-primary and key secondary endpoints at 0.05 two-sided) statistical significance level. Both of the co-primary endpoints will be tested at 0.01 (two-sided) and the key secondary endpoint s will be tested hierarchically at 0.05 (two-"

Data collected post-surgery will be set to missing, and the worst possible value will be imputed from that point through Week 56. For patients who discontinue the study without NP surgery or SCS use for NP, missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation (MI) using all patients who did not have NP surgery or receive SCS for NP under a missing at random assumption. Further details of the primary analysis as well as sensitivity analyses will be included in the SAP. 9.4.1.1 Calculation or derivation of variables for efficacy analyses The changes from baseline in total NPS and NBS at Week 40 are co-primary endpoints. The change from baseline in SNOT-22 total score at Week 40, time to the earlier of first NP surgery and/or SCS use for NP by Week 56, time to first NP surgery by Week 56, change from baseline in DSS score at Week 40, change from baseline in total NPS at Week 56, change from baseline in NBS at Week 56, change from baseline in SNOT-22 total score at Week 56, change from baseline in DSS score at Week 56, and change from baseline in LMS at EOT/IPD are the 9 key secondary endpoints. Total nasal polyps score (Co-primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint) The change from baseline in total NPS at Week 40 is one of the co-primary endpoints and at Week 56 is one of the key secondary endpoints. The total NPS is the sum of the bilateral NPS, which will be evaluated centrally. The total scores and the corresponding changes from baseline at each visit will be calculated. In addition, the proportion of NPS responders, which is defined as patients with at least 1 point improvement (reduction) in total NPS will be a supportive variable to the primary objective. Nasal blockage score (Co-primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint) The change from baseline in NBS at Week 40 is the other co-primary endpoint and at Week 56 is one of the key secondary endpoints. The NBS will be summarized bi-weekly (14-day periods). The bi-weekly mean and the changes from the baseline will be calculated. Disease specific health-related quality of life: SNOT-22 (Key secondary endpoint) Disease specific health-related quality of life will be evaluated by SNOT-22. The changes from baseline in SNOT-22 total score at Weeks 40 and 56 are key secondary endpoints. The observed values and the changes from baseline in SNOT-22 total score at each timepoint will be calculated. Time to first NP surgery and/or SCS use for NP (Key secondary endpoint) The time to the first NP surgery and/or SCS use for NP by Week 56 is another key secondary endpoint. The time w ill be calculated based on the earliest occurrence of NP surgery and/or SCS use for NP and will be calculated as follows:"

Time to first NP surgery (Key secondary endpoint) The time to the first NP surgery by Week 56 is another key secondary endpoint and will be evaluated for all patients. The time to first NP surgery is calculated as follows: Start date of first NP surgery - date of randomization +1 For patients who do not experience any surgery , the time to first NP surgery will be censored at the date of their last visit for the 56-week treatment period, or at the time point after which a surgery could not be assessed (for lost to follow-up patients). Difficulty with Sense of Smell (DSS) score (Key secondary endpoint) The changes from baseline in DSS score at Week s 40 and 56 are key secondary endpoints. The DSS score will be summarized bi-weekly (14-day periods). The bi-weekly mean and the changes from the baseline will be calculated. Lund Mackay (key secondary endpoint) and sinus severity score Only the data from blinded central reader will be used for analysis. Both LMS (key secondary endpoint) and sinus severity score as described in Section 8.1.3.2 will be evaluated centrally. The observed values and the change from baseline at EOT/IPD will be calculated. University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) Sense of smell will be evaluated by UPSIT. The observed values and changes from baseline at each timepoint will be calculated.

SCS use for NP and proportion of NP surgery The proportion of patients who had NP surgery, the proportion of patients who use SCS for NP, and the proportion of patients who had surgery or use SCS for NP will be calculated by Week 56 for all patients. In addition, the number of courses of SCS for NP, total SCS dose used and total duration of SCS use for NP, will also be summarized by Week 56."

Asthma exacerbations In the patients with comorbid asthma at baseline, the number of exacerbations and the annual exacerbation rate will be calculated. The number of exacerbations related to ER/urgent care/hospitalization/SCS will be summarized. 9.4.1.2 Methods for efficacy analyses Analyses of the co-primary endpoints The primary estimand will be applied to the co- primary endpoints, the change from baseline in total NPS and the change from baseline in NBS, using a hybrid method of WP/WOCF and MI followed by ANCOVA with treatment arm, baseline score, region (US vs non-US), and baseline comorbid asthma status (yes vs no) as covariates. The estimates of the treatment effects at Week 40 and Week 56 will be based on contrasts from this ANCOVA model. The analyses will use the data collected up to Week 56 visit regardless of whether patients remained on treatment or not except data collected after NP surgery and/or SCS use for NP. A composite strategy will be used for NP surgery and SCS use for NP. If a patient had any NP surgery before Week 56, the data will be censored after the first NP surgery and the worst possible value will be imputed in its place. If a patient had any course of SCS use for NP before Week 56, the data will be censored after the time of having the first course of SCS use for NP and the patient’s previously worst observed value will be imputed in its place."

Specifically, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted in which the worst possible value is imputed after NP surgery and a treatment policy strategy is used for both treatment discontinuation and use of SCS for NP. Full details of the sensitivity analyses will be pre- specified in the SAP. Analyses of secondary endpoints All secondary continuous efficacy endpoints w ill be summarized by visit and treatment group. In addition, the changes from baseline at sche duled visits in total NPS, NBS, SNOT-22 total score, DSS score, TSS, UPSIT, SF-36v2 (PCS, MCS, and domains), ACQ-6, will be analyzed under the primary estimand using ANCOVA, in a similar manner to that outlined for the co- primary endpoints above. The changes from baseline at EOT/IPD in CT-scores will be analyzed under a similar estimand to that used for the primary and other secondary endpoints, but with a treatment policy rather than composite strategy for SC S use for NP. The analyses will use the data collected up to Week 56 visit regardless of whether patients remained on treatment or received SCS for NP except data collected after NP surgery . A composite strategy will be used for NP surgery. If a patient had any NP surgery before Week 56, the data w ill be censored after the first NP surgery and the worst possible value will be imputed in its place. The composite strategy of imputing WOCF after SCS use for NP will not be used for CT-scores because there is only one post-baseline assessment. The estimates of the treatment effects at Week 40 and Week 56 for SNOT-22 total score and DSS score and at EOT/IPD for LMS for the analyse s of key secondary endpoints will be based on contrasts from the respective ANCOVA models. Time to first NP surgery up to Week 56, time to first course of SCS use for NP up to Week 56, and the Time to first NP surgery and/or first course of SCS use for NP up to Week 56 will be analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment, region (US vs non-US) and baseline comorbid asthma status (yes vs no), as covariates. The proportions of responders at selected timepoints in total NPS, in SNOT-22 total score and in ACQ-6, will be analyzed using logistic regression with treatment arm, baseline scores, region (US vs non-US), and baseline comorbid asthma status (yes vs no) as covariates. The proportion of patients who had NP surgery and the proportion of patients who had courses of SCS for NP up to Week 56 will be analyzed using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test controlling for region (US vs non-US) and baseline comorbid asthma status (yes vs no). The total number of courses of SCS_NP will be analyzed using a negative binomial model adjusting for region (US vs non-US), baseline comorbid asthma status (yes vs no), and prior use of SCS for NP (yes vs no)."

Appendix B Adverse event definitions and additional safety information B1 Definition of adverse events An adverse event (AE) is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. B2 Definitions of serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: ! Results in death; ! Is immediately life threatening; ! Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization;"
102,page_102,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 103 (125)! Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; ! Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect; ! Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require medical treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Adverse Events (AEs) for malignant tumours reported during a study should generally be assessed as Serious AEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medical Event’ criterion should be used. In certain situatio ns, however, medical judgement on an individual event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumour event should be assessed and reported as a Non-Serious AE. For example, if the tumour is included as medical history and progression occurs during the study, but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the malignant tumour, the AE may not fulfill the attributes for being assessed as Serious, although reporting of the progression of the malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, some types of malignant tumours, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that doe s not require hospitalization, may be assessed as Non-Serious; examples include Stage 1 basal cell carcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via cone biopsy. B3 Life threatening ‘Life threatening’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’s death. ‘Life threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure). B4 Hospitalization Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. B5 Important medical event or medical treatment Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalization, disability or incapacity bu t may jeopardize the patient or may require medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used."
103,page_103,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 104 (125)! Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatment; ! Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine; ! Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; ! Blood dyscrasias (e.g. neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; ! Development of drug dependency or drug abuse. B6 Intensity rating scale: 1. Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated). 2. Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities). 3. Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities).It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix B2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix B2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B2. B7 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused by the drug. ! Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the patient actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? ! Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties? ! De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug?"
104,page_104,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 105 (125)! No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. ! Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge. ! Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship. In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: ! Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug? ! Is there a known mechanism? Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’. Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility. B8 Medication Error For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study treatment that either causes harm to the participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or participant. Medication error includes situations where an error. ! Occurred; ! Was identified and intercepted before the participant received the drug; ! Did not occur, but circumstances were recognize that could have led to an error. Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:"
105,page_105,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 106 (125)! Drug name confusion; ! Dispensing error e.g. medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to the participant; ! Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of administration; ! Drug not taken as indicated e.g. tablet dissolved in water when it should be taken as a solid tablet; ! Drug not stored as instructed e.g. kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature; ! Wrong participant received the medication (excluding Interactive Web Response System/ Interactive Voice Response System (IWRS/IVRS) errors); ! Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IWRS/IVRS errors). Examples of events that do not require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies: ! Errors related to or resulting from IWRS/IVRS - including those which lead to one of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error; ! Participant accidentally missed drug dose(s) e.g. forgot to take medication; ! Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose); ! Participant failed to return unused medication or empty packaging; ! Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard of care medication in open label studies, even if an AZ product. Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the medication error. Appendix C Handling of Human Biological Samples C1 Bicustody of biological samples A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. The Investigator at each site keeps full traceab ility of collected biologi cal samples from the patients while in storage at the site until shipment or disposal (where appropriate). The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival."
106,page_106,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 107 (125)AstraZeneca will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual requirements of external laboratory providers. Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AZ-assigned biobanks and will be registered by the AstraZeneca Biobank Team during the entire life cycle. If a patient does not allow samples to be used for future biomarker research they may continue with their samples being used for the main study. If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining biological samples are returned to the site according to local regulations or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner. C2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of/destroyed, and the action documented. If samples are already analyzed,AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results of this research. As collection of the biological sample(s) is an in tegral part of the study, then the patient is withdrawn from further study participation. The Investigator: ! Ensures patients’ withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is notified immediately to AstraZeneca; ! Ensures that biological samples from that patient, if stored at the study site, are immediately identified, disposed of /destroyed, and the action documented; ! Ensures the organization(s) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroyed, the action documented and the signed document returned to the study site; ! Ensures that the patient and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal. AstraZeneca ensures the organizations holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroyed and the action documented and returned to the study site. C3 International Airline Transportation Association 6.2 Guidance Document LABELLING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 3 categories"

For transport purposes, the classification of infectious substances according to risk groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulati ons in the 46th edition (2005). Infectious substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt. There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and Categories A and B. Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to it occurs, is capable of causing permanent di sability, life threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are e.g. Ebola, Lassa fever virus: ! are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602. Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category A. Category B pathogens are e.g. Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, Human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2. They are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name: ! UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B; ! are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650. Exempt - all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens ! Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations; ! Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient; ! temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging (http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.htm); ! Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods specification for the dry-ice content; ! IATA compliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and transportation and packing should be done by an IATA certified person, as applicable; ! Samples routinely transported by road or rail are patient to local regulations which require that they are also packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way to contain any risk of infection or contamination by using approved couriers and packaging/containment materials at all times. The IATA 650 biological sample containment standards are encouraged wherever possible when road or rail transport is used."

Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolis m, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease aetiology; and/or molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting patients. AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genetic research to explore how genetic variations may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis of diseases, and the response to medications. Genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in health care and to the discovery of new diagnostics, treatments or medications. In addition, collection of DNA samples from populations with well described clinical characteristics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, possibly, to genetically guided treatment strategies. Genetic research may consist of the analysis of the structure of the patient´s DNA, i.e. the entire genome. The results of genetic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report or in a separate study summary. AstraZeneca will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples will be retained while research on study treatment continues but no longer than 15 years or other period as per local requirements from the date of the Last Patient Last Visit (LPLV), after which they will be destroyed. D2 Genetic research plan and procedures Selection of genetic research population Study selection record All patients will be asked to participate in this genetic research. Participation is voluntary and if a patient declines to participate there will be no penalty or loss of benefit. The patient will not be excluded from any aspect of the main study."
109,page_109,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 110 (125)Inclusion criteria ! For inclusion in this genetic research, patient s must fulfil all of the inclusion criteria described in the main body of the Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) and: Provide informed consent for the genetic sampling and analyses. Exclusion criteria Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the main study or any of the following: ! Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant; ! Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample collection. Withdrawal of consent for genetic research: Patients may withdraw from this genetic res earch at any time, independent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study. Voluntary withdrawal will not prejudice further treatment. Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Section 7.3 Withdrawal from the study , of the main CSP. Collection of samples for genetic research The blood sample for genetic research may be obtained from the patients at any time after randomization. Although DNA is stable, early sample collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding patients who may withdraw due to an adverse event, such patients would be important to include in any genetic analysis. If for any reason the sample is not drawn at Visit 3, it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit. Only one sample should be collected per patient for genetics during the study. Samples will be collected, labelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. Coding and storage of DNA samples The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are important to maintain patient confidentiality. Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years, from the date of LPLV, after which they will be destroyed. DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. An additional second code will be assigned to the blood either before or at the time of DNA extraction replacing the information on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will be identifiable only by the second, unique number. This number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca gene tics laboratories, or at the designated organisation. No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or designated organisations working with the DNA)."
110,page_110,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 111 (125)The link between the patient enrolment/rando mization c ode and the second number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or designated organisations. The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results wi th clinical data, allow regulatory audit, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent. Ethical and regulatory requirements The principles for ethical and regulatory requiremen ts for the study, including this genetics research component, are outlined in Appendix B . Informed consent The genetic component of this study is option al and the patient may participate in other components of the main study without particip ating in the genetic component. To participate in the genetic component of the study the patient must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the genetic component of the study. Copies of both signed and dated consent forms must be given to the patient and the original filed at the study site. The Principal Investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the patient understands that they may freely withdrawal from the genetic aspect of the study at any time. Patient data protection AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to patients, any insurance compa ny, any employer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identity of the patient. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a patient. For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an Investigator might know a patient’s identity and also have access to his or her gene tic data. In addition, Regulatory Authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the patient’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate. Data management Any genotype data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca and/or designated organizations to analyse the samples. AstraZeneca and its designated organisations may share summary results (such as genetic differences from groups of individuals with a disease) from this genetic research with other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organisations or health insurance companies. This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the results of similar studies to learn even more about health and disease. The researchers can"

Researchers may see summary results but they will not be able to see i ndividual patient data or any personal identifiers. Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged with the genetic data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database. Appendix E Actions required in cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law E1 Introduction This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately report cases of Hy’s Law (HL). It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry. The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. Hy’s Law criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than drug induced liver injury (DILI) caused by the investigational medicinal product (IMP). The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. E2 Definitions Potential Hy’s Law Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3× upper limit of normal (ULN) together with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2×ULN at any point during the study following the start of study treatment irrespective of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Hy’s Law Aspartate aminotransferase or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 ×ULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, e.g. elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified time frame within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur."
112,page_112,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 113 (125)E3 Identification of potential Hy’s Law cases In order to identify cases of PHL it is importan t to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination: ! ALT ≥ 3 × ULN; ! AST ≥ 3 × ULN; ! TBL ≥ 2 × ULN. When a patient meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (and also to the AstraZeneca representative). The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the identification criteria are met, where th is is the case the Investigator will: ! Notify the AstraZeneca representative; ! Request a repeat of the test (new bl ood draw) by the central laboratory; ! Complete the appropriate unscheduled labor atory electronic case report form (eCRF) module(s) with the origina l local laboratory test result. When the identification criteria are met from cen tral or local laboratory results the Investigator will wit hout delay: ! Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Appendix E2for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previ ous visits (including both central and local laboratory results). The Investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the identif ication criteria are met will: ! Notify the AstraZeneca representative; ! Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Appendix E2for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits; ! Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory eCRF. E4 Follow-up E 4.1 Potential Hy’s Law criteria not met"
113,page_113,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 114 (125)If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will: ! Inform the AstraZeneca represe ntative that the patient has not met PHL criteria; ! Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance provided in the Clinical Study Protocol. E 4.2 Potential Hy’s Law criteria met If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will: Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any st udy visit prior to starting Study treatment (see Section 8.4 Safety reporting and medical management ) ! Notify the AstraZeneca representative who w ill then inform the central Study Team. The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach for the study patients’ follow-up and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to this contact the Investigator will: ! Monitor the patient until liver bi ochemistry pa rameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated; ! Investigate the aetiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed with the Study Physician. This includes deciding which the tests available in the HL lab kit should be used; ! Complete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information becomes available; ! If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician the PHL case meets serious criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures. E5 Review and assessment of potential Hy’s Law cases The instructions in this section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL criteria are met. No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistr y abnormality was initially detected, the Study Physician contacts the Investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP. The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other patient matter experts as appropriate. According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Investigator will follow the instructions below."
114,page_114,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 115 (125)If there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE: ! If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the appropriate eCRF; ! If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the eCRF accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes. If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other than the IMP: ! Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard processes. ∀The ‘Medically Important’ serious criteri on should be used if no other serious criteria apply; ∀As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned. If there is an unavoidable delay of over 3 weeks in obtaining the information necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made: ! Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causality assessment as per above; ! Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are met. Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the review amending the reported term if an alternative explanation for the liver biochemistry elevations is determined. E6 Actions required when potential Hy’s Law criteria are met before and after starting study treatment This section is applicable to patients who meet PHL criteria on study treatment having previously met PHL criteria at a study vis it prior to starting study treatment. At the first on-study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being met, the Investigator will determine if there has been a significant change in the patients’ condition compared with the last visit where PHL criteria were met. ! If there is no significant change, no action is required;"
115,page_115,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4.0 AstraZeneca Benralizumab - D3252C00001 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 116 (125)! If there is a significant change, notify the AstraZeneca representative, who will inform the central Study Team, then follow the subsequent process described in Appendix B5; ! A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty. E7 Actions required for repeat episodes of potential Hy’s Law This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment, and has already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit. The requirement to conduct follow-up, review, and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence. The Investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met and answer the following question: Was the alternative cause for the previous occurre nce of PHL criteria being met found to be the disease under study (e.g. chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe infection or liver disease), If No: Follow the process described in Appendix E 4.1 . If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant ch ange in the patient’s condition compared with when PHL criteria were previously met. If there is no significant change, no action is required. If there is a significant change, follow the process described in Appendix E4. A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.

Appropriate drugs, such as ep inephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc., and medical equipment to treat anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available at study sites, and study pers onnel should be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. Serum tryptase or other blood or urine testing relevant to the diagnosis of anaphylaxis may be obtained at a local lab at the discretion of the Investigator. F2 CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR DEFINING ANAPHYLAXIS Anaphylaxis In adults, anaphylaxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swo llen lips- tongue-uvula). AND AT LEAST 1 OF THE FOLLOWING (a) Respiratory compromise (e.g. dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia); (b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], s yncope, incontinence). 2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): (a) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e.g. generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen lips tongue-uvula); (b) Respiratory compromise (e.g. dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia); (c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g. hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence); (d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. crampy abdominal pain, vomiting). 3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that patient’s baseline."
