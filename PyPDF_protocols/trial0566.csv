The purpose of this study is to inve stigate the efficacy and safety of two concentrations of topically applied TMB -001 in subjects 9 years of age and older . Objectives and Endpoints Objectives Endpoints Efficacy Primary Efficacy • To investigate the efficacy of two concentrations of topically applied TMB -001 as a treatment for congenital ichthyosis (CI) of either the autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis -lamellar ichthyosis (ARCI -LI) or RXLI subtypes. Proportion of subjects with Visual Index for Ichthyosis Severity - ""treatment success"" (VIIS - 50), which is defined as a 50% or greater decrease in VIIS scaling score relative to Baseline at Visit 6 (EOS ) calculated using the sum of the scores for ‘VIIS body areas ’ that have a Baseli ne score ≥ 3. Key Secondary Efficacy • IGA scores , dichotomized to “treatment success” or “treatment failure” where “treatment success” is defined as at least a 2 -grade decrease in severity score relative to Baseline at Visit 6 (EOS) . Other Secondary Efficacy • Time to achieve VIIS -50 (≥ 50% reduction in VIIS scaling score for body sites that had a Baseline score ≥ 3) that is maintained at the next observation. • Changes in VIIS scaling score relative to Baseline at Visit 4 and Visit 5. • Proportion of subjects with IGA “treatment success” at Visit 4, Visit 5, and Visit 6 (EOS) . • Proportion of subjects with an IGA score of 0 or 1 representing “cleared” or “almost cleared” at Visit 6 (EOS ). • Changes in percent BSA relative to Baseline with CI in the Treatment/Assessment Area s at Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5, and Visit 6 (EOS) . • Change from Baseline in Itch-Numeric Rating Scale ( I-NRS ) score at Visit 6 (EOS ). • Proportion of subjects with I -NRS “treatment success” where “success” is defined as at least a"
7,page_7,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 8 Objectives Endpoints 4-point reduction in I -NRS relative to Baseline at Visit 6 (EOS ). • Change in DLQI from Baseline to Visit 6 (EOS ). Safety Safety • To investigate the safety of top ically applied TMB -001. • Incidence (severity and causality) of any local and systemic AEs. • Number of subjects with presence (and severity) at each time point of the LSRs including burning/stinging, erythema, erosions, and edema. • Changes from Baseline in vi tal signs at Visit 6 (EOS ). • Changes from Baseline in clinical laboratory test results (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) at Visit 6 (EOS ). Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; ARCI -LI = autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis -lamellar ichthyosis; BSA = body surface area; CI = congenital ichthyosis; DLQI = Dermatology Life Quality Index; EOS = End of Study; IGA = Investigator’s Global Assessme nt; I-NRS = Itch-Numeric Rating Scale; LSR = local skin reaction; RXLI = recessive X -linked ichthyosis; VIIS = Visual Index for Ichthyosis Severity. Overall Design : This is a randomized, parallel, double -blind, vehicle -controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two concentrations of topical TMB -001 for the treatment of CI in subjects with either the ARCI -LI or RXLI subtypes. The duration of treatment will be 12 weeks. Each subject will participate in the study for up to 24 weeks (including up to a 90 -day Screening period). Number of Investigators and Study Centers: Approximately 10 study centers from U nited States of America and Australia are expected to participate in this global study. Number of Subject s: Approximately 45 subjects will be enrolled (15 per treatment arm). Treatment Groups and Duration : Each subject will participate in the study for up to 24 weeks (including up to a 90 -day Screen ing period ). Eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of 3 treatment groups: 1. TMB -001, 0.05%, twice daily ( bid) 2. TMB -001, 0.1%, bid 3. Vehicle Ointment (Control), 0%, bid Temporary Discontinuation (Drug Interruption/Holiday) A treatment interruption scheme will be allowed if a subject experiences skin adverse events or local skin reactions (LSRs) during the study that may require interruption or termination of study medica tion. This is intended to assist subjects to continue in the study if the event is likely or expected to lead to discontinuation. Any subjects with a local AE (especially early during treatment) will be encouraged to continue with their study medication si nce transient skin irritation is known to develop with topical retinoids, but AEs may also develop due to the vehicle formulation or otherwise . It is desirable to make every effort to maintain subjects in the study to allow adequate assessment of efficacy and safety, especially in this small dose ranging study. If during the Treatment Phase there is for example a persistent Grade 2 or greater burning/stinging, erythema, erosions, edema or pruritus, treatment will be"
8,page_8,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 9 temporarily interrupted ( maximum of 2 we eks), and unscheduled visits/phone calls will be scheduled to monitor resolution. As soon as the LSR(s) have resolved, treatment will be restarted at a frequency of once daily for 2 weeks. If treatment is tolerated at this frequency, then treatment will be increased to twice daily or as per protocol. If necessary, a second drug interruption will be allowed according to the instructions above, as per the Investigator’s discussion and agreement with the Medical Monitor. For details see section 6.5 and 7.4 Treatment will be permanently discontinued if any of the following occurs: • If the LSR(s) do(es) not resolve with the interruption of therapy for 2 weeks, or • If the LSR(s) recur(s) during bid dosing, or • If a third drug interruption is needed. Treatment/Asses sment Area s: Treatment/Assessment Areas are defined as: Treatment area - the area of the entire body with active CI where the study medication will be applied (the entire body except for the hands, face, neck , scalp and genitalia are possible treatment areas.) Assessment Area - For the purposes of assessing via the Visual Index for Ichthyosis Severity (VIIS) Four VIIS Assessment Areas within the Treatment Area will be defined as described below and will be further described using color illustrations in the Investigator Study Binder : (a) the upper back from the posterior axillary fold to the other encompassing the T1 -T10 (b) the upper arm (excluding elbows), left or right (c) the shin/lower leg (the portion below the proximal aspect of the knee cap), left or right (d) dorsal foot (left or right). The Investigator will include subj ects when any of the 4 VIIS Assessment Areas have some CI disease . At least, 2 of the 4 VIIS Assessment Areas MUST have a scaling score of 3 or more. Since for ( b), (c), and ( d) each include two body parts, one of each left or right must be designated as the Target ( upper arm, lower leg, or dorsal foot) and followed throughout the study for VIIS assessment. The arm, leg, or foot with more severe and higher score will be designated as the Target unless they have the same severity scores, in wh ich case the left or right choice will be at the discretion of Investigator assuming no other issues exists , dictating the choice of left /right. The severity scores will be averaged by the electronic data capture system but the score of two body parts that have a score of 3 or higher will be used to enroll subjects and used in subsequent assessments. A five -point (0 -4) scale will be used with increasing clinical severity (scaling) and will be defined in the training manual. . Assessment Area - For the purp oses of assessing via the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) : IGA will be performed on the entire Treatment Area . The IGA assessment by definition will include the VIIS Assessment Area but it will provide a broader perspective on disease status and therapeutic response at baseline and subsequent visits. The IGA score is a static evaluation of the overall or “average” degree of severity of a subject’s disease, considering all the subject ’s scaling and fissuring in the IGA Assessment Area s by the Investigator or designee. This evaluation takes into consideration the 2 individual characteristics of CI (scaling and fissuring) with the IGA score at each visit representing the average degree of scaling and fissuring that is eligible for treatment. The IGA will be assessed using a 5-point scale."
9,page_9,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 10 Statistical Methods : All statistical analyses and summaries will be prepared using SAS® unless otherwise stated. All subjects enrolled in the study who were dispensed and who applied study medication at least once will be included in the analysis of safety and will be consider ed the Safety population. All randomized subjects , who received at least one dose of study medication will be considered the intent -to-treat (ITT) population. The per-protocol (PP) population will be a subset of the ITT population consisting of subjects wh o 1) met all inclusion/exclusion criteria that would affect the treatment evaluation, 2) applied ≥ 80% but ≤ 120% of the planned doses of study treatment , 3) who had a VIIS measurement at Visit 6/End of Study ( EOS ), and 4) had no major protocol violations that would affect the treatment evaluation. The final definition of the PP population will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). Efficacy analyses will be performed on both the ITT and PP populations with the ITT population consid ered primary. Additional analyses may be performed to examine the efficacy in each CI subtype or different age groups which will be described in the SAP prior to data base lock. Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group for the Safety, ITT, and PP populations. Frequency counts and percentages will be reported for categorical data and sample size, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum will be reported for the continuous variables. Efficacy Analyses: VIIS ""treatment success"" ( VIIS -50) is defined as ≥ 50% reduction from Baseline for VIIS scaling score for the sum of the scores for ‘VIIS body areas’ that had a Baseline score ≥ 3). The proportion of subjects achieving VIIS -50 at Visit 6 (EOS) relative to Baseline will be the primary efficacy endpoint and time point used to compare the two active treatments to vehicle. Treatment groups will be compared at Visit 6 (EOS ) using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) Test stratified by CI subtype and corresponding 9 5% confidence intervals will be calculated for the difference in proportions for the treatment groups . The proportion of subjects achieving IGA treatment success will be the key secondary endpoint. For this endpoint, the IGA score will be dichotomized to “treatment success” or “treatment failure” where “treatment success” is defined as at least a 2 -grade decrease in severity score relative to Baseline at Visit 6 (EOS) . Additionally, one secondary endpoint is the time to achieve VIIS -50 that is maintained at the next observation. If VIIS -50 is first achieved at Visit 6 (EOS) , then the endpoint is considered to have been met. A time to event analysis will be completed using the Kaplan -Meier method and log rank test. For each of the other secon dary efficacy endpoints (VIIS scaling, IGA, and Itch-Numeric Rating Scale [I-NRS ]), the following summaries will be prepared at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 (EOS) (as applicable) by treatment group for each CI subtype and overall: • Frequency distribution of observ ed scores • Frequency distribution of change from Baseline • Shift tables for changes from Baseline to Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 • Frequency distribution of treatment success rates Success rates between treatment groups will be compared at Visit 6 (EOS) using the CM H Test stratified by CI subtype and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the difference in proportions for the treatment groups. Descriptive statistics (including mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum) for observed and change from Baseline val ues in the Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) and percent BSA affected in the Treatment/Assessment Area s at each visit will be presented by treatment group for each CI subtype and overall."
10,page_10,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 11 For VIIS and I -NRS, the treatment groups will be compared with respect to the change from Baseline using mixed model of repeated measures (MMRM) including terms for treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, and the Baseline value serving as the covariate. From the model, the active to vehicle treatment differe nces will be estimated. Additionally, two -sided confidence intervals will be provided. Handling of missing data: Data summaries and analyses will use observed data only without imputation of missing values. Supplementary analysis will be performed to investigate the impact of data imputation on the primary endpoint as follows: 1) by assuming that subjects with missing data are treatment successes (“ best case ”); and 2) by assuming that subjects in the vehicle group with missing data are “treatment succe ss” and that subjects in the TMB -001 groups with missing data are treatment failures (“worst case”). 3) by assuming that subjects with missing data maintain their last observed rating from which treatment success or failure will be derived at Visit 6 (“LO CF”). Dosing Compliance Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize study treatment compliance for the ITT population. A subject will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the subject applies at least 80% but no more than 120% of the expected number of applications or dose . Safety Analyses: The safety analyses will be conduc ted on the Safety population. Extent of Exposure The total amount of study medication used (grams of study medication applied) will be calculated from the weights of the returned study medication tubes . Descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, minimum and maximum) will be determined for the total amount of study medication used by each subject by treatment group s. Physical Examinations Findings from physical examinations (head and neck, cardiovascular, dermatological, respiratory, gastrointestinal [abdomen ], and gross motor and gait) will be recorded in medical history (from assessment at Visit 1 [Screening] and Visit 2 [Baseline ]) Vital Signs Descriptive statistics of vital signs (temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate) at Visit 1 (Screening ) and Visit 6 (EOS) will be provided by treatment group . Clinical Laboratory Tests Clinical laboratory tests w ill be evaluated for any material changes during the study period. All laboratory data (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be listed and reported in the units received by the laboratory. Shift tables by analyte and by out of range flag will be pre sented to facilitate the evaluation of change from Visit 1 (Screening ) to Visit 6 (EOS ). Urine Pregnancy Test Urine pregnancy test ( UPT ) results (if applicable) from Visit 2 (Baseline ), Visit 4, Visit 5, and Visit 6 (EOS ) will be provided in a listing. Local Skin Reactions Local skin reactions ( LSRs ) (including burning/stinging, erythema, erosions, and edema) will be summarized by frequency of each individual LSR for each treatment group . Change from Baseline in LSRs will be categorized into ‘worsened’ and ‘same or improved’ and will be tabulated."

14,page_14,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 15 2.0 INTRODUCTION The classification of congenital ichthyosis ( CI) is complex because the disorder presents in a multitude of forms and phenotypes . The main features, however, are scaling and often thicke ning of the skin (1). The presentation and severity of symptoms can differ greatly by patient and by the form of ichthyosis, but generally include skin inflammation and fragility, pruritus, fissuring and cracking of thickened skin, ectropion, anhidrosis, and in some severe cases, an increased susceptibility to infection. Recessive X -linked ichthyosis (RXLI) , which occurs at a frequency of about one in 2500 (in males), is clinically characterized by widespread, dar k brown, polygonal scales, and generalized dryness (2). The diagnosis can be confirmed using genetic testing to identify a complete deletion of the ge ne encoding steroid sulfatase (STS) that is located at the terminus of the X chromosome (3). Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis -lamellar ichth yosis (ARCI -LI), which occurs at a frequency of about one in 100,000 to 300,000, is a member of the nonsyndromic autosomal recessive CI group which manifests itself clinically as hyperkeratosis and dry, scaling skin across the entire body (4); pathogenesis is related to a severely disturbed barrier function due either abnormal corneocytes or to a defective deposition of stratum corneum lipids and is typ ically caused by truncation or missense mutations in the gene encoding keratinocyte transglutaminase type 1 (TGM1) (1, 4). Isotretinoin is a “natural” retinoid (13 -cis isomer of naturally occurring treti noin [all -trans -retinoic acid{RA} ]) that was initially developed as a synthetic retinoid, but it is also present in cells as a naturally occurring metabolite (5). Isotretinoin is structurally and pharmacologically related to vitamin A, which regulates epithelial cell growth and differentiation (6). Isotretinoin has several pharmacological mechanisms of action that result in the suppression of sebaceous gland activity, reduction of sebum production, reduction of comedogenesis by decreasing hyperkeratinization, suppression of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes ), and reduction of inflammation (7). Isotretinoin has at least 5 biologically important metabolites: 13 -cis-4-oxo-RA (4-oxo-isotretinoin), all -trans -RA (tr etinoin), all -trans -4-oxo-RA (4 -oxo-tretinoin), 9 -cis-RA (alitretinoin), and 9-cis-4-oxo-RA; and can be considered a pro -drug, in which isotretinoin can be metabolized into the naturally occurring tretinoin (or one of the other metabolites) as the active intracellular moiety (7). In addition, while some of isotretinoin’s activity may be mediated by tretinoin, the isomerization of isotretinoin (13 -cis-RA) into tretinoi n (all -trans -RA) does not account for all of the pharmacological effects observed upon use of this retinoid (8). Thus, isotretinoin’s broader range of activity compared to other retinoids makes it advantageous for clinical development. Oral isotretinoin (Accutane® ) capsules was first approved by the United States ( US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatment for severe recalcitrant nodular acne in 1982 (9). Teratogenicity is regarded as one of the most serious potential adverse effects of oral retinoids, while common mucocutaneous side effects are dose -depend ent and can be managed by modification of the dose (eg, reductions and/or drug holidays) and additional symptomatic therapy"
15,page_15,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 16 (eg, moisturizers). Topical formulation of isotretinoin, Isotrex® gel and cream, 0.05%, has since been approved in various countries outside of the US for the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris, characterized by comedones, papules, and pustules (6,10). Another topical formulation, isotretinoin cream, 0.1%, has also been studied in various indications including ichthyosis and other disorders of keratinization (11,12) and acne vulgaris (13, 14, 15, 16, 17). 2.1 Study Rationale Systemic retinoids, including isotretinoin, have been used for the investigational treatment of CI and have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in reducing the clinical signs of the disease while dosing of the drug is maintained. Although not FDA approved, topical formulations of isotretinoin (eg, 0.05% gel and 0.1% cream) have demonstrated some efficacy in reducing the clinical signs associated with ichthyosis and other disorders of keratini zation. Timber Pharmaceuticals, LLC is developing a topical ointment (0.05 % and 0.1%) formulation of isotretinoin called TMB -001 (previously PAT -001) (isotretinoin) ointment for the treatment of CI, including RXLI and ARCI - LI subtypes . For ARCI -LI subjects , enrollment is not limited to Transglutaminase 1 mutations. Other genetically confirmed ARCI -LI mutations can potentially be enrolled as long as the phenotype is consistent with ARCI -LI and the other inclusion criteria are met, as determined by the Invest igator . The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of two concentrations of topically applied TMB -001 in subjects 9 years of age and older . More recently, a pilot Phase 2a, multicenter study in subjects ≥ 12 years of age showed top ically applied TMB -001 ointment (0.1%) to be safe, tolerable, and supporting a favorable efficacy signal with improvement in overall Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) for CI treatment. 2.2 Background Congenital ichthyosis is a large, heterogeneous family of inherited skin disorders of cornification resulting from an abnormality of skin keratinization (1). The man agement of CI is a life -long endeavor, which remains largely symptomatic (ie, emollients with or without keratolytic s) and commonly focused on reducing scaling and/or skin lubrication with both systemic and topical treatments (1). A first -line therapy includes hydration and lubrication accomplished by creams and ointments containing low concentrations of salt, urea, or glycerol, which increases the water -binding capac ity of the horny layer. Addition of keratolytic s is used to decrease corneocyte cohesiveness, to promote desquamation, and to dissolve keratins and lipids (eg, α -hydroxy acids, salicylic acid, high-dose urea, propylene glycol, N-acetylcysteine, and retinoi ds). Systemic retinoid treatment is reserved for those patients who are refractory to topical agents because of long -term adverse effects and teratogenicity (5); however, the investigational use of oral isotretinoin has demonstrated remarkable efficacy when used for the treatment of ichthyoses and is believed to be attributable to isotretinoin’s ability to reduce comedogenesis by decreasing hyperkeratinization (1, 5). For the treatment of CI, it would be desirable to have a topical for mulation of isotretinoin as it would afford targeted delivery of the"
16,page_16,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 17 drug at the disease tissue site, while potentially minimizing systemic exposure compared to that of systemic retinoid treatment , and additionally providing hydration and lubrication to th e diseased skin. 2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment While no topical isotretinoin formulation is approved for use in treatment of CI (or any indication in the US), t opical formulations of isotretinoin (eg, 0.05% gel and 0.1% cream) have demonstrated some efficacy in reducing the clinical signs associated with ichthyosis and other disorders of keratinization. In one study, topical 13 -cis-RA (isotretinoin) cream 0.1% demonstrated a marked reduction in scaling and an improvement in skin smoothness after 4 weeks of treatm ent in 40% of subjects (2/7 patients with non -erythrodermic LI, 2/2 patients with Darier’s disease, and 0/1 patients with autosomal dominant ichthyosis vulgaris). However, this clinical improvement was accompanied by local skin irritation (eg, itchy erythe ma) in responders, and dose modifications were often prescribed to mitigate such effects (12). Similarly, topical isotretinoin gel, 0.05% (Isotrex®) demonstrated partial resolution or clearance of hyperkeratosis and papules in the treatment area (10 cm2 area) after 3 months of treatment (up to twice daily [bid] as tolerated) in 50% (6/12) of patients with Darier’s disease. In addition, systemic retinoi ds, including isotretinoin, have been used for the investigational treatment of CI and have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in reducing the clinical signs of the disease while dosing of the drug is maintained (1, 5). More recently, a pilot Phase 2a, multicenter study in subjects ≥ 12 years of age showed topically applied TMB -001 ointment (0.1%) to be safe, tolerable, and supporting a favorable efficacy signal with improvement in overall IGA for CI treatment. As with any retinoid, the side effects of TMB -001 may include the following local skin reactions (LSRs) : burning, dryness, edema, erythema, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, photosensitivity, pruritus, scaling/peeling, stinging, and tenderness. Although systemic exposure is expected to be low given the route of topical administration . In minipigs receiving once daily derma l applications of TMB 001 ointment at concentrations of 0% (control), 0.025%, 0.1%, and 0.2%, there was little to no systemic absorption of isotretinoin with most values being near or below the limit of quantitation (0.374 ng/mL). In addition, in a Phase 2a clinical study of subjects with CI , the concentrations of isotretinoin and tretinoin were measured . Plasma concentrations of isotretinoin and tretinoin indicated that systemic exposure was minimal within the 4 hours following initial application. Trough concentrations measured on Days 8, 29, 57 and 84 approximately 12 hours following the preceding dose indicated that systemic concentrations of isotretinoin and tretinoin were within range of the endogenous levels measured at Baseline pr ior to the first application."
17,page_17,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 18 The most notable adverse reactions with oral isotretinoin are: dry lip, dry skin, back pain, dry eye, arthralgia, epistaxis, headache, nasopharyngitis, chapped lips, dermatitis, renal or hepatotoxicity, musculoskeletal discomfort, teratogenicity, and visual acuity reduced. The following are concerns for women of chil dbearing potential ( WOCBP ): • Severe birth defects can occur during pregnancy while taking oral isotretinoin, with any amount and even if taken for short periods of time; • Pregnancy must be avoided 1 month before, during, and for 1 month after treatment .

Approximately 10 study centers from United States of America and Australia are expected to participate in this global study. The duration of treatment will be 12 weeks. Each subject will participate in the study for up to 24 weeks (including up to a 90 -day Screen ing period). 4.1.1 Treatment Groups Eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1. TMB -001 Ointment , 0.05%, bid 2. TMB -001 Ointment , 0.1%, bid 3. Vehicle Ointment (Control) , 0%, bid 4.1.2 Treatment/Assessment Area s Treatment/Assessment Areas are defined as: 4.1.2.1 Treatment Area The area of the entire body with active CI where the study medication will be applied (the entire body except for the hands, face, nec k, scalp and genitalia are possible treatment areas.) 4.1.2.2 The Visual Index for Ichthyosis Severity (VIIS) Assessment Area s The primary efficacy assessment will be performed using the Visual Index for Ichthyosis Severity (VIIS). Four VIIS Assessment Areas will be defined as described below and will be further described using color illustrations in the Investigator Study Binder : (a) the upper back from the posterior axillary fold to the other encompassing the T1 -T10, (b) the upper arm (excluding elbow), left or right , (c) the shin/lower leg (the portion below the proximal aspect of the knee cap), left or right (d) dorsal foot (left or right) ."
21,page_21,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 22 The Investigator will include subjects when any of the 4 VIIS Assessment Areas have some CI disease . At least 2 of the 4 VIIS Assessment Areas MUST have a scaling score of 3 or more. Since for ( b), (c), and ( d) each include two body part s, one of each left or right must be designated as the Target ( upper arm, lower leg, or dorsal foot) and followed throughout the study for VIIS assessment. The arm, leg, or foot with more severe and higher score will be designated as the Target unless they have the same severity scores, in which case the left or right choice will be at the discretion of Investigator assuming no other issues exist s, dictating the choice of left/right. The severity scores will be averaged by the electronic data capture system but the score of two body parts that have a score of 3 or higher will be used to enroll subjects and used in subsequent assessments. A five -point (0 -4) scale will be used with increasing clinical severity (scaling) and will be defined in the training manual. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects with VIIS ""treatment success"" (VIIS -50), which is defined as a 50% or greater decrease in VIIS scaling score relative to Baseline at Visit 6, End of Study ( EOS ) calculated u sing only the VIIS body areas described above that have a Baseline score ≥ 3. VIIS severity will be calculated as above via one of two methods below • On-site visual inspection of the VIIS areas • Virtual/ Remote visit comprised of both photographs and tele -medicine utilizing synchronous video -conferencing technology. The severity score at each visit will be based off information gathered from both sources to yield one score. 4.1.2.3 The Investigator ’s Global Assessment (IGA) Assessment Area The IGA will be performed on the entire Treatment Area. The IGA assessment will inherently include the VIIS Area but it will provide a broader perspective on disease status and therapeutic response at baseline and subsequent visits. The IGA score is a static evaluation of the over all or “average” degree of severity of a subject’s disease, considering all the subject’s scaling and fissuring in the - Treatment Area s by the Investigator or designee. This evaluation takes into consideration the 2 individual characteristics of CI (scaling and fissuring) with the IGA score at each visit representing the average degree of scaling and fissuring that is eligible for treatme nt. The IGA will be assessed using the 5-point scale as shown in Table 3. IGA severity will be calculated as above via one of two methods below: • On-site visual inspection • Virtual/ Remote visit comprised of both photographs and tele -medicine utilizing synchronous video conferencing technology .

22,page_22,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 23 4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design The proposed study will use a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, vehicle -controlled study design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.1% and 0.05% TMB -001 in the treatment of CI. The subject s will be selected according to predefined entry criteria. The study treatment duration is 12 weeks and expected to be enough to show a treatment effect. Isotretinoin was first approved in the US by the FDA and formulated as an oral product, Accutane (isotretinoin) capsules, to treat severe recalcitrant nodular acne (9). A topical formulation of isotretinoin, Isotrex® (isotretinoin) gel, 0.05%, has been approved in various countries outside of the US for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vu lgaris (6). The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of isotretinoin have been well characterized in the literature. Isotretinoin is an approved active phar macological ingredient with a long history of safe use in humans under the iPLEDGE program (18). The iPLEDGE program is a risk management distribution program mandat ed by the FDA for isotretinoin because isotretinoin must not be used by female patients who are or may become pregnant. There is an extremely high risk that severe birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking oral isotretinoin in any amount, even for a short period of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. 4.3 Justification for Dose The concentrations of TMB -001 ointment chosen for this study are based on the formulation integrity and Phase 2a clinical study, specific laboratory animal toxicology studies performed by the Sponsor , and a review of the published safety data for isotretinoin . The highest dose (0.2% topically applied ointment) tested in the Phase 2a clinical study was report ed with retinoid dermatitis and lower tolerability, hence doses lower than 0.2% have been considered for this study. The dose s to be applied , 0.1% and 0.05%, are based upon the potential for therapeutic benefit balanced with the safety risk. 4.4 End of Study D efinition A subject is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed the last scheduled visit (Visit 6) per the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.2). The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last subject in the study globally."
23,page_23,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 24 5.0 STUDY POPULATION The subjects will be male and/or female subjects, 9 years of age and older , with moderate to severe CI genetically confirmed to be of either the ARCI -LI or RXLI subtypes according to protocol -specified definitions. Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers o r exemptions, is not permitted. 5.1 Inclusion Criteria To enter the study, a subject must meet the following criteria: 1. Subject is male or female, 9 years of age and older at Visit 2 (Baseline ). 2. Subject has provided written informed consent/assent. A subject u nder 18 years of age must provide written informed assent and be accompanied by the parent or legal guardian at the time of consent/assent signing. The parent or legal guardian must provide informed consent for the subject. If a subject becomes 18 years of age during the study, the subject must provide written informed consent at that time to continue study participation. 3. Females must be postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea greater than 12 consecutive months in women 50 years of age and older) , surgically sterile (hysterectomy , bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) , or use acceptable forms of birth control. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) at Visit 2 (Baseline ) (UPTs must have a minimum se nsitivity to detect 25 mIU beta -human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG ]/mL). Methods of acceptable contraception are further defined in Appendix 6 . Female subjects who become sexually active or begin to have relations with a partner during the study must agree to use 2 forms of birth control for 30 days prior to having relations and to continue such forms for the duration of the study. 4. Subject has cli nical diagnosis of CI and has a genetic confirmation of either ARCI -LI (eg, transglutaminase 1 -deficient) or RXLI (eg, deletion of steroid sulfatase gene) subtypes of CI. For ARCI -LI subjects, enrollment is not limited to Transglutaminase 1 mutations. Othe r genetically confirmed ARCI -LI mutations can potentially be enrolled as long as the phenotype is consistent with ARCI -LI and the other inclusion criteria are met, as determined by the Investigator . Congenital Ichthyosis XomeDxSlice will be used to diagno se both RXLI and ARCI -LI. GeneDx tests detect transglutaminase mutations in the TGM1 gene, X -linked recessive steroid sulfatase mutations in the STS gene, and additionally analyzes 47 other genes linked to CI. This is a multi -gene panel testing so that all known causes of CI can be confirmed/ruled -out since there is phenotypic overlap between the subtypes (including STS). The tests are considered Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) and are thus regulated per US regulations 42 CFR 493 and the laboratory is acc redited by the College of American Pathologists."

All study treatments must be stored in a secure , environmentally controlled , and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator and authorized study center staff. The Investigator or designee is responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance ( i.e., receipt, reconciliation , and final di sposition records) using the Drug Accountability Form. These forms must be available for inspection at all times . Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study medication are provided in the Investigator Study Binder . 6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized to a treatment group in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by CI subtype."
29,page_29,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 30 All subjects will be centrally assigned to randomized study treatment using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Before the study is initiated, the log in information and directions for the IWRS will be provided to each study center. Study medication use will be accounted and dispensed at the study visits as summarized in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.2). In this double -blind study, all personnel invo lved, ie , physicians, site staff, and participants will remain blinded at all times, except in an emergency , where knowledge of the randomi zation code is required to provide appropriate treatment. In case of an emergency, the Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment is warranted. Subject safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, every effort should b e made to contact the Sponsor and Medical Monitor prior to unblinding a subject’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the subject. If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hour s after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and electronic Case Report Form (eCRF ), as applicable. 6.4 Study Treatment Compliance The prescribed dosage, timing, and mode of administrati on may not be changed, except as defined in Section 7.4. Any departures from the intended regimen must be recorded in the eCRFs. During the course of the study, c ompliance to study drug application will be evaluated via Subject diaries and accounta bility by the site, including weighing the tubes. Subject s exhibiting poor compliance should be counseled on the importance of good compliance to the study dosing regimen . 6.5 Concomitant Therapy Prohibited medications include the use of the following in the Treatment Area s: • Topical retinoids or any other topical prescription or over -the-counter therapies that are intended for, or that in the opinion of the Investigator may improve , CI within 2 weeks of Visit 2 (Baseline ) and until the Visit 6 (EOS ); • Keratolytics, or topical corticosteroids within 7 days prior to Visit 2 (Baseline ) and until the Visit 6 (EOS ); and, • Topical products, at Visit 2 (Baseline) and until the Visit 6 (EOS ). Bland emollient s and over the counter low potency hydrocortisone (e.g., 1% cream) may only be used in the event of severe discomfort ( e.g., burning/erythema /itch) and if it is the opinion of the Investigator that a drug interruption (per section 7.4) alone will not relieve the symptoms and these may"

The duration of the mitigation plan should not exceed 2 weeks . • Topical antibiotic or antifungal can be used after consultation and at the discretion of the Investigator. Systemic antifungals or antibiotics must be prescribed by the Investigator if necessary to avoid risk of more serious or broader infections . The following systemic treatments are prohibited: • Vitamin A supplements or St. John’s Wort within 4 weeks prior to Visit 2 (Baseline ) and until the Visit 6 (EOS ) Note: Use of a multivitamin including Vitamin A is not exclusionary provided it is taken as directed as on the packaging ; • Retinoids within 12 weeks of Visit 2 (Baseline ) or any other systemic therapies which are intended for or may improve CI within 4 wee ks of Visit 2 (Baseline ) and until the Visit 6 (EOS ); and, • Immunosuppressive drugs, including systemic corticosteroids, within 2 weeks of Visit 2 (Baseline ) and until the Visit 6 (EOS) . The use of UV light is prohibited within 4 weeks prior to Visit 2 (Baseline ) and until the Visit 6 (EOS ). Further, subjects should limit exposure to UV via sun light and avoid tanning beds. Subject s may not be enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or ha ve used an investigational drug or investigational device tr eatment within 30 days prior to Visit 2 (Baseline ). Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins , and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded on the eCRF along with : • Reason for use ; • Dates of administration including start and end dates ; and, • Dosage informati on including dose and frequency . The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any ques tions regarding concomitant or prior therapy. 6.6 Dose Regimen Modification Dose regimen modification is not allowed in this study, except for a structured treatment interruption scheme (drug holiday) as detailed in Section 7.4. 6.7 Treatment after the End of the Study The Sponsor will not provide any additional care to subjects after they leave the study because such care should not differ from what is normally expected for subject s with CI."

If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section 8.4.5 and Appendix 6 . 7.2 Inadvertent Enrollment If a subject who does not meet en rollment criteria is inadvertently enrolled, that subject must be discontinued from study treatment; and the Sponsor or Sponsor designee must be contacted. 7.3 Adverse Events A subject may discontinue from the study due to an SAE or AE. In that case, the proc edures in Section 8.4 must be followed. See the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.2) for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed . 7.4 Temporary Discontinuation (Drug Interruption/ Holida y) A treatment interruption scheme will be allowed if a subject experiences skin adverse events or LSRs during the study that may require interruption or termination of study medication . This is intended to assist subjects to continue in the study if the event is likely or expected to lead to discontinuation. Any subjects with a LSR (especially early during treatment) will be encouraged to continue with their study medication since trans ient skin irritation is known to develop with topical retinoids, but LSRs may also develop due to the vehicle formulation or other reasons . It is desirable to make every effort to maintain subjects in the study to allow adequate assessment of efficacy an d safety , especially in this small dose -ranging study. If during the Treatment Phase there is a persistent Grade 2 or greater adverse event , treatment can be temporarily interrupted, and unscheduled visits/phone calls will be scheduled to monitor resolutio n. Supportive action (per section 6.5) can be undertaken, if in the opinion of the Investigator the drug interruption alone will not relieve the symptoms and may cause the subject to discontinue from study . As soon as the LSR(s) have resolved, study medic ation will be restarted at a frequency of once daily for 2 weeks. If treatment is tolerated at this frequency, then treatment will be increased to twice daily or as per protocol. If necessary, a second drug interruption will be allowed according to the ins tructions above, as per the Investigator’s discussion and agreement with the Medical Monitor."
32,page_32,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 33 Treatment will be permanently discontinued if any of the following occurs: • If the LSR(s) do(es) not resolve with the interruption of therapy for 2 weeks, or • If the LSR(s) recur(s) during bid dosing, or • If a third drug interruption is needed. 7.5 Subject Discontinuation/ Withdrawal from the Study Subjects may be discontinued/withdrawn from the study for reasons that include, but are not limited to, the following: • A subject may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or he/she may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral , compliance, or administrative reasons . • If the subject withdraws consen t for disclos ure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent . • If a subject withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested , and the Investigator must document this in the study center study records . • See Section 1.2 for the data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. The discontinuation of specific study centers or of the study are handled as part of Appendix 2 . 7.6 Lost to Follow -Up A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and the study center is unable to contact him/her as described below . The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: • The study center must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the m issed visit as soon as possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study. • Before a subject is deemed lost to fo llow-up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and , if necessary , a certified letter to the subject ’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject ’s medical record . • If the subject continue s to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study and lost to follow -up."

Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Sche dule of Activities , is essential and required for study conduct. Procedures conducted as part of the subject’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing the informed consent form (ICF) may be utilized for Screen ing or Baseli ne purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the Schedule of Activities. All Screen ing evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects meet all eli gibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record the details of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Protocol waivers or exemptions may be permitted at the Spons or’s discretion, especially when mitigating factors associated with a global pandemic and other situations that arise that are outside the control of the Sponsor and/or Investigator. Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discontinue study treatment. 8.1 Study Visits This study will consist of 6 visits as described in the Schedul e of Activities ( Section 1.2). The maximum amount of blood collected from each subject over the duration of the study will be approximately 20 mL. R epeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 8.1.1 Visit 1 (Screening) Screening will occur at Visit 1 (Day -90 to Day -7). Subjects can be screened for the study up to approximately 90 days before Baseline . During Screen ing, the study requirements and procedures will be reviewed and written informed consent/assent will be obtained prior to the initiation of any study -related procedures. Following informed consent, a review of inclusio n exclusion will be conducted so that the Investigator can assess if the subject is likely to be eligible for enrollment. Once this is confirmed, the availability of genetic testing confirming the diagnosis of CI and specific subtype will be addressed. Sub jects who already have had genetic test documenting ARCI -LI or RXLI types of CI will not be required to provide samples for genetic testing. However, the subject must provide the Investigator with a copy of the genetic report for the source documentation f ile. Subjects requiring genetic testing, will have a buccal specimen obtained and sent for analysis. Following confirmation of the appropriate genetic subtype, the following procedures will be completed in the Screening period; Demographics, medical histor y, concomitant medications, physical exam, vital signs, clinical evaluation of extent and location of CI, percent BSA with CI in the Treatment Area, as well as in the VIIS Assessment Area, and"

At least 2 of the 4 VIIS Assessment Areas MUST have a scaling score of 3 or more. The upper arm, lower leg/s hin, and dorsal foot each include left and right body parts. Therefore, one of each left or right must be designated as the Target ( upper arm, lower leg, or dorsal foot) and followed throughout the study for VIIS assessment. The arm, leg, or foot with more severe and higher score will be designated as the Target unless they have the same severity scores, in which case the left or right choice will be at the discretion of Investigator assuming no other issues exists , dictating the choice of left /right. The s everity scores will be averaged by the electronic data capture system but the score of the two body parts that have a score of 3 or higher will be used to enroll subjects and used in subsequent assessments. The location of the CI to be treated and the per cent body surface area (BSA) with CI in the Treatment Area and in the VIIS Assessment Area s will be recorded prior to application of study medication. Scaling in the VIIS Assessment Area s will be graded using the 5 -point VIIS scale: 0 to 4. This is a visual assessment tool to assist with scoring in 4 specific body sites, so it is essential to include at least 2 or more of the 4 body sites with CI in the Treatment/Assessment Area s. The Asse ssment Area s are described in Section 4.1.2.1 . Visual Index for Ichthyosis Severity “ Treatment success ” (VIIS -50) is defined as a 50% or greater decrease in VIIS scal ing score relative to Baseline at Visit 6 (EOS ) calculated using the sum of the scores for ‘VIIS body areas ’ that have a Baseline score ≥ 3."
37,page_37,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 38 VIIS severity will be calculated as above using the scores obtained via one of two methods below: a) On-site visual inspection of the VIIS areas b) Virtual/ Remote visit comprised of both photographs and tele -medicine utilizing synchronous video conferencing technology . The severity score at each visit will be based off information gathered from both sources to yiel d one score. 8.2.2 Investigator’s Global Assessment The IGA score is a static evaluation of the overall or “average” degree of severity of a subject’s disease, considering all the subject’s scaling and fissuring in the Treatment Area s by the Investigator or des ignee. This evaluation takes into consideration the 2 individual characteristics of CI (scaling and fissuring) with the IGA score at each visit representing the average degree of scaling and fissuring that is eligible for treatment. The Treatment Area s are described in Section 4.1.2.2 . The IGA will be assessed using the following 5 -point scale shown in Table 3: Table 3 Investigator ’s Global Assessment Score (5-Point Scale ) 0 = Clear No scaling and no roughness, no fissure 1 = Almost Clear Occasional fine scales, hardly palpable roughness (mostly smooth) no fissure 2 = Mild Small and fine scales predominate, no more than a few large scales, mild roughness on palpation, few fissures may be present 3 = Moderate Large rather thick scales predominate, coarse roughness on palpation, few fissures may b e present 4 = Severe Large coalescent scales dominate, sharp edges on palpation with plate -like hyperkeratosis, many fissures may be present IGA severity will be calculated as above using the scores obtained via one of the two methods below: c) On-site visual inspection d) Virtual/r emote visit comprised of both photographs and tele -medicine utilizing synchronous v ideoconferencing technology . The severity score at each visit will be based off information gathered from both sources to yield one score. 8.2.3 Itch-Numeric Rating Scale Pruritus will be assessed with a self -administered Patient Reported Outcome questionnaire using the I-NRS at Visit 2 (Baseline ), Visit 5, and at Visit 6 (EOS ). Subjects will indicate itch severity by circling the integer that best describes the worst level of itching due to CI in the past 24 hours on an 11 -point scale anchored at 0 representing “no itching” and 10 representing “worst itch imaginable .” (see Appendix 11 ). The study staff should review the I -NRS with each subject and"
38,page_38,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 39 ask him/her to indicate the response that best describes his/her experience. Pruritus assessed b y this evaluation should be reported as an AE only if therapy is required. 8.2.4 Percent Body Surface Area with Active Congenital Ichthyosis in the Treatment/Assessment Area s The percent BSA with active CI within the Treatment Area will be calculated at Visit 1 (Screening ). The Treatment Area includes all affected skin excluding the hands, face, neck , scalp and genitalia . This calculation is confirmed at Visit 2 (Baseline) and assessed at all follow -up visits. The minimum affected area to be treated will be no less than 10% and no more than 90% of the whole BSA at Visit 1 (Screening ). In addition , the percent BSA with active CI within the designated VIIS /Assessment Area s will be calculated at Visit 1 (Screening ) and at all follow -up visits . Note that the Tr eatment Area is at least equal to or larger than the VIIS Assessment Area. Based on the Treatment and VIIS Assessment Area s selected in a given subject and the extent of his/her disease, these two areas may or may not be the same. Two examples are provided below for clarity: Treatment Area % BSA VIIS Assessment area % BSA Subject 1 90% (entire body minus hands, face, neck, scalp , genitalia) 24% (upper back, upper arms, lower legs and dorsal feet) Subject 2 70% 13% (upper back and upper arms) 8.2.5 Dermatology Life Quality Index The DLQI (Dermatology Quality of Life Index ), is a dermatology -specific Quality of Life instrument. Age-appropriate DLQI will be completed at Visit 2 (Baseline ), Visit 5, and Visit 6 (EOS ). The standard DLQI is a questionnaire designed for subjects ≥ 16 years of age that measure s the impact of skin disease on the previous week’s quality of life. There are 10 questions r elated to the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, treatment (see Appendix 9 ). Questions are scored from 0 to 3 with a possible score range from 0 (no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (maximum impact on quality of life). The score ranges are shown in Table 4. Table 4 Dermatology Life Quality Index Scale 0 to 1 = No effect on patient’s life 2 to 5 = Small effect"
39,page_39,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 40 6 to 10 = Moderate effect 11 to 20 = Very large effect 21 to 30 = Extremely large effect. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is the minimum difference in score that is meaningful for a subject . This is considered 4 for inflammatory skin diseases. Children’s DLQI will be used for subjects < 16 years of age to measure the impact of skin disease on the previous week’s quality of life. There are 10 questions related to the following topics: symptoms and feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, treatment (see Appendix 10 ). Questions are scored from 0 to 3 with a possible score range from 0 (no effect on child’s life) to 30 (extremely large effect). The score ranges are shown in Table 5. Table 5 Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index Scale 0 to 1 = No effect on child’s life 2 to 6 = Small effect 7 to 12 = Moderate effect 13 to 18 = Very large effect 19 to 30 = Extremely large effect. 8.3 Safety Assessments The p lanned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.2). 8.3.1 Physical Exam ination s A brief physical exami nation will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening ).Abbreviated examination / subject disposition will be conducted at Visit 2 (Baseline) to identify any changes since the Screening visit and at Visit 6 EOS to assess for any changes during the study . The examination will evaluate head and neck, dermatological, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointest inal (abdomen), and gross motor and gait body assessments . Abnormalities at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2 (Baseline ) prior to treatment will be recorded as medical history. Any new or worsening abnormalities at Visit 6 (EOS ) will be recorded as AEs. 8.3.2 Vital Signs Vital signs including temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate will be measured at Visit 1 (Screening ) and Visit 6 (EOS ). Assessments will be made after the subject has rested in a seated position for at least 5 minutes in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones) . Height and weight will only be measured at Visit 1 (Screening )."
40,page_40,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 41 8.3.3 Local Skin Reactions At every study visit (except Screening), the Investigator or designee will evaluate LSRs known to be associated with retinoids (burning/stinging, erythema, erosions, and edema) or other causes regardless of blinded causality assessment within the areas treated with study medication using a 4-point ordinal scale where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. Note: At Visit 2 (Baseline ), the LSR assessment must be performed prior to the application of study medication . Only LSRs that require medical intervention (eg , prescription medication) or that require withholding application of the study medication will be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded as AEs. For drug interruption due to LSRs, refer structured drug interruption scheme ( drug holiday) described in Section 7.4. 8.3.4 Electrocardiogram s Electrocardiogram monitoring will not be performed in this study. 8.3.5 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Urine and blood samples will be collected from each subject for safety laboratory analys es at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 6 (EOS ). Subjects must be fasting ( at least 8 hours) for Visit 1 (Screening ) and, if possible, for Visit 6 (EOS ); however, if a subject arrives at the clinic for Visit 6 (EOS ) without fasting for at least 8 hours, laboratory specimens may be collected as non -fasting, at the discretion of the Investigator, and with the appropriate fasting status documented on the laboratory requisition form. For subjects that will have the Visit 6 (EOS) conducted remotely, urine and blood samples may be collected by a home health care provider supplied by the Sponsor. See Appendix 3 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.2) for the timing and frequency. The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those that are not associated with the underlying disease unless judged by the Investigator to be out of range to a grea ter degree than expected for the subject ’s condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 30 days after the last dose of study medication should be repeated until the values , stabilize, return to normal or Baseline , or are no longer considered clinically significant by the Investigator or Medical Monitor . • If such values do not return to normal /Baseline within a period judged reasonable by the Investigator , the etiology should be identified , and the Sponsor should be notified."
41,page_41,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 42 • All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 3 , must be conducted in accordance with t he laboratory manual and the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.2). • If laboratory values from non-protocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in subject management or are considered clinically significant by the Investigator (eg, SAE , AE, dose interruption ), then the results must be recorded in the eCRF. Any new or worsening of clinically significant abnormalities at Visit 6 (EOS ) will be recorded as AEs. 8.4 Adverse Events All AEs will be recorded. At each post -Baseline Visit, subjects will also be questioned specifically about the status of any ongoing A Es. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 . Adverse events will be reported by the subject (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the subject’s legally authorized representative). The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and r ecording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study medication or study procedures, or that caused the subject to discontinue the study (see Section 7.0). The trial blind may be broken for an individual only if knowledge of the IMP is essential for clinical management of the subject. 8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A dverse Event and S erious Adverse Event Information All AEs and SAEs will be collected from signing the ICF until the Visit 6 (EOS ) at the time points specified in the S chedule of Activities (Section 1.2). All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 4 . The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE information after the conclusion of study participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study medication or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor . The method s of recording, evaluating, and assessing the causalit y of AEs and SAE s and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 ."
42,page_42,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 43 8.4.2 Method of Detecting A dverse Events and S erious Adverse Events Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subjec t is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. 8.4.3 Follow -Up of A dverse Events and S erious Adverse Events After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.6). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for S erious Adverse Events Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatme nt under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB s)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC s), and Investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR s) according to local regulatory requirements and the Sponsor ’s policy and forwarded to the Investigators as necessary. An Investigator who receives an Inves tigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information ( eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.4.5 Pregnancy A UPT will be performed at Visit 2 (Baseline ), Visit 4, Visit 5, and Visit 6 (EOS ) for WOCBP. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may not be administered TMB -001 ointment . If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 6 . Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs."
43,page_43,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 44 8.4.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest No events will be considered as AEs of special interest for this study. 8.4.7 Disease-Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as Adverse Events or S erious Adverse Events Disease attributes that are associated with underlying disease condition should not be reported as AEs. Local skin reactions associated with reti noids should not be reported as AEs unless the LSRs required medical intervention or withholding application of study medication (refer Section 8.3.3 for complete details). 8.5 Treatment of Overdose Overdose in this study can be defined as either oral ingestion of a tube of TMB -001 or applying the TMB -001 ointment more than the protocol specifi ed regimen of twice daily. Oral ingestion of a tube of TMB -001 ointment 0.1% would result in less exposure than achieved with the recommended dosage of oral isotretinoin. Consequently, the theoretical occurrence of symptoms of overdosage (eg , hypervitaminosis A) is highly unlikely. If a subject does receive an overdose of TMB -001 ointment , the subject should be counseled about the teratogenicity of isotretinoin and counseled on the prevention of pregnancy. Any WOCBP must be evaluated for pregn ancy and must be warned to avoid pregnancy per the contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol for at least 1 month after overdose. Men should use a condom or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a female who is or might become pregnant for at least 1 month after an overdose. Subjects who present with an overdose should not donate blood for at least 1 month. In the event of an overdose, the Investigator should: 1. Contact the Medical Monitor immediately. 2. Closely monitor the subject for any AEs, SAEs, an d laboratory abnormalities for 1 month after the overdose. 3. Obtain a plasma sample for pharmacokinetic analysis if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case -by-case basis). 4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the eCRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject."

For ARCI -LI subjects, enrollment is not limited to Transglutaminase 1 mutations. Other genetically confirmed ARCI -LI mutations can potentially be enrolled as long as the phenotype is consistent with ARCI -LI and the other inclusion criteria are met, as determined by the Investigator . Subjects requiring genetic test confirmation will have the testing performed by an independent laboratory after the Investigator or designee has determined they are likely to be otherwise eligi ble for enrollment. A buccal sample from the subject will be taken and sent to the laboratory for genotyping. Congenital Ichthyosis XomeDxSlice will be used to diagnose both RXLI and the ARCI -LI. subtype of CI. GeneDx tests detect transglutaminase mutation s in the TGM1 gene, X -linked recessive steroid sulfatase mutations in the STS gene, and additionally analyzes 47 other genes linked to CI. This is a multi - gene panel testing so that all known causes of CI can be confirmed/ruled -out since there is phenotypi c overlap between the subtypes (including STS). The tests are considered Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) and are thus regulated per US regulations 42 CFR 493 and the laboratory is accredited by the College of American Pathologists.

The PP population will be a subset of the ITT population consisting of subjects who: 1) me et all inclusion/exclusion criter ia that would affect the treatment evaluation, 2) appl y ≥ 80% but ≤ 120% of the planned doses of study treatment , 3) who had a VIIS measurement at Visit 6 (EOS ), and 4) have no major protocol violations that would affect the treatment evaluation. The final definition of the PP population will be presented in the SAP. The following descriptive statistics will be used as applicable to summarize the study data unless otherwise specified : • Continuous variables: sample size, mean, SD, median, min, and max. • Catego rical variables: frequencies and percentages . Individual subject data will be presented in listings. 9.4.1 Efficacy Analyses All efficacy analyses will be performed on both the ITT and PP populations with the ITT population considered primary. Other post hoc analysis may be conducted using a modified ITT population . Any such analyses will be fully described in the SAP prior to database lock . 9.4.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The proportion of subjects achieving VIIS -50 (≥ 50% reduction from Baseline for VIIS scaling score for the sum of the scores for ‘VIIS body areas’ who had a Baseline score ≥ 3) at Visit 6 (EOS ) relative to Baseline w ill be the primary efficacy endpoint and time point used to compare active treatment to vehicle. Treatment groups will be compared at Visit 6 (EOS ) using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) Test stratified by CI subtype and corresponding 95% confidence inter vals will be calculated for the difference in proportions for the treatment groups . 9.4.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The proportion of subjects achieving IGA treatment success will be the key secondary endpoint. For this endpoint, the IGA score will be dichoto mized to “treatment success” or “treatment failure” where “treatment success” is defined as at least a 2 -grade decrease in severity score relative to Baseline. Active treatment will be compared with vehicle at Visit 6 (EOS ) using the CMH test stratified by CI subtype and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the difference in proportions for the treatment groups. Additionally, one secondary endpoint is the time to achieve VIIS -50 that is maintained at the next observation. If VIIS -50 is first achi eved at Visit 6 (EOS) , then the endpoint is considered to have been met. A time to event analysis will be completed using the Kaplan -Meier method and log rank test to compare active treatment with vehicle ."
47,page_47,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 48 For each of the other secondary efficacy endpoints (VIIS scaling, IGA, and I -NRS), the following summaries will be prepared at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 (EOS ) (as applicable) by treatment group for each CI subtype and overall: • Frequency distribution of observed scores ; • Frequency distribution of change from Baseline ; • Shift tables for changes from Baseline to Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 ; and, • Frequency distribution of treatment success rates . Success rates between treatment groups will be compared at Visit 6 (EOS ) using the CMH Test stratified by CI subtype , and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the difference in proportions for the treatment groups. The VIIS scaling success is defined as a ≥ 50% reduction from Baseline for body sites that had a Baseline score ≥ 3. For IGA, success is defined as a ≥ 2-point reduction from Baseline. For I -NRS, success is defined as ≥ 4-point reduction from Baseline. Descriptive statistics (including mean, median, SD, min, and max) for observed and change from Baseline values in the DL QI and percent BSA affected in the Treatment/Assessment Area s at each visit will be presented by treatment group for each CI subtype and overall. For VIIS and I -NRS, the treatment groups will be compared with respect to the change from Baseline using a mixed model of repeated measures (MMRM) including terms for treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, and the Baseline value serving as the covariate. From the model, the active to vehicle treatment differences will be estimated. Additionally, two -sided confidence intervals will be provided. 9.4.2 Safety Analyses All subjects enrolled in the study who were dispensed study medication and who applied study medication at least once will be included in the analysis of safety and will be considered the Safety population. All AEs reported during the study will be listed, documenting onset, whether therapy was required, any change in study treatment dosing, severity, possible relationship to study treatment , and outcome. Verbatim terms on the eCRFs will be linked to preferred terms (PTs) and system organ class (SOC) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) mapping system. Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that first occur or worsen in severity after the first administration of study treatment and prior to 30 days after the last administration of study treatment. All reported TEAEs and incidence rates will be summarized by the number of subjects reporting AEs, SOC, PT, severity, and relationship to study treatment by treatment group."

Events Meeting the AE Definition • Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or oth er safety assessments ( eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from Baseline , considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, not related to progression of underl ying disease). • Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. • New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdo se per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. • ""Lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition • Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. • The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied , unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. • Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. • Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/o r convenience admission to a hospital). • Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen."
63,page_63,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 64 Definition of SAE If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met ( eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease)."
64,page_64,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 65 An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a) Results in death b) Is life -threatening The term “life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. c) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been app ropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospita lization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from Baseline is not considered an AE. d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity • The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct n ormal life functions. • This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f) Other situations: • Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situat ions such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surg ical intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the above d efinition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias , or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE"
65,page_65,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 66 AE and SAE Recording • When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation ( eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. • The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. Each event must be recorded separately. • It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send phot ocopies of the subject’s medical records to IQVIA Biotech Safety in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page. • There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by IQVIA Biotech Safety . In this case, all subject identifi ers, with the exception of the subject number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to IQVIA Biotech Safety . • The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clini cal information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: • Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. • Moderate: An event th at causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities. • Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the inte nsity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality • The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. The AE must be characterized as unrelated, unlikely to be related, possibly related, probably related, or unknown (unable to jud ge). o “Probably related” conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. o “Possibly related” suggests that the association of the AE with the study treatment is unknow n; however, the AE is not reasonably supported by other conditions. o “Unlikely to be related” suggests that only a remote connection exists between the study treatment and the AE. Other conditions, including chronic illness, progression or expression of the disease state or reaction to concomitant therapy, appear to explain the reported AE. o “Unrelated” is used if there is not a reasonable possibility that the study treatment caused the AE. o All efforts should be made to classify the AE according to the above categories . The category “unknown” (unable to judge) may be used only if the causality is not assessable, eg, because of insufficient evidence, conflicting evidence, conflicting data, or poor documentation. • The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. • Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated."
66,page_66,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 235-9051 -202 - Amendment 1 67 • The Investigator will als o consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. • For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. • There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred , and the Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to IQVIA Biotech Safety . However, it is very important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causali ty for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to IQVIA Biotech Safety . • The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a n SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. • The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -Up of AEs and SAEs • The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by IQVIA Biotech Safety to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possibl e. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. • If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the Invest igator will prov ide IQVIA Biotech Safety with a copy of any post mortem findings including histopathology. • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. • The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor /IQVIA B iotech Safety within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of SAEs SAE Reporting to IQVIA Biotech Safety via Paper CRF • E-mail transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to IQVIA Biotech Safety with Facsimile transmission as back -up method . • In rare circumstances and in the absence of e-mail/ facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or couri er service. • Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and sign the SAE eCRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. • Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in Investigator Study Binder . All SA Es must also be reported to IQVIA Biotech Safety within 24 hours of first awareness of the event.

Postmenopausal female : a) A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months wi thout an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the a bsence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. b) Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the non-estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
