Children randomized to the apixaban arm of the study weighing between 3 and < 35 kgwill be administered apixaban twice daily (BID) in doses between 0.2 mg and 4mg depending on body weight using the0.1 mg capsules and0.5 mg mini-tablets. Instructions will be provided on how to dissolve the 0.1 mg capsules and suspend the mini -tablets into solution. Alternatively, children 5 years will have the option of using the oral solution formulation at the same doses as would be recommended for the mini-tablet formulation .Note that children < 5 years of age will not have the option of being dosed via the oral solution formulation. Children randomized to the apixaban arm of the study weighing 35 kg will be administered apixaban 5 mg twice daily (BID) as a tablet or with the oral solution . Apixaban doses can be administered by mouth (PO) or via a nasogast ric tube (NGT )or gastric tube (GT)followed with or without food approximately 12 hours apart. The oral solution should be administered with the appropriate dosing syringe provided by the Sponsor. The apixaban 5 mg tablet can be crushed and suspended in water or 5% dextrose in water (D5W) or apple juice or can be mixed with applesauce and promptly administered orally. Alternatively, apixaban 5 mg tablets can be crushed and suspended in 60 mL of water or D5W and promptly delivered through a nNGT. The apixaban 0.5 mg tablets can be mixed with applesauce or can be dissolved in water, apple juice, or formula and promptly administered orallyor via NGT/GT .Apixaban should not be administered through a nasojejunal tube ( NJT)/post -pylor ic feeding tube due to decreased absorption. Either apixaban or active comparators will be started according to the guideline recommended time after randomization when the subjects are able to tolerate oral or enteral intake, and treatment will be continued for up to 12months or until the need for anticoagulant is resolved, whichever is shorter. At the end of the study, all subjects will beconverted to the standard of care (SOC ).Drug diaries will be used to record administration of study medication. During the study , apixaban treatment will be held at least 24 hours prior to any planned elective surgery or invasive procedures. Apixaban should be resumed after the procedure when adequate hemostasis has been established but no sooner than 24hours after the procedure, and no later than 10 days after the procedure . Bridging strategies with unfractio nated heparin (UFH )are permitted in the interim, per local institutional practices. Dose interruption for vitamin K antago nists (VKA) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH )will follow the local institutional standard practice informed bythe ACCP (American College of Chest Physicians )2012 guideline and the local product label for thromboembolism prophylaxis. Subjects who receive LMWH are allowed to switch to VKA at any time during the study; conversely , subjects having difficulty with VKA may switc h to LMWH . Use of VKA or LMWH will follow the local standard o f care that is aligned with the ACCP guidelines. The dose of VKA is recommended tobe titrated to achieve a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0, and the dose of LMWH is rec ommended to target an anti -Xa level between 0.5 and 1.0 units/mL . Exact targets may var y by conditio n and local standard of care.

Objectives : The objectives of this study are to assess the following in pediatric subjects with congenital or acquired heart dise ase requiring chronic prophylactic anticoagulation: Primary Objectives *the safety of apixaban Secondary Objectives * apixaban PK, PD(by measuring FX using c hromogenic assay ), and anti -FXa activity *theeffects of apixaban versus VKA or LMWH on Q OL measures *the efficacy of apixaban for thromboprophylaxis (exploratory aim) Study Design : Recruitment startedin January 2017 for children of ages 2to < 18 y ears, and was subsequently expanded to 3 months in December 2017 .Enrol lment was further expanded in February 2020 to subjects ages 28 days to < 3 months. Neonates will no longer be included in the study population . This will be a prospective, randomized, open -label, Phase II, multi-cent er clinical trial. A pproximately 200 pediatric subjects with congenital or acquired heart disease requiring chronic prophylactic anticoagulation will be randomized 2:1 to apixaban (targeting approximately 133 subjects) or active comparator (VKA or LMWH, targeting approximately 67subjects). Randomizatio n will be stratified by three age groups: 28 days to< 2years, 2 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years. Randomization will also be stratified by clinical diagnos is of single ventricle physiology , and other ty pes of congenital or acquired heart disease. Subjects will be randomized to receive thromboproph ylaxis with either open -label apixaban o ran active comparator (VKA or LMWH )for up to 12months or until the need for anticoagulant is resolved , whichever occur s first. A month is defined as every 30daysfrom the date of randomizatio n. Intermittent anti -coagulation ( e.g., unfractionated heparin [UFH] , LMWH) is allowed in the apixaban arm when patients cannot tolerate oral intake or when bridging around surgeries or procedures . Subjects who receive LMWH are allowed to switch to VKA at any time during the study; and conversely , subjects having difficulty with VKA may switch to LMWH . Each subject will be transitio ned to SOC at the completion of the study and followed for 2 additional months. During the study treatment period, in-perso n study visits will occur at2 weeks 3 days, 3 months 2 weeks , 6months 2 weeks, and 12 mo nths 2 weeks.Study visits should be scheduled from a starting point of ‘Day 1’ in order to ensure that a 12 month treatment duration is achieved. Visits will consist of obtaining and reporting adverse events (including bleeding and secondary endpoints), monitoring medi cation adherence and laboratory testing . Subjects whoare < 2 years of age will have a mandatory in-person visit at 9 months 2 weeks to include weight measurement, dose adjustment (if necessary) reporting adverse events, and assessing medication adherenc e. Subjects who are 2 years of age have the option of an in-perso n or a phone call visit at 9 months 2 weeks . Subje cts aged 28 days to < 3 months at the time of randomization will have an office visit at 6 weeks 3days for assessment of body weight in order to adjust the dose of study medication (if necessary). The phone visit will monitor adverse events and medication adherence . Sparse samples for PK will be taken in subjects receiving apixa ban. For all subjects, a follow -up telepho ne or in person safety assessment will be scheduled at 14 months2weeks or 2 months 2 weeks following cessation of study drug if duration of therapy is less than 12 months .

However, any clinical, radiologic and catheter evaluatio ns prompted by clinical suspicion of any thromboembolic events, bleeding or death should be performed at the discretion of the site principal investigator and/or treating clinician; information from these visits and findings will be captured for study analysis. Dose Selection: Additional PK data for children aged 14days to < 3 months of age together with previous PK data were used to support the dose selection rationale for pediatric subjects aged 28days to < 18 years. Based on PK simulations performed with a well-developed PPK model ,a dosing scheme has been selected for the age cohort to be enrolled (28 days [and 3 kg]to < 18 years). With the introduction of 0.5- mg ta blets, the dosing paradigm of apixaban changed from mg/kg dosing to fixed -dose, body weight -tiered regimen, as outlined in the table below . The fixed -dose, body weight -tiered regimen for pediatric subjects at least 6 kg and 3 months of age or older, used apixaban doses in inc rements of 0.5 to 1 mg according to the appr opriate weight range, for both oral solutio n and 0.5 -mg tablets. With the introductio nof the 0.1 mg capsule formulation, a body weight -tiered dosing regi men will continue for subjects 3kg and as young as 28 days of age. Increments are now reduced to 0.1 mg. The modelling and simulation results support the current dosing recommendation of fixed -dose body weight -tiered regimen for pediatric subje cts aged 28 days to < 18 y ears. Apixaban will be administered in accordance with the dosing instructions provided in separate documents and in the table below .

If an investigator opts to use DBS, it must be used for all PK collection points Statistical Considerations : Sample Size: The reported low incidence of thromboembolic and bleeding events in children limits the feasibility for a phase III trial by requiring an excessively high sample size. However, there remains a need to understand the safety and PK/PD profile of apixaban in children with heart disease and gather preliminary data on efficacy that could be used to develop future studies. Therefore, the current study is designed to characterize apixaban safety and PK/PD profile, and is a descriptive study for which the safety, PK/PD, an d efficacy variables will be summarized. With a treatment period up to 12 months, the sample size of approximately 200 subjects (approximately 133in the apixaban group a nd approximately 67in the SOC group) is a feasible sample size that will provide a robust PK/PD database, and reasonable safety data along with limited efficacy data in pediatric subjects with heart disease who need chronic thromboprophylaxis. The observed bleeding events, QOL and efficacy data from this study will provide insight into the expected event rates for the pediatric population treated with apixaban or SOC to inform benefit -risk(see section 8.1 of the protocol for detail s).

Thrombosis complicat ions are increasingly recogni zed as important factors contribut ing to the morbidity and mortality in these disease popul ations.1,2,3Hem odynamic factors related to abnorm al ventricular funct ion, arrhy thmias, catheter izationand complex cardiac anatomy are important contributors to the risk of thrombosis. The highest ri sk groups include children wi th congen ital heart di sease of the single ventri cle type in whomall of these factors may co-exist.3,4In observat ional cohort studies , the period prevalence of thromboti c complications has been reported to be 40% after initial palliat ion and 28% after superior cavopulmo nary connect ion (SCPC),4whereas in a large rando mized clinical study , the incidence of com posite death and thromboti c com plicat ions during a median fo llow up durati on of 5.8 months after initial palliat ionwas noted to be approximat ely 20%.5The prevalence of clinically -evident thrombotic events was reported to be 7%during two years after the Fontan procedure and increased to as high as 20% when including asymptom atic thrombosis ident ified by transesophageal echocardiogram .6 In children with acqui red heart diseases, high-risk groups for thrombosi s include dilated cardi omyopathy and Kawasaki disease with coronary artery aneurysms . Retrospective review7,8,9 of pediatri c patients with dilated cardi omyopathy suggests an incidence of thrombus/embo lism ranging from 1 to 16%, likely related to low cardi ac output or focalventri cular wall motion abnorm alities, leading to localized stasis. Kawasaki disease, if untreated, may resul t in coronary artery aneurysms in 20% to 25% of affected children and may lead to ischemic heart disease or sudden death.10However, the prevalence of coronary artery aneurysms is reduced to < 5% by administration of high-dose intravenous immune globulin within 10 days of fever onset10.Event rates for thrombotic co mplications in pat ients with Kawasaki disease and giant aneurysm streated with aspirin alone or in combinat ion with an anticoagulant varyfrom 0.5 to 2.7events per 100 patient-years.11Low cardiovascular event rates of 0.246 per 1000 person -years were reported in a recent US cohort study of 546 patients with Kawasaki disease who were followed for cardi ovascular outcom esover 14.9 years post-diagnosis .12 Other high ri sk groups1,13include children wi th pros thetic heart valves, pulm onary hypertensio n, other forms of complex congenital heart diseases ,and those who require transvenous pacing system s. Despite a better understanding of the risk factors, there continues to be sparse data regarding the optimal strategi es for prevention, detection, and management of thrombosis in pediatric heart disease.2Many of the standard drugs (e.g., warfarin, low-molecular -weight heparin [LMWH] , Revised Protocol No.: 04 Date: 16-Jul-2020 26 Approved 5.0 v Approved 1.0 v"
26,page_26,"Clinical Protocol CV185362 BMS -562247 apixaban and heparin) are used variably at different doses, and are often being used off label.13,14The agents studi ed most frequent ly in children (heparin, and LMWH ) are associated with unwanted adverse effects such as poten tial decrease inbone mineral densi ty15and heparin -induced thrombocy topenia,15,16and have the disadvantage sof requiringparenteral administrati on and therapeuti c monitoring. Further, heparins requi re antithro mbin III for an adequate effect, and antithrombin III l evels are frequent ly low and variable in neonates and other sick children . Direct Factor Xa (FXa)inhibitors thatdo not require antithrombin III, may be a better option for these patients. Warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists ( VKAs) like warfarin suffer fro m a number of shortcomings as well, including a narrow therapeuti c window, the need for therapeutic monitoring, potenti al drug-drug and drug-food interacti ons, and the lack of an oral pediatric formulation. Therefore, the current standard anticoagulants are associated with sub-optimal benefit/risk ratio and acceptabilit y, as dem onstrated in a recent randomized trial, and lead to poor compliance, adherence, and therapeut ic effect.6 Although the AHA Scientific Statement1and the American College of Chest Physicians13have provi ded clinical pract ice guideline sfor pediatric thrombosis, the majo rity of recommendat ions are based upon consensus opinio n in the absence of rando mized clinical trials (that is, Level 2C evidence). Thus ,almost two decades after the first randomized clinical trial of anticoagul ation in children for venous thromboembo lism (VTE ), the level of evidence on which current therapy is based has not progressed. T his highlights the need for al ternat ive and novel strategi es to increase the safet y and efficacy of anticoagulati on of children .2Addit ionally , there remains a pressing need for theavailabilit y and improved understanding of the pharmacokinet ics (PK) and pharmaco dynamics ( PD)of novel anticoagul ants wi th age-appropriate pediatric formulationsand withoutthe drawbacks of LMWH or VKAs. T he advent of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as di rect F Xa inhibitors ( e.g., apixaban) provides an opportunit y to address these needs , and trials in children with NOACs have been ident ified as a high priority research aimby a group of experts .2 Apixaban (BMS -562247) is a novel ,orally act ive, direct inhibi tor of FXa that binds to the active site of FXa without requiring antithrombin III. Apixaban has been studied in more than 20randomized clinical trials in over 60,000 subjects in the adult clinical devel opment program for various indicat ions,17,18,19,20,21and has demonstrated a favorable benefit -risk profile. Apixaban has been approved for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillat ion (NVAF ), prevent ion of VTE in adult patients who have undergone elect ive hip or knee replac ement surgery , and for the treatm ent and reduct ion of the risk of recurrence of VTE in adult patients. Apixaban is expected to have advantages over current ly available ant ithrombotic agents used for the prevent ion and treatm ent of arterial and venous thrombosis. As an oral agent with a liquid formulation, apixaban is more convenient to administer than parenteral agents (e.g,unfract ionated heparin, enoxaparin , and fondaparinux), especially in subjects requiring prolonged treatm ent. Furthermore, unlike VKAs ,apixaban has predi ctable dosing with low inter-subject variabilit y, is not expected to require monitoring of coagul ationmarkers or dose adjustm ent, and is notexpected to have significant interacti ons with food, drugs or botanica l Revised Protocol No.: 04 Date: 16-Jul-2020 27 Approved 5.0 v Approved 1.0 v"

Thus, apixaba n could be a new option as a safe, pediatric friendly anticoagulant for prevent ion of thromboembo lism (TE) in children with heart disease. Accordingly , theSponsor (Bristol-Myers Squibb [BMS]) isundertaking the present randomized, open -label, parallel -arm Phase II study using the standard of care (SOC, e.g.,VKA antagonist or subcutaneous LMWH) as an active comparator , to establish the safet y and PK of apixaban in the prevent ion of TEin pediatric subjects wi th congeni tal or acqui red hea rt disease requi ring chronic anticoagulation. The study willinclude pediatri c subjects congenital heart disease ,as well as subjects with acquired heart disease who require long-term anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis. The rationale for including a broad range of congenital and acqui red heart disease is the high unmet medical need in these popul ations, and because small numbers of patients at risk for each disease type makes studying a popul ation with a single ventri cle disease alone extrem ely challeng ing.2 The current rando mized Phase II trial will enroll pedi atric subjects with acqui red and conge nital heart disease who requi rechronic anticoagul ation for thromboprophylaxis. Subjects will be rando mized to receive apixaban versus VKA or subcutaneous LMWH. Findings from the trial will provi de important i nformat ion including apixaban safety , dosing guidance and qualit y of life (QOL )across different age groups in a broad pediatric heart disease popul ation. 1.1.2 Rationale for Dose In Phase 3 studi es for adult patients (ARISTOTLE trial)17apixaban achieved superi ority for th e pre-specified primary endpo int of stroke and systemic embo lism with less major bleeding compared wi th warf arin. It is expected that achieving a similar plasma exposure woul d resul t in a favorable safet y and efficacy profile in this pediatri c popul ation. Therefore, the proposed dose for this study is targeted to achieve a plasma exposure that is similar to the exposure in the adult stroke prevent ion trial ARISTOTLE. Exposures for this subset of patients are consistent with exposures observed in the VTE treatm ent popul ation for those patients dosed with 5 mg BID. Based on popul ation pharm acokineti c (PPK)modeling of younger subjects in this Phase 3 NVAF popul ationand pat ients in the VTE treatment popul ation,the median daily steady state exposure of apixaban is approximately 2400 ng*hr/mL in patients receiving the 5 m g twice daily (BID) dosing regimen, thus the target exposure used to drive dose selecti on forthis protocol was half this value, which is equal to th e steady state exposure over one dosing interval, AUC(TAU), of 1200 ng*hr/mL As a consequence of the change to solid dose formulations for children < 5 years of age, prom pted by a revisi on of the EMA guidance for propylene glyco l excipient use, a weight ti ered dosing scheme was developed. Thi s dosing scheme achieves com parable exposures to the weight based scheme that was used init ially to support dose sel ection. Children aged 28 day s to < 18 y ears of ageare eligible for the study . Children rando mized to the apixaban arm of the study weighing between 3 and <35 kg will be administered apixaban twice daily (BID) in doses between 0.2 mg and 4mg depending on body weight using the 0.1 mg capsules and 0.5 m g tablets.

Children rando mized to the apixaban arm of the study weighing 35 kg will be administered apixaban 5 mg twice daily (BID) as a tabletor soluti on.Note that children < 5 years of age will not have the option of being dosed via the oral solution formulat ion. Apixaban can be administered by mouth (PO) or via a NGT or GT approximately 12 hours apart, followed with or without food. The oral solution shoul d be administered with the appropriate dosing sy ringe provided by the Sponsor. The apixaban 5 mg tablet can be crushed and suspended in water or 5% dextrose in water (D5W) or apple juice or can be mixed with applesauce and prom ptly administered orally. Alternat ively, apixaban 5 mg tablets can be crushed and suspended in 60 mL o f water or D5W and prompt ly delivered through an NGT. The apixaban 0.5 mg tablets can be mixed with applesauce or can be disso lved in water, apple juice, or baby formula and prom ptly administered orally or via NGT/GT. Apixaban shoul d not be administered through NJT/post -pyloric feeding tubes due to decreased absorpti on.The apixaban 0.1 mg capsules will need to be opened anddisso lved in infant formula or breast milk and prom ptly administered orally or vi a NGT/GT. The dose of apixaban was determined by a model -based approach, using a PPK modeling method. Briefly, a PPK model was devel oped using available data from apixaban pediatri c PK/PD studi es in children aged 14 days to 18 years (CV185118 and CV185079) pooled with adult data (children down to 28 days).Apixaban exposure was adequately characteri zed by a 2-compartment model with first order absorption and first order eliminat ion with the primar y influential covariate of body weight for scaling of clearance (CL) and volume (V) in this patient popul ation. Based on PK simulat ions performed with this model a weight -based dosing scheme was previously selected for the initial age cohort to be enrolled (2to < 18 years). Subsequent analysis supported a weight -based scheme for children down to 3 months of age. The most recent analysis, provides dose recommendat ions in support of enrollme nt of patients down to 28 day s of age based on a dditional PK data in young infants that are now available. Simulations showed that this proposed dosing scheme achieved a similar median steady -state area under the concentration -time curve in one dosing interval AUC(TAU) in this popul ation to that observed in adults in the stroke prevent ion trial who received apixaban. This approach to dose selection has been used to ident ify pediatri c doses for two addit ional studi es: 1) thestudy exploring the safet y and efficacy of apixaban for TE prevention during induct ion chem otherapy in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoma (T-or B-cell) treated with asparaginase, and 2) thestudy evaluat ing apixaban in pediatri c subjects requi ring ant icoagulation for the treatm ent of VTE events. As such, recrui tmentstarted in January 2017 with children of ages 2- < 18 years and was subsequent ly expanded to > 3 months in children weighing > 6 kg in December 2017 . The same model-based approach targeting median Adult AUCs was used to select doses forinfants ages 28 days to < 3 monthsweighing 3 kg .

Findings from these nonclinical studi esindicate thatapixaban has a very low potential for toxicityand support the clinical use of apixaban in pediatric patients. Apixaban has been studi ed extensiv ely in adults for various clinical indicat ions, and ithas been granted market authorization s for adult use for prevent ion and treatm ent of VTE and for prevent ion of stroke and systemic embo lism in patients with NVAFin the United States , the European Unio n, Canada, Japan, and many other countri es. Safety and efficacy for long term use of apixaban have been demonstrated in several completed pivotal phase 3 studi es. These studi es are briefly discussed bel ow: Treatment of VTE : efficacy and safet y of apixaban for the treatm ent of VTEindicat ion have been demonstrated in 2 completed pivotal Phase 3 studi es, AMPLIFY24and AMPLIFY -EXT .25AMPLIFY was a prospective rando mized double -blind trial that compared apixaban (10mg twice daily for seven days followed by 5 mg twice daily for six months) with conventi onal anticoagulat ion (subcutaneous enoxaparin for five days followed by warfarin for six months) in 5395 adult patients f or the treatment of acute VTE. This study achieved non-inferiorit y between the two groups in the standard efficacy endpo ints of recurrent symptomat ic VTE or VTE -related death . It also demonstrated superiorit y of apixaban in the safet y endpo int of major bleeding. Apixaban was also studi edin a rando mized, doubl e-blind study (AMPLIFY- EXT study ) comparingthe efficacy and safet y of two doses of apixaban (athromboprophylact ic dose of 2.5 mg twice daily or a therapeutic dose of 5 mg twice daily , both given for 12 months) wi th placebo in 2482 adult patients wi th VTE who had completed 6to12months of anticoagul ation and for whom there was equipoise regarding the further continuat ion of anticoagul ation. The primary efficacy outcom e, symptom atic recurrent VTE or death from any cause, occurred in 11.6, 3.8, and 4.2percent of those receiving placebo, the 2. 5 mg twice daily dose, and the 5 mg twi ce daily dose, respectively. The primary safety outcom e, major bleeding, occurred in 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1percent of those receiving placebo, the 2.5 mg twice daily dose, and the 5 mg twi ce daily dose, respectively. Prevent ion ofstroke and systemic embo lism in NVAF: the efficacy and safet yof apixaban forprevention of stroke or systemic embo lism in NVAF have been demonstrated in two landmark phase 3 studies, ARISTOTLE17and AVERROES.18ARISTOTLE evaluated apixaban versus warfarin in 18,201 adult patients wit h NVAF who were sui table for warf arin therapy , and AVERROES evaluated apixaban versus aspirin in 5,598 adult patients with NVAF who were considered unsuitable for treatment with warfarin. In AVERROES, when compared with aspirin, apixaban reduced stroke by >50% without a significant increase in major bleeding. In ARISTOTLE, when compared to warfarin, apixaban reduced stroke and systemic embo lism by 21%, reduced bleeding by 31% and reduced all-cause mortalit y by 11%. In both studies, apixaban demonstrated consistent effects among all major subgroups, fewer study drug discont inuations than either comparator, and good t olerabili ty and overall safet y.

31,page_31,"Clinical Protocol CV185362 BMS -562247 apixaban Apixaban PK has been well characterized in adults. It has an oral bioavailabilit y of approximately 50%, a half-life of approximately 12 hours and is eliminated by multiple pathways including metabo lism, renal excret ion and excreti on into the gastrointest inal tract. Renal clearance accounts for approximately 27% of apixaban total clearance. Modest increases in apixaban exposure (38-44%) have been observed in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 30 mL/min) and subjects with end stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis. Moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class B) did not impact apixaban exposure. Due to itsmultiple eliminat ionpathways and lack ofinhibit ion ofmajo r metabo lic enzymes or drug transporters, apixaban is not expected to have significant drug-drug interact ions. However, apixaban is a substrate for CYP3A4 enzyme and the P-gp transporter, therefore, its absorpti on and eliminat ion may be affected by CYP3A4 and /or P-gp modulators. Strong dual inhibi tors of CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as ketoconazol e, can increase apixaban exposure by approximately 2 -fold. Consistent with its mechanism of action, apixaban can increase clotting time measures such as activated partial thromboplast in time (aPTT ), Internat ional Norm alized Ratio (INR) as well as affect other coagulat ion assessments (anti-Xa activit y, thrombin generat ion, etc.). However, apixaban has been shown to have minimal impact on the aPTT , or INR at therapeutic concentrations. M easurement of anti-FXa activity , using a one-step chromogenic assay is appropriately sensi tive enough to detect its presence26. To support the apixaban pediatric devel opment plan, additional clinical pharm acology studies have been completed and are described below. The palatabili ty and relative bioavailabilit y of apixaban oral solution have been assessed in healt hy adult subjects. Based on these studies the apixaban oral solution is expected to have acceptable palatabili ty for the pediatric population and has comparable bioavailabilit y to the apixaban tablet formulation. In addition, administration of the oral solution or a crushed tablet via a NGT flushed with 60 mL D5W achieves similar exposure to oral administra tion of the apixaban solution. Apixaban relative bioavailability appears to be 8% to 20% lower following administration of the oral solution via NGT using infant formula or an enteral meal, such as Boost Pl us, as a flush medium . The palatabili ty and relative bioavailabilit y of apixaban 0.1 mgcapsules dispersed in water relative to the 0.5 mg tablets dispersed in water have been assessed in healthy adult subjects . Based on this study , both of these pediatric formulations are expected tohave acceptable palatabil ity. The resul ts of this study demonstrated comparable AUC was achieved with both formulations, but the Cmax was ~30% higher with the 0.1 mgcapsule formulation compared to the 0.5 m g tabl et formulation. An in vit ro comparison study was performed in pediatric and adult plasma samples spiked with apixaban to compare and characteri ze thePD activit y of apixaban in pediatric and adult plasma samples. This study demonstrated that, relative to adults, Factor X levels are lower in plasma samples from children 6 months of age and younger as well as in umbilical cord blood; this observat ion is consistent with literature reports of developmental hemostasis.

32,page_32,"Clinical Protocol CV185362 BMS -562247 apixaban Factor X concentrations in neonates and infants, the inhibitory effect of apixaban on FXa in pediatrics appeared to be generally consistent with the effect observed in adults.Specifically, relative to the effect observed in adult plasma, apixaban at 110 ng/mL, resulted in 17%, 16%, and 21% greater inhibit ion of FXa in infant, neonate, and umbilical cord blood plasma, respectively . Study CV185079 evaluated themultip le-dose PK,PD, safet y and tolerabilit y of apixaban in 8pediatric subjects up to 18 y ears of age wi th an indwelling central venous catheter. Though the study was terminated early due to poor enrollment, 6 subjects between the ages of 13 to 17 were administered 0.66 mg/m2 apixaban twice daily for10 days and 2 subjects ages 6and11 were adminis tered 0.60 mg/m2 apixaban twice daily for 10 days. Model -estimated steady state AUC(TAU) was 234.6 ng/mL and 223.5 ng/mL in the pediatric subjects between 13-17 years and 6-11years of age,respectively. Apixaban was genera lly safe and well-tolerated by all 8subjects in this study . There were no deaths, treatment -related serious adverse events (SAEs ), or bleeding -related adverse events (AEs)reported. The most frequent ly occur ring AEsand laboratory marked abnorm ality was prolonged aPTT. Prolongat ion of aPTT is a known pharmaco logical effect of direct acting Factor Xa inhibitors and as noted above, aPTT prolongati on was not associated with any bleeding events in the study .Apixaban administration had no apparent impact on vital signs or phy sical examinat ion findings. Study CV185118 is asingle- dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinet ics (PK) , pharmacodynamics (PD) , safet y and tolerabilit y of apixaban in pediatri c subjects from birth to <18years at risk for a venous or arterial thromboti c disorde r. Asof June 2019 , a total of 47 subjects received apixaban and were included in the current dose selection : 10subjects 12years to <18 years of age, 10subjects 6 years to <12 years of age, 8 subjects 2 years to <6 years of age, 9subjects 9 months to <2 years of age, and 9subject s 28 day s to <9 m onths of age and 1 subject <28 day s of age. To date, apixaban has been well tolerated, and there have been no significant apixaban -related safety findings in CV185118. The resul ts of this analysis showed that the clearance of orally administered apixaban increased with increasing age and reached values similar to those of adults in pediatric subjects older than 12years. In addition, oral clearance, when norm alized to body weight, was constant across the pediatric age range of 3 months to 18 years, witha trend towards age depen dence on clearance in infants < 3 months of age.The resul ts of this analysis were used to suppo rt the dose selection rationale for pediatric subjects aged 28 days to < 18 years. A linear relationship between apixaban concentrati on and anti-FXa activity was observed, consistent with that observed in adult subjects. Based on PK simulat ions performed with this model a dosing scheme has been selected for the age cohort to be enrolled (28 daysto <18 years) .

Di stinct features of apixaban include direct binding to the activ e site of FXa without requiring antithrombin III, a pediatric oral dosing formulation with consistent absorpti on and no food effect, lack of drug-drug interacti on with other m edicat ions, no need for therapeuti c monitoring, and alow risk of bleeding. These features may make it superi or to currently available antithrom botic agents forthromboprophylaxi sin children with acquired orcongenital heart disease , thus addressing an unmet clinical need. All patients are expected to receive some benefit in the form of increased medical care/attentio n when participat ing in study procedures, which includes multip le clinic visits, physical and laboratory examinat ions over the course of the study . Potential risks The primary liabilit y for apixaban, as well as any anticoagulant, is undesired bleeding. Based on safet y data obtained in the adult clinical program from over 60,000 subjects and post marketing experience from over 4 millio n adult patientsworldwi de,apixaban ’srisk of bleeding is expected to be low, and comparable to that of subcutaneous LMWH . While apixaban ’srisk of bleeding has been dem onstrated to be lower than warfarin (ARISTOTLE),8it is interest ing to learn that in patients undergoing invasive procedures while taking apixaban, the rates of post-procedural Revised Protocol No.: 04 Date: 16-Jul-2020 35 Approved 5.0 v Approved 1.0 v"

The DSMB may recommend modificati on or suspensio n of the trial for saf ety reasons. In addi tion to DSMB supervisio n, the sponsor will conduct real -time monitoring and will review all safety information from all ongoing apixaban pediatri c studi es as they beco me available. Frequent safet y signal detecti on will be performed, which will include integrati on of clinical study data, post m arketing surveillance AEreports, pre -clinical data, epide miological studies and literature reports, to identify and characterize unrecognized safet y risks or changes in those which are current ly classified as expected Adverse Drug React ions.

To ensure even distribut ion of age and disease types between the two treatm ent groups, rando mizat ion will be stratified by three age groups: 28 days to <2 years , 2 to <12 years,and 12to < 18 years ; rando mizat ion will also be stratified by clinical diagnosis of single ventricle physi ology, and other types of congenital oracqui red heart disease. Neonates will no longer be included in the study population . Subjects will be rando mized to receive thromboprophylaxis with open-label apixaban versus VKA or LMWH for up to 12 months or until anticoagulat ion is no longer needed, whichever is shorter .

Subjects who are expected to be chronically anticoagulated (> 1 year), should have a study treatment durati on of 12 months. Subjects who receive LMWH are allowed to switch to VKA at any time during the study; and vice versa . All subjects will be transi tioned to the standard of care (SOC )at the end of the study (see Secti on 4.5.3 for converting from apixaban to other anticoagulants ), and will be followed for another 2 months.Study drug diaries will be used to record study drug administration. There will be 3 study periods extending up to 14 months total. These include a screening/rando mizat ion periodfrom Day -21 to Day 1, a treatment period from Day 1 to Month 12(or when anticoagulati on is no longer needed) , and a follow-up periodfrom Month 12 to Month 14 (or 2 m onths f ollowing cessat ion of study drug if the durat ion of therapy is less than 12months).A month will be defined as every 30 days from the date of rando mizat ion. The Screening/Randomization Period will occur after consent is obtained and will begin with a scree ning visit that occurs between 0-21days prior to randomizat ion. At the screening visit (enrollment) the Interacti ve Web Response System (IWRS)will be contacted to obtain a unique subject number. A complete medical history , including current medications, and a physical examinat ion includin g vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure , and temperature ), height, and body weight will be performed. The screening visit laboratory studies will include: CBC , ALT, AST, total and conjugated bilirubin, serum creat inine (estimated GFR), INR, aPTT, and serum or urine pregnancy test for wom en of child bearing potenti al (WOCBP). WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgi cal sterilizati on (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy ).All WOCBP must have a negat ive serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensi tivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of βHCG) within 24hours prior to the start of study drug. An extensio n up to 72 hours is permissible in situations where pregnancy test results cannot be obtained within the standard 24hour window . Screening laboratory studies will be interpreted at each site, not at a central core lab.To avoid unnecessary blood draws, safety labs including CBC, liver and renal function tests, coagul ation tests that are run 1 to 7 days prior to consent/screening visit as part of clinical care may be used to satisfy the inclusio n/exclusion criteria as long as the invest igator believes the lab value s coul d not have changed at enrollment . The randomization visit may occur any time within the 21day period after the screening visit (enrollment) . For subjects who meet all the inclusion/exc lusio n criteria, the IWRSwill be contacted and the subjects will be rando mized. The subjects will receive instructions about the study drug and shoul dstart the study drugfollowing rando mization as long as condi tions for administration of study drug are met. The first dose of study drug shoul d be given at the study center following randomization.

For example, a scheduled surgical procedure, perioperative use of CPB, or elevated liver function tests. The treating physician shoul d be informed about recommendations for timing and dosage of study drug (apixaban or active co mparator) administration in such circumst ances. For treatm ent interrupti ons 48consecut ive hours, the period of interruption shoul d be noted and the invest igator should document on the CRF the t ime and date of discontinuation and restart of therapy , as well as the reason for interruption and measures taken to correct the event . An AE shoul d be reported if applicable. Guidance on temporary dose interruptions for selected events are described below. For an individual subject, dose interruptions and treatment discont inuat ion may be more or less conservative than indicated below based on the clinical judgment of the invest igator. Note that discontinuat ion of su bjects from treatm ent is a ddressed i n Sect ion3.5. Elective Procedure or Surgery Apixaban : The effect ive half-life of apixaban when administered twice daily is approximately 12hours ,and it is expected that most of the anticoagulat ion effect will be gone within 24hours after the last dose of the drug. Apixaban must be stopped for asufficient period of time (e.g., at least 24 hours if the risk of bleeding is low and at least 48 hours if the risk of bleeding is moderate or high) prior to th e procedure to minimize the risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding. The treating physician shoul d be made aware of the time and dosage of apixaban administratio n and be informed that routine coagul ation tests such as INR and aPTT are relatively insensit ive measures of anticoagul ation activity and are unsuitabl e for monitoring the anticoagul ation effect of apixaban. The subject will re-start study medicat ion once hemo stasis is secure (e.g., after removal of surgical drains, lines, and wires, etc.),and when, in the opinion of the invest igator, it is safe to do so , at such time as a pati ent woul d otherwise be transi tioned to VKA or LMWH per local institutional standards , but no earlier than 24hours and no later than 10daysafterthe procedure/surgery .Bridging strategies with UFH are permitted in the interim, per local institutional pract ices.

Switching from apixaban to VKA : apixaban may affect INR, so that INR measurements during co-administration with VKA may not be useful for determining the appropri ate dose of VKA . If continuous anticoagulation is necessary , discontinue apixaban and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and VKA at the time the next dose of apixaban woul d have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagul ant when the INR reaches an acceptable range per institutional standards. Switching between apixaban and anticoagulants other than VKA: discontinue one being taken and begin the other at the next scheduled dose.

Minor bleeding: is defined as any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that does not fulfill the above criteria for either major bleed ing or CRNM bleeding. Menstrual bleeding resul ting in a medical consultati on and/or intervent ion will be classified as a minor bleeding event. All bleeding events and their supporting documentation MUST be sent for adjudicat ion. 5.3.2 Treatment Guidelines for Bl eeding / Suspected Bleeding Subject s with bleeding or suspected bleeding shoul d undergo confirmatory laboratory or other testing as indicated clinically (e.g., Ultrasound , Com puter Tomography [CT], Magnet ic Resonance Imaging [ MRI ]. The date and time of the onset of the bleeding event will be recorded on the CRF. The fo llowing routine measures may be considered: Delay the next dose of study drug or discont inue study medicat ion if indicated Provi de fluid resuscitat ion and blood transfusio n as indicated Provi de fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or general hemostatic measures as indicated Note: There is no speci fic reversal agent for apixaban for use in infants and children. Table 5.3.2 -1provides recommendat ions for the treatm ent of bleeding or suspected bleeding. The specific treatm ent for bleeding is left to the discretion of the investigator and/or the treati ng physician based on the med ical status of the subject and/or inst itutional policies. Table 5.3.2 -1: Treatment Guidelines for Bleeding / Suspected Bleeding Minor Bleeding Apixaban may or may not be held based on an individualized benefit -risk assessment Clinically Significant Bleeding / Clinically Relevant Non-Major BleedingApixaban should be held if subject meets criteria outlined in section 3.5. Hold apixaban for clinically significant bleeding . Identify the source and institute local measures to stop the bleeding. Perform laboratory test monitoring ( e.g., hemoglobin, INR, aPTT, platelet count, anti-FXa activity). Apixaban may be bes t monitored using an anti -FXa assay rather than the more standard coagulation tests (e.g. , INR, aPTT) which are less sensitive to apixaban. If bleeding occurs within 6 hours after apixaban administrati on consider administration of activated charcoal oral solution to reduce apixaban plasma exposure. Consider appropriate symptomatic treatment ( e.g., mechanical compression, surgical interventio n, fluid replacement and hemodynamic support, blood product or component transfusion) For bleeding that does not respond to local measures, consider administration of FFP as a supportive measure, recognizing that FFP does not reverse the anticoagulant effects of apixaban Revised Protocol No.: 04 Date: 16-Jul-2020 69 Approved 5.0 v Approved 1.0 v"

However, there remains a need to understand the safety and PK/PD profile of apixaban in children with heart disease and gather preliminary data on efficacy that could be used to develop future studies. Therefore, the study is designed to obtain apixaban PK, PD, safet y inform ation, and expl oratory efficacy data , and is a descriptive study for which the safety , PK/PD, and efficac y variables will be summarized. The study will stillinclude a randomized comparison group with standard anticoagulants as a frame of reference regarding frequencies of bleeding and thromboembo lic events in the pediatric setting. This approach has been recommended by the Subcommittee on Pedi atric and Neonatal Hemostasis and Thrombosis of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) .39 With a treatm ent period up to 12 months, the sample size of approximately 200 subjects (approximately 133in the apixaban group and approximate ly 67in the SOC group) is a feasible sample size that will provide a robust PK/PD database, and reasonable safet y data along with limited efficacy data in pediatri c subjects with heart disease who need chronic thromboprophylaxis. More specifically, approx imately 533blood samples will be obtained during the study to characterize apixaban PK and PD in approximately 133 apixaban treated subjects aged 28 days to < 18 years. The data collected in the current study will be combined with available data from two other pediatric PK studi es for populat ion PK/PD analyses, provi ding the ability to fully capture the pharmacokinet ic disposi tion in this special patient popul ation. In addition, these analysis will provi de robust data to inform apixaban dosing in the pediatric cardi ac popul ation across a broad age spectrum. The observed AE, bleeding events, QOL and efficacy data from this study will provide insight into the expected event rates for the pediatric popul ation treated with apixaban or SOC to inform benefit -risk. The following examples of potenti al results, with anticipated preci sion around the estimate ,may provi de an understanding of the data that the study will generate, and may offer insight into how the trial data m ay be interpreted. Possible Safety Outcome The primary safet y endpo int (a composite of adjudi cated majo r or clinically relevant non-majo r bleeding) event rate is not well characterized in children. Based on two randomized studi es in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease,6,5one randomized study in pediatric patients with VTE events40,and adult data in the stroke prevent ion trial ARISTOTLE17, event rates of 2 to 12% may be expected. Based on thi s event rate range, the following may be a safet y outcom e of this trial: Revised Protocol No.: 04 Date: 16-Jul-2020 83 Approved 5.0 v Approved 1.0 v"

Data that are derived from source documents and reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. Addit ional clinical informat ion may be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance understanding o f product safet y. CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnorm alities that are reported or ident ified during the course of the study . For si tes using the BMS el ectroni c data capture (EDC) tool, electronic CR Fs will be prepared for all data collect ion fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregnancy, which will be reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, respectively .If electronic SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank only in those circumstances permitted by study -specific CRF complet ion guidelines provided by BMS .

Examples of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited while subjects are on treatm ent with BMS -562247. Som e example s of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are: Clarithromycin nelfinavir telithromycin ritonavi r itraconazo le saquinavir ketoconazo le indinavir voriconazo le cobicistat posaconazole Strong inducers of P-gp and CYP3A4 are expected to decrease apixaban blood concentrations and can result in failure of therapeutic ant icoagulant effect. Examples of strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P -gp are: Rifampin phenyto in carbamazepine St. John’s wort These lists are not meant to be all inclusive. Please consult individual drug labels for further inform ation. Management suggestions: Avoid co-administration of strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp . Bleeding risk is expected to be further increased in patients with renal insufficiency , depending upon severit y. The efficacy of routi ne coagul ation testing to evaluate the degree of anticoagulation with apixaban is limited. Avoid co -administration of strong inducers of both CYP34 and P -gp.
