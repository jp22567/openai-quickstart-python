These were detailed in the USM letter dated 08 April 2020 and sent to investigators, Competent Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Institutional Review Boards. The object ive of these USMs is to reduce the risk of infections for the study subjects by increasing the flexibility of study visits and thereby avoid exposure risk during the pandemic . The measures apply specifically to subject s who are unable or unwilling to perfo rm on-site study procedures due t o the COVID -19 pandemic . The changes made to CSP GLPG1690 -CL-204 Version 4.00 (31 Jul 2019), are listed below, with a brief rationale of each change and the applicable sections. For any subject s who, due to any COVID -19-related reason, cannot attend the final visit in the treatment period, Visit 9 (24 weeks) , within the time windo w of ±4 days, the window for the visit may be increased to ±28 days. The subject should continue the intake of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) until Visit 9 (ultimately until Week 28). For the rollover of a subject into the GLPG1690 -CL-206 Open -Label Extension study, a complete, on -site rollover visit is required. If Visit 9 cannot be conducted on site within the extended window of Week 24 +28 days, the subject will be given the opportunity to rollover into the Open -Label Extension study until Week 32. In this case, the subject will however be off study medication and not receive IMP between Week 28 to 32. The Visit 9/rollover assessm ents should be performed at this on -site visit , If the rollover visit cannot be scheduled before Week 32, the subject will continue in the follow -up period of GLPG1690 -CL-204 with a firs t follow -up visit 4 weeks after last IMP administration. Applicable Sections : Section 4.1 Overall Clinical Study Design Section 6.1 Timing of assessments Section 6.11 Schedule of Activities If Visit 9 needs to be postponed until after Week 24, regular phone calls at Week 24 and every 14 days thereafter should be implemented to evaluate the subject ’s safety until a visit can take place on site. In addition, if any of the follow -up visits cannot be performed on site, a phone call to evalua te the subject ’s safety should be performed. The information to be collected d uring these phone calls is detailed in the USM letter and summarized in the protocol Section 6.6 . Applicable Sections : Section 6.1 Timing of events Section 6.6 Safety assessments Section 6.11 Schedule of activities When Visit 9 needs to be postponed beyond Week 24, a Direct -to-Patient (DTP) shipment of one additional IMP kit may be implemented to cover the prolongation of treatment (by up to 28 days). Urine pregnancy tests to perform the monthly pregnancy test at home until follow -up visit 1 (if applicable) and treatment or follow -up diary cards should also be shipped to the subject to cover the longer period between on -site visits . Applicable Sections: Section 5.3 Pac kaging, labelling, and distribution Section 6.1 Timing of events Section 6.6 Safety assessments"

INTRODUCTION For more details refer to the investigator’s brochure (IB) for GLPG1690 (Edition 6, 28-Jun- 2019 ) and relevant updates/addenda. This clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the current International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use - Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP) Guideline E6 (see also Section 10). Systemic Sclerosis Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) is a rare autoimmune disease of the connective tissue with the highest mortality rate of all rheumatic diseases. The disease has a female predominance (3:1) and a peak onset in the fourth decade of life. Systemic sclerosis has three major pathogenic components: (i) fibrosis with thickening of the skin and inner organs, (ii) inflammation, and (iii) vasculopa thy. Major organs affected are the skin, the lung (pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension), the kidneys, the gastrointestinal tract, the musculoskeletal system, the retroperitoneal space , and the heart. Current treatment options for systemi c sclerosis are limited and include topical skin treatments, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, steroids, and other immunosuppressants (methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil [ MMF], azathioprine, cyclophosphamide). At present, t here are no approved drugs for the treatment of systemic sclerosis, indicating a high-level unmet medical need. The sponsor is currently pursuing the development of GLPG1690, a small -molecule autotaxin (ATX) inhibitor targeting disease -relevant signal transduction pathways, for th e treatment of systemic sclerosis. Mode of Action GLPG1690 is a novel, potent, and selective small -molecule inhibitor of ATX. ATX, also known as ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP) 2 or lysophospholipase D (LPD), is a ~120 kDa protein that belongs to the ENPP enzyme family. ATX is the only ENPP enzyme with LPD activity and is responsible for the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to produce the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The term LPA covers several chemical sp ecies able to activate LPA receptors depending on the nature of the fatty acid side chain on the glycerol backbone. The most abundant LPA species in human plasma is LPA C18:2 with a fatty acid side chain of 18 carbon atoms including two unsaturated bonds (Bandoh K. et al, 2000) . Literature data have identified the ATX/LPC axis as the main source of LPA in blood (Tanaka M. et al., 2006; Tsuda S. et al., 2006) . LPA acts through six different G -protein coupled receptors (LPA1 -6) whereby mainly LPA1 -3 have bee n associated with the pathogenic (pro -inflammatory and pro -fibrotic) effects of LPA. Targeting the ATX pathway by antagonizing LPA1 in a previous Phase 2a study (SAR100842) in systemic sclerosis was well tolerated and resulted in clinical improvements of s kin pathologies ( modified Rodnan skin score [ mRSS ]) and skin biomarkers, suggesting that"

Safety Pharmacology The safety pharmacology package conducted to investigate the potential effect of GLPG1690 on cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems did not show any biologically relevant effects. 2.1.3. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism The absolute oral bioavailability was moderate in rodents (25% to 36%), low in monk eys (14%), and high in dogs (102%). GLPG1690 was highly bound to plasma proteins: 99.1% in human and 97.9 -99.6% in rat, dog, mouse, rabbit, and monkey. Overall, GLPG1690 did not extensively distribute into tissues as shown by the low volume of distributi on at steady state (V ss) ranging from 0.35 L/kg in the mouse to 0.55 L/kg in the monkey. In rat, [14C]-GLPG1690 was widely distributed throughout the body. Highest concentrations of radioactivity were observed in contents of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract , glandular tissues, liver, and uveal tract. Some affinity was observed of GLPG1690 and/or metabolites for melanin -containing tissues, like uveal tract and meninges . After oral administration, drug -related material is excreted mainly in feces in rat (about 90% or greater). In bile duct -cannulated rats, about 50% of orally administered radioactivity was recovered in bile. Upon repeated once daily (q.d.) oral dosing of GLPG1690, no significant accumulation was observed in plasma, except in male rats (20 mg/kg/day) and dogs (50/65 mg/kg/day at Week 39). Gender differences in PK profiles were observed in rats but not in dogs. The total plasma clearance of GLPG1690 was low in mice, rats, monkeys, and dogs, ranging between 3% and 23% of the hepatic blood flow. Therefore, GLPG1690 is expected to undergo a low first -pass effect after oral dosing. The primary cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme involved in GLPG1690 metabolism was CYP3A4. In vitro metabolism studies in hepatocytes revealed 26 potential metabolites. Metabolites formed in human hepatocytes were all present to a similar or higher extent in rat and/or dog hepatocytes, the animal species selected for toxicity studies. An in vitro study with GLPG1690 in human hepatocytes showed no clinically relevant induction of human CYP2B6 and CYP2C enzymes. Weak induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, cannot be excluded at a GLPG1690 dose of 600 mg in human, with a maximal decrease of around 30% in the exposure of a sensitive probe substrate for both CYP enzymes. An in vitro study with GLPG1690 in human liver microsomes indicated no clinically relevant inhibition of the majority of CYP enzymes. Weak competitive reversible inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5 cannot be excluded at a GLPG1690 dose of 600 mg in human, with a maxima l increase of approximately 1.7- and 1. 5-fold, respectively in the exposure of a sensitive probe substrate. GLPG1690 demonstrated a strong time -dependent, irreversible inhibition potential against CYP2C8 -mediated metabolism. This could likely lead to a pro nounced interaction with a"
21,page_21,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 ­CL­204 Page 22/80 Version 5.00, Final, 28-Apr-2020 Confidential Information sensitive CYP2C8 probe substrate (increased exposure) if co -administered with a GLPG1690 dose of 600 mg in human. No interaction of GLPG1690 is expected with renal uptake transporters , organic cation transporter (OCT)2, organic a nion transporter (OAT)1 and OAT3 and hepatic efflux transporters P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). For the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1, and the multi drug and toxin extrusion (MATE) efflux transporters MATE1 (hepatic/renal) and MATE2K (renal) , a clinical interaction with GLPG1690 cannot be ruled out , however substantial interactions are not anticipated. For the intestinal efflux P -gp and BCRP transporters and the hepatic efflux bile salt exp ort pump transporters an interaction cannot be ruled out . 2.1.4. Toxicology 2.1.4.1. General Toxicology A comprehensive toxicology program has been conducted with GLPG1690. This program includes Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) oral repeat -dose toxicity studies of up to 2 6 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in dogs, embryo fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, fertility studies in male and female rats, non -TgrasH2 mice preliminary studies, preliminary carcinogenicity studies, and i vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies. Additional toxicology studies conducted include phototoxicity studies and dose range -finding studies in rats and dogs. In rats, no GLPG1690 -related mortality was observed. The dose -limiting adverse effects consisted of reduced food consumption and markedly decreased body weight (BW) gain at 1,000 mg/kg/day in the 4 -week toxicity study, histopathological changes in the testes with reduced sperm parameters at ≥130 mg/kg/day in the 13 - and 26 -week GLP studies, and the presence of vacuolated alveolar macrophage s, with alveolar amorphous material and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs of females in the 26 -week GLP study. The no observed adverse effects level (NOAEL) values in rats were set at 40 and 130 mg/kg/day in males and females, respec tively, in the 26 -week GLP study. In repeat oral dose toxicity studies in dogs, the dose -limiting effects corresponded to decreased white blood cell count and food consumption , emesis and BW loss, associated with poor clinical conditions at doses ≥100 mg/ kg/day in the 13 - and 39 -week GLP studies, respectively. QT prolongation (in 4 -, 13-, and 39 -week studies), which was considered non -adverse, were also observed in repeat oral dose toxicity studies in dogs. Additional adverse findings in dogs consisted of adverse altered sperm parameters and inflammatory cell infiltrates in the liver and minimal bile duct hyperplasia at 150/100 mg/kg/day (in the 13 -week GLP toxicity study) and QT prolongation (in 4 -, 13- and 39 -week studies). The NOAEL value in dogs was set at 50/65 mg/kg/day in the 39 -week GLP study. Male and female fertility studies in rats showed that there were no effects of GLPG1690 on mating performance, fertility, or reproduction in either male or female rats at the different dose levels tested. As t he effects on sperm and testis proved reversible and had no functional impact on animal fertility parameters, the risk of an impact on male fertility in adult subjects is considered low. In males, the no observed effect level (NOEL) for mating performance and fertility was set at 400 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL for sperm changes was determined at 40 mg/kg/day; the latter is in line with previous studies ( i.e.13 week rat study). In females, the NOEL for mating performance and fertility was considered to be 120 mg/kg/day."
22,page_22,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 ­CL­204 Page 23/80 Version 5.00, Final, 28-Apr-2020 Confidential Information In reproductive embryofetal development studies with GLPG1690 in rats and rabbits, major external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities were seen in fetuses of both species as well as increased incidences of post -implantation losses. In rats, the maternal and developmental NOAELs were determined at 60 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. In rabbits, the maternal and developmental NOAELs were determined at 15 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day , respectively . GLPG1690 showed no genotoxic effects in vitr o or in vivo. GLPG1690 showed a phototoxic potential in vitro. However, this potential has not been confirmed in an in vivo study in female pigmented Long -Evans rats , investigating the phototoxic effects on the eyes and the skin. No evidence of cutaneous o r ocular phototoxicity was noted at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg. 2.2. BACKGROUND - CLINICA L STUDIES 2.2.1. Clinical Safety In clinical pharmacology studies , GLPG1690 has been administered to 85 healthy subjects as single doses (dose range: 20 to 1500 mg) , to 96 healthy subjects in repeated doses (dose range: 100 to 1000 mg for either 7 or 14 days) . Administration of GLPG1690 in these Phase 1 studies was considered safe and well tolerated. No deaths, other serious treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs leading to IMP discontinuation, or clinically significant abnormalities related to laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, or physical examinations were reported during any of these Phase 1 studies. GLPG1690 was well tolerated a nd all TEAEs were at most moderate in severity . Administration of oral doses of GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. as a capsule for 12 weeks in 17 subjects with IPF was well tolerated (Phase 2a study GLPG1690 -CL-202). No deaths were reported. Serious TEAEs were experie nced by one subject in the GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. group (cholangiocarcinoma, led to permanent discontinuation) and by two subjects in the placebo group ( atrioventricular block second degree in one subject, led to permanent discontinuation; and lower respirat ory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and acute kidney injury in the other subject). None of these serious TEAEs were considered related to IMP. No notable differences were observed in the incidences of treatment -emergent abnormalities between subjects with IPF treated with GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. or placebo. The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. No clinically significant abnormalities related to laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, or physical examinations were reported. 2.2.2. Clinical Efficacy Following 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with IPF in study GLPG1690 -CL-202, on-site forced vital capacity ( FVC ) spirometry performed at screening, baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 (or at early discontinuation [ ED], if applicable), and at follow -up (2 weeks after the last IMP intake ) showed that FVC values remained stable in the majority of subjects taking GLPG1690 600 mg q.d."

Clinical Pharmacokinetics GLPG1690 formulated as a liquid sus pension was rapidly absorbed with a median time to maximum observed plasma concentration (t max) of 0.5 to 2 hours. Steady -state exposure of GLPG1690 increased approximately (slight over proportionality) in proportion with the dose between 300 to 1,000 mg total daily dose. Excretion of unchanged GLPG1690 in human urine was low (<1.8% in 24 hours) and rapid. There was no impact on the urinary 6 -β-OH- cortisol/cortisol ratio after repeated dosing suggesting a lack of CYP3A4 induction by GLPG1690. Given as tab let, food decreased the rate of absorption of GLPG1690 but there was no clinically relevant difference in the bioavailability of GLPG1690. A higher between -subject variability was observed in fasted state, with four subjects out of 12 having 5 - to 10 -fold lower exposure than the other subjects. The rate of elimination was not impacted by food. The overall mean terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2) after a single dose as tablets was approximately 11 hours . GLPG1690 exposure is reduced up to 90% by the strong CYP3A4/potent P -gp inducer rifampin (by 6.0 - and 9.3 -fold for C max and area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 h [AUC 0-24h], respectively). Exposure of GLPG1690, as measured by the area under the plasma concentration -time curve fr om time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞), was 3 - and 4 fold greater when administered in combination with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and potent P -gp inhibitor) and voriconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, but non -P-gp inhibitor), respectively, tha n when as administered alone. Maximum exposure (C max) of GLPG1690 increased slightly following administration of GLPG1690 in combination with itraconazole or voriconazole compared with administration of GLPG1690 only (C max values were 1.4 -fold greater foll owing administration in combination with itraconazole or voriconazole). This increase is unlikely to be clinically significant. GLPG1690 can therefore be classified as a moderately sensitive substrate of CYP3A4 as it demonstrated an increase in AUC of ≥2 t o <5- fold with strong index inhibitors . The PK of GLG1690 was similar between Caucasian and Japanese healthy male subjects. The PK of GLPG1690 in subjects with IPF was not markedly different from those observed in healthy subjects at the same dose level. 2.2.4. Clinical Pharmacodynamics After a single administration of GLPG1690, a significant dose -dependent percentage reduction of LPA C18:2 was observed in plasma. This effect started from 0.5 hours after IMP intake, reached a plateau, and was sustained over time u p to 24 hours after IMP intake. Multiple q.d. or b.i.d. ascending doses resulted in a similar effect on LPA C18:2. A strong reduction in LPA C18:2 levels was already observed at Day 14 before IMP intake, pointing to a sustained effect over 14 days. The su stained effect on LPA C18:2 was also confirmed by area under the effect -time curve (AUEC) for the percentage reduction from baseline and maximum effect (expressed as a percentage reduction from baseline) (E max).GLPG1690 induced a fast and sustained reducti on in plasma LPA C18:2 levels in subjects with IPF, indicative for target engagement. At the follow -up visit, the mean LPA C18:2 level was back to baseline levels, indicating that the inhibitory effect of GLPG1690 on the target is reversible."

CLINICAL STUDY RATIONALE Systemic sclerosis is a chronic and progressive disease with the highest morbidity and mortality among all autoimmune diseases without any approved drug, indicating a high unmet medical need for the development of novel disease -modifying therapies. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate an essential role for ATX, an enzyme wit h LPD activity responsible for the production of the pro-inflammatory/pro -fibrotic mediator LPA, in systemic sclerosis: ATX mRNA expression is significantly increased in systemic sclerosis skin biopsies compared to controls. In response to LPA, systemic sc lerosis -derived dermal fibroblasts produce significant amounts of IL -6 that has been involved in systemic sclerosis pathogenesis. Two preclinical studies using independent skin fibrosis models (bleomycin and sclerodermatous cGvHD models) demonstrated a hig h level of target engagement and efficacy upon ATX inhibition. Moreover, GLPG1690 dose -dependently inhibited the production of the fibrogenic mediator CTGF by human dermal fibroblasts upon TGFβ -triggering. Overall, inhibition of ATX has the potential for a triple mechanism of action in systemic sclerosis: (i) inhibition of pro -fibrotic LPA, (ii) inhibition of pro -inflammatory IL -6 (ATX -IL-6 loop), and (iii) inhibition of angiogenic ET -1, thereby addressing all three major pathogenic components of systemic s clerosis (described in Section 2.1.2 ). GLPG1690 is currently in clinical development for the treatment of patients with IPF. This study will assess GLPG1690 as a pot ential first -in-class disease -modifying drug for systemic sclerosis. As described in Section 2.2, results from a GLPG1690 Phase 1 first -in-human study (GLPG1690 -CL-101) generated promising PD results (target engagement, LPA reduction) and indicated that GLPG1690 was generally safe and well tolerated in a population of healthy subjects. Moreover, safety, PK, and PD properties were successfully evaluated i n a Phase 2a study in subjects with IPF (GLPG1690 -CL-202). In a previous Phase 2a study (SAR100842), targeting the ATX pathway in systemic sclerosis by antagonizing LPA1 was well tolerated and resulted in clinical improvements of skin pathologies (mRSS) an d skin biomarkers, suggesting that targeting the ATX pathway is promising in modulating skin pathologies in systemic sclerosis (Allanore T. et al., 2018) . When viewed in combination, these preclinical and clinical studies strongly suggest that interfering with ATX by GLPG1690 in systemic sclerosis is a promising novel disease - modifying approach."
27,page_27,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 ­CL­204 Page 28/80 Version 5.00, Final, 28-Apr-2020 Confidential Information 4.2.1. Dose Rationale A dose of GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. for oral administration has been selected to be evaluated in this Phase 2a study. This selection is based on the effec tive dose tested in a Phase 2a study in subjects with IPF (GLPG1690 -CL-202) and on the observations made on efficacy, PD, PK, safety, and tolerability in the same study, where GLPG1690 was evaluated as monotherapy versus placebo, as well as on the Phase 1 results in the healthy -subject study (GLPG1690 -CL-101). A population PK and PK/PD model was developed to describe the exposure -response relationships of GLPG1690 and LPA C18:2 as PD biomarker. Subsequent simulations suggest that the anticipated therapeutic dose of 600 mg leads to 88% ( range: 86%-89%) LPA C18:2 reduction at steady state. Predicted concentrations at a dose of 600 mg q.d. were above the LPA C18:2 IC 50 for 100% of the dosing interval. 4.2.2. Clinical Study Design Rationale This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled, multi -center , Phase 2a 24-week study in subjects with systemic sclerosis. The randomized double -blind study design was chosen because it is the most rigorous method to generate high -quality scientific data and there is no approved alternative treatment available for comparison . A placebo -controlled study contains internal evidence of assay sensitivity (i.e. when a difference is demonstrated, it is interpretable without reference to external f indings), measures absolute safety and efficacy (i.e. it measures the total pharmacologically mediated effect of treatment), is very efficient (i.e. can measure treatment effects with a smaller sample size compared with any other type of controlled study) and minimizes the effect of subject and investigator expectations (ICH E10, 2000) . The 2:1 randomization to GLPG1690 avoids unnecessary exposure of subjects to placebo and is typical for Phase 2a studies in systemic sclerosis. The subject eligibility crite ria are typical for patient studies in early progressive diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Based on current European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR ) and Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium (SCTC) recommendations, background treatment is allowed as defined in Section 4.5.3.2 , “Prior and Concomitant Medication s”. The study duration (24 weeks) was chosen based on experience with previous clinic al studies in diffuse systemic sclerosis with a similar mode of action and similar clinical endpoint s. The 12 -week follow -up period was chosen based on experience with a previous clinical study targeting LPA1 in order to assess the occurrence of flares after IMP discontinuation in subjects with systemic sclerosis compared to placebo. 4.3. ENDPOINTS Based on in -house and external preclinical data as well as regulatory experience from previous Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in systemic sclerosis , mRSS is chosen as primary endpoint. mRSS is a validated outcome measure used in numerous clinical studies in systemic sclerosis and has a defined Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) . mRSS is valuable fo r the evaluation of new treatments for systemic sclerosis as it not only reflects the skin disease component but also inner organ fibrosis in a non invasive manner."

No data have been generated in lactating women and on excretion in milk. In view of the teratogenic effects seen in animals and limited knowledge of the possible effe cts of GLPG1690 on lactation at this stage of development, GLPG1690 should not be given to pregnant or lactating women. In addition, highly effective contraceptive measures/preventive exposure measures should be taken by women of childbearing potential (WO CBP) and by men to prevent pregnancy and to avoid the risk of exposure of the embryo or fetus. Detailed information on contraceptive measures is given in Section 4.5.3 .1. QT Interval Prolongation The potential effect of GLPG1690 on QT interval prolongation is not fully known . Consequently , subjects with long QT syndrome or QTcF >450 ms during screening will be excluded. The chronic use or initiation of medication known to prolong the QT interval needs to be evaluated on a case -by-case basis. Periodic ECG recording and monitoring with central reading will be implemented for the duration of the study. A list intended as guidance for the investigator is provided in Appendix 5 . Drug -drug Interaction For potential concomitant medication interactions, specific monitoring and guidance will be implemented during the study (refer to Section 4.5.3.2 ). Clinical Studies GLPG1690 has been evaluated in several clinical pharmacology studies and in the GLPG1690 - CL-202 study with subjects with IPF . Administration of GLPG1690 was generally safe and well tolerated. In the GLPG1690 -CL-202 study, FVC values remained stable in the majority of subjects on GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. (+8 mL mean change from baseline) when administered for 12 weeks (refer to Section 2.2). Special Populations As there is limited clinical experience with GLPG1690 so far, the IMP should not be administered to subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment or hepatic impairment. Refer to the IB for GLPG1690 (Edition 6, 28-Jun-2019 ) and relevant updates/addenda for additional information on the safety of the IMP."

Female subjects In line with the Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA)’s Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) recommendation, female subjects are considered of non -childbearing potential if they meet one of the following criteria:  No menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulat ing hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal rang e may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insu fficient.  Permanently surgically sterile (bilateral oophorectomy [i.e. surgical removal of ovaries ], bilateral salpingectomy , or hysterectomy [i.e. surgical removal of uterus ]). All other female subjects are considered to be of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and must use one of the following highly effective methods of birth control prior to the first dose of IMP, during the clinical study and for at least 30 days after the last d ose of IMP:  Combined (estrogen and progesterone containing) (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) hormonal contraception associat ed with inhibition of ovulation plus a barrier method1.  Progesterone -only h ormonal (oral, injectable, implantable) contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation plus a barrier method1.  Intrauterine device .  Intrau terine hormone -releasing system .  Bilateral tubal occlusion.  Sexual abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evalu ated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a clinical study, withdr awal, spermicides only , and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable as methods of contraception. In case a WOCBP has a vasectomized partner, provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP clinical study participant and that the vase ctomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success, then she is not required to use an additional form of contraception. Within these limits, the specific forms of contraception employed are left to the discretion of the subject, the investigator, and/or the subject’s physician. WOCBP will be requested to do a monthly urine pregnancy test during the treatment period , and a urine pregnancy test at the Follow -up Visit 1 . The monthly pregnancy test for Weeks 12 and 20 will be performed a t home by the subject using home testing kits . The site will construct the subjects on how to use and read the pregnancy tests. The outcome must be documented on the subject diary card and the site will obtain the results during the phone call and record in the source and case report form (CRF). In case of a positive urine pregnancy test at home, the subject should immediately contact the clinical study center and the investigator 1 As there is no current data available regarding potential interactions between IMP and hormonal contraceptives, female subjects who use hormonal contraception should supplement this with a barrier method (preferably male condom)."

Male subjects Men should be advised not to father a child while receiving treatment and must use ef fective contraception during and up to 90 days after treatment. Male subjects intending to father a child, should discontinue treatment with IMP and wait for at least 90 days before stopping the contraceptive measures detailed in this section. Non-vasectom ized male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use a condom from the time of the first dose of IMP, during the clinical study, and for at least 90 days after the last dose of IMP, in addition to having their female par tner use one of the following forms of contraception:  Combined (estrogen and progesterone containing) (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.  Progesterone -only hormonal (oral, injectable, implantab le) contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.  Intrauterine device .  Intrauterine hormone -releasing system. Sexual abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments is considered a highly effective contraceptive measure. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated i n relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

In case additional concomitant medication needs to be administered or dose adjustments for pre-existing conditions need to be performed during the study, the benefit -risk to the subject should be carefully assessed and consideration given to the timing of any necessary introduction of new medications. The following medications are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit and during the treatment period : warfarin, antifibrotic agents (including colchicine, minocycline, tyrosine kinase inhibitors [nilotinib, imatinib, dasatinib, nintedanib ], pirfenidone ), bosentan or Type 1 oral collagen . The following medications are prohibited within 3 months prior to the baseline visit and during the treatment period : steady dose of prednisone or its equivalent >10 mg/day, methotrexate >20 mg/week, azathioprine >150 mg/day, MMF >3 g/day, mycophenolic acid >2.16 g/day, leflunamide >20 mg/day. Cyclophosphamide is prohibited within 6 mo nths prior to the baseline visit and during the treatment period , as well as t he following biologics : tocilizumab or other drugs targeting IL -6/IL-6 receptor , abatacept, anti -tumor necrosis factor (TNF ) drugs, rituximab , belimumab, or other monoclonal antibodies . If during the study, the subject’s condition necessitates the use of one of the abovementioned medications (excluding prednisone or its equivalent >10 mg/day ), the use of IMP should be interrupted until resolution or stabilization of this cond ition, preferably after consultation with the contract research organization ( CRO ) medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available). Precautions with concomitant medication known to prolong the QT i nterval The use of medication known to prolong QT interval during the study needs to be based on a benefit -risk evaluation by the investigator, e.g. in the case of atrial fibrillation. In certain other situations (e.g. the initiation of macrolides or fluor oquinolones in case of a lower respiratory tract infection), when the benefit -risk evaluation necessitates the administration of medication known to or potentially prolonging QT, IMP can be interrupted as evaluated by the investigator after clinical assess ment of the subject’s profile, including the baseline QTcF and how this has changed over time for this specific subject. If the investigator elects to continue IMP , additional monitoring will be performed as per investigator’s judgment. A nonexhaustive lis t of medication known to prolong QT interval is provided in Appendix 5 . Note: In case QT interval prolongation is reported in a subject while receiving one of these medications, the investigator should follow the labels and Risk Eva luation and Mitigation Strategies guidance."
36,page_36,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 ­CL­204 Page 37/80 Version 5.00, Final, 28-Apr-2020 Confidential Information Precautions with other concomitant medications At dose levels of 600 mg q.d., GLPG1690 has the potential to substantially influence the metabolism of CYP2C8 substrates and to potentially be influenced by known strong CYP3A4/potent P -gp inducers/inhibitors.  GLPG1690 demonstrated a strong time -dependent inhibition potential against CYP2C8 -mediated metabolism. Consequently, GLPG1690 should not be used concomitantly with medications primarily or solely metabolized via CYP2C8 (see Appendix 1 ). For other medications involving part of their metabolism pathway via CYP2C8, caution should be applied on a case -by-case basis taking into consideration the benefit -risk ratio. Statins such as fluvastati n and pitavastatin are metabolized to some degree by CYP2C8, and need to be used with caution. Other statins such as simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin are theoretically less metabolized by CYP2C8. Monitoring of LFTs and creatine kinase is implement ed during the study, and guidance to the subject aligned with guidance for statins in clinical practice is therefore strongly recommended. Loperamide is also a substrate of CYP2C8, and special caution should be applied in alignment with clinical practice.  GLPG1690 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P -gp, and could therefore be influenced by their respective inhibitors and inducers. GLPG1690 exposure is reduced up to 90% by the strong CYP3A4/potent P -gp inducer rifampin. As a consequence, strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P -gp are part of the exclusion criteria and should be avoided during the study to ensure proper exposure to GLPG1690 (see Appendix 2 ). For inhibition, strong CYP3A4 and dual strong 3A4 and potent P -gp inhibitors have shown that GLPG1690 exposure increased by 3 to 4 fold when coadministered , therefore use of known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and potent P -gp inhibitors is prohibited during the study (see Appendix 3 and Appendix 4 ). Antibiotics from the macrolide therapeutic class are excluded, unless they are used for the short -term treatment of a lower respiratory tract infection with interruption of IMP, which is restarted as soon as possible after the completion of the treatment w ith macrolides. It is highly recommended that the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available) are consulted before the initiation of medication known to prolong QT interval, to be a CYP2C8 s ubstrate, or to inhibit or induce P -gp/CYP3A4. In certain situations, when the benefit -risk evaluation necessitates the administration of medication excluded from use during the study, the use of IMP should be interrupted until resolution or stabilization of this condition, preferably after consultation with the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available) and restarted as soon as possible. As a rule, inclusion of subjects with stable chronic illness on stable medications which are metabolized/transported by the abovementioned CYP/transporter enzymes should be decided on a case -by-case basis if not excluded or prohibited, taking into account the medical history, concomitant medication of the s ubject, the therapeutic index of the medication, and safety profile. As indicated in the study contact list, the CRO medical monitor should be contacted, or the sponsor’s study physician in case the former is not available (when deemed necessary by the investigator), specifically for medication with a narrow therapeutic index and/or a risk of (un)predictable AEs."

The decision to continue the IMP should be taken on a case -by-case basis. 4.5.3.3. Food and Beverage Restrictions The use of St . John’s Wort is prohibited during the study. Double -strength grapefruit juice is poten tially a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and therefore should be avoided during the study. 4.5.3.4. Other Prohibitions and Restrictions Not applicable. 4.5.4. Treatment Discontinuation ( Temporarily and Permanently), Subject Withdrawal , and Study Termination A subject may be withdrawn from the clinical study at any time without the subject’s consent if the investigator or sponsor determines that it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue participation. In such case, the reason for withdrawal wil l be documented in the source documents, and the subject will complete the ED visit and follow -up visits for safety assessments. Treatment with IMP should be discontinued by the investigator (preferably after discussion with the CRO medical monitor, who ma y consult and must inform the sponsor’s study physician) for any of the following conditions:  Life-threatening AE or an SAE that places the subject at immediate risk.  Serious infections deemed related to study treatment by the investigator, and requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy and/or hospitalization .  Confirmed pregnancy : if a subject becomes pregnant during the study (to be confirmed by local serum pregnancy test; central measurement will also be performed), the IMP has to be stopped immediately and the subject has to be followed up until birth or otherwise termination of pregnancy. The subject needs to be unblinded immediately and repeat counseling on birth defect risk must be offered in case she was on active drug.  Arrhythmia or conduction abnor mality, including but not limited to prolonged QTcF, where the severity is categorized as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or higher (QTc F >500 ms on at least two separate ECGs).  An increase for QTcF with >60 ms change from ba seline (Visit 2) or QTcF >500 ms at any ECG recording (triplicate mean or single) needs to be confirmed by an ECG recording as soon as possible from the original abnormal recording at the same visit. In case of an abnormal ECG on both of these two recordin gs, the investigator needs to send an immediate alert to the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available). If the ECG abnormality is before IMP intake, IMP administration will be withheld unt il the central reader has reviewed the ECG registration. In case of confirmation of the ECG abnormality, IMP will be discontinued for this subject."

If the routine random or postprandial total serum bile acid sample is >3x ULN, then the subject should have a fasted sample taken within 1 to 5 days. The results of this test will determine whether the subject should discontinue IMP or not. When test results need to be confirmed, the subject should return to the clinical study center and be evaluated as soon as pos sible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment. In addition to repeating AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine ki nase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), INR, and alkaline phosphatase. A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family histo ry, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced subject, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver im aging (e.g. biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investi gations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs. Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs . Every effort should be made to keep subjects in the study and on treatment. However, the investigator can consider stopping the treatmen t with GLPG1690 or placebo , preferably after consultation with the sponsor’s study physician, in case of concerns about the subject’s safety, major protocol noncompliance, serious or severe AEs or worsening of the disease condition, which in the investigat or’s opinion needs an alternative treatment approach not being covered in the clinical study (e.g. rescue medication) . When study treatment is discontinued, the subject will be requested to return for the ED visit and follow -up visits. Subjects will be in formed prior to clinical study entry that they are allowed to withdraw from the clinical study. At any time and for any reason, a subject’s participation in the clinical study may terminate at his/her request without prejudice to his/her future medical car e. The subject will be encouraged to share the reason(s) for withdrawal so this can be documented in the source documents, and to complete the ED visit and follow -up visit s for safety assessments, but will not be obliged to do so. Subjects who withdraw fro m the clinical study without contact with the clinical study center (lost-to-follow -up) should be contacted by the clinical study center so that their health status can be assessed and documented in the source documents.

All attempts must be documented in the source documents. Subjects who discontinue IMP or the study will not be replaced. The sponsor has the right to terminate the clinical study at any time in case of safety concerns or if special circumstances concerning the IMP or the company itself occur, making further treatment of subjects impossible . In this event, the investigator(s) and relevant authorities will be informed of the reason for clinical study termination. 4.6. MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS 4.6.1. Randomization At screening, subjects will be assigned a subject identification. When a subject is confirmed to be eligible for the clinical study, the subject will be randomized. Allocation of each subject to a given treatment will be done using a centralized electronic system (interactive web response system [I WRS]). Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. or matching placebo , respectively . For each subject at each clinical study center visit, the clinical study center will contact the IWRS for the appropriate treatment number to be assigned. The medication kit (s) will contain the relevant IMP for the period until the next clinical study center visit. Subjects and study personnel will be blinded to the treatment assigned to the subject . Additional details on blinding and unblinding are provided in Section 4.6.2 . 4.6.2. Blinding and Unblinding This is a randomized, double -blind clinical study. The subject and the entire clinical study team, including the investigators, clinical study coordinators , and sponsor personnel are blinded to treatment assignment. Blinded and packaged medication will be provided to the clinical center. The placebo formulation will match th e active formulation in size, color, shape, and appearance. All IMP formulations (active and placebo) will be packaged in the proper proportion to assure desired dosages and maintenance of the blinding. The blind can be broken only if the investigator dee ms it necessary for the safety of a subject. The investigator is encouraged to discuss considerations to break the blind with the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or the sponsor’s study physician (in case the former is not available ), whenev er possible and where the situation allows. However, the responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations resides solely with the investigator. The investigator is not required to discuss unblinding beforehand if he or she feels rapid eme rgency unblinding is necessary, but is required to inform the CRO medical monitor and the sponsor in a timely fashion after unblinding has occurred. The blind can be broken by the investigator via IWRS ."

INVESTIGATIONAL MEDI CINAL PRODUCT 5.1. IDENTITY OF THE INVE STIGATIONAL MEDI CINAL PRODUCT The IMPs (GLPG1690 and placebo) will be supplied to the clinical study center, by and under the responsibility of the sponsor, who will also provide the investigator with European Union (EU) Qualified Person release documents. GLPG1690 will be provided as film -coated tablets for oral use, containing 200 mg G451990 each (G451990 is the compound code for GLPG1690). The placebo will be provided as matching film -coated tablets for oral use. A full list of excipients used in the fil m-coated tablet formulation is available in the IB for GLPG1690 (Edition 6, 28-Jun-2019 ) and relevant updates/addenda. 5.2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTR ATION The following dose will be used:  600 mg GLPG1690 q.d. (as three GLPG1690 film -coated tablets of 200 mg).  Placebo q.d. (as three placebo film -coated tablets). The IMP is to be taken q.d. around the same time every day with food (e.g. breakfast, small meal, or a snack) or after food intake; taking into account the timing of the planned visits, with a maximum of 2 hours between the food intake and IMP intake . Subjects will be instructed to swallow the tablets as a whole with a glass of water and to not chew the IMP prior to swallowing. On clinical study center visit days, the IMP will be administered at the clini cal study center after predose assessments have been completed. If a subject misses a dose (e.g. because he/she forgot to take the medication), he/she should take the missed dose within 12 hours after the planned intake time and within 2 hours of food inta ke. If the IMP is not taken within 12 hours after the planned time, the missed dose should be skipped. 5.3. PACKAGING, LABELING , AND DISTRIBUTION The film -coated tablet for oral use will be packaged in blisters. IMP packages will be labeled with clinical study -specific details. All manufacturing, packaging, and labeling operations will be performed according to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products and the relevant regulatory requirements. Each medication kit will be identified with a unique kit num ber. A multiple of kits will be provided to the subject at each clinical study center visit, providing the subject with sufficient tablets to cover the period until the next scheduled clinical study center visit."

If Visit 9 is postponed beyond Week 24, a Direct -to-Patient (DTP) shipment of one additional IMP kit may be implemented to cover the treatment prolongation of up to 28 days. If Visit 9 is n ot conducted in the extended (±28 days) window, i.e. after Week 28, n o further IMP will be provided to the subject, and the subject will not take any IMP after Visit 9 (i.e. ultimately Week 28). The distribution to the clinical study center will only occu r after the required local documentation is obtained including clinical study approval by Competent Authorities and the IECs/IRBs, documentation on which the assessment of the investigator’s qualifications was based (e.g. curriculum vitae) and the signed a nd dated study agreement and financial agreement. 5.4. STORAGE Clinical study centers are to store all drug supplies in a secure , locked area with limited access below 30°C, protected from light, until dispensed. Clinical study centers will be required to monitor the storage temperature by using at least a calibrated minimum -maximum temperature - recording device and to keep a minimum to maximum temperature log which must be completed each working day in order to establish a record of com pliance with these storage conditions. The investigator will instruct subjects on how the IMP should be stored at home. 5.5. TREATMENT COMPLIANCE AND DRUG ACCOUNTABI LITY For each dose taken at home, the date and number of tablets taken should be recorded on the subject diary card (see Section 6.4 for additional information). Any interruption or change in treatment (together with the reason for change) shou ld be documented on the subject diary card. The pharmacist or designated clinical study personnel will maintain a log of the total amount of IMP received at the clinical study center , the amount dispensed to the subject, and the amount of IMP returned by t he subject to the clinical study center . IMP supplies for each subject will be inventoried and accounted for throughout the clinical study. At the end of the treatment period , these records will be checked against the inventory by the study monitor. All cl inical supplies will be stored in locked facilities. Subjects will return any unused IMP and empty IMP packages at each clinical study center visit. Missed doses should be discussed to try to ascertain the reason(s). Every effort should be made to ensure p roper subject dosing. Subjects with poor compliance will be retrained by the clinical study center . Upon sponsor approval , all unused IMP and empty IMP packages will be destroyed at the clinical study center . If destruction by the clinical study center is not possible or the destruction process is found unacceptable by the sponsor, the IMP should be returned to the drug supplier/drug depot as appropriate. At each clinical study center visit, clinical study center staff will review treatment compliance by assessing the number of returned IMP. 6.

All screening tests will be reviewed to confirm eligibility before randomization and IMP intake . Retesting of individual screening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, with the following exceptions AND only in case it is still possible to randomize the subject within the per -protocol defined screening period of 28 days:  Laboratory values for LFTs, eGFR , and hemoglobin can be retested once .  Lost or invalid blood or urine samples . Rescreening: in case of screening failure, subjects are allowed to be rescreened maximum two times, after signing a new ICF. Rescreening can start at least 6 weeks after the initial laboratory testing of the previous screening. 6.4. SUBJECT DIARY CARD Subjects will be given diary card s from Visit 2 until Follow -up Visit 1 to record the following:  From Day 1 until the last visit of the treatment period, subjects will be asked to record the date of IMP intake , the number of tablets taken for each administration , any change in intake and reason for the change, and monthly urine pregnancy test outcome (only for WOCBP, see Section 4.5.3.1.1 ).  From Day 1 until Follow -up Visit 2, subjects will be asked to record changes in concomitant medication regimen, including new medicines not captured in medication history, and any other concomitant medication used as well as any emerging AE . Subjec ts will be instructed to bring their diary card s and used/unused IMP to each clinical study center visit. At each clinical study center visit, review of compliance with the diary card s and subject re -training if needed, will be performed. 6.5. EFFICACY ASSESSM ENTS 6.5.1. Modified Rodnan Skin Score mRSS is an established primary outcome measure in most therapeutic studies in systemic sclerosis, based on the evidence that skin thickness serves as a surrogate for overall disease activity, severity, and mortality in syste mic sclerosis. mRSS scoring will be performed at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline), Visits 4, 5, 7, and 9, ED (if applicable), and Follow -up Visit 1. mRSS will be assessed in a standardized manner according to published protocols by the SCTC and the World Scleroderma Foundation (Khanna D. et al., 2017) by the responsible study physician . Preferably , each subject will be assessed by the same study physician (or nurse practitioner, as acceptable according to local clinical study center setup and meeting the experience criterion defined outside the protocol ) for the entire study . The 17 -site mRSS will be used, with each site assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 with a maximum score of 51. For individual subjects, clinically meaningful changes in skin score (MCID) are 4 .7 skin score units and/or at least 20% change in overall mRSS (Khanna D. et al., 2006). Regardless of experience, each assessor will need to undergo study -specific training and qualification to ensure consistency. In the event of a chan ge of assessor, consistency of scoring between assessors should ideally be assessed and documented (i.e. new and previous assessor carry out scoring in parallel)."

SAFETY ASSESSMENTS This section describes methods and timing for all safety assessments and r ecording. Additional assessments (e.g. unscheduled clinical laboratory tests or extra vital signs recordings) are allowed to ensure appropriate collection of safety data and to assess any perceived safety concerns. For subjects who, due to any COVID -19-related reason, cannot perform the study procedures . If Visit 9 needs to be postponed until after Week 24, regular phone calls at Week 24 and every 14 days thereafter should be implemented to evaluate the subject’s safety until a visit can take place on -site. In addition, if any of the follow -up visits cannot be performed on site, a phone call to evaluate the subject’s safety should be performed. During these phone calls, the investigator should at least discuss the following items and collect the following information as much as possible:  subject ’s general condition and ongoing study medication intake  information on any adverse events (changes of ongoing or new events)  information on concomitant medication intake  completion of subject diary cards and urine p regnancy test and result (monthly, if applicable) by the subject  the possibility for local laboratory testing, vital signs , and ECG should be considered , and discussed . This local testing may occur either prior to the phone call, or as a consequence of the exchanged information, at the discretion of the investigator . All adverse events including those based on, or identified by local testing need to be reported in the eCRF, and any SAEs sh ould be reported within 24 hours with the SAE form. Urine pregnancy tests to perform the monthly pregnancy test at home until follow -up visit 1 (if applicable) and treatment or follow -up diary cards will also be shipped to the patient to cover the longer period between on -site visits. 6.6.1. Adverse Events The AEs reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject signs the ICF and ends at his/her last follow -up visit as defined in the Schedule of Activities (see Section 6.11). Detailed definitions, ratings , and reporting requirements for AEs and SAEs are found in Section 9. 6.6.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations The following clinical laboratory safety tests will be performed:  Hematology : hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin , mean corpuscul ar hemoglobin concentration, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, white blood cell differential count (absolute and relative), and platelets.  Coagulation : INR, thromboplastin time, and partial thromboplastin time.  Serum/plasma c hemistr y: random glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, phosphorus, AST, ALT, GGT , total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase,"

Positive hepatitis and HIV results should be reported by the investigator as required by local law.  FSH test for females at screening to confirm menopause if applicable .  Pregnancy test for females : serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin at screening, urine pregnancy test on a monthly basis (only for WOCBP). The clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at visits specified in the Schedule of Activities in Section 6.11 (see also Section 6.1, “Timing of Assessments ”). Reference ranges will be supplied by the central laboratory. Clinical laboratory values outside the normal range will be flagged and clinical relevance will be assessed by the investigator . Only laboratory test abnormalities judged as clinically significant by the principal investigator should be recorded as AEs . The details of blood and urine sample handling and shipment instructions will be provided in a separate laboratory manual. 6.6.3. Physi cal Examination Physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner (as acceptable according to local regulation ) at visits specified in the Schedule of Activities in Section 6.11. The person conducting the physical examination will document this in the subject’s medical records. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs. Height and weight will only be recorded at screening. 6.6.4. Vital Signs Vital signs ( SBP, DBP , heart rate, respiratory rate , and body temperature) will be recorded in a standardized manner (i.e. after the subject has rested in a supine position for 5 minutes) at visits specified in the Schedule of Activities in Section 6.11. Clinically significant abnormal values should be recorded as AEs. 6.6.5. 12-lead Electr ocardiogram At the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities ( see Section 6.11) a 12-lead ECG will be recorded and results will be sent for central reading . Triplicate ECGs will be performed irrespective of IMP intake at Visit 1 (screening), within 30 minutes before IMP intake and between 2 to 3 hours after IMP intake at Visit 2 (baseline) and Visit 3. A single ECG will be performed within 30 minutes before IMP intake at Visits 7 and 9, and irrespective of IMP intake at ED (if applicable) and Follow -up Visit 1. The ECG m ust be taken after subjects rested for at least 5 minutes in the supine position.

STATISTICAL METHODS All statistical methods shall be detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) that will be prepared before the Week 24 primary analysis. All relevant data collected in this clinical study will be documented using summary tables, figures, and subject data listings. Any deviations from the protocol are to be justified in the SAP. 7.1. DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE Sample size was based on empirical considerations . The number of subjects (30) included in this study should give reasonable precision around the estimates derived for the efficacy evaluation. The primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in mRSS over 24 weeks. Considering 20 and 10 subjects in the GLPG1 690 and placebo arm, respectively, and a common standard deviation of 5 on the change from baseline in mRSS, the MCID of 4.7, and taking into account a 10% dropout, the probability to observe a treatment effect of more than 4 points is 63%. 7.2. POPULATION FOR ANALYSES 7.2.1. All Screened Subjects All subjects who signed and dated an ICF and underwent screening assessments to check whether or not they are eligible to participate in the clinical study. 7.2.2.

Analyses of Safety Data All safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set (Section 7.2.6 ). All safety data collected on or after the first dose of IMP administration up to the last contact after the last dose of IMP, unless specified otherwise, will be summarized by treatment group according to the IMP received. Clinical safety will be addressed by assessing AEs, laboratory assessments, phys ical examinations, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs. 7.3.6.1. Extent of Exposure A subject’s extent of exposure to IMP will be generated from the IMP administration page of the CRF. Exposure data will be summarized by treatment group. Duration of exposure to IMP will be expressed as the number of days between the first and last dose of IMP, inclusive, regardless of temporary interruptions in IMP administration and summarized by treatment group. 7.3.6.2. Adverse Events Clinical and laboratory AEs will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. System Organ Class (SOC), High Level Group Term, High -Level Term, Preferred Term, and Lower -Level Term will be attached to the clinical database. The following AEs will be considered as treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs): Any AE with an onset date on or after the start of IMP intake and no later than 30 days after last dose of IMP, or any worsening of any AE on or after the start of IMP intake . AEs reported before the start of IMP or later than 30 days after the last dose of IMP will be listed. In addition, summarie s and/or listings will be provided for the suspected symptoms/AEs of flare with an onset date on or after the IMP start date until the EoS (including information from Follow -up Visit 2).

Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information An AE is considered unlisted if the nature or intensity is not consistent with the applicable product reference safety information. For an IMP, the expectedness of an AE will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the reference safety information part of the IB. 9.1.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest Not applicable. 9.1.5. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance based on the investigator’s judgment, are not considered AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (e.g. clinical chemistry, hematology , and urinalysis) or other a bnormal (clinical study -specific) assessments (e.g. ECG, radiography, vital signs) that require medical or surgical intervention, are associated with signs and/or symptoms, lead to IMP interruption, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an A E or SAE if they meet the definition as described in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 , respectively. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, the syndrome or diagnosis is to be reported (e.g. anemia instead of decreased hemoglobin). 9.1.6. Special Situations Special situations are situations that have a possible impact on the safe use of the IMP. These situations might be or might not be associated with AEs.  Pregnancy  Abuse or misuse of study drug - Abuse of study drug is defined as the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study drug, which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects. - Misuse of study drug is defined as a situation where the study drug is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the product information.  Drug interaction or food interaction with study drug - A drug interaction with study drug is defined as a situation in which there is evidence or a suspicion that the study drug interacts with another drug when both are administered together. - A food interac tion with study drug is defined as a situation in which there is evidence or a suspicion that the study drug interacts with a food when taken together.  Medication error with study drug"
61,page_61,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 ­CL­204 Page 62/80 Version 5.00, Final, 28-Apr-2020 Confidential Information - A medication error with study drug is defined as an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient.  Occupational exposure to study drug - Occupational exposure with study drug is defined as an exposure to the study drug as a result of one’s professional or non-professional occupation.  Overdose with study drug - An overdose of study drug is defined as the administration of a quantity of the study drug given per administration or cumulatively, which is the intake of more than three tablets/day  Product complai nt or quality defect of study drug - Product complaint or quality defect of study drug is defined as complaints or defects of the study drug arising from potential deviations in the manufacture, packaging, or distribution of the study drug. 9.2. ASSESSMENT OF ADV ERS E EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS The investigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causality and severity. This is the basis for the sponsor’s final review and confirmation of accuracy and completeness of event information and causality assessments. 9.2.1. Assessment of Causality The investigator is responsible for assessing the causal relationship to IMP(s) administration or study procedures (e.g. invasive procedures such as venipuncture) based on her/his clinical judgment. The following decisi on choice will be used by the investigator to describe the causality assessment between the reported event or laboratory test abnormality and the IMP.  Unrelated: Time relationship to IMP intake is improbable. Related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or subject's clinical state.  Unlikely: Time relationship to IMP intake is improbable (but not impossible). Concomitant disease or other drugs provid e plausible explanations.  Possible: Time relationship to IMP intake is reasonable. Event or laboratory test abnormality, could also be explained by disease or other drugs. Information on IMP withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  Probable: Time relationship to IMP intake is reasonable. Unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs. Response to withdrawal is clinically reasonable and rechallenge not required."
62,page_62,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 ­CL­204 Page 63/80 Version 5.00, Final, 28-Apr-2020 Confidential Information  Certain: Time relationship to IMP intake is plausible. Cannot be explained by concom itant disease or other drugs. Response to withdrawal is plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically). Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i.e. an objective and specific medical disorder or a recognized pharmacological phenomenon). Re challenge satisfactory, if ethical and necessary. It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment (worsening of the disease) should not be considered as causally related in the context of AE reporting. 9.2.2. Assessment of Severity The severity of AEs should b e graded using the C TCAE version 5.0. If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life -threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) to describe the maximum inte nsity of the AE. For purposes of consistency with the CTCAE, these intensity grades are defined in the table below. Table 2 Grading of Adverse Event Severity Grade Adjective Description Grade 1 Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated Grade 2 Moderate Local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL* Grade 3 Severe Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL** Grade 4 Life-threatening Urgent intervention indicated Grade 5 Death Death -related AE * Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. ** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using th e toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality. This is upon the investigator’s assessment. If there is a change in intensity (worsening or improvement) of an AE, it must be recorded. 9.2.3. Outcome Each AE must be rated by choosing among:  Recovered/resolved .  Recovered/re solved with sequelae .  Recovering/resolving .  Not recovered/not resolved .  Fatal .  Unknown."

INVESTIGATOR REQUIRE MENTS AND INSTRUCTIO NS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EV ENTS, SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS , PREGNANCIES , AND OTHER SPECIAL SITUATIONS TO THE SPONSOR 9.3.1. Adverse Events The AE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject signs the ICF and ends at the subject’s last follow -up visit (the last follow -up visit after the last dose of IMP) as described in the Schedule of Activities (see Section 6.11). In this period, all new AEs, regardless of cause or relationship, derived by spontaneous, unsolicited reports of subjects, by observation and by routine open questioning (such as “How do you feel?”) need to be recorded in the source and in the CRF. In case an AE is ongoing at the time of the last follow -up visit, the investigator needs to follow on the subject until AE resolution or reasonable stabilization and to document in the subject’s source documentation. No related updates or additional data on the AE should be reported in the CRF. If a subject is documented as lost -to-follow -up, ongoing/unknown outcome AEs will not be followed up. If the AE meets the criteria for seriousness, the SAE form must be completed and sent to the sponsor within 24 hours (see Section 9.3.2 ). 9.3.2. Serious Adver se Events Subjects experiencing an SAE or an emergency situation will be examined by a physician as soon as possible. The subject will remain under observation as long as medically indicated. Appropriate laboratory tests will be performed until all paramet ers return to normal or are otherwise explained or stable. All SAEs, whether or not deemed IMP -related, must be recorded in the CRF and on the SAE form. The investigator must report each SAE immediately, and under no circumstances should this exceed 24 ho urs following the knowledge of the SAE, as is indicated on page 2 under “Emergency Contact Information”. The SAE form should at least contain identifiers of the subject and the reporter, SAE term and statement of relatedness to the IMP, and at a later stag e if not yet available within 24 hours, the form needs to be completed with a clearly written narrative describing signs, symptoms, and treatment of the event, diagnostic procedures, as well as any relevant laboratory data and any sequelae. Follow -up and o utcomes should be reported and documented in the source documents for all subjects that experience an SAE. It is important that the information provided on the SAE form matches the information recorded on the CRF for the same event. Copies of additional la boratory tests, consultation reports, post mortem reports, hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents should be sent when requested and available. Only subject identifiers (subject number) should appear on the copies, and all names and init ials"
64,page_64,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 ­CL­204 Page 65/80 Version 5.00, Final, 28-Apr-2020 Confidential Information should be blackened and rendered illegible. Follow -up reports relative to the subject’s subsequent course must be submitted until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes. Any SAEs that occur after th e post -treatment follow -up visit but within 30 days of the last dose of IMP(s), regardless of causality, should also be reported (Emergency Contact Information on page 2). Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after the CSP -defined follow -up period. However, if the investigator is informed about an SAE that occurs at any time after the subjects’ post -treatment follow -up visit and the event is deemed relevant to the use of IMP(s), he/she should promptly document and report the event to the sp onsor by using the SAE form. 9.3.3. Pregnancy All initial reports of pregnancy in female subjects and pregnancies in partners of male subjects included in the clinical study must be recorded and documented in the source documents and on the pregnancy form. The investigator must report each pregnancy i mmediately, and under no circumstances should this exceed 24 hours following the knowledge of the pregnancy, as is indicated on page 2 under “Emergency Contact Information”. All pregnancies should be followed up until delivery or pregnancy interruption. T he investigator will contact the subject or partner of the subject after giving consent, at the expected time of delivery for follow -up and for information regarding the outcome of the newborn. Abnormal pregnancy and/or abnormal newborn outcomes are consid ered SAEs and must be reported using the SAE form. 9.3.4. Reporting of Special Situations ( Other Than Pregnancy) and Associated Adverse Events In case a special situation is not associated with an AE, the special situation should be reported within 24 hours by us ing the Special Situations form as is indicated on page 2 under “Emergency Contact Information” . In case a special situation is associated with an AE, the special situation should be reported within 24 hours by using the Special Situations form and the ass ociated AE should be reported as specified in Section 9.3.1 . In case a special situation is associated with an SAE, the special situation should be reported within 24 hours by using the SAE form (and not the Special Situations form) and the associated SAE should be reported as specified in Section 9.3.2 . 9.4. SPONSOR REPORTING RE QUIREMENTS Depending on relevant local legislation or regulations, including the applicable United States Federal Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations, the EU Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) and relevant updates, and other country specific legislation or regulations, the sponsor may be required to expedite to worldwide regulatory agencies reports of SAEs, serious adverse drug reactions, or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs).
