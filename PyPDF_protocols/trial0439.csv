Objective(s) Primary To assess the baseline frailty of subj ects enrolled in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022. Secondary To present the distribution of SF- 36and EQ-5Dscores in subjects included in ZOSTER- 006 and ZOSTER -022 at b!aseline by country to allow comparison with normative values for those questionnaires in the general population of the countries participating in the study . To assess vaccine efficacy against HZ by frailty status. To assess HZ burden of illness (BOI) b y frailty status . To identify predictive factors for indiv iduals developing HZ. To describe safet y per frailty status. To assess humoral immunogenicity byfrailt y status . Tertiary Todescribe CMI b yfrailty status of subjects enrolled in ZOSTER -006 only. Rationale for the studyIn the course of ZOSTER- 006 and ZOSTER -022, QoL questionnaires were encoded into the respective trial database only for subjects who developed a suspected HZ episode during the stud y. This was done to assess the QoL of subjects who developed suspected cases of HZ between the vaccine group and the placebo group. The remaining subjects who did not develop suspected cases of HZ completed the questionnaires; however ,these questionnaires were never encoded or anal ysed as par t of ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER - 022. The purpose of this study is to allow for the encoding and anal ysis of all questionnaires for subjects enrolled in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022. The aim is to assess the baseline frailty of subjects enrolled in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022 and to investigate the representativeness of the study population to the general population .Additionally , analysis of efficacy , safety and immunogenicit y will be performed b y frailt y status. The study will also explore if quality of life data an d subject characteristics reported by the subjects before the onset of HZ would be predictive of HZ.

Study design A multi -country , observational, retrospective study . Study population: All subject senrolled in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022. Type of study : Data to be anal ysed in this study have been collected in the ZOSTER -006 (eTrack 110390) and ZOSTER -022 (eTrack 113077) and will be com bined for assessment of primary , secondary and tertiary objectives. Data collection: QoL questionnaires and the year of birth of subjects enrolled in ZOSTER -006 and Z OSTER -022. QoL questionnaires: The SF- 36is a multi -purpose health survey with 36 questions. The EQ-5Dis a questionnaire with 5 questions designed as a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. T he EQ- 5Ddefines health in terms of mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression. Method: Frailt y scores for study subjects in Z OSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022 will be calculated b y incorporating the subject’s medical history and items from the SF-36and EQ-5Dquestionnaires. Discussion of study designThis is a re trospective, observational study of subjects previously enrolled in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022, therefore no new subjects will be enrolled in this study and no new ICF wi ll be required from study subjects. Number of subjects Approximately 30,000 subjects who were enrolled in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022 Endpoints Primary Baseline Frailty Status: Frailt y Status pre -vaccination dose 1 as defined by responses to components of the SF -36and EQ-5D questionnaire at vaccination day 0 and the subjects coded medical history .

Case -control study: A form of epidemiological study where the stud y population is selected on the basis of whether the subjects do (cases) or do not (controls) have the particular outcome (disease) under study . The groups are then compared with respect to exposure/ characteristic of interest. Coded: Data from which personal identifier information has been removed and replaced b y a key. These data are not anony mised since a decode listing exists and it is therefore possible to identify the patient under certain circumstances by an authorised or legally appointed third part y data custodian, or b y the original holder of the data. Eligible: Qualified for enrolment into the study based upon strict adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Epidemiological study: An observational or interventional study without administration of medicinal product(s) as described in a research protocol. Epoch: An epoch is a self -contained set of consecutive timepoint s or a single timepoint from a single protocol. Self -contained means that data co llected for all subjects at all- timepoint s within that epoch allows to draw a complete conclusion. Typical examples of epochs are retrospective data collection and prospective data collection, etc. eTrack: GSK Biologicals’ tracking tool for clinical/ epidemiological trials. modified Total Vaccinated cohort (mTVC )The mTVC will include only subjects from centres that participate in ZOSTER -064, which will exclude subjects in the TVC who were not administered the second vaccination or who developed a co nfirmed case of HZ prior to 1 month after the second vaccination (i.e. these subjects that were included in the mTVC of ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022.

No medical care or medical/scientific procedures as required in a research protocol are administered to participants except as part of routine medical care. Quality of Life (QoL) Quality of life is measured, using two questionnaires ( EQ- 5Dand SF-36 ) that were completed by the subject. EQ-5D and SF- 36provide multi -dimensional evaluation of the health status. Research protocol: A document that describes the objective(s), design, methodolog y, statistical considerations, and organisation of a study . The protocol usually also gives the background and rationale for the study , but these could be provided in other protocol referenced documents.

Varicella (ch ickenpox) shortly occurs after primary VZV infection and is characterised b y systemic illness and a widely disseminated rash. Herpes Z oster (HZ, shingles) occurs when VZV reactivates from latency and ty pically manifests as a localised, dermatomal rash. The typical HZ rash usually lasts 2 to 4 weeks and is usually accompanied by pain ; that is often described as burning, shooting, or stabbing, and pruritus, which can also be severe, may be as common as pain. In some patients, even touching the affected area l ightly may cause severe pain, a phenomenon known as allody nia. The most common complication of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), defined as pain that persists after the resolution of the HZ rash. Patients affected b y PHN ty picall y report constant burning , throbbing, intermittent sharp or electric shock -like pain, or allod ynia. PHN tends to improve over a period of months and about 70- 80% of cases resolve within 1 y ear. However, in some persons PHN persists for man y years [Dworkin , 2007]. Inclusion of subjects in clinical trials may be biased for various reasons , e.g. inclusion/exclusion criteria, selection of patients by investigators, self -selection of patients. As such, the aim of this study is to explore if the subjects in the ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER -022 studies were representative of an older adult population. This will be done by exploring the baseline frailt y status and quality of life scores of subjects within the studies. Several studies have demonstrated that the incidence and severit y of HZ increases with age [CDC , 2008]. It is also likely that the incidence and severit y of HZ is higher in frail subjects. However, as with age vaccine efficacy may somewhat lower in frail subjects. This study will therefore allow a synthesis of the benefit of vaccination in frail subjects, i.e. in terms of increased incidence, vaccine efficacy , safet y and immunogenicity . 1.1.1. Risk factors for herpes zoster Several risk factors for developing HZ have previously been identified, amongst which the age of the individual is the most common. The incidence of HZ is relatively constant at 2-3 cases per 1000 persons per y ear until age 40, and then increases progressivel y with age: At 50 -59 years of age (YOA) the incidence is about 5 cases per 10 00 persons per year, and it increases to 10 cases per 1000 persons per y ear in people ≥ 60 YOA [ CDC , 2008]. Half of all HZ cases occur in subjects over the age of 60, and individuals who reach 85 years old have a 50% chance of having HZ during their lifetime [ Oxman , 2005]. Age has also been demonstrated to be a ris k factor for the development of PHN amongst patients with HZ [ Oxman , 2005; Scott , 2006; Kanbayashi , 2012; Kawai , 2015].

20,page_20,"CONFIDENTIA L 204878 (ZOSTER- 064) Protocol Administrative Change 3 Final 11-FEB -2019 22A second factor that has been consistentl y related to HZ development is the presence of immunosuppressive conditions [ Cohen, 2007; Buchbinder , 1992; Langan , 2013]. Other factors have been suggested to be associated with an increase of HZ incidence, including female gender [ Fleming , 2004; Jung , 2004; Liu, 2015], race [ Fleming , 2004; Schmader , 1998], psy chological s ymptoms such as stress and depre ssion [ Irwin , 1998; Schmader , 1998; Lasserre , 2012], or impaired functional status [ Wolfe , 2006; Liu, 2015]. Some factors have also been associated with greater incidence of PHN among patie nts with HZ: ps ychological symptoms [ Clark, 2000; Volpi , 2 008], impaired phy sical and social functional status [ Katz , 2005; Drolet , 2010, Kawai , 2015] and severity of the HZ rash and associated pain [ Whitley , 1999; Jung , 2004; Opstelten , 2007; Drolet , 2010; Kanbay ashi, 2012]. 1.1.2 ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022 Two GSK -sponsored Phase III studies invest igated the effect of GSK’s candidate HZ /su vaccine on the incidence of the disease in subjects 50 YOA and older (ZOSTER - 006, eTrack number 110390, NCT01165177, started in 2010) [ Lal, 2015] and in subjects 70 YOA and older (ZOSTER- 022, eTrack number 113077, NCT01165229, started in 2010), respectivel y [Cunningham , 2016]. An indication in adults ≥ 50 YOA was filed for registration. HZ/su (trade name Shingrix ) was first approved in Canada and theUnited States in October 2017. As part of the stud y procedures, each subject enrolled in one of these two studies was asked to complete two quality of life (QoL) questionnaires named respectively SF-36 and EQ-5Dat predefined timepoint s. These questionnaires were to be completed independentl y from the fact th at subjects had HZ or not and provide relevant information about the QoL (functional status, ability to socialize, mental health, etc.) of subjects before they develop HZ (see APPENDIX Aand APPENDI X Bfor samples of the SF-36 and EQ-5Dquestionnaires). 1.2. Rationale for the study In the course of ZOSTER- 006 and ZOSTER -022, Quality of Life questionnaires (QoL), EQ-5Dand SF-36, were completed by all study subjects at baseline. Extracting some elements of these questionnaires and combining them with other medical history data allows attributing of frailty scores. As these questionnaires were encoded into the respective trial dat abases only for subjects who developed a suspected Herpes Zoster (HZ) episode during the studies, as per the original stud y protocols, the purpose of ZOSTER -064 is to allow for the encoding of remaining questionnaires of the subjects and anal ysisof all qu estionnaires together . This will allow classification in different levels of frailty and therefore will allow baseline frailty assessment of subjects that took part in the ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022 studies. This will inform the representativeness of the st udy sample to the general population in older adults, i.e. in terms of the proportion of subjects who are pre - frail and frail. In addition ,a comparison of the SF -36and EQ-5Dscores in subjects at baseline CONFIDENTIAL 204878 (ZOSTER-064) Protocol Administrative Change 3 Final 70882527ffe6806e42bab9a20b06541da11028ce22 11-FEB-2019"
21,page_21,"CONFIDENTIA L 204878 (ZOSTER- 064) Protocol Administrative Change 3 Final 11-FEB -2019 23with normative values for those questionnaires in the general population of the countries participating in the stud y (where these values are available) will also provide further insight in the study population and allow to better understand the study population compared to the overall target population f or the vaccine. Analy ses pertaining to efficacy , safety and immunogenicity as per frailt y score might then also be performed according to the methodology used in the ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022 studies. Additionally , the data collected can be used to assess if some phy sical, physiological and/or psy chological characteristics reported by the subjects before the onset of HZ would be predictive of HZ. This willhelp understand the previousl y hypothesized predictive factors such as stress or functional status, a nd also to assess other potential risk factors such as frailty , fatigue or emotional and mental health. 2. BENEFIT: RISK ASSESS MENT ZOSTER -064 study will use data collected as part of the SF-36 and EQ-5DQoL questionnaires completed by subjects in ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER -022 studies. There are no risks or benefit sto subjects in this study because this is a retrospective observational study . 3. OBJECTIVE S 3.1.

Therefore, adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the outline of study procedures (Section 8), are essential and required for study conduct. Type of design: Observational, retrospective stud y. Study population: Adults aged ≥50 y ears of age who participated in either ZOSTER - 006 or ZOSTER -022. Type of study : to be combined with other protocols for anal ysis:data to be anal ysed in this study have been c ollected in ZOSTER -006 (eTrack 110390) and ZOSTER - 022 (eTrack 113077). Data collection :CRF/eCRF Duration of the stud y: The time between the first and the last information to be encoded will be approximately 8 months. 4.1. Discussion of study design This is a retrospective, observational study , therefore no new subjects will be enrolled in this study and no new I CF will be required from study subjects (see Section 7.2). In ZOSTER- 006 and ZOSTER -022, encoding of QoL questionnaires ( SF-36 , EQ-5D) was only performed for subjects who developed a suspected HZ episode durin g the study . This was done to assess the QoL of subjects who developed suspecte d cases of HZ between the vaccine group and the placebo group. The remaining stud y subjects who did not develop suspected cases of HZ completed the questionnaires; however ,these questionnaires were never encoded or analy sed as part of ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTE R- 022. The purpose of ZOSTE R-064 is to allow for the encoding of the remaining questionnaires to assess the baseline frailty ofall the subjects in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022. 5. HZ CASE DEFINITION Classification as a HZ confirmed case was done during ZOSTER- 006 and ZOSTER - 022, after confirmation of all suspected HZ cases b y either of the two following way s: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): Rash lesion samples were collected from subjects clinically diagnosed as having a suspected case of HZ. The sample s were transferred to GSK Biologicals or a validated laboratory designated by GSK Biologicals using standardised and validated procedures for laboratory diagnosis of HZ by PCR. For more information, please refer to Appendix B of the ZOSTER -006 protocol . The HZ Ascertainment Committee: CONFIDENTIAL 204878 (ZOSTER-064) Protocol Administrative Change 3 Final 70882527ffe6806e42bab9a20b06541da11028ce24 11-FEB-2019"
23,page_23,"CONFIDENTIA L 204878 (ZOSTER- 064) Protocol Administrative Change 3 Final 11-FEB -2019 25All suspected HZ cases were referred to the HZ Adjudication Committee (HZAC). The HZAC classified all r eferred cases as either “HZ”, “not HZ” , or “not able to decide” . However, the HZAC classification was to serve as the final case definition only when the case could not be confirmed or excluded by PCR, e.g., when all samples from a given subject were inadequate (as when both VZV and β -actin PCR results were negative), or when no samples were available for a given subject. If the case could not be confirmed or excluded by PCR and the HZAC final outcome was ‘not able to decide’, the overall final outcome was “No possible classification”; for analysis the categories “not HZ” and “No possible classification” were considered as “not HZ”. 6. STUDY POPULA TION 6.1. Number of subjects/ centres Approximately 30,000 subjects enrolled in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022 There will be no new subjects enrolled in the ZOSTER- 064 study . The protocol is developed to allow for the encoding into the eCRF of allQoL questionnaires of subjects enrolled in ZOS TER -006 and ZOSTER -022 and analy sing frailty status. 6.2. Inclusion criteria for the study Deviations from inclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardise the scientific integrit y of the study . Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specifi ed in the protocol is essential. All subjects must satisfy ALL the following criteria at study entry : Allsubjects enrolled in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER - 022(See Section 7.2and 8.3.1) 6.2.1. Inclusion criteria for the study data encoding Allsubjects enrolled in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER - 022(See Section 7.2and 8.3.1 ) Subjects who died or w ere lost to follow -up during ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022 will be considered for enrolment in ZOSTER- 064 and their data/questionnaires up to that point will be used.

Exclusion criteria for the study Deviations from exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentia lly jeopardise the scientific integrit y of the study. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry . If the exclusion criterion applies, the subject must not be included in the study : Subjects who were excluded from all analyses from ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER - 022. This will include any subject eliminated following deviations from GCP compliance. 6.3.1. Exclusion criteria for data encoding Subjects who developed asuspected HZcase during ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER - 022 (since their QoL questionnaires were encoded in the eCRF for ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022). 7. CONDUCT OF THE STUDY 7.1. Regulatory and ethical considerations The study will be conducted in accordance with the I CH G uideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), all applicable subject privacy requirements and the guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Conduct of the study includes, but is not limited to, the following: Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independ ent Ethics Committee (I EC) review and favourable opinion/approval of study protocol and any subsequent amendments. Investigator reporting requirements as stated in the protocol. GSK Biologicals will provide full details of the above procedures to the inve stigator, either verbally , in writing, or both. 7.2. Informed consent ZOSTER -064 is a study related to ZOSTER- 006 and ZOSTER -022 that allows for encoding and anal ysis of questionnaires already completed by the subjects who were part of those earlier studies. Not all of the previousl y completed questionnaires have been encoded and analysed yet. As such, ZOSTER -064 will provide anopportunity to ass ess the frailt y index of all subjects enrolled in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022. Every subject considered for inclusion in this study has previousl y signed an I CF from the investigational sites of ZOSTER- 006 or ZOSTER -022. The ICF signed by the patients in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022 allows for the use of all collected information in new studies.

According to Protocol cohort for analy sis of immunogenicity The anal ysis of the immunogenicity data from the ZOSTER -064 (i.e. combined immunogenicit y data from ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022) will be performed on the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicit y In ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022, the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects from the ATP cohort for anal ysis of safet y (i.e., those meeting all eligibility criteria, compl ying with the procedures and intervals allowed for the anal ysis, with no elimination criteria during the study ) for whom data concerning immunogenicit y endpoint measures were available. For the immunogenicit y tables where different timepoint swere presented, the concept of “Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity ” was used to denote that for each timepoint , the corresponding ATP cohort for immunogenicity was used. More specificall y, The anal yses on the timepoint sMonth 0 and Month 3 were based on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity Month 3; The anal ysis on the timepoint Month 14 was based on the ATP cohort for immunogenicit y Month 14; The anal ysis on the timepoint Month 26 was based on the ATP cohort for immunogenicit y Month 26; The anal ysis on the timepoint Month 38 was based on the ATP cohort for immunogenicit y Month 38; The goal was to include all evaluable subjects in the statistical anal ysis at a specific timepoint , i.e., by including all the subjects not impacted b y the elimination code for a specific Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity . For the criterion impacted only a specified timepoint (specified blood sampling interval), the subject was excluded from the anal ysis at that timepoint . For the criteria impacting a specified timepoint and the subsequent ones (e.g., medication forbidden b y the protocol), the subject was excluded from the anal yses performed at that timepoint onwards. For the criteria impacting all timepoint s (e.g., not received two doses), the subject was ex cluded from the anal yses at all-timepoint s. For the anal ysis of humoral immunogenicit y, ATP cohort was further defined as A TP cohort for immunogenicity – Humoral.

EQ-5Dquestionnaire The EQ-5Dquestionnaire is a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value [ Kind, 1996]. The EQ -5Ddefines health in terms of mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression. The 5 items are combined to generate health profiles, i.e. a respondent who responds 1 (no problem \no s ymptom) to all 5 items has a profile “11111” and similarly a subject who responds with the highest level of difficult y or s ymptom to all items has a profile “33333”. These profiles are subsequently converted to a continuous single index utility score using a one to one matching, e.g. “11111”=1.00, “22222”=0.52 and “33333”= - 0.59, using value sets (i.e. matching profiles to single index utility scores). As suggested by the developers, for international studies, the United King dom Time -Trade -Off (TTO) value set is to be used for the main anal ysis. Note: highe r scores represent a better QoL. SeeAPPENDIX Bfor a sample of EQ-5Dquestionnaire. 10.7.4.

The coded medical history database will be searched and subjects with the relevant preferred terms will be assigned to 1 or more of the abo ve categories. A frailty index will be defined by combining all 41 items into a score from 0 to 1 whereb y: frailty index = (accumulation of deficits) / (number of items). Each subject will then be assigned to one of three categories, Non -Frail, Pre -Frail a nd Frail. If the frailty index is less than or equal to 0.08 then the subject is classified as Non -Frail. If the score is greater than 0.08 but less than or equal to 0.25 then the subject is classified as pre -frail. If the score is greater than 0.25 then the subject is classified as Frail. Further details of the calculation of the frailt y index will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 10.7.5. HZ burden -of-illness score For each confirmed case of HZ in ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022, responses to the “worst pain” question in the ZBPI were used to calculate a “HZ burden -of-illness” score, defined as the area under the curve (AUC) of HZ -associated pain plotted against time during the 182 -day period after the onset of the case. Subjects who developed HZ presented “burden -of-illness” scores ranging from 0 up to, theoreticall y, 1820.

Predictive factors for individuals developing HZ Only subjects in the placebo vaccination group will be included in the analysis of potential predictive factors. A Cox proportional hazards regression model allowing for time-dependent covariates will be fitted to identify which factors are predictive of developing HZ. The model will include time to HZ as the outcome variable and as potential predictors: demographic and clinical characteristics, SF-36 variables and EQ -5D variables. Subjects who did not develop HZ will be censored at the time of their last study visit. The proportional hazards regression model wi ll be used for both minimally adjusted anal yses and multivariate anal yses. All factors will initially be examined in an age-and sex -adjusted model with stratification for the clinical trial (i.e. ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER -022). Factors will be included in the multivariate model if they are associated (P < 0.05 using a two -sided test) with HZ in the minimally adjusted model. The multivariate model will also include age and gender with stratification for the clinical trial (i.e. ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022). A ste p-down (backward) variable selection procedure will be used to fit the final multivariate model. This model will be fitted using the PHREG procedure of the SAS/STAT package. Spearman correlations coefficients will be presented to display the relationships between pairs of variables. In addition, particularl y for the quality of life variables, the variance inflation factor and the condition indices for testing multicollinearit y will be estimated. In the anal ysis, the impact of excluding “suspected but not c onfirmed cases” of HZ will be explored. Three anal yses will be performed whereb y it will be assumed that “suspected but not confirmed cases” are (1) “Not in at risk group” (2) “In at risk group” and event=0, (3) “In at risk group” and event=1.

Subjects who developed a confirmed HZ during the interval between two timepoint s will be considered HZ+ at the later timepoint .
