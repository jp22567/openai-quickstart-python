1,page_1,"2 Strength s and limitations of this study  This is the first study of effectiveness and implementation of a best practice model of care in LBP primary ca re in Sweden .  An international consensus framework has been used for the development, implementation an d evaluation of the models of care .  The main trial’s a priori methodology has been informed and refined by an initial internal pilot phase. BACKGROUND Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most prevalent and burdensome problems for individuals and society in Sweden and worldwide [1,2]. LBP is often defined in terms of its localization, duration, severity, frequency, and interference on activities of daily livi ng [3]. Most new episodes of LBP are self-limiting with only approximately 20% having persistent symptoms but a large majority experience pain recurrence [1]. The aetiology of LBP is often classified as specific or non -specific, based upon if a pathoanatom ical cause can be identified through objective diagnostic assessment and confirmed by medical imaging [4]. The prevalence of LBP caused by specific pathology of serious nature such as malignancy, spinal fracture, infection, or cauda equine syndrome requiri ng secondary or tertiary health care has been reported to range between < 1% -4% in the primary health care setting [5,6]. Furthermore, nerve root problems associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis are thought to explain approximately 5% -15% of cases [7,8]. Medical imaging studies have highlighted that approximately 50% of younger adults and 90% of older adults have degenerative findings and large variations in lumbar spine morphology [9]. This is however evident in both symptomatic and asymptomatic i ndividuals suggesting that low back pain is more typically a result of benign dysfunctional biological and psychological functions as well as social contextual factors influencing the pain experience. In Sweden, the health care process for patients with L BP tends to be fragmented with many health care practitioners (HCP) giving conflicting information and providing intervention s of varying effectiveness [10,11]. Our studies have shown that only a third of patients on sick leave for musculoskeletal disorder s receive evidence -based rehabilitation interventions in primary care [10,11]. Furthermore our research has also demonstrated that there are still interventions that physiotherapists in primary care consider to be relevant in clinical practice despite the absence of evidence or consensus about the effects [12]. Our preliminary data suggests that when patients with LBP are referred to a specialist clinics , up to 48% have not received adequate evidence -based rehabilitation in primary care. The development of clinical practice guidelines aim s to provide HCP with recommendations based on strength of available evidence as well as professional consensus for the intervention’s risk and benefits for the patients. Such guidelines are lacking in Sweden but have recent ly been developed by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority and the English National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [13-15]. These national guidelines provide a thorough assessment of current evidence and can be used in Sweden to form the basi s for locally adapted recommendations that are feasible to integrate in local health care setting. Common to LBP, central recommendations from evidence based clinical guidelines for arthritis are also education and exercise therapy aimed at improving pat ient self -care. These principles have been packaged in well -known models of care describing how complex patient interventions can be delivered by clinicians. These model of care include “Better Management of Patients with Osteoarthritis (BOA)” in Sweden [16] and “Good Life with Osteoarthritis” in Denmark (GLA:D) [17]. Annual reports from BOA and GLA:D indicate an HCP acceptance through a broad national use of the models of care [18,19]. Furthermore, improvements in patient reported pain, physical function a nd decreased use of pain medication after receiving these models of care have been reported [18,19]. There is currently a pa ucity of evidence to determine if and how a similar best practice model of care for LBP could improve therapist and patient rated ou tcomes in the primary"
2,page_2,"3 treatment and secondary prevention of LBP. Recently an international cons ensus has been reached proposing a framework for the development, implementation and evaluation of m usculoskeletal models of care [20 ]. The theoretical underpi nning is important in developing a model of care aimed at behavioural change to understand and explain the mechanisms of change [20]. Social -cognitve theories are widely used to predict and explain behaviour change. For example, the Theory of Planned Behav iour (TPB) [21] can be utilised to explain how intentions and volition of behaviour such as HCP use of a model of care can potentially be influenced by an intervention aiming to strengthen associations with attitudes, social norms and perceived behavioural control concerning the model. Furthermore, the Common Sense Model of self -regulation (CSM) [22] can been utilised to explain how behavioural change such as improved patient reported pain, physical function , self-care enablement and quality of life can potentially be influenced by an intervention aiming to strengthen associations with improved patient cognitive and emotional illness representations and comprehensibility through coping procedures [22]. It is important to apply knowledge from implementation science to achieve effective implementation of a best practice model of ca re in primary health care [23-26]. Implementation science is the scientific study of uptake of research findings and evidence -based practices into routine practice to improve the qu ality and effectiveness of health care and services [27] . Implemetation strategies focus on determinants minimising barriers and maximising enablers that impact on the implementation and use of evidence -based practices. Recent implementation science studie s inve stigating the uptake of national clinical guidelines for LBP in Denmark and the Neth erlands have found multifaceted strategies to facilitate HCP behaviour change to be more cost - effective than single -faceted strategies [28,29 ]. There is therefore a clear rationale for evaluating the extent to which and how a best practice primary health care model for low back pain (BetterBack ) implemented with a multi -facetted strategy is potentially effective in the Swedish context . This article describes the BetterBack trial internal pilot and protocol for the main trial. The protocol conforms to the SPIRIT guidelines [ 30]. AIMS The overall aim is to investigate the effectiveness of the BetterBack  model of care for LBP implemented with a multi -facetted strateg y in a Swedish primary health care context . The specific trial objectives are to: (A) To improve and understand the mechanisms underlying changes in HCP confidence, at titudes and beliefs for providing primary health care for patients with LBP (B) Improve and understand the mechanisms underlying illness beliefs , self-care enablement , pain, disability and quality of life in patients with LBP; (C) Evaluate the implementation process and cost-effectiveness of the BetterBack  model of care for LBP in the Swedish primary health care context . HYPOTHESIS 1. HCP reported confidence, attitudes and beliefs for providing primary health care for LBP will show statistic ally significant improvement after a multifaceted implementation of the BetterBack  model of care compared to baseline before implementation . Intentional and volitional HCP rated determinants of implementation behaviour regarding the BetterBack  model of care will mediate improved confidence, attitudes and beliefs in a causal effects model . 2. The multifaceted implementation of the BetterBack  model of care will result in more statistically significant and greater clinically important improvem ent compared to current routine care for LBP regarding patient -reported measures for illness beliefs, self-care enablemen t, pain, disability and quality of life . Improvements in i llness beliefs will mediate"
3,page_3,"4 the effect on these outcomes. 3. A multifaceted implementation of the BetterBack  model of care compared to current routine care will result in fewer patients with persistin g LBP, fewer requiring specialist care and more statistically significant incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on cost per EuroQoL -5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ -5D) quality -adjusted life years (QALY) gained. METHODS Study design World Health Organization Trial Registration Data Set is presented in table 1. This study is an effectiveness -implementation hybrid type 2 trial [31]. This involves a prospective cohort study design investigating implementation on the HCP level and a patient blinded, pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial with longitudinal follow up at 3, 6 and 12 months post baseline for effectiveness on the patient level . A superiority trial design framework will be used. A parallel process and economic analysis will also be pe rform ed. This design was chosen because the multifaceted implementation of the BetterBack  model of care will be first targeted at changing HCP level behaviour who will then in turn implement behavio ral change strategies on a patient level . Randomisation at the patient level is not possible d ue to potential carry -over effects of the HCP transitioning back and forth between providing routine care or the BetterBack  model of care for different patients . Instead, p atients will be allocat ed to routine care (con trol group) or the BetterBack  model of care (intervention group) depending upon the clinics allocation . Patients will remain in their allocated group throughout the study. The main study design is a dog leg with 2 assessments in routine care [32,33 ]. Thi s involves the first cluster being assess ed after the implementation of the BetterBack  model of care . The second cluster is assessed after a period of current routine care (control) , and assessed again after the implementation of the BetterBack  model of care. The third cluster will receive current routine care (control) throughout the trial. The initial implementation of the BetterBack  model of care in cluster 1 allows for an internal pilot to determine the HCP acceptability of the intervention and trial within the first cluster [34,35]. A progression criteria for continuing to t he main trial requires that HCP who have completed the BetterBack  education workshop rate on average a maximum of 2.5 out of 5 on the following determinant of implementation beha viour question: I expect that the application of BetterBack  model of care will be useful (1 = agree completely - 5 = do not agree at all). The internal p ilot also monitors patient recruitment during the first 2 months to provide a check point to optimize the main study design while data generated will still contribute to the final analyses to maintain trial efficiency [34,35] . Clusters are expected to recruit and gather data for at least 20 LBP patients per month in the internal pilot. In the dogleg desig n it is possible to vary the time point of cluster 2 to cross forward from the control to intervention condition if the patient recruitment process in either cluster 1 or 3 is more or less than expected in the internal pilot. In th e event that cluster 1 re cruit less than expect ed and clusters 2 or 3 recruit more tha n expected, then cluster 2 will cross forward to the intervention condition immediately after the intern al pilot. If cluster 1 recruit more than expec ted and cluster 2 or 3 recruit less than expe cted during the internal pilot phase, then cluster 2 will cross forward to the intervention condition later in the main trial to allow adequate current routine care data collection. Implementation of the BetterBack  model of care in cluster 3 will occur di rectly after the end of patient recruitment in cluster 3. The study design is outlined in table 2. Study setting The Östergötland public health care region has a total population of 453 596 inhabitants with approximately 5000 patients per year accessing primary care physiotherapy due to LBP . In the"
4,page_4,"5 public health care region of Östergötland, a large majority of consultations for LBP are via direct access to the 15 primary care physiotherapy rehabilitation clinic s. A smaller percentage of consultations are via referral to these rehabilitation clinics from the 36 primary health care general practice s in the region . Therefore the focus of this study is on the physiotherapeutic rehabilitation process for LBP in primary care . The rehabilitation clinics form three clusters in Östergötland health care r egion. These clusters are based on municipal geographical area and organisational structure of the rehabilitation clinics which helps to minimize contamination between separate clusters of clinics (Figure 1 ). Cluste r west i s comprised of 5 clinics with 27 physiotherapists, c luster central is comprised of 6 clinics with 4 4 physiotherapists an d cluster east i s comprised of 6 clinics with 41 physiotherapists. Eligibility criteria Registered physiotherapists practicing in the allocated clinics and regularly working with patients with LBP will be included in the study. These physiotherapists will assess the eligibility of consecutive patients before and after the implementation of the BetterBack  model of care based on th e following criteria: Inclusion criteria: Males and females 18 -65 years; Fluent in Swedish; Accessing public primary care due to a current episode of a first -time or recurrent debut of benign low back pain with or without radiculopathy. Exclusion criteri a: Current diagnosis of malignancy, spinal fracture, infection, cauda equine syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis or systemic rheumatic disease, previous malignancy during the past 5 years; Spinal surgery during the last 2 years; Current pregnancy or previous pregnancy up to 3 months before consideration of inclusion; Patients that fulfil criteria for multimodal/multi - professional rehabilitation for complex longstanding pain; Severe psychiatric diagnosis. A signed patient consent form will be collected by the physiotherapist before baseline measures are collected and intervention is commenced according to the study protocol. The therapist’s intervention will not be effected by the patient’s decision to participate or not participate in the study, only data coll ected will not be performed for those not participating. Intervention s Control condition – current routine physiotherapeutic care for LBP in primary health care Patients attending rehabilitation clinic cl usters that have not have not yet completed the implementation of the BetterBack  model of care will receive treatment as usual according to current routine care clinical pathways (Figure 2). A clinical pathway specified in Östergötland public health care region requires that for patients accessing primar y care due to LBP, a triage is to be performed by licensed HCPs (Physiotherapists, Nurses or General Practitioners (GP) ), to triage for specific pathology of serious nature. These approximately 1 -4% of patients with suspected specific pathology of serious nature are then to be examined by GPs and referred for specific intervention in seconda ry or tertiary health care. The majority of patients with L BP who on initial triage are assessed as having benign first -time or recurrent debut of LBP are then scheduled for physiotherapy consultation and implementation of a LBP management plan. If the patient has persistent functional impairment and activity limitation despite 2 -3 months of primary care intervention, the clinical pathway specifies inclusion criteria for specialist care referral pathways (Figure 2). Intervention condition – The BetterBack  model of care for LBP Development and design of the BetterBack  model of care for LBP A framework for the development of musculoskeletal models of care [20 ] was used to guide"
5,page_5,"6 develop ment of the BetterBack  model of care for LBP . The high prevalence and burden of LBP [1,2] , discordance in evidence based rehabilitation processes [10 -12], a lack of physiotherapeutic clinical practice guidelines and a user -pull for a best pr actice model of care requested by physiotherapy clinic managers in the Östergötland health care region have been identified in the primary care of LBP . Therefore , a case for change has been justified to improve current physiotherapeutic health service deli very for the primary care of LBP . The structure and components of BetterBack  where developed by engaging a work group of physiotherapy clinicians (clinical champions) from each primary care cluster in the Östergötland public health care region and physiot herapy academics at Linköping University. To identify which key areas of contemporary care were of relevance for BetterBack , the following tasks were performed by the work group: 1) Discussion and outline of the current routine care clinical pathway for LBP and areas needing improvement: The work group concluded that a best practice model of care needed to focus on the primary care physiotherapy process outlined by the red square in figure 2. 2) Analysis and discussion of existing international evidence based guidelines : The following thorough and up -to-date systematic critical literature reviews and intern ational clinical guidelines [13-15, 36 ] were analysed and discussed by the work group. 3) Adaptation of evidence based recomme ndations to the Swedis h context: The development of evidence based recommendations was based the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare methods for guideli ne construction [37]. The overall grade of evidence together with a consensus position based on professional experien ce and patient net benefit versus harms and costs are the key aspects on which the work group has formulated local recommendatio ns to reflect their strength [38]. The recommendations have been externally reviewed by local spinal physicians and internationa l experts from the University of Southern Denmar k. A summary of the Östergötland health care region physiotherapeutic clinical practice guideline recommendations for primary care management of LBP with or without radiculopathy as well as the implementation tools used in the BetterBack  model of care is provided in the supplementary material to this protocol article. 4) Considering potential barriers to the uptake of ev idence based recommendations by health care professionals [39] and patient adherence to LBP management interventions [40], the work group ident ified and discussed targeted physiotherapist and patient behaviour change priorities of relevance for BetterBack . The Behaviour Change Wheel [41 ] (figure 3) was used to describe how the BetterBack  model of care at the guideline policy level applies theory -informed HCP and patient focused intervention functions with specific behavioural change techniques [42]. To help understand the mechanism of action of behavioural change interventions , the Theoret ical Domains Fram ework (TDF) [43 ] has been integrated into the Behavioural Change Wheel [41 ]. The TDF is comprised of 14 theoretical domains/determinants of behavioural change which can be matched with behavioural change technique s to understand their effect on th e central source of behaviour [44]. The central source of behaviour in the behavioural change wheel is described by the COM -B model. In the COM -B model, a person’s capability (physical and psychological), opportunity (social and physical) can influen ce on motivation (automatic and reflective) enacting behaviours that can then alter capability , motivation and opportunity [41 ]. The COM -B provides a broad model of behaviour where our causal assumptions of the BetterBack  model of care which are adapted f rom the TPB on a HCP level [21] and also adapted from the CSM on a patient level [22] can be applied in the Behavioural Change Wheel [41]. The first step in the BetterBack  model of care is to target HCP behaviour for the adoption of the BetterBack  mode l of care . Impeding barrier behaviours requiring change include low awareness of the model, be liefs of negative consequences, a biomedical treatment orientation rather than a"
6,page_6,"7 biopsychosocial orientation and primarily low beliefs about skills/capabilities f or improving self - care patient management . Once HCP behaviour change has occurred, this can influence behaviour change on a patient level targeting patient understanding of the mechanisms and natural course of benign LBP and patient enablement of self -care. Impeding barrier behaviours requiring change include maladaptive beliefs on the cause and persistent course of LBP (low outcome expectation, anxiety , catastrophizing, fear -avoidance, and negative illness beliefs), contextual factors, low self- care enable ment and low baseline physical activity . The potential outcomes of behavioural change could be improved illness beliefs, self-care enablement, pain, function, quality of life and health care utilization. T he specific BetterBack  intervention content and me chanism of action for HCP behavioural change is outlined in table 3. A flow -diagram describing the BetterBack  model of care patient intervention process is displayed in figure 4 . Multifaceted implementation strategy for the BetterBack  model of care The multifaceted implementation strategy is composed of the following 3 main facets: 1) Forming an implementation forum including head of departments/managers of the rehabilitation units and the clinical researchers.  The implementation forum will collaborate on deciding overarching goals, timeline and logistics facilitating the implementation of the BetterBack  model of care in primary care rehabilitation clinic clusters in the Östergötland public health care region. 2) Forming a support team comprised of exp erience clinicians as local supervisors and faculty researchers as knowledge facilitators.  The support team is composed by trusted clinicians with special skills in LBP treatment from each participating unit and have had involvement in the work group for local adaptation of the BetterBack  model of care in their health care region. 3) Forming a package of education and training that the support team can utilize to assist the use of the BetterBack  model of care by HCP .  Physiotherapists in the 3 geographic al clusters of public primary care rehabilitation clinics in Östergötland will be offered to participate in a 13.5 hours (2 days), continued medical education (CME) workshop. The workshop is designed by the support team with at least 2 clinical researcher and 1 experienced clinician (clinical champion) from the rehabilitation unit cluster present in the support team’s delivery of the workshop for each cluster. The HCP education provided in the workshop format is described in supplementary file 2.  Key compon ents of the educational program are:  Education about evidence based recommendations for LBP care and the BetterBack  model of care through an experiential learning process applying problem based case studies and clinical reasoning tools.  Practical use of t he standardized BetterBack  education and exercise programs aiming at self -care as well as function and activity restoration.  Access to a website describing the BetterBack  model of care. A chat forum will give an opportunity for clinicians to ask question s and share different experiences of the new strategy managed by the support team. Researchers will respond to questions from the participating clinicians.  To consolidate education at the local clinics, the local support team member (clinical champion) will provide continued maintenance of education according to the BetterBack  model. Outcomes HCP outcomes: 1. Primary outcome measure"
7,page_7,"8  Practitioner Confidence Scale (PCS) [45] mean change from baseline to 3 months post baseline. Practitioner reported confiden ce is the primary HCP behavioural change goal for the HCP education and training workshop in the multifaceted implementation of the BetterBack  model of care . The 3 month time frame allows for the development and consolidation of HCP behavioural change aft er application in repeated patient cases. 2. Secondary outcome measures  PCS [45 ] mean immediate change from baseline to directly after the HCP education and training workshop as well as mean long term change from baseline to 12 months post baseline. This s econdary outcome is important for the understanding of longitudinal HCP behavioural change.  Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for p hysical therapists (PABS -PT) [4 6] mean change from baseline, to directly after the HCP education and training workshop as well as at 3 and 12 months post baseline. Patient outcomes : 1. Primary outcome measure  Numeric rating scale for lower back related pain intensity during the latest week (NRS -LBP) [47]. The mean difference between control and intervention groups in c hange betw een baseline and 3 months post baseline will be analysed . Pain intensity is the primary functional impairment that patients with LBP contact primary health care for and has been recommended by international consensus to be included as a core outcome domain for clinical trials i n non-specific low back pain [48 ]. International consensus even recommends patient reported NRS change over 6 months as a core metric for pain management interventions [49].  Oswestry disability index version 2.1 (ODI) [50]. The mean d ifference between control and intervention groups in c hange between base line and 6 months post baseline will be analysed . Disability, analogues to decreased physical functioning and activity limitation has been recommend ed by international consensus to be i ncluded as a core outcome domain for clinical trials i n non -specific low back pain [48 ]. International consensus even recommends patient reported ODI change over 6 months as a core metric for functional restoration [49]. 2. Secondary outcome measures  NRS-LBP [47] and ODI [50 ] mean difference between control an d intervention groups in short -term change from baseline to 3 months post baseline and mean long-term change from baseline to 12 months post baseline . These secondary outcomes are important for the understanding of longitudinal patient -rated changes in pain intensity and disability after primary care intervention .  The European Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ -5D) [51]. The mean difference between control and intervention groups in change between baseli ne and 3, 6 and 12 months post baseline will be analysed. Health related quality of life has been recommended by international consensus to be included as a core outcome domain for clinical trials i n non - specific low back pain [48 ]. International consensus even recommends patient reported EQ - 5D change over 6 months as a core metric for p ain management interventions [49 ].  The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) [52]. The mean difference between control and intervention groups in change between base line and 3, 6 and 12 months post baseline will be analysed. Illness perception has been shown to predict longitudinal pain and disability out comes in several LBP studies [53 -57].  Patient Enablement Index (PEI) [58], Patient Global Rating of C hange (PGIC) [59] and Patient S atisfaction (PS) [60 ] mean difference between control and intervention group s at 3, 6 and 12 months post baseline will be analysed. Health care process outcomes : 1. Primary outcome measure  Proportion al difference between control and inte rvention groups for incidence of"
8,page_8,"9 participating patients receiving specialist care for LBP between baseline and 12 months after baseline. Incidence proportion, analogous to cumulative incidence or r isk is calculated by taking the number of patients receivin g specialist care of LBP and dividing it by the total number of patients recruited to the study. T he main goal of both the control and interventions conditions in primary care for benign first -time or recurrent debut of LBP is to improve patient reported o utcomes without the need of secondary or te rtiary health care processes . 2) Secondary outcomes measures  Mean difference between control and intervention groups f or change between baseline and final clinical visit regarding g rade of patient functional impai rment and activity limitation according to the ICF brief core set for LBP [61].  The proportion of patients who receive the BetterBack  model of care . Participant timeline The trial timeline is show n in table 2 . The intervention schedule started with t he development of evidence based recommendation s and the BetterBack  model of care which occurred during June 2016 - February 2017. The enrolment schedule started with cluster enrolment and randomisation in March 2017. This resulted in the first allocated clu ster 1 (west) entering internal pilot of implementing the BetterBack  model of care HCP education and training workshop which occurred in March 2017. This was followed up with a 2 month internal pilot of p atient enrolment schedule occurring in all 3 cluste rs during April -May 2017. In order to finalise a sample size calculation for the main trial, baseline data collected du ring the internal pilot is compared to follow - up data 3 months after baseline for the primary outcome measure questionnaires to analyse i nitial HCP and patient effects of the implementation of BetterBack  model of care in cluster 1 compared to the control condition s in clusters 2 & 3 . In the transition to the main trial, patient enrolment and baseline assessme nts will then continue to occur until January 2018 . The eventual time of crossing forward of cluster 2 into the implementation of the BetterBack  model of care is determined by the internal pilot trial results . Participants in the trial will be follow -up longitudinally at 3, 6 and 12 months after baseline measures. The schedule for assessments is also outlined in table 2. Sample size An initial sample size estimation in the plann ing stage of the study assumed at least a small Cohens d effect size (d=0.3 5) for the HCP behavioural change primary and secondary outcome s. This is based on previous literature showing sm all-moderate HCP behavioural change effects sizes using similar intervention s to increase the uptake of evidence -based management of LBP in primary c are [62-63]. Considering als o a 1 -tailed p = 0.05 for the benefit of the multifaceted implementation of BetterBack , 80% statistical power and a 20 % loss to follow -up, a sample size of n = 63 HCP is needed for a matched pairs t-test statistics comparing baseline and follow -up means . We assume a possible carry -over of a similar effect size (d=0.35) on patient behavioural change primary and secondary outcomes. Considering also a 1 -tailed p = 0.05 for the benefit of the multifaceted implementation of BetterBack  compared to usual care and a 80% statistical power, the number of patients required for an individually randomized simple parallel group design would be n = 204. Adjusting for the design effect due to clustering randomizing, an intracl uster correlation of 0.01 and a cluster autoco rrelation of 0.80, a dog leg design with 2 assessments in routine care and 100 patient s in each cluster section would require at least n = 402 patients over 2.41 clusters according to algorithms des cribed by Hooper & Bourke [32 ]. In a balanced recruitment schedule, this equates to 14 patient per months per cluster for a total of 3 clusters . Allowing for potential unbalanced recruitment flow and a potential drop -out in the longitudinal outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months post baseline, each cluster will aim for up to 20 patients per month equating to a potential total study n = 600. Recruitment"
9,page_9,"10 In an effort to curb recruitment difficulties, strategies to promote adequate enrolment of participants into the study will be used. We anticipate less problems with rec ruitment into the prospective cohort study design investigating the multifaceted implementation of the BetterBack  model of care on the HCP level . This is due to the study having a user -pull endorsed by clinical department managers calling all HCP working with patients with LBP at their clinics to participate . However, recruitment of patients into the cluster randomized controlled trial is dependent upon the feasibility of recruitment processes adapted to the context of each individual clinic and the compli ance of HCP to administer recruitment of consecutive patients . A strategy to optimis e the administration of patient recruitment will involve the author KS regul arly visiting participating clinics to inform HCP of the study protocol and help streamline prac tical administration of the protocol in the context of the individual clinics. KS will also monitor w eekly recruitment rates from the clinics and provide motivati onal feedback on recruitment flow to clinical department managers and designated clinical champions who will provide additional motivation al feedback to HCP. In accordance with a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials , a flow diagr am displaying participant enrolment, allocation, follow -up and analysis will be constructed [64]. Reasons for excl usion, declined participation, protocol violations and los s to follow -up will be monitored by KS. Allocation and blinding Random concealed allocation of clusters was performed by a blinded researcher randomly selecting from 3 sequentially numbered, opaqu e, sealed envelopes. The method resulted in the following order: 1=cluster west, 2=cluster central and 3=cluster east . The author KS informed the clinics in the different clusters of their allocation to the control or intervention study condition. Due to t he nature of the study and intervention, HCP conducting patient meas urements and treatment cannot be blinded to group allocation. Risk of bias is minimal as the primary and secondary outcomes are patient self -reported questionnaires. Patients will be blind ed to group allocation. The researcher responsible for statistical analysis will not be blinded to group allocation. Data collection HCP reported professional behaviour questionnaires :  The PCS contains 4 items reported on 5-point Likert scale s where a tot al score of 4 represents greatest self -confidence and 20 represents lowest self -confidence for managing patients with LBP. The structural validity in terms of internal consistency of the items have been shown to be good with a Cronbach α coefficient = 0.73 in a single factor model for self-confidence [45]. The questionnaire has been forward translated by our research group from English to Swedish.  The PABS -PT consists of two factors where higher scores represent more treatment orientation regarding that fa ctor. O ne factor with 10 items measures the biomedical treatment orientation (Score 0 -60) and one with 9 items measures the biopsychosocial treatment orientation (Score 0 -54) [45]. Each item is rated on a 6 -point Likert scale ranging from 1=‘totally disagr ee’ to 6=‘totally agree’. The internal consistency of the biomedical factor has been shown to be good with a range between Cronbach α=0.77 -0.84. Futhermore, the biopsychosocial factor has been shown to be adequate with a range between Cronbach α=0.62 -0.68 [65]. Construct validity and responsiveness to educational interventions has been shown to be positive along with the test -retest reliability with reported intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) on the biomedical factor=0.81 and on the biopsychosocial factor=0.65 [65]. The questionnaire has been forward t ranslated from English to Swedish in a previously published study [66 ].  The Determinants of I mplementation Behaviour Questionnaire (DIBQ) was originally constructed based on the domains of the TDF [43, 6 7]. Confirmatory factor analysis resulted in a modified 93 item questionnaire assessing 18 domains with sufficient discriminant validity . Internal consistency of the items for the 18 domains was good, ranging from 0.68 - 0.93 for the Cronbach α coefficient [68]. The questionnaire has been forward translated by"
10,page_10,"11 our research group from English to Swedish. After face validity consensus in our research group regarding relevant domains for the implementation of BetterBack  model of care , the questionnaire was shor tened to the following domains: Knowledge, Skills, Beliefs about capabilities, Beliefs about consequences, Intentions, Innovation, Organisation, Patient, Social influence, Behavioural regulation totalling to 57 items . Questions were adapted to the context of HCP reported determinants of an “expected” implementation of BetterBack  model of care for measurement directly after the HCP education and training workshop. HCP reported determinants retained orginal wording for the question naires at 3 and 12 months a fter the implementation of BetterBack  model of care. The response scale used for each DIBQ question in our study is a 5 -point Liket scale ranging from 1= `totally agree´ to 5=`totally disagree´. Patient reported outcome measures:  NRS -LBP intensity during the latest week is an 11 -point scale consisting of integers from 0 through 10; 0 representing ‘‘No pain’’ and 10 representing ‘‘Worst imaginable pain’’. Previous research in a LBP cohort has shown a test-retest reliability ICC = 0.61, a common standard dev iation=1 .64 points, the standard error of measure = 1.02 and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in LBP after trea tment =2 [69,70 ].  ODI version 2.1 assesses patient’s current LBP related limitation in performing activities such as personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life and travelling. The ODI consists of 10 items with response scales from 0 to 5, where higher values represent greater disability. The ODI is analysed as a 0 to100 percentage variable wher e lower scores represent lower levels of low back pain disability. A reduction of 10 points is considered the MCID in LBP after treatment [ 50,70 ]. In Scandinavian conditions, the coefficient of variation, ICC and i nternal consistency of the ODI is 12%, 0.8 8-0.91 and 0.94 respectively [71-73]. Good concurrent validity has also been shown [72].  The EQ -5D measures generic health -related quality of life and is computed into a 0 to 1.00 scale from worst to best possible health state b y using the Swedish value se ts [74]. A reduction of 0.0 8 points is considered the MCID in LBP after treatment [75 ]. Mean change after treatment for LBP has been reported to be 0.12 (SD±0.30) [76].  The BIPQ analyses cognitive illness representations (consequences, outcome expectancy, personal control, treatment control, and knowledge), emotional representations (concern and emotions) as well as illness comprehensibility. An overall score 0 -80 represents the degree to which the LBP is perceived as threatening or benign where a higher sc ore reflects a more threatening view of the illness [52 ]. The BIPQ has been shown to be valid and reliable in a Scandinavian sample of patients with subacute and chronic LBP. The BIPQ has a Cronbach’s alpha =0.72 and a t est-retest ICC = 0.86, an ICC range for individual items from 0.64 to 0.88, a standar d error of measurement (SEM) = 0.63 and minimal detectable change (MDC) = 1.75[77 ].  The PEI has a score range between 0 and 12 with a higher score intended to reflect higher patient self -care enablement [58 ].  PGIC asks the patient to rate the degree of change in LBP related problems from the beginning of treatment to the present. This is measured with a balanced 11 point numerical scale. A reduction of 2 points is considered the MCID in LBP after treatment [5 9].  PS is measured with a single item patient reported question. The question asks “Over the course of treatment for this episode of low back pain or leg pain, how satisfied were you with the care provided by your health -care provider?” Were you very satis fied (1), somewhat satisfied (2), neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (3), somewhat dissatisfied (4) , or very dissatisfied (5)?’’ [6 0]. Health care process measures:"
11,page_11,"12  At 12 months after baseline, data will also be extracted from the public health care regio nal registry for the total number of patient visits for LBP, the number patients needing primary care multimodal pain team treatment, the number referred to specialist pain clinic, orthopedic or neurosurgical care and the number receiving surgery.  Clinica l reasoning and process evaluation tool (CRPE -tool): Grade of patient functional impairment and activity limitation according to the ICF brief core set for LBP is assesses by the physiotherapist at baseline and final clinical contact where light, moderate, severe and very severe impairment/limitation is coded 0 -4 respectively. A total score for baseline and follow -up measures is calculated from the sum of the functional impairment divided by the number of functional impairments and a similar total score is calcula ted for activity limitations [61 ]. ICD -10 diagnosis codes and KVÅ codes for treatment interventions will also be recorded.  The Keele STarT Back Screening Tool is report ed by patients at baseline providing a stratification of prognostic risk of pers istent pain. The overall score ranging from 0 -9 is used to separate the low risk patients from the medium -risk subgroups where patients who achieve a score of 0 -3 are classified into the low -risk subgroup and those with scores of 4 -9 into the medium -risk s ubgroup. To identify the high -risk subgroup , the last 5 items must scoring 4 or 5 . The CRPE -tool data wi ll be analysed in terms of StarT back tool subgroups.  Qualitative SWOT analyses will be performed by HCP between 3 -6 months after implementation.  Semi -structured interviews investigating the patient experience of recieving care for LBP will be performed on 10 patients . These patients will have received care after implementation of the BetterBack  model of care . Data management All paper based questionnai re data will remain confidential and will be kept in a lockable filing cabinet in the research group office . A password -protected coded database only accessib le to the research team will be kept on a data storage drive in the research department . The resea rch team will regularly monitor the integrity of trial data. Trial conduct will be audited on a weekly basis by the research team. Statistical analysis Statist ical significance will be assessed with an alpha level of 0.05. All results will be reported as estimates of mean ± standard deviation and also effect size (e.g. mean difference) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). An intention -to-treat (ITT) principle applying multiple imputation will be applied . A sensitivity analysis will compare per protocol and ITT databases. A sensitivity analysi s will also be used to assess the significance of a washout period by comparing the complete database against the same database without data collected during the 2 week s in conjunction with the Betterback  implementa tion in each cluster Matched pairs t -test statistics comparing baseline and follow -up means will be used for the HCP reported primary and secondary outcomes. Causal mediation analysis will be used to analyse indirect mediational effects of multiple putati ve determinants of implementation behaviour measured with the DIBQ directly after the HCP education and training workshop (intention stage) or at 3 or 12 months (volition stage s) on the effect of baseline PCS or PABS -PT on 3 or 12 months foll ow-up measurem ent of PCS or PABS - PT. If the HCP education and training workshop does not have a casual effect on improved prospective outcomes we will analyse where the causal pathway breaks down. Causal mediation analysis will be performed using the program PROCESS [81 ] within IBM SPSS (figure 5) . Patient reported outcome measures for the control and intervention groups will be compared using multilevel analyses of repeated measurements and experiment condition as fixed effects and participants and clusters as random e ffects with IBM SPSS . Fixed effect interactions between experimental condition and The Keele STarT Back Screening Tool will also be assessed. Patient"
12,page_12,"13 population specific minimal clinically important difference will be assessed för primary and secondary out comes based on an anchor method where PGIC serve s as an anchor. Applying a 1-1-1 multilevel mediation procedure with all effects random in MPLUS , the products of (1) t he independent variable (Experimental condition: control or intervention ) to the mediato r (change in BIPQ ), and (2) the mediator to the d ependent variable (change in NRS, ODI or secondary outcome scores pre - to posttreatment) when the independent vari able is taken into account, will be tested for mediation (figure 6) . The EQ5D will be used to calculate the ratio of costs to quality adjusted life years (QALY) saved for patients. Incremental cost -effectiveness and cost -utility ratios for the multifaceted implementation strategy and the usual care condition will be calculated. This is based on the Swedish guideline priced direct costs of health service utilisation, costs of medications and overall intervention clinical outcome effectiveness and social security system utilisation (sickness benefits) as well as indirect productivity costs due to a bsenteeism and return to work. Data monitoring All outcom e questionnaires are formatted for use of scan processing software for automated data entry into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences package . The author K S who is not blinded to treatmen t allocation will perform regular data checks during data entry and provide feedback when necessary to HPC regarding data omissions. JS will also double check data entry to detect and correct input errors, and range checks will be undertaken prior to data analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethical clearance for the study (Dnr:2017 -35/31) has been attained through the Regional Ethics Committee in Linköping. Internal pilot trial results The initial implementation of the BetterBack  model of care in cluste r 1 allowed for an internal pilot to determine the HCP acceptability of the intervention and trial within the first cluster [34,35]. A progression criteria for continuing to the main trial required that HCP who have completed the BetterBack  education work shop rate on average a maximum of 2.5 out of 5 on the following determinant of implementation behaviour question: The 27 HCP participating in the internal pilot in cluster 1 responded to the question I expect that the application of BetterBack  model of ca re will be useful (1 = agree complet ely - 5 = do not agree at all). A mean value of 1.7 (SD 0.8) was recorded which subsequently fulfilled the HCP progression criteria. The resulting internal pilot patient flow for april and may were n=28, n=28 for cluste r 1 west, n=5, n=12 for cluster 2 central as well as n=14, n=22 for cluster 3 east consecutively. This informed the decision to move cluster 2 central transition from control to intervention condition to occur later in the schedule, planned for september 2 017. The flow of patient recruitment and the process of 3 month follow -up in the internal pilot w as used to inform the optimal time point of patient reported primary outcome for the main trial. Our initial planning was to measure patient reported primary outcome at 6 months post b aseline based on the definition of persistence/chronicity of symptoms being often defined in the literature to be of 3 and up to 6 months duration [82 ]. However our intern pilot study with a 3 month follow rate of 80% after up to 3 reminders sent to patients informed of a likely risk of non -response at later follow -up time points as patients . Feedback from participating HCP even reported a larger clinical interest in 3 month patient follow -up data. Therefore the internal pilot infor med the choice to revise our patient reported primary outcomes to 3 month post -baseline with subsequent amendments of the trial registration on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03147300 . Our internal pilot study was also used to assess baseline variation and cha nge over 3 months in HCP"
13,page_13,"14 evaluation and patient reported primary outcome measures in the control and intervention arms to aid calibration of the sample size calculat ion. A multilevel analyses of repeated measurements and experiment condition as fixed effec ts and participants and clusters as random effects revealed a intracluster correlation of < 0.01 for the all primary outcomes measures. Small effect sizes in favour of the intervention condition was shown for PCS ( d=0.33) and NRS ( d=0.28) primary outcome measures. Therefore, the internal pilot data supported our a priori sample size calculation for the main trial regarding PCS and NRS. However no effect size difference were observed between experimental conditions for ODI. It is possible that when statistica l power improves within the main trail, potential differences in ODI may be detectable between experimental conditions. References 1.

28,page_28,"29 Supplementary file 1 Östergötland health care region physiotherapeutic clinical practice guideline recommendation s for primary care management of benign LBP with or without radiculopathy Each evidence based guideline recommendation is supported by a clinical priority ranking . This is based on an overall assessment of the severity of the con dition, reported effect of the intervention, strength of evidence assessment (GRADE) , cost -effectivene ss and the benefit of the intervention based on professional experience and patient benefit. A scale from 1 to 10 is used where the number 1 indicates recommended practices with the highest priority while the number 9 indicates recommended practices of low priority . The number 10 indicates recommendations that provide very little or no benefit or utility and are therefore not recommended. Recommendation 1 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶ ❿ Routine care should consist of standardised processes for subjective and objective assessmen t and diagnostics. A thorough screening of red flags is essential to rule out serious pathology. Treatment should be individualised for each patient. Basic treatment principle s should be based on reassurance of a good prognosis, maintenance of appropriate physical activity and self -care enablement. Justification: The work group’s reasoning is based on clinical experience of the importance of careful screening to rule out serio us pathology. Furthermore, standardised assessment and diagnostics provide quality assurance but treatment needs to be individualised for each patient case. The work group also reasoned based on clinical experience that appropriate physical activity is lik ely to contribute to maintaining the patient's functional level, psychosocial and general health as well as have positive effects on self -care enablement. In some cases, may physical activity temporarily aggravate pain and symptoms, but there are no known persisting side effects. The work groups reasoning is also based on evidence showing a statistically significant advantage for maintaining appropriate physical activity compared to bed rest for improving pain and function. Despite this, evidence that prove s the benefit of appropriate physical activity is so great to be clinically relevant is missing. In addition, the best available evidence has however a currently limited scientific basis (○○). The working group proposes the following resources in the BetterBack  model of care to support the implementation of Recomm endation 1 (See sections 7.1 -7.5) Recommendation 2 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶❷ Do not perform routine medical imaging invest igations (eg X-ray, CT, MRI)"
29,page_29,"30 Justification : The work group´s reasoning is based on evidence that shows no differences in outcomes of pain, function and quality of life between patients who received or did not receive routine medical imaging investigations in the primary care context. The best available evidence has however a currently inadequate scientific basis (○○○ ). It was also discussed that imaging cannot confirm or reject a preliminary diagnosis as the relationship between patient symptoms and degenerative imaging finding is usually weak. Moreover, degenerative secondary findings are common in asymptomatic in dividuals. The work group however suggests that early use of medical imaging is motivated in the presence of symptoms or signs suggesting possible serious underlying pathology (red flags). Medical imaging may also be relevant when pain persists despite pri mary care treatment. Recommendation 3 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶❷ ❿ Consider using a patient -reported tool (eg STarT Back risk assessment tool) as usual care during the early -stages of patient management to screen the risk of continued LBP Justification: The work group ’s reasoning is ba sed on studies showing th at STar T Back Tool is the only valid tool to investigate the risk of continued back pain in the primary care context. It shows the highest accuracy for detecting patients with low risk profile (total score ≤3) and medium -high risk profile (total score ≥4) for continued back p ain. Studies also show that STar T Back Tool has the best ability to predict functional and pain -related outcomes. The best available evidence has however a currently inadequate scientific basis (○○○ ). No economical evaluations were ide ntified but the working group discussed the importance of a simple and fast tool. STarT Back Tool can be filled in and analyzed in a few minutes to advantage over other tools that c an be an administrative burden for patients and healthcare professionals. The working group argues that the predictive value of the tool should support, but not replace, regular examination procedures and clinical decision making. See section 7.3 for STar T Back Tool. Recommendation 4 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶❷ ❿ Consider using a patient -reported tool (such as the STarT Back risk assessment tool) and classification of examination findings during the early -stages of patient management to aid the stratification of care to prevent continued LBP Justificati on: The work group reasoned that for the choice and scope of targeted treatment measures, consideration should be given to the assessment of risk profile for long -term LBP and classification of examination findings. This has been shown to have a better eff ect on pain, function and quality of life, as well as less economic costs compared to no treatment stratification . The best available evidence has however a currently inadequate scientific basis (○○○ ). For a patient with low risk profile ( total score ≤3 on STarT Back Tool) usual care is relevant and requires only few visits, but the working group recommends that adequate treatment measures directed at examination findings is of the highest importan ce. For patients with medium -high risk profile (total sc ore ≥ 4 on STarT Back Tool), usual care will require additional visits. Information provided in questions 5 -9 on STarT Back Tool that investigate anxiety with psychological risk factors can guide the need, focus and extent of behavioral medicine measures. The working group argues that stratified care classified after assessing a risk profile for long -term back pain should"
30,page_30,"31 support but not replace conventional examination procedures and clinical decision -making for treatment measures. The working group proposes the follo wing resources to support the implementation of targeted treatments based on stratific ation (See sections 7.1 -7.5). Recommendation 5 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶❷ ❿ Consider giving individualis ed patient education as a part of usual care (e.g. an explanatory model based on pain neuroscience and psychological mechanisms ) Justification: Based on the best available evidence, the work group reasoned that indiv idualis ed patien t education as part of usual care can result in reduced work sickness absenteeism. The p riority of the recommendation has been strengthened by consensus within the work grou p based on proven experience that individual adapted patient educat ion is an important part of patient -centered care. The best available evidence has however a currently inadequate scientific basis (○○○ ). The intervention requires that the patient is receptive for education. The extent of pati ent education can depend upon whether the patient has a distorted image of the underlying mechanism of LBP and a high degree of negative outcome expectations, an xiety, and fear -avoidance or if they are inactive or passive i n managing the LBP . Patient education should include a reassuring dialogue and other cognitive and behavio ural therapeutic techni ques of relevance to support change in the individual's maladapti ve thoughts, fee lings and behaviors. Pedagogical explanation models should be used to provide the patient with knowledge about symptoms and disorders, as well as to strengthen and support sel f-care ability to master everyday activities . The work group pro poses the following resources to support of the implementation of patient educati on (See sections 7.6 -7.7) Recommendation 6 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶❷ ❿ Consider a supervised ex ercise program as part of usual care Justification: Supervised training is de fined as general or back -specific exercises or physical activities conducte d under the guidance of a healt hcare professionals. The work group ’s reasoning is based on scientific evidence and proven experience that supervis ed training as part of usual care c an result in clinically relevant improvement in pain, function, quality of life and produces lower health care costs compared with no supervised training. The re is however no evidence that a specific type of exercise would be superior to another. The best available evidence has however a currently lim ited scientific basis (○○). The work group proposes the following resources to support the implementation of a supervised tra ining program (see section 7.8 ). Recommendation 7 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶❷ ❿ Consider mobilisation techniques for neuromusculoskeletal structures as part of usual care (including active or passive motion in an angular and / or translational plane) Justification : The working group reasoning is based on evidence that for patients with segmental movement impairments, mobilization techniques can provide a statistically significant red uction in short -term pain. I t is however uncertain whether the effect is sufficiently large so that patients experien ce a clear improvement overtime . At gro up level, there is no evidence t hat a particular technique is be superior to another. It cannot be"
31,page_31,"32 ruled out that for subgro ups of LBP patients , more positive effects on pain and function may be produced by specific mobilisation techniques. It is expected that these subgroups can be identified by careful diagnostics and short trial treatments. Mobilizing techniques as part of multimodal treatment provide better results. Serious side effects are rare. However, the best available evidence is based on a curr ently limited scientific basis (○○). Recommendation 8 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶❷ ❿ Consider acupuncture treatment in addition to usual care Justification: The working group reasoned based on evidence that cannot exclude acupuncture has a short -term pain relief effect in additi on to a placebo effect. Acupuncture has however no effect on function. Side effects in the for m of brief superficial bleeding or inflammation may occur. Pneumothorax and systemic infections are not common, but the prevalence is unkn own. The best available evidence has however a currently inadequate scientific basis (○○○ ). Recommendation 9 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶❷ Do not offer corset, shoes, traction, ultrasound or electrotherapy Justification: The work group ’s reasoning is based on evidence that passive treatments such as corset, shoots / soles, traction, ultra sound or electrotherapy do not reduce pain or improve function and quality of life in patients more than no treatment or when offered as part of multimodal treatment. However, the best available evidence is based on a currently limited scientific basis (○○). It cannot be ruled out that subgroup s of patients may experience positive effects of these interventions when a hypothesised effect mechanism is aimed at specific functional impairment or activity limitation . Recommendation 10 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶❷ ❿ Consider prescription -free NSAID medication if necessary in addition to usual treatment (lowest dose and shortest possible treatment time). NSAIDs: There is evidence of the effect of NSAID in pat ients with long -term LBP but the effect has not been highlighted on short -term pain or function al outcomes . There are no adverse reactions reported in systematic review studies on LBP , but potential transient side effects of NSAIDs such as reduced blood clotting, reduced stomach mucous function and reduced k idney function are known from studies on other conditions . The work group reasoned that lowest dose and shortest possible treatment time decreases the risk of side - effects. The work group anticipates that there are differences in patient preferences regard ing NSAIDs, where some patients will agree to NSAID treatment, wh ile others will decline. T he best available evidence for NSAID effects on LBP outcomes is based on an inadeq uate scientific evidence (○○○ ). The work group reasoned based on clinical experien ce that it can not be excluded that the NSAID may have a pain relief effect in the short term. Recommendation 11 PRIORITY RANKING = ❶❷"
32,page_32,"33 Do not offer paracetamol or opioids Paracetomol: Has no effect on the degree of LBP and functional ability. Ther e are no reported adverse reactions in studies, but side effects of paracetamol in the form of hepatic effects are known from studies on other conditions . The best available evidence is based on a moderately strong scientific basis (○). Opioids : A weak analgesic effect of oxycodone in combination with paracetamol has been demonstrated in a study but the intervention has no effect on functional capacity for up to 12 weeks. Other positive effects or adverse effects were not shown. A wide range of opioid side effects are known from other studies . The refore, the working group reasoned that treatment results in more risks than benefits to the patient. T he best available evidence is based on a currently limited scientific basis (○○)."

39,page_39,"40 5. Clinical reasoning and pro cess pathway for therapists A thorough history and adequate physical examination are of great importance in order to target treatment interventions . In addition, it is very important to exclude the few red flag cases that require acute medical or specialis t referral for the investigation and treatment of tumors, infections, inflammatory diseases, more severe back pathology and neurological conditions, as well as the strong influence of psychosocial factors which can also cause back pain. StarT Back Tool can be used to support decision making regarding the extent of health care needed and the need for psychosocial focus based on an assessment of risk factors for continued back pain. The physical assessment should include an analysis of functional movements, p osture, active movements, passive movements, combined movements and / or static positions , joint accessory movement / provocation tests and neuromuscular function . This is to investigate how the symptoms are related to motion dysfunction. Based on assessme nt findings, relevant treatment measures with eff ect mechanisms directed at functional impai rments and activity limitations should be tested. These may include range of movement exercises (active/ passive or accessory joint mobilisation or neuro muscular structure mobilisation), motor control exercises, muscle stretching, balance exercises, coordination, m uscle strength, muscle endurance , general physical fitness or cardio vascular exercise. For example: 1. In the identification of movement directions and positio ns that reduce or centralize the patient's localised pain, distal pain or radiculopathy, these may be considered as a treatment techniques. This allows the patient to learn strategies to control pain and thus take better responsibility for his or her own s ituation. 2. In the identification of movement restriction due to joint, muscle or nerve related impairment, mobilisation strategies for the relevant structure may be considered to reduce the movement restriction. 3. In the identification of segmental instabil ity or trunk motor control impairment in the, exercises with a focus on movement control can be tested aiming to improve muscle function, reduce pain and optimise loading of the trunk during full body movement. 4. In the identification of a psychogenic cause s of back pain, supervised exercise could be tested to minimize kinesiophobia. This can often be complemented with patient education that can help pain management and enable self -care. 5. In the identification of a postural impairment, posture correction and ergonomic interventions can be tested . Dosage of treatment mea sures should be individualised and sufficient to achieve the desired effect. Initial targeted treatment should be through individual patient care. As a complement to the initial targeted treatm ents, the purpose of a general training and patient education is to restore or improve function and activity. The suitability of group -based patient care is assessed in consultation with the patient as general training and patient education is considered r elevant to support the patient's self -care."

BetterBack  Model – Training program for pat ients Training program for patients receiving the BetterBack  model of care for LBP Part 1: Posture, muscle control and coordination of basic body movements Goal : To ensure the patient has satisfactory posture and trunk muscle activation in static positio ns as we ll as in conjunction with basic body movement in the sitting, sitting and standing. Implementation* : Exercises and dosages are individual ly adjusted by the treating therapist. Exercises are performed as home programs and daily training is recommend ed for optimal results. The therapist assesses when basic competencies in progra m 1 are achieved before progressing to program 2 . Training range of movement Goal : Restore normal mobility. Implementation : Individualise based on if the patient has movement restriction . Part 2: Graded training of muscle strength, coordination and endurance Goal : To ensure the patient has satisfactory ability to perform more challenging body m ovements with adequate strength, corrdination and endurance . Implementation* : Exerc ises and dosages ar e individually adjusted by the treating therapist . Exercises are performed twice a week for 12 weeks with follow -up conducted by the treating therapist. During the first 6 weeks, patients are offered the opportunity to tr ain in a group supervised by a physiotherapist . The patient will then receive support and feedback regarding the practice of exercises and help to upgrade exercises if necessary. Patient education on self -care and management of back pain is also performed in groups. *Prerequisite for upgrading the training program is that the patient can satisfactorily perform basic ex ercises for posture and trunk control in Part 1. Using Part 2 as a basis, the physiothe rapist selects and individualises relevant exercises and dosing bas ed on the assessment findings. If support with the traning program is required (in addition to a self -mediated home based program), group traning supervised by another therapist can implemented . However, the follow -up of the patient is still the responsibi lity of the therapist who first assessed and initiated the patient’s treatment plan. The program is designed with graded levels where difficult y level is increased by successively progressing from stages A through to C. Patients are to perform the exercise s as instructed. Training can initially produce some muscle soreness , but this is normal and decrease s gradually. Contact your physiotherapist if you have questions or feel unsure."

Your training can consist of, for example: walks, nordic walking , cycling , jogging, swimming , dancing, gym. Choose which training form is best for you. You can w ork out alone or with others in a group. The most important thing is that you feel that you take the time for physical activity in your everyday life. Training intensity Training intensity can be regulated through a so -called ""pacing model"". This means that you slowly and gradually increase your training intensity without overloading. You ""pace "" yourself in a controlled wa y to reach your goals. You can monitor your level of exertion b y using a scale of 6 -20 where the scale is based on your approxim ate pulse when you multiply by 10. You should preferably training with a level of exertion between 11 (fairly light) and 14 (somewhat hard). You should start exercising at about 20% less dura tion than you are capacble of . If you feel that the exercise feels very easy (at level 9 or below), you can increase your exercise duration slightly so that you feel at least a farily light exertion level (level 11). When you experie nce your exercise exert ion is on average under a ""somewhat hard"" lavel (below 14), you can increase your exercise by 20% after 2 weeks. If you a re on level 15 or more, you can continue with the same training for an additional 2 weeks . When your training duration lasts 30 minutes , you can increase the load by increasing the intensity to 15/16 ( Hard - you can not speak on at this intensity) in 10 minute intervals . Then you can increase the number of minutes on th is intensity (15/16) every second week. If you have a bad day, you sho uld work out half of what you planned. In this way you can increase your exercise gradually, without risking doing too much . Training Contract : I will perform …………………………….. as my training form I will train 3 times/week I will begin with ………….. minutes I will increase my training intensity with 20 % every second week until reach my goal capacity ."
