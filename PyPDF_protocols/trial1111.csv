23,page_23,"Product: MK-3475 23 Protocol/Amendment No.: 598-06 MK-3475 -598-06 Final Protocol 11-Dec-2020 Confidential Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades [2].Accumulating evidence shows a correlat ion between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies [2]. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells/FoxP3+ regulato ry T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term survival in solid malignancies such as ovarian, colorectal ,and pancreatic cancer ; hepatocellular carcinoma ;malignant melanoma ;and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) . Tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as melanoma [3] [4] . The programmed cell death protein -1 (PD-1)receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. Programmed cell death protein -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or p rogrammed death- ligand 2 [PD-L2]) [5] [6] . The mechanism by which PD-1 down modulates T-cellresponses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4, as both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins [7] [8]. Programmed cell death protein -1 was shown to be expressed on activa ted lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs,and natural killer cells [9] [10]. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors [8] [11] [12] [13] . Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV-and IgC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either PD-1 ligand to PD-1 inhibits T-cell activation triggered through the T-cell receptor. Programmed death -ligand 1is expressed at low levels on various non-hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments. Programmed death -ligand 2is thought to control immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues [11]. Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variet y of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T- cell inhibitor. High expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells (and to a lesser extent of PD-L2) has been found to correlate with poor prognosis and survival in various cancer types, including RCC [14], pancreatic carcinoma [15], hepatocellular carcinoma [16], and ovarian carcinoma [4]. Furthermore, PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T- cell expansion in subjects with melanoma [3]. Antimouse PD -1 or antimouse PD -L1 antibodies have d emonstrated anti tumor responses as a monotherapy in models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, and colorectal carcinoma. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway effectively promoted CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor and the presence of interferon- gamma , granzyme B and perforin, indicating that the mechanism of action involved local infiltration and activation of effector T-cell function in vivo [15] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Summary of Pembrolizumab Clinical Activities 4.1.2.1 Completed Clinical Trials Four clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC: KEYNOTE-0 01,KEYNOTE -010, KEYNOTE- 024, and KEYNOTE-0 42. KEYNOTE -001: An open -label Phase 1 trial (KEYNOTE- 001) was conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of single -agent pembrolizumab. The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated 3dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W), in subjects with advanced solid tumor s. All3dose levels were well tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Based on PK data showing a half-life of 21 days, the protocol was amended to change the dosing frequency in the expansion cohort to every 3 weeks ( Q3W ). All cohorts have completed enrollment. In KEYNOTE-0 01, a total of 550 NSCLC subjects were treated in several dose expansion cohorts with at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab. The initial data from 495 NSCLC subjects were published and repor ted. The ORR was 19.4% (18.0% in the 394 previously treated subjects and 24.8% in the 101 previously untreated subjects). The response rate (RR) was similar regardless of dose, schedule, and histologic analysis. Current or former smokers had a RRof 22.5%, as compared with 10.3% among subjects who had never smoked cigarettes. Subjects were required to submit a newly obtained tumor biopsy prior to initiating therapy with pembrolizumab to evaluate the tumors for expression of PD-L1. After evaluation of several methods for pathological assessment, in a training set, membranous PD-L1 expression in at least 50% of tumor cells (TPS ≥50%) was selected as the cutoff point defining PD -L1 high. In a validation set of 313 subjects, the RR was 45.2% in the 73 subjects with a TPS ≥50% , including 43.9% in previously treated subjects and 50% in previously untreated subjects, values that numerically exceeded the RRin the training group [22]. Pembrolizumab has been generally well tolerated. The most common treatment -related AEs were fatigue (19.4%), pruritus (10.7%), and decreased appetite (10.5%). AEsof Grade 3 or higher were reported in 47 of 495 patients (9.5%). The only treatment -related AEs of an inflammatory or immune -mediat ed nature that occurred in more than 2% of patients were infusion- related reactions (in 15 patients [3.0%]), hypothyroidism (in 34 patients [6.9%]), and pneumonitis (in 18 patients [3.6%]). One infusion reaction led to treatment discontinuation. All the patients with hypothyroidism were successfully treated with medical therapy [22] . 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Subjects were randomized according t o their TPS (extent of PD-L1 expression) defined as follows: a TPS ≥50% was considered strongly positive and a TPS = 1% to 49% was considered weakly positive. Approximately 920 subjects were planned to be enrolled in this trial to examine the efficacy compared of pembrolizumab to docetaxel in an enriched population. Overall, the results from KEYNOTE -001 and KEYNOTE -010 demonstrated that pembrolizumab provided substantial, clinically meaningful benefits in OS, PFS, and ORR in subjects with NSCLC who progressed after platinum- containi ng chemotherapy and whose tumor cells expressed PD-L1. The PD-L1 selection employed in KEYNOTE-010 identified patients more likely to benefit from pembrolizumab and resulted in favorable hazard ratios (HR)in OS compared to docetaxel. In previously treate d subjects with NSCLC with PD-L1,TPS ≥1% ,and disease progression following platinum -containing chemotherapy, pembrolizumab provides a statistically significant and clinically meaningful OS benefit compared to standard docetaxel chemotherapy. In KEYNOTE -010, pembrolizumab was superior to docetaxel in the strongly positive TPS ≥50% stratum with regard to OS, with anHR of 0.54 (p= 0.00024) and 0.50 (p= 0.00002) for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W versus docetaxel and 10 mg/kg Q3W versus docetaxel, respectively [23] . Pembrolizumab was superior to docetaxel in the overall positive TPS ≥1% population with regard to OS, with anHR of 0.71 (p= 0.00076) and 0.61 (p<0.00001) for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W, respectively. Pembrolizumab was superior to docetaxel in the strongly positive TPS ≥50% stratum with regard to PFS by independent review committee based on RECIST 1.1, with a nHR of 0.58 (p= 0.00009) and 0.59 (p= 0.00007) for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W, respectively, compared to docetaxel. Pembrolizumab provided numerically superior benefit in PFS by independent review committee based on RECIST 1.1 compared to docetaxel in the overall positive TPS ≥1% population, with anHR of 0.88 and 0.79 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10mg/kg Q3W, respectively; however, the differences were not statistically significant at the 0.001 level required per protocol. KEYNOTE -024: KEYNOTE - 024was a multicenter, international, randomized, open -label, c ontrolled trial of intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab monotherapy versus the choice of multiple standard of care (SOC) platinum -based chemotherapies in subjects previously untreated for their Stage IV NSCLC and whose tumors express edPD-L1 at ≥50%. First -line treatment with pembrolizumab significantly prolonged PFS (HR 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] :0.37, 0.68; p<0.001) and OS (HR 0.60; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.89; p= 0.005) compared with SOC chemotherapy, inclusive of pemetrexed maintenance for subje cts with nonsquamous tumors [24].In addition, pembrolizumab was associated with a higher ORR, including a higher CR rate, as well as a longer DOR as compared to SOC.

Based on the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, immune -mediated AEs, including pneu monitis occurred at a greater frequency with pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy. Most immune -mediated events were of Grade 1 or 2 severity, and none led to death. These data underscore the substantial benefit of pembrolizumab as initial therapy for subjects with previously untreated, advanced NSCLC whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1(TPS ≥50%) . KEYNOTE -042: KEYNOTE -042, a randomized, open -label, Phase 3 study, compared pembrolizumab monotherapy to SOC platinum -based chemotherapy in previously untreated participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 TPS ≥1% . This study confirmed the OS treatment effect of pembrolizumab monotherapy observed in participants with TPS ≥50% NSCLC in KEYNOTE -024, and extended these benefits to a broader population with TPS ≥1% NSCLC. Results from the FAof KEYNOTE- 042 indicated a significant OS benefit for pembrolizumab over platinum -doublet therapy, with a HR of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.71- 0.93) forPD-L1 TPS ≥1% , and HR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.58-0.86) forPD-L1 TPS ≥50% . Median OS was 16.4 months (95% CI, 14.0-19.7 months) with pembrolizumab and 12.1 months (95% CI, 11.3- 13.3 months) with platinum -doublet in PD-L1 TPS ≥1% .In the population with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, median OS was 20.0 months (95% CI, 15.9- 24.2 months) with pembrolizumab and 12.2 months (95% CI, 10.4- 14.6 months) with platinum - doublet. There was n o observed PFS benefit with pembrolizumab v ersus chemotherapy , with PFS HR of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.69- 1.00), and median PFS of 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.9-8.5 months) with pembrolizumab and 6.4 months (95% CI, 6.2-7.2 months) with platinum - doublet in PD-L1 TPS ≥50% [25].The ORR was 39.1% vs 32% pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy in PD-L1 TPS ≥50% population [26] . 4.1.2.2 Ongoing Clinical Trials with Pembrolizumab Several additional studies to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab combination thera py in the treatment of NSCLC are in progress. Refer to the current pembrolizumab IB for a description of ongoing studies. Rationale Rationale for the Trial and Selected Subject Population The global incidence for lung cancer was 1.8 million in 2012, resulting in an estimated 1.6million deaths [27]. NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases. Progress has been made in the clinical management of early stage NSCLC by establishing comprehensive, multimodality treatment regimens; however, the prognosis for advanced disease has not improved substantially. With an overall 5-year survival rate of 9% to 13%, the treatment of NSCLC remains a highly unmet medical need. Cytotoxic chemothera py as single agents or in combination has served as the mainstay of treatment for decades with platinum -containing doublets and maintenance strategies conferring the greatest advances in OS gains. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

While the benefit observed in the trial was substantial with significant improvement in PFS and OS, the benefits may be improv ed in this patient population. In Check Mate 026, a total of 541 patients were randomized to treatment. In patients with ≥ 5% PD-L1 expression (n = 423), nivolumab did not improve PFS over platinum -doublet chemotherapy (HR, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91 to 1.45; p = 0.25) [28]. Median PFS was 4.2 months and 5.9 months with nivolumab and investigator's choice (IC) of platinum -based doublet chemoth erapy, respectively. Among all treated patients, any CTCAE Grade AEs and Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related AEs were 71% and 18% with nivolumab, as compared to 92% and 51% with IC platinum -based doublet chemotherapy, respectively. Nivolumab did not show superi or PFS when compared to IC platinum -based doublet chemotherapy as first-linetherapy in Stage IV/recurrent NSCLC patients with ≥5% PD-L1 tumor expression. The safety profile of nivolumab was favorable to IC platinum -based doublet chemotherapy and consisten t with that reported in previous studies. While monotherapy pembrolizumab provides efficacy in patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express high PD -L1 (TPS ≥50%), there is still medical need to further improve on the efficacy observed with PD-1 mono therapy in a biomarker selected population, reduce the time to response, and improve symptom control. Therefore, the combination of another therapy with pembrolizumab should be explored. The blocking of PD-1 receptors and CTLA4 receptors results in T-lymphocytes being fully disinhibited. Preclinical studies have demonstrated synergy between nivolumab and ipilimumab. A clinical trial in patients with advanced NSCLC has shown antitumor activity when combining these 2 checkpoint inhibitors in CheckMate 012. Patients who had not received prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy with recurrent Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC were randomly assigned to nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) plus ipilimumab 1mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W), nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 12weeks (Q12W), or nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W. Seventy- eight patients were randomized into the last 2 arms and the data from these patients are summarized here. One patient assigned to ipilimumab Q6W did not begin treatment because of rapid clinical deterioration. The median follow -up times were 12.8 months (IQR 9.3, 15.5) and 11.8 months (IQR 6.7, 15.9) for the ipilimumab Q12W and Q6W arms, respectively. Table 1shows the ORRs byinvestigator per RECIST 1.1 for the 2nivolumab and ipilimumab cohorts. Of the 6 patients with 50% or more tumor cells staining for PD-L1 in their baseline tumor sample who were treated with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q12W, all (100%) had an objective response. Of the 7 patients with 50% or more tumor cells staining for PD -L1 in their baseline tumor sample who were treated with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W, 6 (83%) pati ents had an objective response [29].

Based on the totality of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appro priate dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor type. As outlined below, this dose is justified by: oClinical data from 8 randomized studies demonstrating flat dose-and exposure -efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), oClinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including OSat 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, and oPharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred from pharmacokinetic [PK] data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically- based pharmacokinetic [PBPK] analysis) at 200 mg Q3W . Among the 8 randomized d ose-comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with melanoma and NSCLC , covering different disease settings (treatment -naïve, previously treated, PD-L1 enriched, and all-comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in combi nation with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q3W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of these studies demonstrated flat dose-and exposure -response relationships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5-to 7.5-fold difference in exposure. The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. Subsequently, flat dose-exposure -response relationships were also observed in other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose independent of the tumor type. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, which acts by interaction with immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells. Additionally, pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK data in KN001 evaluating target -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated saturation of PD-1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W. Second, a PBPK analysis was conducted to predict tumor PD-1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetration and PD-1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor. Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed -dosing provides similar control of PK variability as weight based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by these PK characteristics, and given that fixed -dose has advantages of reduced 05NQKR 06DZNS"

This section is no longer applicable. Ipilimumab is currently approved for melanoma patients alone, and in combination with the anti-PD1 antibody. Ipilimumab has demonstrated efficacy with doses ranging from 1 mg/kg to 10mg/kg, with lower toxicity rates at lower doses. In addition, in adjuvant melanoma IV ipilimumab is approved at 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks for up to 3 years or until documented disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. The ipilimumab dose selected for the current study KEYNOTE-598, 1 mg /kg, was formed on the basis of having a well-tolerated safety profile in combination with pembrolizumab, improved ORR (30%), and durable DCR (55%) observed in KEYNOTE 021 Cohorts D and H. Cohort D focused on establishing a safe dose for the combination, while Cohort H was designed to generate preliminary efficacy data of the combination. Key eligibility criteria for Cohorts D and H included age ≥18 years; advanced or metastatic NSCLC of any histology; ≥1 prior therapy (including ≥1 line of platinum -doublet chemotherapy); ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1; ≥1 measurable lesion; any PD-L1 status; any EGFR or ALK status; no prior anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti–CTLA - 4 therapy; no autoimmune disease; and no current interstitial lung disease or prior interstitial lung disease requiring steroids. Patients with EGFR- sensitizing mutation or ALK translocation were required to have had prior treatment with the appropriate targeted therapy. Initially, a 3+3 dose escalation design was pursued for adding 4treatments of ipilimumab to a constant dose of pembrolizumab every 3weeks for a total of 2 years in Cohort D. Three subjects were treated at pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W and then 3additional subjects were treated at pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W. Although no dose-limiting toxicities were observed , the dose of the combination was changed to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and ipilimumab 1mg/kg Q3W x 4doses because of emerging concerns regarding the safety, including some treatment -related deaths, of subjects with NSCLC treated with labeled doses of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab. Forty -five subjects were treated at this lower dose of both agents. Forty -four subjects were available for the efficacy assessment because one was later identified as having melanoma instead of NSCLC. The median duration of follow -up was 11.3 months (0.3-26.9 months). The ORR was 30%, one of which was CR (2%), by independent central review per RECIST 1.1, as shown in Table 3. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Database Cutoff Date: 07 -NOV -2016 The combination regimen was tolerable for subjects. Adverse event s were reported in 42 (98%) of the 45subjects who received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg; the most frequent AE was fatigue (44%). Twenty -two (49%) of these subjects experienced Grade 3to 5 AEs, the most frequent of which was fatigue, and syncope (7% each). The toxicity was manageable. Eleven (24%) subjects discontinued treatment because of AEs. There was one treatment -related death from pancreatitis. While the dataset for the regimen combining pembrolizumab and ipilimumab is small with 44subjects, the ORR in previously treated subjects with the combination is greater than what would be expected from pembrolizumab monotherapy in a broad population of subjects with NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a TPS ≥1% (18.0% [95% CI: 14.1, 22.5] for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg in KEYNOTE -010). The addition of ipilimumab to pembrolizumab did not add excessive toxicity in this dose and schedule. These data indicate that the combination regimen of pembrolizumab and ipilimumab may enhance the efficacy of pembrolizumab monotherapy in a first-line setting, without substantially increasing the toxicity. The Sponsor has also conducted a Phase 1b study of pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks in combination with ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg Q3W (4 dose s) in participants with advanced melanoma (KEYNOTE - 029). Results of a melanoma expansion cohort (N=153) showed that the combination was reasonably well tolerated with 38% treatment -related Grade 3 to 4 AEs and highly efficacious with a 57% ORR [31] . The proposed dose and schedule of ipilimumab 1 mg /kg every 6 week to be combined with IV pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for the duration of treatment in KEYNOTE -598 is based on open -label, Phase 1, multicohort study CheckMate -012, which evaluated nivo lumab plus ipilimumab in previously untreated advanced NSCLC. CheckMate -012 included multiple cohorts with different treatment regimen schedule sincluding 3 cohorts of nivolumab (1-3 mg/kg) every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab (1-3 mg /kg) every 3 weeks for 4 05NQKR 06DZNS"

The toxicity observed in the first 3 cohorts, when ipilimumab dosing was every 3 weeks for 4 cycles was high with Grade 3 to 4 TRAEs of (29 -58%), and TRAEs leading to discontinuation (13-40%), with 3 reported treatment -related death sfrom respiratory failure, pulmonary hemorrhage ,and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The combination of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg at dosing intervals of every 6 or 12 weeks had manageable toxicity after a median follow - up of approximately 1 year, with Grade 3 to 4 TRAEs occurr ing in 13(33%) patients taking nivolumab 3mg /kg Q2W + ipilimumab 1mg/kg Q6W and treatment -related AEs leading to discontinuation 5(13%), with no treatment related death. The most commonly reported Grade 3 to 4 TRAEs were increased lipase (3 [8%] and no patients, respectively), pneumonitis (2 [5%] and 1 [3%] patients), adrenal insufficiency (1 [3%] and 2 [5%] patients), and colitis (1[3%] and 2 [5%] patients) [29]. The median number of doses in (39 patients) the cohort receiving nivolumab 3mg /kg Q2W + ipilimumab 1mg/kg Q6W was 8 (3−18) doses for nivolumab and 2 (1−6) doses for ipilimumab, with the median duration of therapy 4.1 (1.9–10.1) month sfor nivolumab, and 3.4 (1.4–9.4) month sfor ipilimumab. Based on CheckMate -012 findings, the Phase 3 study CheckMate 227 of the combination of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1mg/kg every 6 weeks (until PD or discontinuation due to toxicity ) was started and is ongoing. The above overall experience of the ipilimumab dose in combination with PD1 inhibitors, and the assumption of potential additive antitumor activity of ipilimumab when combined with pembrolizumab for the duration of treatment, supports the dose selected for this Phase 3 study of IV ipilimumab 1 mg /kg every 6 week sto be combined with IV pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. Based on the results of KEYNOTE -024, pembrolizum ab monotherapy has become aSOC for treating Stage IV NSCLC in patients with PD -L1 TPS ≥50% with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The study resulted in a significant PFS benefit for pembrolizumab over the SOC at the time (platinum-doublet therapy), with an HR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.37-0.68, p <0.001; med ian PFS 10.3 months [95% CI: 6.7-not reached] with pembrolizumab and 6.0 months [95% CI: 4.2-6.2] with platinum -doublet), as well as an OS benefit with an HR of 0.60 (95% CI: 0 .41-0.89, p=0.005; median OS was not reached in either treatment arm) [24]. The results from KEYNOTE -024 established pembrolizumab as first- line therapy for patients whose tumors have a TPS ≥50% and in whom EGFR or ALK-directed therapies are not indicated; the regimen has received regulatory approval for this use by the FDA and EMA. The use of an ipilimumab matching placebo in combination with pembrolizum ab will ensure the objectivity of the local investigators’ treatment decision and AE causality assessments, while still providing subjec ts aSOC treatment. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

PFSis an acceptable measure of clinical benefit for a randomized Phase 3trial that demonstrates superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy, especially if the magnitude of effect is large and the therapy has an acceptable risk-benefit profile. Furthermore, it is an endorsed regulator y endpoint for 1LNSCLC trials with recent FDA approvals of pembrolizumab for the 1Ltreatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 positive expression (TPS ≥50%) and no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and European Medicines Agency (EMA )approvals including the EGFR inhibitors, afatinib and erlotinib.

DORbased on RECIST 1.1 and assessed by BICR is a commonly accepted endpoint by both regulatory authorities and the oncology community. Change from baseline in global health status/quality of life score from the EORTC QLQ -C30 (items 29 and 30) is a common PRO endpoint in trials of immunotherapy for advanced NSCLC [32] [33] . TTD in cough, pain in chest, or shortness of breath, defined as the time to the first onset of a 10-point or greater score deterioration from baseline in any one of the 3symptoms, confirmed by a second adjacent 10-point or greater score deterioration from baseline has been used as an endpoint in advanced NSCLC immunotherapy trials [34] [35] . 4.2.3.1.3 Exploratory Endpoints NOTE: As of Amendment 06, data for exploratory endpoints are no longer being collected. The EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -LC13 will be used to investigate ( 1)quality of life and (2) disease -and treatment -related symptoms.

These data, along with initial qualitative work [37], were submitted to FDA to support qualification of the NSCLC -SAQ for use in NSCLC clinical trials to measure a patient -reported, symptom -based endpoint. The PGIC-L PGIS-LC, and PGIC -LCquestionnaires will be used to investigate clinically meaningful thresholds for change in the cough, pain in chest, or shortness of breath scales from the EORTC QLQ -LC13/QLQ -C30 and the NSCLC- SAQ total score . PFSand ORR will be evaluated using modified RECIST 1.1 for immune -based therapeutics (iRECIST) [1], as assesse d by the investigator in subjects treated with pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab compared to pembrolizumab plus placebo. RECIST 1.1 will be adapted to account for the unique tumor response characteristics seen following treatment with pembrolizumab. Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab may produce antitumor effects by potentiating endogenous cancer -specif ic immune responses. The response patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents, and subject s may manifest a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions. Standard RECIST 1.1 may, therefore, not provide an accurate response assessment of immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab. Based on an analysis of subject s with melanoma enrolled in KEYNOTE- 001 (KN001), 7% of evaluable subject s experienced delayed or early tumor pseudoprogression. Of note, subject s who had PD by RECIST 1.1 but not by the immune - related response criteria [38] had longer OSthan subject s with PD by both criteria [39]. Additionally, the data suggest that RECIST 1.1 may underestimate the benefit of pembrolizumab in approximately 15% of subject s. These findings support the need to apply a modification to RECIST 1.1 that takes into account the unique pattern of atypical responses in immunotherapy and enables treatment beyond initial radiographic progression, if the subject is clinically stable. Modified RECIST 1.1 for immune -based therapeutics assessment has been develope d and published by the RECIST Working Group, with input from leading experts from industry and academia, along with participation from the US FDA and the EMA [1]. It is adapted to account for the unique tumor response seen with immunotherapeutics. The unidimensional measurement of target lesions, qualitative assessment of nontarget lesions, and response categories are identical to RECIST 1.1, until progression is seen by RECIST 1.1. However, if a subject is clinically stable, additional imaging may be performed to confirm radiographic progression. iRECIST will be used by investigators to assess tumor response and progression, and make treatment decisions. 4.2.3.2 Patient -reported O utcomes NOTE: As of Amendment 06, PROs will no longer be collected.

The EORTC QLQ -LC13, a supplemental lung cancer - specific module, comprises multi- item and single -item measures of lung cancer -assoc iated symptoms (i.e., coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, pain) and side-effects from chemotherapy and radiation (i.e., hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, dysphagia). It is scored on a 4 point scale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much) and has been translated and validated into 64 languages. The EQ-5D- 5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The EQ-5D- 5L will provide data for use in economic models and analyses including developing health utilities or quality-adjusted life years. The 5 health -state dimensions in this instrument include the following: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated on a five-point scale from 1 (no problem) to 5(extrem e problem or unable to perform). The NSCLC -SAQ contains 7 items assessing symptoms of metastatic NSCLC (i.e., coughing, pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and reduced appetite). The recall period is 7 days. Each item has a 5-point verbal rating scale from either “No symptom at all” to “Very severe symptom” or from “Never to Always” depending on the item’s format (i.e., severity or frequency). A single total symptom score is computed based on item responses. The PGIC -L and PGIC -LC will be administered to assess chang e since the last visit in cough, pain in chest, shortness of breath and total lung cancer symptoms, as measured with the EORTC QLQ -C30/ EORTC QLQ -LC13 and the NSCLC -SAQ, respectively.

The PGIS -LC will be administered to assess the current severity of overall lung cancer symptoms. The response options for this question are not severe, mildly severe, moderately severe, very severe, and extremely severe. 4.2.3.3 Safety Endpoints Safety parameters commonly used for evaluating investigational systemic anticancer treatments are included as safety endpoints including, but not limited to, the incidence of, causali ty,and outcome of AEs/SAEs ; and changes in vital signs and laboratory values. AEs will be assessed as defined by CTCAE, Version 4.0. 4.2.3.4 Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research Introduction : Cancer immunotherapies represent an important and novel class of antitumor agents. However, the mechanism of action of these exciting new therapies is not completely understood and much remains to be learned regarding how best to leverage these new drugs in treating patients. Thus, to aid future patients, it is import ant to investigate the determinants of response or resistance to cancer immunotherapy as well as determinants of AEs in the course of our clinical trials. These efforts will identify novel predictive/pharmacodynamic biomarkers and generate information that will better guide single -agent and combination therapy with immuno -oncology drugs . To identify novel biomarkers, we will collect biospecimens (blood components, tumor material, etc.) to support 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Investigations may include but are not limited to: Germline (blood) genetic analyses (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms analyses, whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing): This research will evaluate whether genetic variation within a clinical trial population correlates with response to the treatment(s) under evaluation. If genetic variation is found to predict efficacy or AEs, the data might inform optimal use of therapies in the patient population. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate germline DNA variation across the genome in order to interpret tumor -specific DNA mutations. Finally, microsatellite instability may be evaluated as this is an importan t biomarker for som e cancers (i .e., colorectal cancer). Genetic (DNA) analyses from tumor : The application of new technologies, such as next generation sequencing, has provided scientists the opportunity to identify tumor - specific DNA changes (e.g., mutations, methylation status, microsatellite instability). Key molecular changes of interest to immune -oncology drug development include (for example) the mutational burden of tumors and the clonality of T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. Increased mutational burden (somet imes referred to as a ‘hyper -mutated’ state) may generate neo-antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment. To conduct this type of research, it is important to identify tumor -specific mutations that occur across all genes in the tumor genome. Thus, genome -wide approaches may be used for this effort. Note that in order to understand tumor -specific mutations, it is necessary to compare the tumor genome with the germline genome. Microsatellite instability may also be evaluated as this is an important biomarker for some cancers (i.e., colorectal cancer). Tumor and blood RNA analyses :Both genome -wide and targeted messenger RNA expression profiling and sequencing in tumor tissue and in blood may be performed to define gene signature s that correlate toclinical response to treatment with pembrolizumab or other immunotherapies. Pembrolizumab induces a response in tumors that likely reflect san inflamed/immune phenotype. Specific immune -related gene sets (such as those capturing interferon -gamma transcrip tional pathways) may be evaluated and new signatures may be identified. Individual genes related to the immune system may also be evaluated (e.g., IL-10). MicroRNA profiling may also be pursued. Proteomics and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using blood or tumor: Tumor and blood samples from this study may undergo proteomic analyses (e.g., PD-L1 IHC). Programmed death -ligand 1 protein level in tumor sections, assessed by IHC, has been shown to correlate with response to pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC, and an in vitro diagnostic device has been developed for use with pembrolizumab in NSCLC. Preliminary data indicate that this association may also be true in additional cancer types (i.e., triple -negative breast cancer , head and neck cancer ,and gastric cancer ). Additional tumor or blood -derived proteins may also correlate with response to pembrolizumab. Therefore, tumor tissue may be subjected to proteomic analyses using a variety of platforms that could include but are not limited to immunoassays, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. This approach could identify novel protein biomarkers that could aid in patient selection for pembrolizumab (MK -3475) therapy. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Assays such as enzyme -linked immunoassay measure such proteins in serum . Correlat ion of expression with response to pembrolizumab therapy may identify new approaches for predictive biomarkers in blood,representing a major advance from today’s reliance on assessing tumor biomarkers . This research would serve to develop such assays for future clinical use . 4.2.3.5 Future Biomedical Research The Sponsor will conduct Future Biomedical Research on specimens consented for future biomedical research during this clinical trial. This research may include genetic analyses (DNA), gene expression profiling (RNA), proteomics, metabolomics (serum, plasm a) and/or the measurement of other analytes , depending on which specimens are consented for future biomedical research. Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere in the protocol (as part of the main trial) and will only be conducted on specimens from appropriately consented subjects. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for Future Biomedical Research is to explore and identify biomarkers that inform the scientific understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use such information to develop safer, more effective drugs /vaccines , and/or to ensure that subjects receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct time. The details of this Future Biomedical Research are presented in Section 12.2 –Collection and Management of Specimens for Future Biomedical Research. Benefit/Risk NOTE: The results of IA1 of this study indicated that the study did not meet the prespecified success criteria for improvement in PFS or OS for the combination of pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab compared with pembrolizumab plus placebo. Furthermore, a nonbinding futility analysis was performed at IA1 at the request of the DMC. This analysis showed the study met the crite riafor declaring futility and the benefit -risk assessment was not considered positive to continue the trial. Therefore, the benefit -risk assessment of pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab is no longer applicable and has been removed. It cannot be guaranteed that subjects in clinical trials will directly benefit from treatment during participation as clinical trials are designed to provide information about the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine. Despite the substantial improvement in PFS and OS observed with pembrolizumab as compared to SOC platinum -doublet chemotherapy in KEYNOTE -024, the clinical outlook of patients with previously untreated metastatic /recurrent NSCLC whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 can be improved with further gains in cure rates and long-term OSneeded. As such, urgency remains to investigate new treatments for this patient population. Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for subjects participating in this clinical t rial may be found in the accompanying IB and informed c onsent documents. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible ; however, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30minutes: -5min/+10 min). The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for pembrolizumab dose calculation, preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration. Trial Blinding NOTE: As of Amendment 06, blinding is no longer applicable as ipilimumab and matching placebo have been removed from the study. Subjects who remain on treatment will receive open -label pembrolizumab monotherapy as per protocol . This section is no longer ap plicable. A double -blinding technique will be used. Ipilimumab and placebo will be prepared and/or dispensed in a blinded fashion by an unblinded pharmacist or qualified trial site personnel . The subject and the investigator who isinvolved in the treatme nt administration or clinical evaluation of the subjects are unaware of the group assignments. Imaging data for the primary analysis will be centrally reviewed by independent radiologist(s) without knowledge of subject treatment assignment. See Section 7.1.4.2, Blinding/Unblinding, for a description of the method of unblinding a subject during the trial, should such action be warranted. Randomization or Treatment Allocation NOTE: As of Amendment 06, ipilimumab and matching placebo have been removed from the study and no further subjects will be randomized in the study . This section is no longer applicable. Treatment allocation/r andomization will occur centrally using aninteractive voice response system / integrated web response system (IVRS /IWRS). There are 2 treatment arms. Subjects will be assigned randomly in a1:1ratio to pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab or pembrolizumab plus placebo, respectively. Stratification Treatment allocation/r andomization will be stratified according to the following factors: 1.ECOG Performance Status: 0 versus 1. 2.Geography: East Asia versus non-East Asia . 3.Predominant tumor histology: squamous versus nonsquamous . East Asian shave a better prognos is than other ethnic groups regarding NSCLC.

If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor Clinical Director. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician. However, the decision to continue the subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the Sponsor and the subject. Acceptable Concomitant Medications Treatment of complications or AEs, or therapy to ameliorate symptoms (including blood products, blood transfusions, fluid transfusions, antibiotics, and antidiarrheal drugs), may be given at the discretion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation of (or to interact with) the study intervention. Antiemetic or any other prophylaxis should be considered in accordance with institutional guidelines. The following concomitant medications are also allowed: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Thyroid hormone suppressive therapy Anti-inflammatory agents Bisphosphonates or denosumab All concomitant medications received within 30 days before the first dose of trial treatment through the Safety Follow -up Visit should be recorded.

Please note, for continuation of treatment beyond progression per RECIST 1.1, clinical stability criteria per Section 12.4 must be met, including the no requirement for radiation . Trial therapy should be held during the course of palliative radiotherapy and should be resumed no earlier than the next scheduled administration of trial therapy. Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox) , yellow fever, seasonal f lu (that contain a live virus), rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an AE, SAE , or for use as a premedication in subjects with a known history of an IV contrast allergy administered as part of computed tomography (CT)radiography. Replacement doses of steroids (for example, prednisone 5to 7.5 mg daily) are permitted while on study, as is the use of local steroids and the useofinhaled steroids for the control of asthma . Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator , require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from treatment but continue in the trial for assessment of disease status and survival . Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary. The Exclusion Criteria describe other medications which are prohibited in this trial. There are no prohibited therapies during the Post -Treatment Follow -up Phase. Rescue Medications & Supportive Care Supportive Care Guidelines Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the treating investigator . Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potential immunologic etiology are outlined along with the dose modification guidelines in Section 5.2.1.2 –Dose Modification (Escalation/Titration/Other) , (Table 6). Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral orIV treatment with corticosteroids, as well as additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab or previously- administered ipilimumab. Note: If after the evaluation of the event, it is determined not to be related to pembrolizumab or previously -administered ipilimumab , the i nvestigator does not need to follow the treatment 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Diet/Activity/Other Considerations Diet Subjects shoul d maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE such as diarrhea, nausea ,or vomiting. Contraception Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Refer to Section 12.5 for approved methods of contraception. Subjec ts should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate in the study, subje cts of childbearing potential must adhere to the contracept ion requirement (Section 12.5) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to 120days after the last dose of study medication. If there is any question that a subject o f childbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study. Pregnancy Ifasubject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab , the subject will be immediately discontinued from study treatment. The site will contact the subject at least monthly and document the subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (eg,death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn). The study investigator will make every effort to obtain perm ission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor. If a m ale subject impregnates his female partner ,the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy must be reporte d to the Sponsor and followed as described in Section 7.2.2 –Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor . Use in Nursing Women It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, subjects who are breastfeeding are not eligible for enrollment. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

This section has been updated accordingly. Discontinuation of treatment does not represent withdrawal from the trial. As certain data on clinical events beyond treatment discontinuation may be/areimportant to the study, they must be collected through the subject’s last scheduled follow -up, even if the subject has discontinued treatment . Therefore, all subjects who discontinue trial treatment prior to completion of the treatment period will still continue to participate in the trial as specified in Section 6.0 – Trial Flow Chart and Section 7.1.5.6 – Discontinued Subjects Continuing to be Monitored in the Trial. Subjects may discontinue treatment at any time for any reason or be dropped from treatm ent at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur. In addition, a subject may be discontinued from treatment by the investigator or the Sponsor if treatment is inappropriate, the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/o r other safety reasons. Specific details regarding procedures to be performed at treatment discontinuation are provided in Section 7.1.4 –Other Procedures.

Individual trial procedures are described in detail below. It may be necessary to perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by the investigator. Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator and or the Sponsor for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject. In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations. Administrative Procedures 7.1.1.1 Informed Consent The investigator or qualified designee must obtain documented consent from each potential subject or each subject’s legally acceptable representative prior to participating in a clinical trial or Future Biomedical Research .If there are changes to the subject’s status during the trial ( e.g.,health or age of majority requirements ), the investigator or qualified designee must ensure the ap propriate consent is in place. 7.1.1.1.1 General Informed Consent Consent must be documented by the subject’s dated signature or by the subject’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature on a consent form along with the dated signature of the person conducting the consent discussion. A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation in the trial. The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s approval/favorable opinion in advance of use. The subject or his/her legally accepta ble representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the trial. The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature or by the subject’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature. Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at the protocol level. The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ IEC requirements, applicable laws and regulations and Sponsor requirements. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

The card will contain trial site contact information (including direct telephone numbers) to be utilized in the event of an emergency. The investigator or qualified designee will provide the subject with a Subject Identification Card immediately after the subject provides written informed consent. At the time of treatment allocation/randomization, site personnel will add the treatment/randomization number to the Sub ject Identification Card. The subject identification card also contains contact information for the emergency unblinding call center so that a health care provider can obtain information about trial medication/vaccination in emergency situations where th e investigator is not available. 7.1.1.4 Medical History A medical history will be obtained by the investigator or qualified designee. The medical history will include all active conditions, and any condition diagnosed within the prior 10years that are considered to be clinically significant by the investigator.

All scheduled tumor imaging, including screening, must include complete imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Tumor imaging is strongly preferred to be acquired by CT with iodinated c ontrast . For the abdomen and pelvis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used when CT with iodinated contrast is contraindicated, or when local practice mandates it. Chest imaging must be done by CT, but may be done without contrast when iodinated contrast is contraindicated. Brain imaging should be provided when clinically indicated and at screening, as described below, for subjects with previously treated brain metastases. MRIis the strongly preferred modality for imaging the brain. The same imaging technique regarding modality, ideally the same scanner, and the use of contrast should be used in a subject throughout the study to optimize the reproducibility of the assessment of existing and new tumor burden and improve the accuracy of the assessment of response or progression based on imaging. Subject eligibility will be determined using local assessment ( investigator assessment) based on RECIST 1.1. All scheduled images for all study subjects from the sites will be submitted to the central imaging vendor. In addition, images (including via other modalities) that are obtained at an unscheduled time point to determine disease progression, as well as imaging obtained for other reasons, which show radiologic progression, should also be submitted to the central imaging vendor. When the investigator identifies radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1, the central imaging vendor will perform expedited verification of radiologic PD andcommunicate the results to the trial site and Sponsor . If the investigator elects to implement iRECIST following initial investigator determination of PD, the investigator will assess for confirmation of progression by iRECIST at subsequent time points. Images should continue to be submitted to the central imaging vendor. 7.1.2.6.1 Initial Tumor Imaging Initial tumor imaging at screening must be performed within 30 days prior to the date of randomization. The site study team must review screening images to confir m the subject has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. The screening images must be submitted to the central imaging vendor for retrospective review. Tumor imaging performed as part of routine clinical management is acceptable for use as screening tumor ima ging if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 30 days prior to the date of randomization and can be assessed by the central imaging vendor. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, as subjects with carcinomatous meningitis are excluded regardless of clinical stability. Imaging used to confirm no evidence of progression of brain metastases must be submitted to the central imaging vendor for retrospective review as part of the screening assessment. 7.1.2.6.2 Tumor Imaging During the Study The first on-study imaging assessment should be performed at 9 weeks (63 days ±7days) from the date of randomization. Subsequent tumor imaging should be performed every 9weeks (63 days ±7 days) or more frequently if clinically indicated. After 54 weeks (378 days ±7 days), subjects who remain on treatment will have imaging performed every 12 weeks (84days ±7 days). Imaging timing should follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts. Imaging should continue to be performed until disease progression is identified by the investigator and verified by the central imaging vendor (unless the investigator elects to continue treatment and follow iRECIST), the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurs first. All supplemental imaging must be submitted to the central imaging vendor. PRand CR should be confirmed by a repeat imaging assessment. The imaging may be performed, at the earliest, 4weeks after the first indication of a response, or at the next scheduled scan (i.e., 9 or 12weeks later), whichever is clinically indicated. Subjects will then return to regular scheduled imaging every 9 or 12weeks as described above , starting with the next scheduled imaging time point. Subjects who receive additional imaging for confirmation do not need to undergo the next scheduled tumor imaging if it is less than 4 weeks later; tumor imaging may resume at the subsequent scheduled imaging time point. Per iRECIST (Section 7.1.2. 6.6), disease progression should be confirmed by the site 4 to 8weeks after central verification of site-assessed first radiologic evidence of PD in clinically stable subjects . Subjects who have unconfirmed disease progression may continue on treatment at the discretion of the investigator until progression is confirmed by the site provided they have met the conditions detailed in Section 7.1.2.6.6. Subjects who receive confirmatory imaging do not need to undergo the next scheduled tumor imaging if it is less than 4 weeks later; tumor imaging may resume at the subsequent scheduled imaging time point, if clinically stable.

If previous imaging was obtained within 4weeks prior to the date of discontinuation, then imaging at treatment discontinuation is not mandatory. In subjects who discontinue study treatment due to documented disease progression, and the investigator elects not to implement iRECIST, this is the final required tumor imaging. In subjects who discontinue study treatment without docume nted disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by tumor imaging using the same imaging schedule used while on treatment (every 9weeks in Year 1 or every 12 weeks after Year 1) to monitor disease status until the start of a new anticancer treatment, disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. 7.1.2.6.4 Second Course (Retreatment) Tumor Imaging NOTE: As of Amendment 06, ipilimumab and matching placebo have been r emoved from the study. This section has been updated accordingly. Tumor imaging must be performed within 30 days prior to restarting treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy. Before a subject may enter Second Course Phase, BICR verification of PD must have occurred. The PD imaging may also be used as the second course baseline imaging if it is within 30 days prior to restarting treatment and otherwise meets the baseline standards outlined in the S IM. The first second course on study imaging assessment should be performed at 12 weeks (84days ±7 days) after the restart of treatment. Subsequent tumor imaging should be performed every 12 weeks (84 days ±7 days) or more frequently if clinically indicated. Imaging for the Second Course Phase is not required tobe transmitted to the central imaging vendor . If during the second course tumor imaging shows initial PDper local RECIST 1.1, the investigator may elect to implement iRECIST and repeat the imaging 4 to 8 weeks later in order to confirm PD with the option of continuing treatment on second course while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression. Subjects who obtain confirmatory imaging do not need to undergo scheduled tumor imaging if it is lessthan 4 weeks later and may wait until the next scheduled imaging time point, if clinically stable. Imaging should continue to be performed until disease progression, the start of a new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or notification by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.

Once imaging is complete (e .g., PD, new anti neoplastic therapy), the subject enters into Survival Follow -up. 7.1.2.6.5 RECIST 1.1 Assessment of Disease RECIST 1.1 will be used by BICR as the primary measure for assessment of tumor response, date of disease progression, and as a basis for all protocol guidelines related to disease status (e.g., discontinuation of study treatment). Although RECIST 1.1 refe rences a maximum of 5target lesions in total and 2 per organ, the Sponsor allows a maximum of 10target lesions in total and 5 per organ, if clinically relevant to enable a broader sampling of tumor burden. 7.1.2.6.6 iRECIST Asses sment of Disease iRECIST is based o n RECIST 1.1, but adapted to account for the unique tumor response seen with immunotherapeutic drugs. iRECIST will be used by the investigator to assess tumor response and progression, and make treatment decisions. When clinically stable, subject s should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed by the investigator, working with local radiology, according to the rules outlined in Section 12.4. This allowance to continue treatment despite initial radiologic PD takes into account the observation that some subject s can have a transient tumor flare in the first few months after the start of immunotherapy, and then experience subsequent disease response. This data will be captured in the clinical database. Clinical stability is defined as the following: Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant progression of disease No decline in ECOG Performance Status No requirements for intensified management, including increased analgesia, radiation, or other palliative care Any subject deemed clinically unstable should be discontinued from study treatment at site- assessed first radiologic evidence of PD, and is not required to have repeat tumor imaging for confirmation of PD by iRECIST. If the investigator decides to continue treatment, the subject may continue to receive study treatment and the tumor assessment should be repeated 4 to 8 weeks later to confirm PD by iRECIST, per investigator assessment.

If treatment with ROS1 -targeted therapy and testing for ROS1 areapproved and acces sible , then local testing for ROS1is required . Testing for ROS1 is not required in subjects whose tumor is known to have predominantly squamous histology, and in subjects where ROS1 - targeted therapy is not accessible . 7.1.3.5 Planned Genetic Analysis Sample Collection Sample collection, storage and shipment instructions for Planned Genetic Analysis samples will be provided in the Procedure Manual. Samples should be collected for planned analysis of associations between genetic variants in germline/tum or DNA and drug response. If a documented law or regulation prohibits (or local IRB/Independent Ethics Committee [IEC] does not approve) sample collection for these purposes, then such samples should not be collected at the corresponding sites. Leftover DNA extracted from planned genetic analysis samples will be stored for future biomedical research only if subject signs the Future Biomedical Research consent . 7.1.3.6 Future Biomedical Research Sample s The following specimens are to be obtained as part of Future Biomedical Research: DNA for future research Leftover main study tumor tissue Leftover RNA from RNA analyses Leftover plasma from plasma biomarker analyses Leftover serum from serum biomarker analyses 7.1.3.7 Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics All-cause hospitalizations and emergency room visits must be reported in the eCRF, from the time of treatment allocation/randomization through 90 days following cessation of study treatment, or 30 days following cessation of study treatment if the particip ant initiates new anticancer therapy ( whichever is earlier ). Other Procedures 7.1.4.1 Withdrawal/Discontinuation When a subject withdraws from participation in the trial, all applicable activities scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of withdrawal . Any adverse events which are present at the time of withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 7.2 - Assessing and Recording Adverse Events. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Subjects may withdraw consent at any time by contacting the principal investigator for the main trial. If medical records for the main trial are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently, the subject's consent for Future Biomedical Research will be w ithdrawn. A letter will be sent from the Sponsor to the investigator confirming the withdrawal . It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the subject of completion of withdrawal . Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal or already performed prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research trial data and results. No new analyses would be generated after the request is received. In the event that the medical recor ds for the main trial are no longer available (e.g., if the investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main trial records) or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the subject’ s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for specimen withdrawal cannot be processed. 7.1.4.2 Subject Blinding/Unblinding NOTE: As of Amendment 06, blinding is no longer applicable as ipilimumab and matching placebo have been removed from the study. Subjects who remain on treatment will receive open- label pembrolizumab monotherapy as per protocol. Text related to ipilimumab/matchin g placebo and emergency unblinding in this section is no longer applicable. STUDY TREATMENT IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION IS TO BE UNMASKED ONLY IF NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PARTICIPANT. EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE NOT TO UNBLIND THE PARTICIPANT UNLESS NECESSARY. For emergency situations where the investigator or delegate needs to identify the drug used by a subject and the dosage administered in case of emergency e.g., the occurrence of serious adverse events, he/she will contact the emergency unblindi ng call center by telephone and make a request for emergency unblinding. As requested by the investigator or delegate the emergency unblinding call center will provide the information to him/her promptly and report unblinding to the Sponsor. Prior to con tacting the emergency unblinding call center to request unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment, the investigator or delegate must enter the toxicity grade of the adverse events observed, the relation to study drug, the reason thereof, etc., in the medical chart etc. For studies that require non-emergency unblinding as part of the study design (eg,disease progression) to support treatment decisions, instructions in this section below should be followed. The emergency unblinding center should not be used for this purpose. Subjects whose treatment assignment has been unblinded by the investigator/delegate and/or non-study treating physician must be discontinued from study drug, but should continue to be monitored in the trial. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Once authorization is granted by the Sponsor for nonemergent unblinding, thesite will contact IVRS/IVXS to receive the participant’s unblinded treatment a rm. The emergency unblinding center should not be used for nonemergen cyunblinding. Treatment/Vaccine identification information is to be unmasked ONLY if necessary for the welfare of the subject. Every effort should be made not to unblind the subject unless necessary. In the event that unblinding has occurred, the circumstances around the unblinding (e.g., date, reason and person performing the unblinding ) must be documented promptly, and the Sponsor Clinical Director notified as soon as possible. Only the principal investigator or delegate and the respective subject’s code should be unblinded. Other t rial site personnel and Sponsor personnel directly associated with the conduct of the trial should not be unblinded. 7.1.4.3 Calibration of Equipment The investigat or or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinical study that provides information about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained is reliable and/or reproducible. Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documentation at the study site. Visit Requirements Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0-Trial Flow Chart. Specific procedure -related details are provided above in Section 7.1 - Trial Procedures. 7.1.5.1 Screening Within 30 days prior to treatment randomization, potential subjects will be evaluated to determine that they fulfill the entry requirements as set forth in Section 5.1. Visit requirements are outlined in the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6).Screening procedures may be repeated. Written consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol -specific procedure. Results of a test performed prior to the subject signing consent as part of routine clinical management are acceptable in lieu of a screening test if performed within the specified time frame . Screening procedures are to be completed within 30days prior to the first dose of trial treatment except for the following: Laboratory tests are to be performed within 10 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. ECOG performance must be assessed within 7 days of the first dose of trial treatment but before r andomization . For women of reproductive potential, a serum pregnancy test will be performed within 72hours prior to first dose of trial treatment. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

If theDiscontinuation Visit occurs 30 days from the last dose of study treatment, at the time of the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit, procedures do not need to be repeated. Procedures at the time of discontinuation are detailed in Section 6.0 - Trial Flow Chart. All subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression should continue to receive all assessments until PD by RECIST 1.1 or initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy. Imaging assessments should continue as per the inte rval stated in the protocol; every 9 weeks for the first 54 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Additional imaging at the Discontinuation Visit is not required provided that a scan was obtained within 4 weeks prior to the date of discontinuation. In subjects who discontinue tr ial treatment due to documented disease progression, the scan documenting disease progression is the final required tumor imaging . 7.1.5.3.2 Safety Follow -up Visit The mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit should be conduct ed approximately 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment or before the initiation of a new antineoplastic treatment, whichever comes first. Subjects with an AE of Grade >1 will be further followed until the resolution of the AE to Grade 0or 1 or until beginning of a new antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first. Subjects who are eligible for retreatment during the Second Course Phase may have up to 2 Safety Follow -up Visits, the first after the Treatment Phase and the second after the Second Course Phase per the requirements in Section 7.1.5.5 –Second Course Phase .

Subjects who have received the maximum administrations of pembrolizumab indicated above for either initial treatment or Second Course Phase trial treatment , should be followed as indicated in the Follow -up Phase of the study outlined in Section 6.0 -Trial Flow Chart . Follow - up Visit 1 should be scheduled to coincide with the next scheduled imaging visit to occur at least 9 weeks after the last dose of trial treatment. Assessment for drug-related AEs, including those consistent with immune phenomena, should occur at Follow -up Visit 1. Follow -up Visit 2 should be scheduled to coincide with thenext scheduled imaging visit to occur at least 18 weeks after the last dose of trial treatment. After Follow -up Visit 2, subjects only need to be assessed every 9 weeks (63 ± 7days) or 12 weeks (84 ± 7 da ys) as defined in Section 7.1.2.6 – Tumor Imaging and Assessments of Disease , by radiologic imaging to monitor disease status, development of drug-related SAEs and ECIs, and initiation of new antineoplastic therapy. Unless otherwise noted in Section 6.0 - Trial Flow Chart , every effort should be made to collect subject information on the start of new antineoplastic therapy, disease progression, and/or death. Subjects who are eligible to receive retreatment according to the criteria in Section 7.1.5.6 – Second Course Phase will move to the Second Course Phase when they experience disease progression. 7.1.5.4.2 Survival Follow -up Once the subject stops the imaging assessments for this protocol (e.g., for PD or starting a new antineoplastic therapy), the subject moves into the Survival Follow -up Phase and should be contacted by telephone every 12 weeks (84 ± 14 days) to assess for survival status. Survival assessments and its respective entry into the database may be required more frequently around the projected interim or final analyses. Post-study treatments and the subject’s response to them will also be collected at the same time . Survival status data may be requested more frequently than every 12 week s(84 ±14 days) at specific time points during the study. For example, survival status may be requested prior to an external DMC safety review, efficacy IA,and FA. All subjects who are in the Survival Follow -up Phase ,and not known to have died prior to the request for this additional survival status time points, will be contacted at that time . Subjects may withdraw their consent at any time from any or all portions of the study.

Assessing and Recording Adverse Events An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event cantherefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol - specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol - specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor’s product, is also an adverse event. Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typical crying in infants and children and onset of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time. Sponsor's product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic agent or protocol -specified procedure, whethe r investigational (including placebo or active comparator medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by or distributed by the Sponsor for human use. Adverse events may occur during clinical trials, or as prescribed in clinical practice , from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/ randomization must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through 30days following cessation of treatment, all adverse events must be reported by the investigator. Such events will be recorded at each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is described in section 7.2.3.1. The investigator will make every attempt to follow all subjects with non- serious adverse events for outcome. Electronic repor ting procedures can be found in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC )data entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre-screening period (for determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any protocol -specified procedure or intervention. If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide consent to the main study and AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting. Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor NOTE: As of Amendment 06, ipilimumab and matching placebo have been removed from the study. Subjects who remain on treatment will receive open -label pembrolizumab monotherapy as per protocol. Text related to ipilimumab/matching placebo in this section is no longer applicable and has been removed. For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed dose for pembrolizumab as any dose of 1000 mg orexceeding 5 times the protocol - prescribed dose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, pembrolizumab should be discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. If an adverse event(s) is associat ed with (“results from”) the overdose of Sponsor's product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met. If a dose of Sponsor's product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported by the investigator within 24 hours to the Sponsor either by electronic media or paper.

Electroni c reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by an investigator who is a qualified physician to be related to the Sponsor's product that is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time following consent through the end of the specified safety follow - up period specified in the paragraph above, or at any time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph also must be reported immediately to the Sponsor. All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome. 7.2.3.2 Events of Clinical Interest Selected non-serious and serious adverse events are also k nown as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) and must be reported to the Sponsor. For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation/ randomization, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that occurs to any subject must be repor ted within 24 hours to the Sponsor if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol - specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedu re.

Specifically, the suspec ted/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is disease progression of the cancer under study. The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to ensure the safety of the subjects in the trial. Any suspected endpoint which upon review is not progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to G lobal Safety as a SAE within 24 hours of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under study . Evaluating Adverse Events An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4. Any adverse event which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade recorded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets. All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must als o be evaluated for seriousness. For studies in which multiple agents are administered as part of a combination regimen, the investigator may attribute each adverse event causality to the combination regimen or to a single agent of the combination. In gene ral, causality attribution should be assigned to the combination regimen (i.e., to all agents in the regimen). However, causality attribution may be assigned to a single agent if in the investigator’s opinion, there is sufficient data to support full attri bution of the adverse event to the single agent. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

(Note: Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre-existing condition that has not worsened is not a serious adverse event. A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of a Merck product and is documented in the patient’s medical history.); or †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in of fspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or Is anew cancer (that is not a condition of the study) (although not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to the Sponsor within 24 hours to meet certain local requirements); or Is an overdose (whether accidental or intentional). Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event for collection purposes . An overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non -serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within 24 hours. Other important medical events that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medica l judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outco mes listed previously (designated above by a †). Duration Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of time and units Action taken Did the adverse event cause the Sponsor’s product to be discontinued? Relationship to Sponsor’s ProductDid the Sponsor’s product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’s product caused the adverse event will be provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the r equired regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the available information. The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the Sponsor’s product and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor’s product caused the adverse event (A E): Exposure Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the Sponsor’s product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pill count, diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?

Executive Oversight Committee The Executive Oversight Committee (EOC) comprises members of Sponsor Senior Management. The EOC will receive and decide upon any recommendations made by the DMC regarding the trial. Data Monitoring Committ ee To supplement the routine trial monitoring outlined in this protocol, an external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the interim data from this trial. The voting members of the committee are external to the Sponsor. The members of the DMC must not be involved with the trial in any other way (e.g., they cannot be trial investigators) and must have no competing interests that could affect their roles with respect to the trial. The DMC will make recommendations to the EOC regarding steps to ensure both subject safety and the continued ethical integrity of the trial. Also, the DMC will review interim trial results, consider the overall risk and benefit to trial participants (see Section 8.7 - Interim Analyses) and recommend to the EOC if the trial should continue in accordance with the protocol. Specific details regarding composition, responsibilities ,and governance, including the roles and responsibilities of the various members and the Sponsor protocol team ; meeting facilitation; the trial governance structure; and requirements for and proper documentation of DMC reports, minutes, and recommendations will be described in the DMC charter that is reviewed and approved by all the D MCmembers. The DMC has responsibility for assessment of the overall risk:benefit. Periodic safety monitoring will be specified in the DMC Charter with input from the DMC members. When prompted by safety concerns, the DMC can request corresponding efficacy data. Any DMC recommendation will be communicated to the Sponsor as agreed to in the DMC Charter. As of Amendment 06, no additional DMC reviews will take place . 8.0STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN NOTE: Data from the IA1 of KEYNOTE -598 (data cutoff: 01 -SEP-2020) indicated that the study did not meet the prespecified success criteri afor improvement in PFS or OS for the combination of pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab compared with pembrolizumab plus placebo. Furthermore, a nonbinding futility analysis was performed at IA1 at the request of the eDMC. This analysis showed the study met the criteria for declaring futility and the benefit -risk was not considered positive to continue the trial. Based upon these data and at the recommendation of the eDMC, no further prespecified analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will be performed. Exploratory objectives may not be pursued.

Efficacy Endpoints Primary Endpoints Overall Survival OSis defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last known contact. Progression- free S urvival PFSis defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression perRECIS T1.1based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. See Section 8.6.1.2 – Progression- free Survival for the definition of censoring. Secondar yEndpoints Objective Response Rate ORRis defined as the proportion of subjects who have a CR or a PR.

Cough is based on EORTC QLQ- LC13 quest ion 1, pain in chest is based on EORTC QLQ- LC13 question 10, and shortness of breath is based on EORTC QLQ -C30 question 8. Safety Endpoints Safety measurements are described in Section 4.2.3.3 – Safety Endpoints and Section 7 – Trial Procedures .Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs. Safety parameters to be analyzed include, but are not limited to, AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, and laboratory changes . Analysis Populations Efficacy Analysis Populations The ITTpopulation will serve as the population for primary efficacy analysis. All randomized subjects will be included in this population. Subjects will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized. Details on the approach to handling missing data are provided in Section 8.6–Statistical Methods . Safety Analysis Populations The All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) population will be used for the analysis of safety data in this study. The ASaT population consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1dose of study treatment. Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment they actually received for the analysis of safety data using the ASaT population. For most subjects ,this will be the treatment group to which they are randomized. Subjects who take incorrect study treatment for the entire treatment period will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment actually received. Any subject who receives the incorrect study medication for 1 cycle, but receives the correct treatment for all other cycles, will be analyzed according to the correct treatment group and a narrative will be provided for any events that occur during the cycle for which the subject is incorrectly dosed. At least 1laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained after at least 1dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in the analysis of each specific parameter. To assess change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required. Details on the approach to handling missing data for s afety analyses are provided in Section 8.6 –Statistical Methods.

Methods related to exploratory objectives will be described in the sSAP. Efficacy results that will be deemed to be statistically significant after consideration of the Type I error control strategy are described in Section 8.8–Multiplicity. Nominal p-values will be computed for other efficacy analyses , but should be interpreted with caution due to potential issues of multiplicity. The stratification factors used for randomization (see Section 5.4 –Stratification) will be applied to all stratified analyses, in particular, the stratified log-rank test, stratified Cox model, and stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [42]. In the event that there are small strata, for the purpose of analysis, strata will be combined to ensure sufficient number of participants, responses and events in each stratum. Details regarding the pooling strategy wil l be prespecified in the sSAP prior to the database lock for the first analysis when each applicable endpoint will be analyzed, and decisions regarding the pooling will be based on a blinded review of response and event counts by stratum. 8.6.1.1 Overall Survival The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curve in each treatment group . The treatment difference in survival will be assessed by the stratified log- rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., the hazard ratio). The hazard ratio and its 95% CIfrom the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single covariate for treatment will be reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (see Section 5.4– Stratification) will be applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. In case the proportional hazards assumption does not hold, Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) method may be conducted for OS to account for the possible nonproportional hazards effect as a sensitivity analysis. 8.6.1.2 Progression-f ree Survival The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS will be assessed by the stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., hazard ratio) between the treatment groups . The hazard ratio and its 95% CIfrom the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single covariate for treatment will be reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (see Section 5.4–Stratification) will be applied to both the stratified log- rank test and the stratified Cox model. Since disease progression is assessed periodically, PD can occur any time in the time interval between the last assessment where PD was not documented and the assessment when PD is documented. For the primary analysis, for the subjects who have PD, the true date of disease 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Death is considered as a confirmed PD event. In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint perRECIST 1.1 by BICR , 2sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules will be performed. The first sensitivity analysis is the same as the primary analysis except that the data for any subject who misses more than 1disease assessment (with or without a subsequent death or progression) are censored at the last disease assessment prior to missing visits. The second sensitivity analysis is the same as the primary analysis except that it considers discont inuation of treatment or initiation of an anticancer treatment subsequent to discontinuation of study- specified treatments, whichever occurs later, to be a PD event for subjects without documented PD or death. If a subject meets multiple criteria for censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest will be applied. The censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses are summarized inTable 11. In case there is an imbalance between the treatment groups on disease assessment schedules or censoring patterns, we will perform an additional PFS sensitivity analys is using time from randomization to scheduled tumor assessment time as opposed to actual tumor assessm ent. In case the proportional hazards assumption is not valid, RMST method may be conducted for PFS to account for the possible nonproportional hazards effect as a sensitivity analysis.

As of Amendment 06, the following safety analyses will be performed: individual events and the broad AE categories including the proportion of participants with any AE, a drug- related AE, a serious AE, an AE which is both drug-related and serious, a Grade 3-5 AE, a drug-related Grade 3-5 AE, a fatal AE, dose interruption due to an AE,and discontinuation due to an AE will be summarized by counts and percentages by treatment group. As of Amendment 06, all other safety analyses listed in this section below will not be performed. The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach (Table 14). The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. Adverse experiences (specific terms as well as system organ class terms) and events that meet predefined limits of change in laboratory and vital signs, and ECG parameters are either prespecified as Tier- 1 endpoints or will be classified as belonging to “Tier 2”or “Tier 3,”based on observed proportions of participants with an event. Tier 1 Events Safety parameters or AEOSI that are identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” safety endpoints that will be participant to inferential testing for statistical significance with p -values and 95% CIs provided for between- group comparisons. AEOSI that are immune -mediated or potentially immune -mediated are well documented and will be evaluated separately; however, these events have been characterized consistently throughout the pembrolizumab clinical development program and determination of statistical significance is not expected to add value to the safety evaluation. Based on toxicity data ac ross the pembrolizumab program, the combination of pembrolizumab with ipilimumab is not anticipated to produce toxicity beyond what is expected for these therapies alone. Thus, there are no AEs that warrant elevation to Tier 1 in this study. Tier 2 Events Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% CIs provided for differences in the proportion of participants with events using the Miettinen and Nurminen method, an unconditional, asymptotic method [40]. Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 10% of participants in any treatment group exhibit the event. The threshold of at least 10% of participants was chosen for Tier 2 event because the population enrolled in this study are in critical condition and usually experience various AEs of similar types regardless of treatment ;events reported less frequent than 10% of participants would obscure the assessment of overall safety profile and add little to the interpretation of potentially meaningful treatment differences. In addition, Grade 3 to 5 AE (≥5% of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) and SAE (≥2% of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) will be considered Tier 2 endpoints. Because many 95% CIs may be 05NQKR 06DZNS"

The timing of the safety monitoring will be specified in the DMC Charter. As of Amendment 06,no additional eDMC reviews will take place . Interim Efficacy Analyses Note: As of Amendment 06, based on the eDMC’s recommendation after reviewing IA1 efficacy and safety data, the originally planned IA2 and FA described below will not be performed. The nonbinding futility analysis prespecified at IA2 was performed at IA1 at the recommendation of the eDMC. There are 2 planned interim efficacy analyses in addition to the final efficacy analysis for this study. Interim A nalysis 1 The interim analysis 1(IA1) is an interim analysis for OS. It will be performed when ~255 death shave been observed and ~12months after the lastsubject randomized, whichever occurs later. An interim analysis of PFS will also be performed at this time. It is estimated that ~357 PFS events will have been observed , but there is no requirement for th e number of PFS events to proceed with the analysis. IA1 will also be the only analysis for ORR. Interim A nalysis 2 Theinterim analysis 2 (IA2) is an interim analysis for OS. It will be performed when ~307 deaths have been observed and ~19months after the lastsubject randomized, whichever occurs later. The final analysis of PFS will also be performed at this time. It is estimated that ~389 PFS events will have been observed, but there is no PFS event count requirement to proceed with the analysis. A nonbinding futility analysis based onOS may be conducted at IA2. Further details of any futility evaluation will be specified in the sSAP . Final Analysis The FAwill evaluate OSonly. The analysis is planned when ~361deaths have been observed and ~ 27months after the last subject randomized, whichever occurs later . The Type I error control for efficacy analyses as well as efficacy bounds are described in Section 8.8 –Multiplicity . Multiplicity The overall Type I error rate is strong ly controlled at 0.025 (one -sided) αlevel. The trial uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz [41] to provide strong multiplicity control for multiple hypotheses as well as interim analyses. Figure 4shows the initial one-sided α-allocation for each hypothesis in the ellipse representing the hypothesis. The initial weights for reallocation from each hypothesis to the others are represented in the boxes on the lines connecting hypotheses. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Objective Response Rate No initial alpha is allocated to test ORR. However, the ORR p-value from IA1 (ie, no new data is added after IA1) can be compared to an α-level of eg,0.025 if the null hypothes esfor both PFS and OS are rejected at IA1 ora later time. The power at the updated α- level of 0.025 is 99.8% ,with an approximate treatment difference (ΔORR ) required for reaching the efficacy bound being 8.1% , assuming underly ing 39% and 59% ORR in the control and experimental groups, respectively. Progression- free Survival The trial initially allocates α=0.006, one-sided, to test PFS. If the null hypothesis for OS is rejected, its α=0.0 19is essentially fully reallocated to PFS hypothesis testing. Thus, the PFS null hypothesis may be tested at α=0.006 or eg.α=0.025 (if both ORR and OS null hypothese sare rejected). Table 15below shows the boundary properties for each of these α- levels for the IAs and FA,which were derived using a Lan-DeMets O'Brien -Fleming spending function.

The bounds provided in Table 15and Table 16are based on the assumption that the expected number of PFS events at IA1and IA2 (FA forPFS) are 357 and 389, respectively, the number of OS events at IA1, IA2,and FA(FA for OS) are 255, 307,and 361, respectively . At the time of an analysis, the observed number of events may differ substantially from the expected. To avoid overspending at an interim analysis and leave reasonable alpha for the final analysis, the minimum alpha spending strategy will be adopted. At an IA, the information fraction used in Lan-DeMets spending function to determine the alpha spending at the IA will be based on the minimum of the expected information fraction and the actual information fraction at each analysis. Specifically, In the scenario that the events accrue slower than expected and the observed number of events is less than the expected number of events at a given analysis, the information fraction will be calculated as the observed number of events at the interim analysis over the target number of events at FA. In the scenario that the events accrue faster than expected and the observed number of events exceeds the expected number of events at a given analysis, then the information 05NQKR 06DZNS"
106,page_106,"Product: MK-3475 106 Protocol/Amendment No.: 598- 06 MK-3475 -598-06 Final Protocol 11-Dec-2020 Confidentialfraction will be calculated as the expected num ber of events at the interim analysis over the target number of events at FA. The final analysis will use the remaining Type I error that has not been spent atthe earlier analyses. The event counts for all analyses will be used to compute correlations. Of note, while the information fraction used for alpha spending calcula tion will be the minimum of the actual information fraction and the expected information fraction, the correlations required for deriving the bounds will still be computed using the actual information fraction based on the observed number of events at each analysis over the target number of events at FA. The minimum spending approach assumes timing is not based on any observed Z-value and thus the Z test statistics used for testing conditioned on timing are multivariate normal. Given the probabilities derived with the proposed spending method, the correlations based on actual event counts are used to compute bounds that control the Type I error at the specified alpha level for a given hypothesis conditioned on the interim analysis timing. Since this is true regardless of what is conditioned on, the overall Type I error for a given hypothesis unco nditionally is controlled at the specified level. By using more conservative spending early in the study, power can be retained to detect situations where the treatment effect may be delayed. Safety Analyses The eDMC has responsibility for assessment of overall risk: benefit. When prompted by safety concerns, the eDMC can request corresponding efficacy data. As of Amendment 06, no additional eDMC review s will take place . Sample Size and Power Calculations The study plans to randomize approximately 568 subjects with 1:1 ratio into the pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab arm and the pembrolizumab plus placebo arm. With 389 PFS events, the study has ~87% power for detecting a hazard ratio of 0.69 at 0.60% (one-sided) signi ficance level. With 361deaths, the study has ~90% power for detecting a hazard ratio of 0.7 at 1.90% (one -sided) significance level. The above sample size and power calculations for PFS and OS assume the following, with control arm assumption estimated from the pembrolizumab arm from KEYNOTE- 042 in the PD-L1 TPS ≥50% population : PFS follows apiecewise exponential distribution with a median of 6.5months before 6.5 months and a median of 14.5 months after 6.5 months inthe control group. OS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 20months for the control group. The HRfor PFS and OS between the experimental and control groups is 0. 69 and 0.7 , respectively. Enrollment period of 20 months. A yearly dropout rate of 13% and 1% for PFS and OS, respectively. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

The investigator will promptly inform the Sponsor of any regulatory authority inspection conducted for this trial. Persons debarred from conducting or working on clinical trials by any court or regulatory authority will not be allowed to conduct or work on this Sponsor’s trials. The investigator will immediately disclose in writing to the Sponsor if any person who is involved in conducting the trial is debarred or if any proceeding for debarment is pending or, to the best of the investigator’s knowledge, threatened. In the event the Sponsor prematurely terminates a particular trial site, the Sponsor will promptly notify that trial site’s IRB/IEC. According to European legislation, a Sponsor must designate an overall coordinating investigator for a multi- center trial (including multinational). When more than one trial site is open in an EU country, Merck, as the Sponsor, will designate, per country , a national principal coordinator (Protocol CI), responsible for coordinating the work of the principal investigators at the different trial sites in that Member State, according to national regulations. For a single -center trial, the Protocol CI is the principal investigator. In addition, the Sponsor must designate a principal or coordinating investigator to review the trial report that summarizes the trial results and confirm that, to the best of his/her knowledge, the report accurately describes the c onduct and results of the trial [Clinical Study Report (CSR) CI]. The Sponsor may consider one or more factors in the selection of the individual to serve as the Protocol CI and or CSR CI (e.g., availability of the Protocol/CSR CI during the anticipated review process, thorough understanding of clinical trial methods, appropriate enrollment of subject cohort, timely achievement of trial milestones). The Protocol CI must be a participating trial investigator. Compliance with Trial Registration and Results Posting Requirements Under the terms of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) of 2007 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) clinical trial Directive 2001/20/EC, the Sponsor of the trial is solely responsible for determining whether the trial and its results are subject to the requirements for submission to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu or other local registries. Merck, as Sponsor of this trial, will review this protocol and submit the information necessary to fulfill these requirements. Merck entries are not limited to FDAAA or the EMA clinical trial directive mandated trials. Information posted will allow subjects to identify potentially appropriate trials for their disease conditions and pursue participa tion by calling a central contact number for further information on appropriate trial locations and trial site contact information.

Publication may include any or all of the following: posting of a synopsis online, abstract and/or presentation at a scientific conference, or publication of a full manuscript. The Sponsor will work with the authors to submit a manuscript describing trial results within 12 months after the last data become available, which may take up to several months after the last subject visit in some cases such as vaccine trials. However, manuscript submission timelines may be extended on OTC trials. For trials intended for pediatric -related regulatory filings, the investigator agrees to delay publication of the trial results until the Sponsor notifies the investigator that all relevant regulatory authority decisions on the trial drug have been made with regard to pediatric -related regulatory filings. Merck will post a synopsis of trial results for approved products on www.clinicaltrials.gov by 12 months after the last subject's last visit for the primary outcome, 12 months after the decision to discontinue development, or product marketing (dispensed, administered, delivered or promoted), whichever is later. These timelines may be extended for products that are not yet marketed, if additional time is needed for analysis, to protect intellectual property, or to comply with confidentiality agreements with other parties. Authors of the primary results manuscript will be provided the complete results from the Clinical Study Report, subject to the confidentiality agreement. When a manuscript is subm itted to a biomedical journal, the Sponsor's policy is to also include the protocol and statistical analysis plan to facilitate the peer and editorial review of the manuscript.

Purpose Merck, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of subject safety is the overriding concern in the design of clinical trials. In all cases, Merck clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. B. Scope Such standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by Merck irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (e. g., contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials which are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials which are n ot under the control of Merck. II.Scientific Issues A. Trial Conduct 1.Trial Design Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of Merck or comparator products. Alternatively, Merck may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine subject preferences, etc. The design (i.e., subject population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial. Research subjects must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 2.Site Selection Merck selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate subjects, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in Merck trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by Merck personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial. 3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity Trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical Practice. Merck reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness and consistency. Data are verified versu s source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per Merck policies and procedures, if fraud, misconduct or serious GCP -non-Compliance are suspected, the issues are promptly investigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified and data disclosed accordingly. B. Publication and Authorship To the extent scientifically appropriate, Merck seeks to publish the results of trials it conducts. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing. In such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues of multiplicity . Merck’s policy on authorship is consistent with the requirements outlined in the ICH-Good Clinical Practice guidelines. In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. Merck funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications. 05NQKR 06DZNS"
120,page_120,"Product: MK-3475 120 Protocol/Amendment No.: 598-06 MK-3475 -598-06 Final Protocol 11-Dec-2020 ConfidentialIII.Subject Protection A.IRB/ERC review All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB/ERC before being initiated at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the IRB/ERC prior to implementation, except that changes required urgently to protect subject safety and well -being may be enacted in anticipation of IRB/ERC approval. For each site, the IRB/ERC and Merck will approve the subject informed consent form. B.Safety The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that subject welfare is ofprimary importance. Potential subjects will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care. Subjects are never denied access to app ropriate medical care based on participation in a Merck clinical trial. All participation in Merck clinical trials is voluntary. Subjects are enrolled only after providing informed consent for participation. Subjects may withdraw from a Merck trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them. C.Confidentiality Merck is committed to safeguarding subject confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or representative) and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical records that might identify the research subject by name. D.Genomic Research Genomic Research will only be conducted in accordance with informed consent and/or as specifically authorized by an Ethics Committee. IV.Financial Considerations A.Payments to Investigators Clinical trials are time- and labor-intensive. It is Merck’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performe d in support of Merck trials. Merck does not pay incentives to enroll subjects in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts. Merck does not pay for subject referrals. However, Merck may compensate referring physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially eligible subjects. B.Clinical Research Funding Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by Merck, and that the investigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local IRB/ERC may wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, publications resulting from Merck trials will indicate Merck as a source of funding. C.Funding for Travel and Other Requests Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (e.g.,to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices including, in the U.S., those established by the American Medical Association (AMA). V. Investigator Commitment Investigators will be expected to review Merck’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. * In this document, ""Merck"" refers to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. and Schering Corpor ation, each of which is a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition.1 b.Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics as related to drug /vaccine response.2 c.Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence of variations in DNA sequence on drug /vaccine response.2 d.DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid. e.RNA: Ribonucleic acid. 2.Scope of Future Biomedical Research The specimens consented and/or collected in this trial as outlined in Section 7.1.3.5 – Future Biomedical Research Samples will be used in various experiments to understand: oThe biology of how drugs/vaccines work oBiomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed by the body oOther pathways drugs/vaccines may interact with oThe biology of disease The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine development. It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals respond to drugs /vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations with the greatest need. All specimens will be used by the Sponsor or those working for or with the Sponsor . 3.Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research a.Subjects for Enrollment All subjects enrolled in the clinical trial will be considered for enrollment in Future Biomedical Research. b.Informed Consent Informed consent for specimens (i.e., DNA, RNA, protein, etc.) will be obtained during screening for protocol enrollment from all subjects or legal guardians, at a trial visit by the investigator or his or her designate. Informed consent for Future Biomedical Research should be presented to the subj ects on the visit designated in the trial flow chart . If delayed, present consent at next possible Subject Visit. Consent forms signed by the subject will be kept at the clinical trial site under secure storage for regulatory reasons. 05NQKR 06DZNS"
122,page_122,"Product: MK-3475 122 Protocol/Amendment No.: 598-06 MK-3475 -598-06 Final Protocol 11-Dec-2020 ConfidentialA template of each trial site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the Sponsor’s clinical document repository. c.eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens Documentation of subject consent for Future Biomedical Research will be captured in the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified will be destroyed. d.Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s) Collection of specimens for Future Biomedical Research will be performed as outlined in the trial flow chart. In general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for Future Biomedical Research, these will usually be obtained at a time when the subject is having blood drawn for other trial purposes. 4. C onfidential Subject Information for Future Biomedical Research In order to optimize the research that can be conducted with Future Biomedical Research specimens, it is critical to link subject' clinical information with future test results. In fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical trial data to the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing subject characteristics like gender, age, medical history and treatment outcomes are critical to understanding clinical context of analytical results. To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obtained for Future Biomedical Research, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All specimens will be single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below . At the clinical trial site, unique codes will be placed on the Future Biomedical Research specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any personall y identifying information embedded within it. The link (or key) between subject identifiers and this unique code will be held at the trial site. No personal identifiers will appear on the specimen tube. 5.Biorepository Specimen Usage Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for analyses using good scientific practices. Analyses utilizing the Future Biomedical Research specimens may be performed by the Sponsor , or an additional third party (e.g., a university investigator) designated by the Sponsor. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the specific scope of analysis outlined in future biomedical research protocol and consent .Future Biomedical Research specimens remaining with the third party after specific analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor . 6. Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research Subjects may withdraw their consent for Future Biomedical Research and ask that their biospecimens not be used for Future Biomedical Research. Subjects may withdraw consent at any time by contacting the principal investigator for the main trial. If medica l records for the main trial are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). 05NQKR 06DZNS"
123,page_123,"Product: MK-3475 123 Protocol/Amendment No.: 598-06 MK-3475 -598-06 Final Protocol 11-Dec-2020 ConfidentialSubsequently, the subject's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main study use only. If specimens were collected from study participants specifically for Future Biomedical Research, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigat or confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the subject of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or already performed prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research trial data and results. No new analyses would be generated after the request is received. In the event that the medical records for the main trial are no longer available (e.g., if the investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main trial records) or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the subject’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed. 7. Retention of Specimens Future Biomedical Research specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential analysis forup to 20 years from the end of the main study. Specimens may be stored for longer if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions have been adequately addressed. Specimens from the trial site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to the Sponsor -designated biorepository. If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular trial, the trial site will ship directly to the Sponsor -designated biorepository. The specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility which operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the biorepository database. 8.Data Security Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated trial administrator research personn el and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highly secure, and is accomplished using network security policies and practices based on international standards to protect against unauthorized access. 9. Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Da ta to Subjects No information obtained from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the subject, family, or physicians . Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the subject include: Lack of relevance to subject health, limitations ofpredictive capability, and concerns regarding misinterpretation. If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to rapidly report this information to doctors and subjects. Subjects will not be identified by 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Future Biomedical Research Study Population Every effort will be made to recruit all subjects diagnosed and treated on Sponsor clinical trials for Future Biomedical Research . 11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research For FBR , risks to the subject have been minimized. No additional risks to the subject have been identified as no additional specimens are being collected for FBR (i.e., only leftover samples are being retained) . The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies and procedures to address subject data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largely limited to rare situations involving possible breach of confidentiality. In this highly unlikely situation there is risk that the information, like all medical information, may be misused. 12.Questions Any questions related to the future biomedical research should be e -mailed directly to clinical.specimen.management@merck.com. 13.References 1.National Cancer Institute: http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary/?searchTxt=biomarker 2.International Conference on Harmonization: DEFINITIONS FOR GENOMIC BIOMARKERS, PHARMACOGENOMICS, PHARMACOGENETICS, GENOMIC DATA AND SAMPLE CODING CATEGORIES - E15; http://www.ich.org/LOB/media/MEDIA3383.pdf 3.Industry Pharmacogenomics Working Group.

Assessment and Decision at RECIST 1.1 Progression For subject s who show evidence of radiological PD by RECIST 1.1 as determined by the investigator, the investigator will decide whether to continue a subject on study treatment until repeat imaging is obtained (using iRECIST for subject management (see Table 8and Figure 3). This decision by the investigator should be based on the subject ’s overall clinical condition. Clinical stability is defined as the following: Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant progression of disease No decline in ECOG P erformance S tatus No requirements for intensified management, including increased analgesia, radiation, or other palliative care Any subject deemed clinically unstable should be discontinued from study treatment at site- assessed first radiologic evidence of PD, and is not required to have repeat tumor imaging for confirmation of PD by iRECIST. If the investigator decides to continue treatment, the subject may continue to receive study treatment and the tumor assessment should be repeated 4 to 8 weeks later to confirm PD by iRECIST, per investigator assessment. Images should continue to be sent in to the central imaging vendor for potential retrospective BICR. Tumor flare may manifest as any factor causing radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1, including: Increase in the sum of diameters of target lesion(s) identified at baseline to ≥20% and ≥5mm from nadir oNote: the iRECIST publication uses the terminology “sum of measurements”, but “sum of diameters” will be used in this protocol, consistent with the original RECIST 1.1 terminology. Unequivocal progression of nontarget lesion(s) identified at baseline Development of new lesion(s) iRECIST defines new response categories, including iUPD (uncon firmed progressive disease) and iCPD (confirmed progressive disease). For purposes of iRECIST assessment, the first visit showing progression according to RECIST 1.1 will be assigned a visit (overall) response of iUPD, regardless of which factors caused the progression. At this visit, target and nontarget lesions identified at baseline by RECIST 1.1 will be assessed as usual. 05NQKR 06DZNS"
127,page_127,"Product: MK-3475 127 Protocol/Amendment No.: 598-06 MK-3475 -598-06 Final Protocol 11-Dec-2020 ConfidentialNew lesions will be classified as measurable or nonmeasurable, using the same size thresholds and rules as for baseline lesion assess ment in RECIST 1.1. From measurable new lesions, up to 5lesions total (up to 2 per organ), may be selected as New Lesions –Target. The sum of diameters of these lesions will be calculated, and kept distinct from the sum of diameters for target lesions at baseline. All other new lesions will be followed qualitatively as New Lesions –Nontarget. Assessment at the Confirmatory Imaging On the confirmatory imaging, the subject will be classified as progression confirmed (with an overall response of iCPD), or as showing persistent unconfirmed progression (with an overall response of iUPD), or as showing disease stability or response (iSD/iPR/iCR). Confirmation of Progression Progression is considered confirmed, and the overall response will be iCPD, if ANY of the following occurs: Any of the factors that were the basis for the initial iUPD show worsening oFor target lesions, worsening is a further increase in the sum of diameters of ≥5mm, compared to any prior iUPD time point oFor nontarget lesions, worsening is any significant growth in lesions overall, compared to a prior iUPD time point; this does not have to meet the “unequivocal” standard of RECIST 1.1 oFor new lesions, worsening is any of these: An increase in the new lesion sum of diameters by ≥5mm from a prior iUPD time point Visible growth of new nontarget lesions The appearance of additional new lesions Any new factor appears that would have triggered PD by RECIST 1.1 Persistent iUPD Progression is considered not confirmed, and the overall response remains iUPD, if: None of the progression -confirming factors identified above occurs AND The target lesion sum of diameters (initial target lesions) remains above the initial PD threshold (by RECIST 1.1) Additional imaging for confirmation should be scheduled 4 to 8 weeks from the imaging on which iUPD is seen. This may correspond to the next visit in the original visit schedule. The assessment of the subsequent confirmation imaging proceeds in an identical manner, with possible outcomes of iCPD, iUPD, and iSD/iPR/iCR. 05NQKR 06DZNS"

The response is classified as iSD or iPR (depending on the sum of diameters of the target lesions), or iCR if all lesions resolve. In this case, the initial iUPD is considered to be pseudoprogression, and the level of suspicion for progression is “reset”. This means that the next visit that shows radiographic progression, whenever it occurs, is again classified as iUPD by iRECIST, and the confirmation process is repeated before a response of iCPD can be assigned. Management Following the Confirmatory Imaging If repeat imaging does not confirm PD per iRECIST, as assessed by the investigator, and the subject continues to be clinically stable, study treatment may continue and follow the regular imaging schedule. If PD is confirmed, subject s will be discontinued from study treatment. NOTE: If a subject has confirmed radiographic progression (iCPD) as defined above, but the subject is achievi ng a clinically meaningful benefit, an exception to continue study treatment may be considered following consultation with the Sponsor. In this case, if study treatment is continued, tumor imaging should continue to be performed following the intervals as outlined in the Trial Flow Chart in Section 6. and submitted to the central imaging vendor. Detection of Progression at Visits After Pseudo- progression Resolves After resolution of pseudoprogression (ie, achievement of iSD/iPR/iCR), iUPD is indicated by an y of the following events: Target lesions oSum of diameters reaches the PD threshold (≥20% and ≥5mm increase from nadir) either for the first time, or after resolution of previous pseudoprogression. The nadir is always the smallest sum of diameters seen during the entire trial, either before or after an instance of pseudoprogression. Nontarget lesions oIf nontarget lesions have never shown unequivocal progression, their doing so for the first time results in iUPD. oIf nontarget lesions have shown previous unequivocal progression, and this progression has not resolved, iUPD results from any significant further growth of nontarget lesions, taken as a whole. New lesions oNew lesions appear for the first time oAdditional new lesions appear 05NQKR 06DZNS"

Progression must be confirmed before iCPD can occur. The decision process is identical to the iUPD confirmation process for the initial PD, with one exception: if new lesions occurred at a prior instance of iUPD, and at the confirmatory imaging the burden of new lesions has increased from its smallest value (for new target lesions, the sum of diameters is ≥5 mm increased from its nadir), then iUPD cannot resolve to iSD or iPR. It will remain iUPD until either a decrease in the new lesion burden allows resolution to iSD or iPR, or until a confirmatory factor causes iCPD.
