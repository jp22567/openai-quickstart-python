Gent, Belgium Consultant in Urology New York, , USA TRIAL SITES Approximately 7 0 sites in Europe and North America. PLANNED TRIAL PERIOD First subjec t first visit : Q3 2017 Last subjec t last visit : Q3 2019 CLINICAL PHASE Phase 2 BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR CONDUCTING THE TRIAL Nocturia is defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) as waking from sleep (during the night) at least once to urinate. This may occur when there is an excessive urine production during the night (noc turnal polyuria [NP]). The anti diuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a key role in the control of urine production during the night. Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of AVP developed by Ferring Pharmaceuticals , is approved and used for the treatment of nocturia due to NP in more than 80 countries, including Canada and European countries. However, desmopressin has not yet been approved for this indication in the USA . Low doses of desmopressin (25 µg for women and 50 µg for men) are approved to date in Canada, Australia and European countries under the trade name NOCDURNA (desmopressin Orally Disintegrating Tablet [ODT]). These gender specific minimum effective low doses are approved for use in all adult ages an d are indicated for treatment of nocturia due to NP in adults, who awaken two or more times each night to void. The global cumulative patient exposure of NOCDURNA by end-2016 is 1,389 patient years based on a dose of 25 μg for women and 50 μg for men (wome n: 779 patient years; men: 610 patient years). Analysis of the combined data from three trials of low-dose desmopressin ODT, comprising >1400 patients with nocturia, shows that desmopressin dose, patient age, baseline serum sodium levels, and kidney functi on according to estimated"

Ferring Pharmceuticals is currently developing FE 201836, another synthetic analogue of AVP and a potent and highly selective shor t-acting vasopressin -2 (V 2)-receptor agonist with an antidiuretic action profile suitable for treating nocturia due to NP in adults. FE 201836 exerts its antidiuretic effect by increasing the water permeability of the luminal membrane of the renal cortical and medullary collecting ducts, and thereby reducing free water excretion. Hyponatraemia may develop over time if excessive drinking occurs during the period of antidiuretic drug effect. Therefore, the ideal V 2-receptor agonist should provide an antidiure tic duration of action not exceeding 6 -8 hours i.e., corresponding to the night -time sleep period when drinking does not occur or is limited to a minimum (to satisfy thirst). The oral half-life should be shorter than that of desmopressin and the key route of metabolism non -renal, since the clinical promise of a short -acting V 2-receptor agonist is based on an improved safety profile without a prolonged duration of action leading to hyponatraemia. A shorter and more predictable duration of antidiuretic action would minimise the risk of hyponatraemia and may reduce the need for serum sodium monitoring. In the present clinical trial, 6 doses of FE 201836 (50-500 µg) will be evaluated for estimation of the dose -response curve, where the response is the change in the number of nocturnal voids. The choice of FE 201836 doses is based on the data regarding the antidiuretic effect of FE 201836 in healthy subjects and by the antidiuretic effects of desmopressin in healthy subjects and in patients with NP. In phase 1 trial 000195 in young healthy men and women oral doses of FE 201836 up to 4800 µg (i.e., 9.6 times higher than the suggested maximum dose in the present phase 2 trial) were administered and found to be safe and well tolerated. The exposure after intravenous infusion of 0.5 µg FE 201836, comparable to the exposure after an oral dose of approximately 900 µg FE 201836, resulted in approximately 8 hours of antidiuretic effect. The present trial is powered for detecting differences in treatment effec ts between FE 201836 and placebo. Desmopressin is included as benchmark treatment . There is no prospectively planned power for conclusive inference with regards to differences between desmopressin and placebo (or FE 201836). In order to select trial subjec ts with nocturia primarily due to the underlying condition of NP driven with increased Free Water Clearance (FWC), who will benefit the most from treatment with an antidiuretic agent, a 1 -week active run -in period followed by a 1 -week washout period (refer red to as the ‘enrichment period’) will be applied to ensure that drug -responders (defined as a reduction of nocturnal diuresis [mL/min]of 20% or more) are identified. The ≥20% dec rease in the nocturnal diuresis rate has been established as a relevant mark er of antidiurectic responsivene ss in previous nocturia trials with an active run -in. The majority of fluid output occurs via the urine, approximately 1 ,500 mL/day, therefore there is no evidence in adult nocturia patients that the"

An analysis of individual nocturia subject data found that reducing Nocturnal Urine V olume (NUV) and increasing the duration of antidiuretic action of a V 2-receptor agonist (desmopressin) was a significant predictor for subsequent decrease from baseline in the number of nocturnal voids. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of NP can be driven by either increase d FWC, which based on mode of action will be responsive to antidiuretic treatment, or by increased sodium clearance, which differs s ubstantially in mode of action and is governed by Atrial Na triuretic Peptide (ANP) which again is directly and indirectly influenced by the Renin -Angiotensin - Aldosterone System (RAAS). The aim of the active run -in is (after excluding all other medical causes of NP) to identify subjects with increased FWC which is responsive to V 2-receptor agonism. In addition, safety will be assessed in this period with spe cial emphasis on hyponatraemia.

METHODOLOGY This is a randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, response -adaptive, dose -finding trial investigating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 6 different oral doses ( 50-500 µg) of FE 201836, with desmopressin as a benchmark, during 12 weeks of treatment for nocturia due to NP in adults. The trial will comprise 8 visits to the clinic and will consist of a 2 -week screening/lifestyle changes period where no Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP) will be given, an enrichment period consisting of a 1-week single -blind (to subjects) active run -in period and a 1 -week washout period , and a 12 -week double -blind randomised treatment period for each subject . During th e active run -in period the trial subjects will receive 500 µg FE 201836 and placebo to assess safety and establish that subjects who respond to treatment with FE 201836 are included in the trial (i.e., an enrichment design). The 12 -week double -blind random ised treatment period of the trial will follow a response -adaptive Bayesian top -down design. Initially subjects will be randomised to: placebo, 500 µg FE 201836 or desmopressin (for benchmarking only). When approximately 125 subjects have been randomised t o the trial, an interim analysis will be conducted to investigate the efficacy of 500 µg FE 201836. If 500 µg FE 201836 is not sufficiently efficacious compared to placebo the trial will be stopped for futility. If 500 µg FE 201836 is efficacious additiona l doses of FE 201836 (doses 50 -350 µg) will be opened up for randomisation of new sub jects in order to identify the Minimum Effective Dose (MED) and near maximal Effective D ose (ED 85). The ED 85 is the lowest dose that achieves at least 85% of the effect of the maximum dose (500 µg). After the first interim analysis, subsequent interim analyses will take place every 8 weeks to reassess the randomisation allocation probabilities to 50 -500 µg FE 201836, based on observed responses at the respective interim loc ks. After the first interim analysis eligible subjects will be randomised to one of 8 treatment groups (Table S -1). Each subject will be instructed to take the IMP every night at bedtime with the intention to sleep. In order to keep the treatment blinded each subject will receive two medications throughout th e trial; an oral solution and an Orally Disintegrating Tablet (ODT), i.e., a double - dummy design will be applied because desmopressin is available in an ODT formulation and FE 201836 is an oral solution. Subjects will be asked to follow lifestyle changes ( e.g., limiting fluid intake) throughout the entire"

In addition, subjects will be asked to complete electronic diary (e -Diary) assessments and Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) questionnaires before and after randomisation. One objectiv e of the present trial is to further validate the NI Diary. Therefore, a sample of subjects (from trial sites in the US A) who have completed the trial will be invited to participate in an exit interview within 14 days of attending the end -of-trial visit (V isit 8), to record the subjects’ perception of what constitutes a meaningful change in the NI Diary Total Score . Safety, including serum sodium levels, adverse events and clinically significant changes in vital signs and laboratory values will be monitored throughout the trial and reviewed on an ongoing basis by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) . Furthermore, the risk for subjec ts developing hyponatraemia will be mitigated by a serum sodium monitoring plan , including a 1-week active run -in period to identify subjects at increased risk for developing acute hyponatraemia prior to randomisation . If the incidence of serum sodium levels <130 mmol/L is statistically significantly >10% during the active run -in, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be notified and further action will be discussed, e.g., the DMC may recommend that the highest dose of FE 201836 ma y be replaced by a lower dose. T he trial is designed so the dose may be lowered from 500 µg to 3 50 µg, if recommended by the DMC .

Subjects will be screened, enter a 2 -week lifestyle changes period followed by a 1-week single -blind ac tive run -in and 1 -week washout prior to randomisation. Following randomisation , the first 125 subjects will be treated daily with placebo, 500 µg FE 201836 or desmopressin (25 µg for females and 50 µg for males ) for up to 12 weeks . When the first 125 subjects have been randomised an interim analysis will be conducted and a decision taken on whether to continue the trial as planned or stop the trial for futility. If the decision is to continue the trial as planned, subjects may be randomised to one of 8 treatment groups for 12 weeks : placebo, 50 µg FE 201836, 100 µg FE 201836, 150 µg FE 201836, 2 50 µg FE 201836, 350 µg FE 201836, 500 µg FE 201836 , or desmopressin (25 µg for females and 50 µg for males) . STATISTICAL METHODS Primary Analysis Model used in the Response -adaptive Trial Design The primary an alysis is based on a time -course hierarchical longitudinal model, i.e., 𝑌𝑡,𝑖=𝑒𝛾𝑡(𝜇𝑑,𝑖+𝛿𝑖)+ 𝜀𝑡 where Y t,i is the change from baseline in number of nocturnal voids at visit t for subject i, d is the dose, 𝑒𝛾𝑡 the fraction of the effect at Visit t (Week 1, Week 4 or Week 8) as compared to the Month 3 visit ( 𝛾t=0 at Month 3), δ i the random subject effect and ε t the independent N(0, 𝜆𝑡2) distributed error term. The dose -response for subject 𝑖, 𝜇𝑑,𝑖, is adjusted for the number of baseline voids ( 𝑥0,𝑖) and modelled using the sigmoidal E -max model, i.e., 𝜇𝑑,𝑖=𝛽𝑥0,𝑖+𝛼1+(𝛼2−𝛼1) 𝑑𝛼4 𝑑𝛼4+𝛼3𝛼4=𝛽𝑥0,𝑖+𝜇𝑑 Inference will be based on a Bayesian analysis using sufficiently non -informative priors on respective parameters. The trial will be considered successful if the maximum dose has a greater than 97.5% posterior probability of being better than placebo, i.e. , if Pr( μMAX < μ Plb) > 97.5%. Response -adaptive Decision Rules The double -blind treatment period is based on a response -adaptive Bayesian top -down design. After an initial 125 subjects have been randomised to placebo, 500 µg FE 201836 (the highest dose) or desmopressin in a 2:2:1 ratio an interim analysis will take place to stop for futility if the Pr ( μMAX – μPlb < -0.3) <10%, where Pr (.) denotes posterior probability (under the assumed mon otonic dose - response relation, i.e. smaller doses will be less e ffective). If not stopped for futility, all treatment arms will be opened up for randomisation, subjects can be randomised to placebo, desmopressin or to any FE 201836 dose (50 -500 µg) in a 2:1:7 ratio. When allocated to a FE 201836 dose (7/10), unrestrict ed randomisation will be used to allocate a subject"

Randomisation if the Maximum Dose is Lowered The trial has been designed with the option to decrease the maximum dose of FE 201836 from 500 µg to 350 µg if recommended by the DMC. If this decision is made, randomisation to the 500 µg FE 201836 treatment group will be closed, the trial will continue w ith 350 µg FE 201836 as the highest dose for the active run -in and the highest dose of FE 201836 that any sub ject can be randomised to. In the case where subjects have already been randomised to 500 µg FE 201836 and have not completed the trial the DMC will recommend whether or not, these subjects may be permitted to remain on 500 µg FE 201836 treatment for the remainder of the trial. In case subjects randomised to treatment with 500 µg FE 201836 prematurely discontinue the trial due to DMC decision they may be replaced by subjects randomised to treatment with a lower dose of FE 201836. No other prematurely discontinued subjects will be replaced. If the decision to close randomisation to 500 µg FE 201836 occurs prior to the first interim analysis (when the first 125 subjects are randomised) the remaining subjects will be randomised to the following treatment groups: placebo, desmopressin (25 µg for females and 50 µg for males) or 350 µg FE 201836. After the first interim analysis the dose -response adaptive randomisation will allocate subjects to the remaining open doses, i.e., one of 7 treatment groups: placebo, 50 µg FE 201836, 100 µg FE 201836, 150 µg FE 201836, 250 µg FE 201836, 350 µg FE 201836, or desmopressin (25 µg fo r females and 50 µg for males). The dose -response model will be fitted across all doses, i.e., 0 -500 µg, but inference will be made only on the doses th at remain open to randomisation e.g., 0 -350 µg. That is, the MED and ED 85 doses and the inferences with regards to proof -of-concept and fu tility are limited to the dose range (i.e, with a maximum dose of 350 µg FE 201836)."

Nocturia is a symptom complex associated with several underlying medical and urological causes and pathologies ( van Kerrebroeck, 2002 ; Wein , 2002). It is common in the elderly, occurring in up to 50% of men and women older than 75 years ( Bosch, 2010). Nocturia is associated with a variety of clinical syndromes and disorders, which may result from (van Kerrebroeck, 2002 ): • Disorders that cause frequent low volume vo ids (e.g., Overactive Bladder [ OAB ], Bladder Outlet Obstruction [ BOO ], stiffer/less -compliant/functionally -smaller bladder associated with aging) or • frequent high volume voids (e.g., Nocturnal Polyuria [NP] , global polyuria [d iabetes insipidus or mellitus] ) or • a combin ation of both, which is common. As described above , NP is a subset of nocturia defined as excessive volume of urine produced at night. The human body typically produces less urine while asleep. People with NP produce larger volumes of urine when asleep, causing them to awaken multiple times in the night to void. Thus, the diagnosis nocturia may be applied when there is an excessive urine production during the night . Nocturnal polyuria has been attributed to: • Abnormalities in diurnal variation in vasopressin secretion (a condition also coined as NP syndrome ) (Asplund, 1991) • Abnormalities in the diuresis of solutes (e.g., urea, sodium, potassium) • Night time mobilisation of oedematous fluid in conditions such as congestive heart failure, nephrotic sy ndrome, or venous insufficiency However, as described abo ve, patients often have more than one symptom presenting as nocturia (or NP); e.g., high volume of urine at night in combination with low volume bladder (perhaps associated with ageing) and BOO . Taken together, these facts make the clinical situation compl icated since patients may have NP overlaid symptoms associated with frequent, low -volume voids, including OAB and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) . The anti diuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a key role in the control of urine production during the night. Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of AVP developed by Ferring Pharmaceuticals , is approved and used for the treatment of noc turia due to NP in more than"

However, desmopressin has not yet been approved for this indication in the USA . Low doses of desmopressin (25 µg for women and 50 µg for men ) are approved to date in Canada, Australia and Europe an countries under the trade name NOCDURNA (desmopr essin Orally Disintegrating Tablet [ODT]) . These gender specific minimum effective low doses are approved for use in all adult ages and are indicated for treatment of nocturia due to NP in adults, who awaken two or more times each night to void. The global cumulative patient exposure of NOCDURNA by end-2016 is 1 ,389 patient years based on a dose of 25 μg for women and 50 μg for men (women: 779 patient years; men : 610 patient years). Analysis of the combined data from three trials of low-dose desmopressin OD T, comprising >1400 patients with nocturia, shows that desmopressin dose, patient age, baseline serum sodium levels, and kidney function according to estimated glomerular filtration rate clearance were significant risk factors for hyponatraemia in both sex es (Juul, 2016). Ferring Pharm aceuticals is currently developing FE 201836, another synthetic analogue of AVP and a potent and highly selective short -acting vasopressin -2 (V 2)-receptor agonist with an antidiuretic action profile suitable for treating nocturia due to NP in adults. FE 201836 exerts its antidiuretic effect by increasing the water permeability of the luminal membrane of the renal cortical and medullary collecting du cts, and thereby reducing free water excretion. Hyponatraemia may develop over time if drinking occurs during the period of antidiuretic drug effect. Therefore, the ideal V2-receptor agonist should provide an antidiuretic duration of action not exceeding 6 -8 hours i.e., corresponding to the night -time sleep period when drinking does not occur or is limi ted to a minimum (to satisfy thirst only). The oral half -life should be shorter than that of desmopressin and the key route of metabolism non -renal, since th e clinical promise of a short - acting V 2-receptor agonist is based on an improved safety profile without a prolonged duration of action potentially leading to hyponatraemia. A shorter and more predictable duration of antidiuretic action would minimise the r isk of hyponatraemia and may reduce the need for serum sodium monitoring. In the present clinical trial, 6 doses of FE 201836 (50-500 µg) will be evaluated for estimation of the dose -response curve, where the response is the change in the number of nocturnal voids. The selection of FE 201836 doses in the trial is based on data regarding the antidiuretic effect of FE 201836 in healthy subjects and by the antidiuretic effects of desmopre ssin in healthy subjects and in patients with NP. In a phase 1 trial (000195 ) in young healthy men and women , oral doses of FE 201836 of up to 4 ,800 µg were administered and found to be safe and well tolerated. The exposure after in travenous infusion of 0. 5 µg FE 201836, comparable to the exposure after an oral dose of approximately 900 µg FE 201836, resulted in approximately 8 hours of antidiuretic effect. The present trial is powered for detecting differences in treatment effects between FE 201836 and placebo. Desmopressin is inc luded as benchmark treatment. There is no prospectively planned power for conclusive inference with regards to differences between desmopressin and placebo (or FE 201836)."

Renal impairment has also limited the use due to a risk of prolonging duration of action. FE 201836 , a novel short -acting V 2-receptor agonist , now under development , is designed to preserve potency at the V 2-receptor at the same level as desmopressin, with a shorter half-life, increased selectivity, faster clearance and greater extra -renal clearance compared to desmopressin . The present phase 2 trial will establish the dose -response of FE 201836 with respect to the number of nocturnal voids in subjects with nocturia due to NP, allowing the development to pro ceed for a novel agonist at the V 2-receptor for treatment of nocturia due to NP. 1.3 Benefit / Risk Aspects Benefits Subjects enrolled in the present trial will be closely monitored and they will have the same or more frequent visits to the hospital compared t o routine treatment, depending on local practice. During these visits the subjects will be given instructions regarding lifestyle changes (including limiting fluid intake ). For some subjects the implementation of lifestyle changes might be enough to reduce bothersome nocturia, defined as 2 or more nocturnal voids . Risks Treatment of nocturia due to NP with desmopressin implies a prolonged antidiuretic effect that may be associated with an increased risk of developing hyponatraemia, especially in elderly patients. FE 201836 is designed to preserve potency at the V 2-receptor at the same level as desmopressin, with a shorter half -life, increased selectivity, faster clearanc e and greater extra -renal clearance compared to desmopressin. Based on the low degree of unchanged renal excretion of FE 201836 , renal impairment is not expected to have any clinically relevant impact on the duration of the antidiuretic effect . An improved safety profile is expected to result from this combination of characteristics. The short half-life of FE 201836 (approximately 2 hours) and low degree of unchanged renal excretion (approximately 5%) are designed to limit the antidiuretic effect to the night -time sleep period, when subjec ts do not drink or their fluid intake is limited to a minimum (to satisfy thirst only). Therefore, the risk for dilutional hyponatraemia that may occur after the subjec t starts drinking in the morning is expected to be l ow. Subjects in the phase 1 clinical trial 000195 were dosed with up to 48 00 µg (i.e. , 9.6 times higher than the suggested maximum dose in the present phase 2 trial ) orally without any subject being hyponatr aemic. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD ) modelling suggests that the duration of antidiuretic effect at 500 µg will be approximately 6 hours, limiting the potential for daytime antidiuresis."

The trial will comprise 8 visits (Section 3.1.1 ) to the clinic and will consist of a 2 -week screening/lifestyle changes period where no IMP will be given, an enrichment period consisting of a 1-week single -blind (to subjects) active run -in period and a 1 -week washout period, and a 12-week double -blind randomised treatment period for each subject (Figure 3-1). During the active run-in period the trial subjects will receive 500 µg FE 201836 and placebo to assess safety and establish that subjects who respond to treatment with FE 201836 are included in the trial (i.e., an enrichment design). The 12 -week double -blind randomised treatment period of the trial will follow a response -adaptive Bayesian top -down design. Initially subjects will be randomised to: placebo, 500 µg FE 201836 or desmopressin (for benchmarking only). When approximately 125 subjects have been ran domised to the trial, an interim analysis will be conducted to investigate the efficacy of 500 µg FE 201836 . If 500 µg FE 201836 is not sufficiently efficacious compared to placebo the trial will be stopped for futility. If 500 µg FE 201836 is efficacious additional doses of FE 201836 (doses 50 -350 µg) will be opened up for randomisation of new subjects in order to identify the Minimum Effective Dose (MED) and near maximal Effective D ose (ED 85). The ED 85 is the lowest dose that achieves at least 85% of the effect of the maximum dose (500 µg). After the first interim analysis, subsequent interim analyses will take place every 8 weeks to reassess the randomisation allocation probabilities to 50 -500 µg FE 201836, based on observed responses at the respective in terim locks . For more information regarding the interim analyses, please refer to Section 3.3 and Section 9.11.2 . After the first interim analysis eligible subjects will be randomised to one of 8 treatment groups (Table 5-1). Each subject will be instructed to take the IMP every night at bedtime with the intention to sleep. In order to keep the treatment blinded each subject will receive two medications throughout the trial; an oral solution and an ODT , i.e., a double -dummy design will be applied because desmopressin is available in an ODT formulation and FE 201836 is an oral solution (Table 5-1). Subjects will be asked to follow lifestyle changes (e.g. , limiting fluid intake) througho ut the entire duration of the trial. In addition, subjects will be asked to complete e-Diary assessments (Section 7.1.1 ) and PRO questionnaires (Section 7.1.1.3 ) before and after randomisation (Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3). One objective of the present trial is to further validate the NI Diary. Therefore, a sample of subjects (from trial sites in the US A) who have completed the trial will be invited to participate in an exit interview within 14 days of attending the end -of-trial visit (Visit 8), to record the subjects’ perception of what constitutes a meaningful change in the NI Diary Total Score (Section 10.3.1 )."

Furthermore, the risk for subject s developing hypona traemia will be mitigated by a serum sodium monitoring plan (Section 7.1.3.1 ), including a 1-week active run -in to identify subjects at increased risk for developing acute hyponatraemia prior to randomisation . If the incidence of serum sodium levels <130 mmol/L is statistically significantly >10% during the active run -in, the Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC) established for the trial (Section 3.4) will be notified and further action will be discussed, e.g., the DMC may recommend that the highest dose of FE 201836 ma y be replaced by a lower dos e. The trial is designed so the dose may be lowered from 500 µg to 3 50 µg if recommended by the DMC, as described in Section 9.11.1 . 3.1.3 Trial Schedule The first trial visit ( Visit 1, screening) for the first subject is expected in Q 3 2017 and the last trial visit for the last subject is expected in Q3 2019. The total duration of the trial (for a subject) is expected to be approximately 1 8 weeks (includi ng the exit interview) .

Lifestyle changes (e.g., limiting fluid intake ) are recommended as an initial treatment in most clinical guidelines , e.g., the updated American Urology Association ( AUA ) guideline on the management of BPH (McVary, 2011), despite the relative paucity of supporting data ( Weiss, 2013). Excluding pel vic floor exercises for bladder -related Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms ( LUTS ), which are not part of the present trial, there seems to be no evidence that prolonged lifestyle changes, versus the proposed 2 weeks in the present trial, will result in additional benefit on NP related to excessive nocturnal fluid intake. From a practical point of view, the total of 4 weeks during the pre-randomisation period in the present trial is consider ed adequate for subjec t compliance. In order to select subjec ts with nocturia primarily due to the underlying condition of NP driven with increased Free Water Clearance (FWC), who will benefit the most from treatment with an antidiuretic agent, a 1 -week ac tive run -in period followed by a 1 -week washout period will be applied to ensure that drug -responders (defined as subjects with a reduction of nocturnal diuresis rate [mL/min] of 20% or more) are identified. The ≥20% decrease in the nocturnal diuresis rate has been established as a relevant marker of antidiurectic responsivenes in previous nocturia trials with an active run -in (Lose, 2003; Mattiasson, 2002 ). The NUV is defined as the total urin e volume from 5 minutes after bedtime with the intention to sleep until the first void within 30 minutes of rising in the morning. Total time in bed is a proxy for the time the subject is in nocturnal diuresis. The nocturnal diuresis rate is calculated fro m the mean of 3 days NUV and total time in bed: 𝑁𝑜𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑖𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑠 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 (𝑚𝐿/𝑚𝑖𝑛 )=NUV (mL) Total Time in Bed (min) The majority of fluid output occurs via the urine, approximately 1500 mL/day, therefore threre is no evidence in adult nocturia subjects that the relative change over the time in nocturnal diuresis rate ( mL/min normalised to time in bed ) should be adjusted for body weight and or/body surface area which are both assumed to be constant over a short period of 1 week only. An analysis of individual nocturia subject data found that reducing NUV and increasing the duration of antidiuretic action of a V 2-receptor agonist (desmopressin) was a significant predictor for subsequent decrease from baseline in the number of nocturn al voids (Yamaguchi, 2013 ). The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of NP can be driven by either increased FWC, which based on mode of action will be responsive to antidiuretic treatment, or by increased sodium clearanc e, which differs substantially in mode of action and is governed by Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) which is directly and indirectly influenced by the Renin -Angiotensin -Aldosterone System (RAAS). The aim of the active run -in is (after excluding all other medical causes of NP) to identify subjects with increased FWC , which is responsive to V 2-receptor agonism. In addition, safety will be assessed in this period with special emphasis on hyponatraemia."

Following randomisation at Visit 4, a double -blind design has been chosen to minimise both investigator and subject ascertainment bias. In order to keep the treatment blinded each subject will receive two medications throughout the trial; an oral solution and an ODT , i.e., a double -dummy design will be applied because desmopressin is available i n an ODT formulation and FE 201836 is an oral solution. The blinding is further described in S ection 5.5. Interim analyses will be conducted throu ghout the trial in order to investigate the efficacy of FE 201836 and to reassess the randomisation probabilities for each dose of FE 201836 based on observed responses at the respective interim locks. In addition, serum sodium will be monitored during the active run -in in order to identify subjects at increased risk of developing acute hyponatraemia. The interim analyses are further described in Section 3.3 and Section 9.11. 3.5.2 Selection of Endpoints The change in mean number of nocturnal voids has become a standard primary clinical trial endpoint in nocturia trials since the first overseas trials (with desmopressi n) in early 2000 (Lose, 2003; Mattiasson, 2002 ; van Kerrebroeck, 2007 ). It is therefore reasonable and appropriate to use reduction in number of nocturn al voids from baseline as the primary endpoint in this trial. Nocturia is one of the primary causes of sleep disturbance and has been shown to impair functioning, quality of life, health and productivity, with those experiencing 2 or more voids per night reporting significant bother ( Ancoli -Israel, 2011 ). Awakening during the first 3 -4 hours of the night during the deep and slow -wave restorative sleep is more likely to contribute to daytime fatigue ( Chartier -Kastler, 2006 ). The clinically relevant benefit (for the subject) of desmopressin treatment may be demonstrated further by measuring the time to first awakening to void ( FUSP ), which reduces the time spent in slow wave (deep) sleep ( Bliwise, 2015 ). Therefore it is reasonable to include FUSP as an endp oint in the present trial . To further evaluate the clinical benefit of FE 201836 endpoints relating to percentag e of nights with at most one nocturnal void or with complete response are included for analysis. The significant impact of nocturia and its treatment on subjects’ quality of life and daily lives will be documented by the use of a n e-Diary which contains a 3-day voiding diary, NI Diary and PRO questionnaires. Voiding diaries are standard tools use d within the urology area (Holm -Larsen, 2009) and are among the best possible means of obtaining objective data on subjective symptoms ( Abrams, 1983 ). A voiding diary therefore represents a self -monitoring daily record of the individual’s voiding behaviour. The ICS recommends inclusion of voiding diaries in clinical assessment of subjec ts with LUTS (Abrams, 2002). The subjects will be asked to complete voiding diaries over 3 consecutive 24 -hour periods just prior to scheduled visits throughout the trial. Three -day voiding diaries have been shown to be as effective as 7 -day diaries with the potential for better accuracy ( Dmochowski, 2005). The NI Diary, is a 12-item PRO measure assessing t he impact burden associated with nocturia (Holm -Larsen, 2014 ). The NI Diary has been developed and psychometrically evaluated in patients with nocturia, in line with published International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL)"

The PGI -S and PGI-I questionnaires , developed for use in populations with urinary tract conditions (Viktrup, 2012 ; Yalcin, 2003), are included to support anchor -based analysis of the NI Diary , as described in Section 10.3.1 . To further assess the change in subjective bothersomeness of nocturia, trial participants will be asked, “How much has this frequency of night -time urination bothered you?” with response options including “not at all,” “slightly,” “moderately,” “quite a bit,” and “extremely.” This 5 point Likert scale has previo usly been used i n a large epidemiological study (Hsu, 2015). The ISI is a PRO instrument to quantify the subject's perception of his/her insomnia severity, it is included as a measure of sleep quality. The ISI targets the subjec tive symptoms and consequences of insomnia as well as the degree of concern or distress caused by those difficulties ( Bastien, 2001 )."

All screening assessments must be completed and evaluated to confirm that all eligibility criteria are met by the subject . A site-specific Screening L og, for record ing of details of all subjects screened and confirmation of eligibility or record ing of reasons for s creening failure , as applicable , must be maintained at the trial site. The screening number , whic h will be allocated sequentially in the order in which the subjects are screened , must be entered into the Screening L og. It is permitted to re -screen a subject in this trial in case a subject has been considered a screening failure due to one or more of the following reasons: • not fulfilling the inclusion criterion number 6 as defined in Clinical Trial Protocol versions 2.0 (>250 mL) , 3.0 (>250 mL) , or 4.0 (≥250 mL) but had at least 1 single voided volume ≥200 mL prior to Visit 2 • not fulfilling the inclusion criterion of an NI Diary Total Score of ≥10 points (raw score) prior to Visit 2 (inclusion criterion number 8) as defined in Clinical Trial Protocol versions 2.0 and 3.0 • fulfilling the exclusion criterion of a serum triglyceride level >400 mg/dL (exclusion criterion number 12) as defined in Clinical Trial Protocol version 2.0 • fulfilling the exclusion criterion of aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase levels >2x the upper limit of normal range and a total bilirubin level >1.5 mg/dL (second part of exclusion criterion number 19) as defined in Clinical Trial Protocol version 2.0 • fulfilling exclusion criterion number 3 as defined in Clinical Trial Protocol version s 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 • fulfilling exclusion criterion number 5 as define d in Clinical Trial Protocol version s 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 • fulfilling exclusion criterion number 25 as defined in Clinical Trial Protocol version s 2.0, 3.0, and 4 .0 • technical issues with the e -Diary device prior to Visit 2 If a subject has failed screening du e to any other reason the subject must not be re -screened for participation in the trial at a later time."

The randomisation list will be adjusted during the course of the trial via a response - adaptive randomisation procedure. At least 50% of subjects should be randomised at trial sites in the USA to allow for an optimised validation of the NI Diary. Therefore, a cap of maximum 150 subjects will need to be set for countries other than the USA. Subject -specific randomisation number s will be allocated in the order at which the subject s are being rand omised into the trial. The subject randomisation number will be recorded in the Screening L og. It is not permitted for a subject to be randomised in the trial twice . The first 125 subject s will be randomised to treatment in a fixed manner. The allocation r atio is 2:2:1 for placebo, 500 µg FE 201836 and desmopressin. At the first interim analysis, after 125 subjects being randomised , the allocation ratio is 2:7:1 for placebo, active treatment and desmopressin, respectively. Subject s will be randomised to the active treatment groups of FE 201836 in a response -adaptive randomisation manner. A pre -defined algorithm will be used to determine the relative randomisation to each of the FE 201836 groups . Subsequent i nterim analyses will be conducted every 8 weeks to adjust the adaptive randomisation probabilities . The enrolment of subject s will continue without any stop at the interim analyses. For more information regarding the interim analyses, please refer t o Section 3.3 and Section 9.11. The screening rate will be monitored such that the a ccrual of randomised subjects does not overshoot the operating characteristics described in Section 9.1, which could potentially result in a loss of statistical power. 4.2.2.1 Randomisation i f Maxim um Dose is Lowered The trial has been designed with the option to decrease the maximum dose of FE 201836 from 500 µg to 350 µg if recommended by the DMC (Section 9.11.1 ). If this decision is made, randomisation to the 500 µg FE 201836 treatment group will be closed, the trial will continue with 350 µg FE 201836 as the highest dose for the active run -in and the highest dose of FE 201836 that any sub ject can be randomised to. In case subjects have already been randomised to the 500 µg FE 201836 treatment group and have not completed the trial , the DMC will recommend whether or not these subjects may be permitted to remain on treatment with 500 µg FE 201836 for the remainder of the trial. Subjects randomised to treatment with 500 µg FE 201836 who prematurely discontinue the trial due to DMC decision (Section 4.4) may be replaced by subject s randomised to treatment with a lower dose of FE 201836. If the decision to close randomisation to 500 µg FE 201836 is taken prior to the first interim analysis, i.e., when the first 125 subjects have been randomised, the remaining subjects will be randomised to the following treatment groups: placebo, desmopressin (25 µg for females and 50 µg for males) or 350 µg FE 201836. After the first interim analysis the do se-response adaptive randomisation will allocate sub jects to the remaining 7 open treatment groups : placebo, 50 µg FE 201836, 100 µg FE 201836, 150 µg FE 201836, 250 µg FE 201836, 350 µg FE 201836 , or desmopressin (25 µg fo r females and 50 µg for males)."

However, the i nvestigator should record the reason for the subject’s withdrawal, if possible. The investigator also has the right to withdraw a subject . Since an excessive rate of withdrawals can render the trial devoid of meaning, unnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided. Every effort should be made to invite subjects withdrawn/discontinued from the trial to an end -of- trial v isit (Visit 8) as so on as possible after a decision of withdrawal/ discontinuation has been taken. For any discontinuation, the investigator should obtain the required information and document the date and reason for the premature discontinuation in the eCRF. In case the subje ct has withdrawn consent, no new data can be recorded in the eCRF. Correction of previous data and/or recording data related to visits/procedures done prior to but made available after withdrawal of consent (e.g. , laboratory results) will be allowed unless the subject disapproves it. If the reason for withdrawal is an adverse event, the specific event or the main laboratory abnormality must be recorded in the eCRF.

The product should be kept in the original package to be protect ed from moisture and light. The product should be used immediately upon opening of the individual tablet blister. The investigator will ensure that the IMP is stored under appropriate conditio ns in a secure location with controlled access. The storage temperature shall be monitored regularly and documented in accordance with the instructions provided by the sponsor. Deviations in storage temperature must be reported to the sponsor as instructed in the IMP handling instruction. Returned IMP from the subjects (used/partly used o r unused , including empty packag ing material) must be stored separately from non -allocated IMP. The subjects will be instructed to store the IMP in accordance with the abov e-mentioned conditions. 5.5 Blinding/Unblinding 5.5.1 Blinding The IMP will be supplied by the sponsor in individually packed containers. The IMP for the randomised treatment period will be packaged according to a computer -generated randomisation list prepared for all trial sites. The randomisation list will not be available to any person involved in the conduct and evaluation of the trial until the trial database is declared clean and is released to the trial statistician. 5.5.2 Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment An emergency unblinding procedure will be available for the investigator a nd designated personnel at the s ponsor through the eCRF . It is the investigator’s responsibility to decide whether it is medically necessary to know which IMP the subject receives (i.e., unblinding) to ensure the subject’s welfare and safety. Breaking of the blind for individual subjects in emergency situations is only permitted in case of a S uspected Unexpected Serious Adverse R eaction (SUSAR) , or in case of an adverse event where the knowledge of the IMP administered is required for medical management of the subject. As far as the emergency permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed by the investigator and the sponsor. The investigator who unblinds a treatment will use the eCRF and is required to enter a password and must record the reason for unblinding before the treatment code can be broken. It must also be recorded in the eCRF when , and by whom , the code was broken. The investigator must record the event of unblinding i n the subject’s medical record , including the r eason for unblinding.

The voiding diary should be completed over 3 consecutive 24 -hour periods just prior to Visit 4. After randomisation (Visit 4) each subject has to complete four 3-day voiding diaries prior to the scheduled trial visits. Nocturnal voids are defined as the voids occurring from 5 minute s after bedtime, with the intention to sleep at night, until rising in the morning. The first morning void will not be counted as a nocturnal void even though its volume is included as part of the NUV . The time to first void is defined as the time from bed time with the intention to sleep until first nocturnal void. The s ponsor will provide the subjects with cups for measuring the urine volume. Prior to each visit the subjects will receive reminders to complete the e -Diary. 7.1.1.2 Nocturia Impact Diary Nocturia has wide -ranging implications for patients’ quality of life, mainly through persistent, repeated sleep interruptions. Valid patient self -reported assessments of disease burden and benefit of therapy are essential to evaluate the full clinical value of treatment for the patient. The NI Diary is a validated, nocturia -specific tool available in multiple languages and consists of a 12-item questionnaire with 11 core items (Q1 -Q11) and an ove rall QoL impact question (Q12) (Holm -Larsen, 2014 ). It is used in conjunction with a v oiding diary to capture patient reported consequences of nocturia and its treatment. It has a recall period of one night and day. Responses are scored from 0 to 4 (lowest to highest impact). For Question 12, response options range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (a great deal). The NI Diary total scores are calculated by summing the 11 core items . The NI Diary total and overall impact scores are standardised from 0 to 100 (lowest to highest impact). The NI Diary will be included in t he e-Diary (Section 7.1.1 ), which will be completed by the subjects at home, for the 3 conse cutive days just prior to scheduled visit s as outlined in Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3. The NI D iary should be completed in the evening and before completing the PGI-S and PGI -I questionnaires . One objective of this trial is to further validate the NI Diary, as well as to establish what constitutes a meaningful change in the NI Diary Total Score. Thus, the disease -specific NI Diary will be further tested and validated in connection with this trial. This will be done through pshychometric validation, as described in Section 10.3.1.1 , and through exit interviews, as described in Section 10.3.1.2 ."

They should be completed in the following order : • At home in the evening (after completion of the NI Diary) : o Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) o Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI -I) • At the trial site: o Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) o Bother ( Hsu 5-point Likert Bother Scale) The two PRO questionnaires that will be completed at the trial site (ISI and Hsu 5 -point Likert Bother Scale) are recommended to be completed before any other assessments are performed, by the subject in a quiet place without influence from the trial personnel or accompanying family or friends. It is not permitted to help the subject cho ose an answer or interpret or rephrase questions which the subject do es not understand. The subjects should be informed that there are no right or wrong answers and that all of the subjects’ responses will remain confidential. 7.1.1.3.1 Patient Global Impression of Severity and Patient Global Impression of Disease Improvement Patient Global Impression of Disease scales are commonly used measures of symptom severity, treatment response and the efficacy of treatments ( Yalcin, 2003). The P GI-I and PGI -S will be included in the trial to indicate change or stability in global health status for anchor -based analyses to identify thresholds for clinically important change s in, e.g., NI Diary scores and number of nocturnal voids, as described in a separate Psychometric Analysis Plan (PAP) . Moreover, b oth scales will be analysed for treatment effect , as described in Section 9.7.3 . To better reflect the current condition, the revised and patient -tested versions of PGI -I and PGI -S will refer to ‘night - time voiding’, as compared to ‘LUTS’ ( Viktrup, 2012 ). The PGI -S is a prospective measure that measures a patient’ s current severity reported as “None,” “Mild,” “Moderate,” or “Severe” ( coded as 1 -4). Scores on this measure will provide a patient -rated summary of the severity of the patient’s nocturia symptoms . The PGI -I is a retrospective measure. It will provide a p atient -rated summary of change in nocturia since the start of trial treatment , reported as “Very much better,” “Much better,” “A little better,” “No change,” “A little worse,” “Much worse,” or “Very much worse,” (coded as 1 -7). PGI-S followed by PGI-I will be completed by the subjects at home in the evening immediately after completing the NI Diary , as outlined in Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3. 7.1.1.3.2 Insomnia Severity Index Chronic disruptions of sleep will have consequences for daytime performance and well -being. Nocturia patients often report excessive daytime sleepiness, with some experiencing more severe symptoms, including increased rates of mood disorders and decrease of physical health. Fatigue is a"

Sleepin ess has also been linked to increased risks for accidents, such as falling asleep while driving or work -related accidents ( Asplund, 2005 ; Ancoli -Israel, 2011 ). Nocturia is characteris ed by shortening the FUSP . The first sleep period is of high importance due to that deepest stages of sleep (most restorative sleep) typically occur within the first few hours of the sleeping and once these stages are interrupted by wakening (e.g. , to void ) patients are not able to make up for this during the rest of the night ( Bliwise, 2015 ). FUSP will be a secondary endpoint in the trial. Sleep quality will be measure d through the ISI, which is an instrument to quantify the subject's perception of his/her insomnia severity. The ISI targets the subjective symptoms and consequences of insomnia as well as the degree of concern or distress caused by those difficulties ( Bastien, 2001 ). The ISI comp rises of four `sleep -related' items and three `wake -related' items assessing the severity of sleep -onset and sleep maintenance difficulties (both nocturnal and early morning awakenings), satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily func tioning, noticeability of impairment attributed to the sleep problem and degree of distress or concern caused by the sleep problem. Each item is rated on a 0 -4 scale and the total score ranges from 0 to 28. A higher score suggests more severe insomnia. The self -administered ISI questionnaire will be completed at the trial site by the subj ect before active run -in period (Visit 2), at the randomisation visit (Visit 4), after 4 weeks (Visit 6), after 8 weeks (Visit 7) and at the last trial visit after 12 we eks of treatment (Visit 8) as illustrated in Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3. Since the ISI has a two -week recall, a reminder to think back two weeks will appear on the screen upon start of completion , in order to improve on quality of the information captured . The ISI will be completed at Visit 2 in order to compare insomnia severity to other diseases presenting with insomnia, as recorded by the ISI. The ISI completed at the remaining visits (Visits 4, 6, 7 and 8) will be used to measure treatment effect. 7.1.1.3.3 Bother Patient bother is a broad concept covering as pects such as impact on sleep, daily life, social life, mental health, fatigue, etc. ( Tikkinen, 2010 ). It has been shown that most nocturia patients are not very bothered by one nightly void, but that there is clearly a bot her threshold at two voids or more. Moreover, comparing two adjacent voiding categories at a time, the increase was statistically significant with each increment in number of nightly voids. To further assess the change in subjective bothersomeness of noctu ria, trial participants will be asked, “How much has this frequency of night -time urination bothered you?” with response options including “not at all,” “slightly,” “moderately,” “quite a bit,” and “extremely.” This 5 -point Likert scale has previously been used in a large epidemiological study (Hsu, 2015). The Hsu 5-point Likert Bother Scale will be completed by the subject at the trial site at randomisation (Visit 4), after 1 week (Visit 5), after 4 weeks (Visit 6), after 8 weeks (Visit 7) and at the last trial visit after 1 2 weeks of treatment (Visit 8), as illustrated in Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3."

Blood samples for analysis of serum sodium will be collected , preferably in the morning, at Visits 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8, as presented in Table 6-1. The risk for subjects developing hyponatraemia during the trial period will be mitigated as follows (serum monitoring plan) : Screening (Visit 1) All subjects must have normal serum sodium (≥13 5 mmol/L) at screening (Visit 1). If the serum sodium value is <135 mmol/ L (re-tested and confirmed , with results available within 7 days) the subject must be discontinued from the trial as a ‘screening failure’. Active Run -in Period During the 1 -week active run -in period, 4 days (±1 day) after the planned start of IMP treatment, the subject will be telephoned to follow -up on safety . Visit 3 At Visit 3 (after the active run -in), if the serum sodium value is <130 mmol/L the investigator must immediately contact the subject and schedule visits for further evaluation. If the serum sodium value is <130 mmol/L (re-tested and confirmed , with results available within 7 days) the sub ject will not be randomised to the trial and must be discontinued from the trial as a ‘ screening failure’. The subject will be followed (by the investigator) for safety until the serum sodium level is stable and not clinically significant, preferably until at least ≥135 mmol/L. If the subject cannot attend Visit 3 as planned, arrangements must be made to test the serum sodium level at Day 6 -8 from the IMP start date to ensure the serum sodium level is measured while the subject is taking IMP . 12-week Random ised Treatment Period During the 12 weeks randomised treatment period, any unexpected low serum sodium value (<135 mmol/L or a drop in serum sodium level >10 mmol/L) must be re -tested with at least 2 additional consecutive tests to identify the nadir and d uration of the hyponatraemic episode. The serum sodium level should be re -tested within 5 (±2 days) since the previous test. The subject will be followed (by the investigator) for safety until the serum sodium level is stable and not clinically significant , preferably until at least ≥135 mmol/L."

All cases of serum sodium values ≤125 mmol/L will be reported a s Serious Adverse Event (SAEs ) (Section 8.5). The subject will be followed (by the investigator) for safety until the serum sodium level is stable and not clinically significant, preferably until at least ≥135 mmol/L. Acute Intercurrent Illness In case of acute intercurrent illnesses characterised by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (s uch as systemic infections, fever, gastroenteritis), the treatment with IMP should be interrupted until the subject has fully recovered. The treatment can be re -started at the discretion of the investigator once the condition of the subject is stabilised. In addition, subjects may be called in for additional unscheduled visits due to safety reason, as described in Section 6.8. Additional Serum Sodiu m Testing Events that will trigger additional serum sodium testing include, but are not limited to, the following: • If more than 21 days elapse from the serum sodium measurement at Visit 1 and the visit date of Visit 2, the serum sodium measurement must be re-tested, with results available prior to Visit 2. • A subject is presenting with signs or symptoms of hyponatraemia (e.g., headache, dizziness) • A subject has gained more than 2 kilograms in body weight between visits (Section 7.2.4 ) • If concomitant treatment with therapy that may induce hyponatraemia (Section 4.3.1 ) is initiated or dosing of an existing therapy is increased during the trial, additional serum sodium monitoring should be performed in the first week (4 -8 days) after initiation and again wi th follow -up as judged by the investigator, at least at 4 weeks . 7.1.3.2 von Willebrand Factor and Factor VIII Blood samples for assessment of coagulation factors will be collected at Visits 1, 4, 6 and 8 . The concentration s of the coagulation factors von Willebra nd Facto r (vWF) and Factor VIII (FVIII) were assessed in the phase 1 clinical trial , 000195 , after both oral and intravenous administration of FE 201836. The results indicated that both v WF and F VIII were increased at high plasma concentration s of FE 201836. vWF started to increase at a plasma concentration of ap proximately 150 pg/mL FE 201836 and FVIII at a plasma concentration of approximately 200 pg/mL . Such high plasma concentrations are unlikely to be reached in the urological doses proposed for t he present trial, however, vWF and FVIII will be measured as a safety precaution, and to ensure that these coagulation factors are not released in clinically significant amounts."

The biomarker copeptin can be easily tested for , and is therefore used as an AVP surrogate to potentially identify low nocturnal vasopressin levels in plasma . In patients with NP, an inverse circadian rhythm of vasopressin is suspected , resulting in low nocturnal concentrations, which may be the root cause of NP. Copeptin may be a useful biomarker to diagnose NP due to low levels of endogenous AVP , thereby identifying the ideal candidate for antidiuretic therapy (Brunell, 2016) and consequently treatment with FE 201836. 7.1.4 Vital Signs Diastolic and systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) and heart rate (beats per minute) will be measured after resting for 5 minutes in a sitting position , according to usual clinical practice at all trial visits . Measurements outside normal ranges will be assessed by the investigator as ‘abnormal, not clinically significant’ or ‘abnormal, clinically signific ant’. Any abnormal, clinically significant changes should be reported as adverse events. 7.1.5 24-Hour Urine Volume and Nocturnal Urine Volume Data on 24 -hour urine volume, i.e., including NUV, will be obtained from the 3 -day voiding diary (Section 7.1.1.1 ) completed prior to Visits 2, 4, 5 and 8. In addition, NUV data will be obtained from the 3 -day voiding diary completed prior to Visit 3 (Table 7-1). 7.2 Other Assessments 7.2.1 Demographics Demographic data , including date of birth and race , will be collected at screening (Visit 1). 7.2.2 Medical History Information on clinically significant previous a nd concomitant illnesses, signs or findings from assessments and examinations during the screening, including surgical history, will be recorded as medical history at the screening visit (Visit 1). 7.2.3 Concomitant Medication Information on concomitant medicati ons will be collected at each visit throughout the trial , as described in Section 4.3.1 . Concomitant medications are defined as any medication , other than the IMP, taken by the subject at entry and during the trial. Prohibited medications/therapies are listed in Section 4.3.2 . 7.2.4 Body Weight and Height Body weight and height will be measured to calculate the body mass index (BMI). The eCRF will be configured to automatically calculate the BMI . Height (without shoes) will be measured at screening (Visit 1)."

The same scale should preferably be used on the subject during the course of the trial for consisten cy in readings. If the subject has gained more than 2 kilograms between trial visits , the serum sodium level must be measured , as described in Section 7.1.3.1 . 7.2.5 Physical Examination Physical examinations will be performed at Visits 1, 4 and 8 by the investigator or a delegated sub-investigator (MD, Medical Doctor; DO, Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine; PA, Physician Assistant; NP, Nurse Practitioner) and must not be delegated to any other trial site personnel. The same individual should preferably perform the physical examinations for a subject for consistency in evaluation. A complete physical examina tion will include , at a minimum, assessments of the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urological and neurological systems . Any abnormal, clinically significant changes should be reported as adverse events. 7.2.6 Pregnancy Test A serum pregnanc y test will be performed in all pre - and peri -menopausal female subjects at screening ( Visit 1), Visit 4 and at the end -of-trial visit (Visit 8). A urine pregnancy test will also be performed at screening (Visit 1). Female s ubjects of childbearing potential must have documentation of an acceptable effective method of contraception , as described in Section 4.3.4 . Amenorrhea of >12 months duration based on the reported date of the last menstrual period is sufficient documentation of post -menopausal status and does not require a pregnancy test. 7.2.7 Electrocardiogram A 12 -lead ECG will be performed by the investigator or appropriate design ee at the screening visit (Visit 1) and at the end -of-trial visit (Visit 8). The ECG should be taken after resting for 5 minutes. The ECG print -out should be reviewed, signed and dated by the investigator. Any abnormal, clinically significant changes shoul d be reported as adverse events. 7.3 Handling of Biological Samples A trial -specific laboratory manual will be provided to the participating sites, describing in detail how to handle, store and transport the biological samples in this trial. All biological sam ples will be analysed at central laboratories and will be destroyed after the results are available . For all biological samples collected in the trial, analyses beyond those described in the protocol can only be performed after obtaining the required appro vals. The processes related to handling biological samples will be described in the informed consent docu ments and data protection legislation including local legislation will be adhered to. In addition to the central laboratory, a local laboratory may be used for analysis of serum sodium if a quick turn -around time of the result is needed (Section 7.1.3.1 )."

It includes: • Any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the IMP, whether or not considered to be caused by the IMP. • Adverse events commonly observed and adverse events anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the IMP. • Any laboratory abnormality, vita l sign or finding from physical examination assessed as clinically significant by the i nvestigator (note: pre-existing conditions diagnosed through assessments and examinations at the screening visit or during the screening period are not adverse events, but are recorded as medical history ). • Accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or dose), reasons for any medical, nursing or pharmacy consultation, or reasons for admission to hospital or surgical procedures. • Overdoses and medication errors with and without clinical consequences. 8.2 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events 8.2.1 Collec tion of Adverse Events The investigator must monitor the condition of the subject throughout the trial from the time of obtaining informed consent until the last visit. The sources of adverse events cover : • The subject’s response to questions about his/her health (a standard non -leading question such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” is asked at each visit). • Symptoms spontaneously reported by the subject. • Investigations and examinations where the findings are assessed by the investigator to be clinically significant changes or abnormalities. • Other information relating to the subject’s health becoming known to the investigator (e.g. , hospitalisation). 8.2.2 Recording of Adverse Events The investigator must record all adverse events in the Adverse Event Log provide d in each subject’s eCRF with information about: • Adverse event • Date and time of onset (time can be omitted, if applicable) • Intensity • Causal relationship to IMP"

Each of the items in the Adverse Event Log is described in detail in the following sections. Adverse Event Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and symptoms should be recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record. If a subject suffers from the same adverse event more than once and the subject recovers in between the events, the adverse events should be re corded separately. If an adverse event changes i n intensity, a worst -case approach should be used when re cording the event, i.e. the highest intensity and the longest duration of the event.a Note the following: A procedure is not an adverse event; the reason for conducting the procedure is. Hospitalisat ion is not an adverse event; the reason for hospitalisation is. Death is not an adverse event, but the cause of death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown cause, which is an adverse event). Date and Time of Onset The date of onset is the date when t he first sign(s) or symptom(s) were first noted . If the adverse event is an abnormal clinically significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination , the onset date is the date the sample was taken or the examination was performed . Intensity The intensity of an adverse event must be classified using the following 3-point scale: Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity. Moderate: Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing). Severe: Inability to work or pe rform usual activiti es (unacceptable). a Exception: if an adverse event with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e., a pre -treatment adverse event) worsens in intensity, this must be recorded as two separate events. The initial adverse event should be recorded with outcome “not recovered ” and the date and time of outcome is when the intensity changed. The second adverse event should be recorded with date and time of onset when the intensity changed."

The ADR may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the IMP or may be unpredictable in its occurrence. No reasonable possibility: There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a c ausal relationship between the IMP and the adverse event. Action Taken to IMP The action taken to the IMP in response to an adverse event must be classified as one of the following: • No change (medication schedule maintained or no action taken) • Withdrawn • Interrupted Other Action Taken Adverse events requiring therapy must be treated with recognised standards of medical care to protect the health and well -being of the subject. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation. If medication is administered to treat the adverse event, this medication should be entered in the Concomitant Medication Log . Date and Time of Outcome The date and time the subject recovered or died. Outcome The outcome of an adverse event must be classified as one of the following: • Recovered (fully recovered or the condition has returned to the level observed at initiation of trial treatment) • Recovered with sequelae (resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity) • Recover ing (the event is improving) • Not recovered • Fatal"

Serum sodium levels should be tested in subjects presenting with signs or symptoms of hyponatraemia . Any significant changes in serum sodium, judged by the investigator as clinically significant must be reported as adverse events , as described in Section 8.2. All cases of serum sodium values ≤125 mmol/L are considered important medical events and must be reported as SAEs , as described in Section 8.5.2 . 8.4 Pregnancy and Pregnancy Outcome If a pregnancy occurs, the IMP should be immediately stopped for the pregnant subject and Global Pharmacovigilance at Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S must be informed. The pregnancy should be reported via the pregnancy Report Form included in the eCRF system. In case the eCRF cannot be accessed and hence the Pregnancy Report Form cannot be fill ed in within the eCRF system, a paper Pregnancy Report Form available in the investigator’s file should be used and sent to Ferring Global Pharmacovigilance. Contact details to Ferring Global Pharmacovigilance are provided in Section 8.5.2 . A pregnant participant or the partner of a male participant should be followed until termination or until term to ensure absence of congenital anomaly or birth de fect that may have resulted from maternal exposure or transmission of the study drug via semen following paternal exposure. The pregnancy should be followed -up at least until the birth of the infant and 4 -6 weeks after the birth of the infant. In general, the follow -up will include the course; duration and the outcome of the pregna ncy as well as neonatal health. If a pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome (birth defect/congenital anomaly) this must be reported as a n SAE to Global Pharmacovigilance at Ferr ing Pharmaceuticals A/S."

The death of a subject enrolled in a trial is per se not an event, but an outcome. is life-threatening The term life -threatening refers to an adverse event in which the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which may have caused death if it were more severe. requires in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation The term hosp italisation means that the subject was admitted to hospital or that existing hospitalisation was extended as a result of an event. Hospitalisation describes a period of at least 24 hours. Over -night stay for observation, stay at emergency room or treatment on an out -patient basis do not constitute a hospitalisation. However, medical judgement must always be exercised and when in doubt the case should be considered serious (i.e., if case fulfils the criterion for a medically important event). Hospitalisation s for administrative or social purposes do not constitute an SAE. Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before trial inclusion are not considered adverse events, if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the tria l, provided that the condition did not deteriorate during the trial. results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity Disability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.

Examples of imp ortan t medical events include adverse event s that suggest a significant hazard, contraindication or precaution, occurrence of malignancy or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether ev ents qualify as medically important . Important medical events include any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product. Any organism virus or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalop athy), pathogenic or non - pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a subject exposed to a medicinal product."

If nothing else is stated the Bayesian dose -response analyses are conducted with respect to the time - averaged treatment effect. The posterior means estimates, 95% credib ility interval of the estimates and posterior probabilities of quantities of interest will be reported. Frequentist inferences will rely on the appropriate choice of model and report p-values corresponding to the statistical test of the hypothesis of “equal effect” against the alternative of “different effect”. The level of significance is set at 5% (two -sided). Treatment comparison refers to the pair -wise comparison between active doses and placebo. There are no planned adjustments for multiplicity when pair -wise testing any active dose of FE 201836 versus placebo. Desmopressin is included as a benchmark treatment only. None of the primary, secondary or explorative an alyses will include desmopressin . Explorative benchmarking analyses are furher described in Section 9.8. 9.7.2 Primary Analysi s The o bjectives of the primary analysi s are to establish Proof -of-Concept of FE 201836 and to estimate the dose -response profile of FE 201836. The dose -response is the averag e reduction from baseline in nocturnal voids during the randomised period . Proof -of-concept will be evaluated by the posterior probability that FE 201836 has superior efficacy as compared to placebo. Similarly, interim analysis futility criteria will be ev aluated by pre -defined quantities of interest. This section provides a brief background on the statistical Bayesian model that is utili sed. 9.7.2.1 Statistical Dose -Response Model Let 𝑥𝑡,𝑖 denote the observed cross -sectional change from baseline in nocturnal voids (averaged across three consecutive nights) and let 𝑦𝑡,𝑖 denote the time -averaged change from baseline for subject 𝑖 up to time 𝑡: 𝑦𝑡,𝑖=∑ 𝑥𝑘,𝑖 𝑡 𝑘=1 𝑡, 𝑡=1,2,3,4, where 𝑡 denotes the nominal post -baseline time -point reflecting data observed at Weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12 (Visits 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively). The final endpoint, 𝑦4,𝑖, is modelled as being an observation of 𝑌4,𝑖~𝑁(𝜇𝑑,𝑖,𝜎2) where the dose -response at dose 𝑑 for subject 𝑖 is adjusted for the number of baseline voids ( 𝑥0,𝑖) and assumed to follow a sigmoidal model: 𝜇𝑑,𝑖=𝛽𝑥0,𝑖+𝛼1+(𝛼2−𝛼1)𝑑𝛼4 𝑑𝛼4+𝛼3𝑎4=𝛽𝑥0,𝑖+𝜇𝑑,"

The interpretation of the parameters are: 𝛼1 is the placebo response; 𝛼2 is the maximum response; 𝛼3 is the dose (ED 50) at which 50% of the maximum effect is obtained; 𝛼4 is the slope parameter. The longitudinal aspect of the average change from baseline is captured by the following model : 𝑌𝑡,𝑖~𝑁(𝑒𝛾𝑡(𝜇𝑑,𝑖+𝛿𝑖),𝜆𝑡2), where the per -subject offset from the mean dose -response is 𝛿𝑖~𝑁(0,𝜏2) and 𝜆𝑡2 represents the within subject variance . The model is constrained such that 𝛼4=0 and the intermediate values of 𝑦. can thus be thought of as being fractions of final value. Missing data (missing due to drop -out or final visit has not occurred yet) will be imputed using the longitudinal model, assuming missing at random. This implies that als o data from subjects who have not yet been observed at Week 12 are used in the primary efficacy analysis, as described in Appendix 2 . All parameters i n the models are given sufficiently non -informative prior distributions as specified in Appendix 2 . By application of Bayes’ theorem and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques the posterior probabilities (or the quantities of interest) given in Table 9-2 can be estimated.

Prior distributions for primary analysis are specified in Appendix 2 , while prior distributions for secondary analyses will be specified in the SAP. The dose -response model for the 50% responder rates will also be further detailed in the SAP. • Continuous treatment effect s at a certain visit will be analysed using SAS PROC MIXED assuming a repeated measures ANCOVA. (A non -parametric dose -response curve is assumed.) The changes from baseline per visit will be regressed upon the baseline observation as covariate and treatment, vi sit and treatment -by-visit interaction as factors. An unstructured covariance structure will be used for the random subject effect. Least square mean estimates of the changes from baseline and the treatment contrasts (with associated 95% confidence interva ls) versus placebo will be tabulated and the changes from baseline will be graphically illustrated. Should only one post -baseline visit be obtained for an endpoint , an ANCOVA will be performed without the visit and treatment -by-visit interaction terms . • Correlation between endpoints will be reported using Pearson correlation coefficients and partial correlation where applicable. • Binary endpoints such as “responder status ” at a certain visit will be analysed using SAS PROC GENMOD with the logit as link functi on for the responder probability. An unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed for the repeated responder status which will be adjusted for baseline value as covariate and treatment, visit and treatment -by-visit interaction as factors. (Associated wit h e.g. , responder analysis in terms of reduction in number of voids, cumulative distritubtion function plots of percentage change from baseline by treatment may be produced.) Table 9-4 presents the planned analys es. Illustration of the therapeutic window is described separately in Section 9.7.3.1 and safety related endpoints are further described in Section 9.10. Explorati ve gender analyses are planned for all endpoints . For these the following are noted: • Estimates of the gender specific dose -response during 12 weeks of treatment will follow the analysis described in Section 9.7.2.3 by conducting separate analysis for each gender. Possible differences between the gender specific models will be investigated. • Regression models will include gender and gender -by-treatment as factors.

The second kind concerns the pre -planned efficacy analyse s upon which the trial may be stopp ed due to fu tility, or alloc ation probabilities to FE201836 doses may be adjusted based on estimated dose -response curve , as described in Section 9.11.2 . 9.11.1 Serum Sodium Monitoring during the Active Run -In Period The risk of subjec ts developing hyponatraemia will be mitigated by a serum sodium monitoring plan (Section 7.1.3.1 ), including a 1 -week active run -in period to identify subjects at increased risk for developing acute hyponatraemia prior to randomisation. If the incidence of serum sodium levels <130 mmol/L is statistically significantly >10% during the active run -in, the DMC (Section 3.4) will be notified and further action will be discussed, e.g., the DMC may recommend that the highest dose of FE 201836 ma y be replaced by a lower dose. The number of cases of serum sodium lev els <130 mmol/L resulting in an estimated rate that is statistically significantly >10% depends on the number of subjects who have completed the active run-in, examples are presented in Table 9-7. Table 9-7 Examples of Incidence Rates that are Statistically Significantly >10% Number of S ubjects who have C ompleted 1 -week Active -run in Number of Cases Observed with Serum Sodium levels <130 mmol/L E stimate of Incidence Rate Lower Limit of 95% Confidence Interval 10 4 40% 12.2% 20 6 30% 11.9% 50 10 20% 10.0% 100 17 17% 10.2% 200 30 15% 10.4% Thus, t he present trial has been designed with the option to decrease the maximal dose of FE 201836 from 500 µg to 350 µg if recommended by the DMC. If this decision is made, randomisation to the 500 µg FE 201836 treatment group will be closed, the trial will continue with 350 µg FE 201836 as the highest dose fo r the active run -in and the highest dose of FE 201836 that any subject can be randomised to. In the case where subjects have already been randomised to 500 µg FE 201836 and have not completed the trial the DMC will recommend whether or not, these subjects may be permitted to remain on 500 µg FE 201836 treatment for the remainder of the trial. If the decision to close randomisation to 500 µg FE 201836 occurs p rior to the first interim analysis (when the first 125 subjects are randomised) the remaining subjec ts will be randomised to the following treatment groups: placebo, desmopressin (25 µg for females and 50 µg for males) or 350 µg FE 201836. After the interim analysis subjects may be randomised to one of 7 treatment groups: placebo, 50 µg FE 201836, 100 µg FE 201836, 150 µg FE 201836, 250 µg FE 201836, 350 µg FE 201836, or desmopressin (25 µg for females and 50 µg for males)."

That is, the MED and ED 85 doses and the inferences with regards to proof -of-concept and futility will be limited to the dose range (i.e., with a maximum dose of 350 µg FE 201836). 9.11.2 Interim Efficacy Analyses The planned interim analys es will be conducted by an internal DMC (Section 3.4) according to a separate DMC charte r, which will be established before the first interim analysis . The interim analyses will use unblinded efficacy data to infer whet her to stop early for futility or to continue the trial as planned . At the first interim analysis the trial may be stopped due to futility if there is a low probability (less than 10%) that 500 µg FE 201836 is at least 0.3 voids more efficacious than placebo: Pr(𝜇𝑀𝐴𝑋 −𝜇𝑃𝑙𝑏<−0.3)<10% . Up to the first interim analysi s (conducted when 125 subject s have been randomised ) the allocation ratio is 2:2:1 for placebo, 500 µg FE 201836 and desmopressin. Should the trial continue, the allocation ratios will be changed to 2:7:1 , where all doses of FE 201836 ( 50-500 µg ) are opene d for response -adaptive allocation. The randomisation probabilities for each dose of FE 201836 will be proportional to the average of I(dose is MED) and I(dose is ED 85), where I(target) is the square root of the probability that “dose is target” scaled by the standard error at that dose. The remaining interim analyses are planned to occur every 8 weeks as depicted in the decision tree (Figure 9-2).

Source data ar e contained in source documents (original records or certified copies). Source Documents - ICH Definition Source documents are defi ned as original documents, data and records (e.g. , hospital records, clinical and office charts, labora tory notes, memoranda, subject diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic med ia, x-rays, subject files and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial). Trial -specific Source Data Requirements - The Sponsor No specific protocol data can be recorded directly in the e -CRF without a prior written or electronic record. The data entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The e -Diary data is part of a process where the subject uses the e -Diary to transmit data to the service provider’s database, hence the service provide r’s database is considered to be the source data. The investigator may need to request previous medic al records or transfer records, current me dical records must also be available. For each subject e nrolled, the investigator must document in the subject’s medical record, that the subject participate s in this trial and at least the following information must be recorded : • Documentation of signed a nd dated informed consent • Subject’s name and date of birth • Confirmation of participation in the trial (trial identification, screening/randomisation [subject] number) • Eligibility of participation in the trial (inclusion/exclusion) • Relevant medical history • Nocturia medical history or subject -reported nocturia symptoms • Visit Dates • Results of any examinations/tests and assessment performed • Details of any concomitant medication/therapy"

The system is validated and access at all levels to the system is granted/revoked following sponsor and vendor procedures, in accordance with regulatory and system requirements. Trial data should be entered into the eCRF in a t imely manner preferably within 3 working days after the subject visit. The investigator will approve/authorise the eCRF entries for each subject with an electronic signature which is equivalen t to a handwritten signature. The eCRF system and the database will be hosted at . After the trial database is declared clean and released to the statistician, a final copy of the database will be stored at the sponsor . The investigator will also receive a copy of the trial site’s final and locked data (including audit trail, electronic signature and queries) as write -protected PDF -files produced by . The PDF -files will be stored electronically and will be provided by to the investigator before access to the eCRF is revoked. Entry errors occurring in the eCRF will be corrected electronically. Such corrections/modifications will be automatically tracked by an audit trail detailing the date and time of the correction, t he name of the person making the correction and the reason for the correction . 10.3 Use of Patient Reported Outcome s The PRO questionnaires to be used in the trial are described in Section 7.1.1.3 ."

For PROs completed at home, subjects will be reminded in due time. The 3-day e-Diary, including the PROs will be reviewed for completeness (via the web -portal) by the trial site personnel throughout the trial ( Section 6). In case of missing ISI and Bother assessments, the reason (s) should be recorded by the trial personnel in the eCRF , e.g., subject refusal, lack of time from subject or functional li mitation from subject to complete the questionnaire. Handling of missing assessments and missing data will be detailed in the SAP. 10.3.1 Validation of the Nocturia Impact Diary 10.3.1.1 Psychometric V alidation In connection with this trial, the NI Diary will be further tested and validated through anchor -based analyses including the PRO questionnaires PGI -I and PGI-S (Section 7.1.1.3.1 ) and subjects ’ perception o f change in NI Diary Total Score as captured in exit interviews (Section 10.3.1.2 ). Details of these analyses are described in a separate PAP . The order of these three e-Diary assessments , all completed at home, should therefore be NI Diary first, PGI -S second and PGI -I last, as described in Section 7.1.1.3 . 10.3.1.2 Validation through Exit Interviews A sample of subjects (from trial sites in the US A) who have completed the trial will be invited to participate in a n exit interview within 14 days of attending the end -of-trial visit (Visit 8). Signed informed consent must have been obtained through the ICF for the trial, as appropriate, before participation in the exit interview. The exact size of the sample will depend on when saturation has been reached. The subjects included will be proportionate to t he clinical trial sample distribution with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics. The investigator at the trial site will be asked to complete a Case Report Form that includes specific requirements for recruiting subjects to ensure the correc t mix of subjects. The exit interview is designed to examine the impact of living with nocturia and to assess what a meaningful positive change would be from the subject’s perspective in terms of this impact . In the exit interviews, subject s’ ratings and perceptions of changes will be collected using qualitative and quantitative methods. These data will be used to aid in understanding what is, from a subject’s perspective , a meaningful change threshold for indicating positive improvement in the impact of nocturia on a subject’s lif e, as measured by the NI Diary. A detailed description of the exit interview is provided in the Exit Interview Protocol, en closed in Appendix 1 .

The investigator will permit the monitor direct access to all source data, including electronic medical records and/or documents in order to facilitate data verification. The investigator will co - operate with the monitor to ensure that any discrepancies that may be identified are resolved. The investigator is expected to be able to meet the monitor during these visits. Risk based monitoring will be applied for this trial. The frequency of the on -site monitoring visits will be adapted depending on the risk level of the site and workload. Site ris k is based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the quantity of data generated, quality of the source documents, unreported adverse events or SAEs and number of protocol deviations. The risk -based monitoring and adaptive monitoring strategy, source data verification process and definition of key variables to be monitored will be described in detail in the Monitoring Plan for the trial. 11.2 Audit and Inspection The investigator will make all the trial -related source data and records available at a ny time to quality assurance auditor(s) mandated by the sponsor , or to domestic/foreign regulatory inspectors or representatives from IECs/IRBs /REBs who may audit/inspect the trial. The main purposes of an audit or inspection are to assess compliance with the trial protocol and the principles of ICH -GCP including the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, 2013 ) and all other relevant regu lations. The subjects must be informed by the investigator and in the Informed Consent Documents that authorised sponsor representatives and representatives from regulatory authorities and IECs/IRBs /REBs may wish to inspect their medical records. During audits/insp ections the auditors/inspectors may copy relevant parts of the medical records. No personal identification apart from the screening/randomisation number will appear on these copies. The investigator should notify the sponsor without any delay of any inspec tion by a regulatory authority or IEC/IRB /REB ."
