9,page_9,"I4V-MC-JAHL(a)Clinical Protocol Page 9 LY30091041.Synopsis Title of Study: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Baricitinib in Adult Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis Rationale : Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a pruritic, chronic or chronically relapsing, highly symptomatic inflammatory skin disease characterized by excessive T cell activation leading to significant skin infiltration by T cells and dendritic cells (Bieber 2010) . Presentation is varied, but includes skin manifestations and prurit us, with associated sleep disturbances and subsequent skin infections. The cou rse of disease includes relapses of varying duration and severity . Baricitinib is an orally available, selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor with potency and selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2 and less potency for JAK3 or tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) ( Fridman et al. 2010 ). The pathogenesis of AD is thought to be modulated through t hymic stromal ly mphopoietin (TSLP) , interleukin (IL) -13, IL-4, IL-5, IL-22, and IL-31, many of which activate receptor s with downstream signaling through intracellular JAK1/JAK2 /TYK2 (Nomura and Kabashima 2015 ). This activity profile suggests that baricitinib would inhibit cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis . Clinical studies have established that baricitinib is effective in autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases involving the joints, kidneys, and skin. Baricitinib was effective at reducing swollen and tender joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Genovese et al .2016; Dougados et al .2017; Fleischmann et al.2017; Taylor et al .2017); was effective at reducing disease severity in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Papp et al .2016 ); was effective at reducing the urinary albumin -to-creatinine ratio in patients with diabetic kidney disease (Tuttle et al. 2015 ); and in a recently completed Phase 2 study (I4V -MC -JAHG) was effective at reducing disease severity in patients with moderate to severe AD. The mechanism of action, combined with demonstration of clinical benefit in inflammatory diseases involving joints, kidneys, and skin, provides the rationale for evaluating bari citinib in moderate to severe AD. Objectives/Endpoints: Objectives Endpoints Primary Totest the hypothesis that baricitinib 4-mg QD or baricitinib 2 -mg QD is superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD .Proportio n of patients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 w ith a ≥2-point improvement at W eek16.

Summary of Study Design: Study I4V-MC -JAHL (JAHL) is a Phase3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, outpatient study evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib 4 -mg once daily (QD), 2-mg QD, and 1 -mg QD as compared to placebo in adult patients with moderate to severe AD. T he study population will include patients aged 18 years or older who have moderate to severe AD and a history of inadequate response or intolerance to existing topical therapies. The study duration will be up to 25 weeks over 3 study periods: Period 1: Sc reening Period lasting from 8 to 35 daysprior to Week 0 (baseline, Visit 2). Period 2: Double -Blind edTreatment Period, lasting from Week 0 (baseline, Visit 2) through Week 16 (Visit 8) inclusive : oAt completion of the double -blind treatment period, eligible patients will be provided the option to participate in the long -term extension study I4V-MC -JAHN (JAHN). Those not eligible or who chose not to participate will proceed to the post -treatment follow -up period. Period 3: Post - Treatment Follow -Up Period , spanning the period from the last treatment visit at Week 16 (Visit 8) or Early Termination Visit (ETV) to approximately 4weeks following the last dose of investigational product. Treatment Arms and Duration: Patients will be randomized at Week 0 to 1 of 4 treatment groups: placebo once daily (QD), baricitinib 1-mgQD, baricitinib 2 - mg QD, or baricitinib 4 -mgQD. The study duration will be up to 25 weeks (Screening Period: up to 5weeks prior to randomization; Double -Blinded Treatment Period: 16 weeks; Follow -up Period: approximately 4weeks after the last dose of investigational product). Number of Patients: This study will include approximately 600 patients with AD wh o will be randomized 2:1:1:1 to placebo QD or 1 of 3 dose groups o f baricitinib (1 -mg QD, 2 -mg QD, or 4 -mg QD) (240 patients in the placebo arm; 120 patients in each baricitinib treatment group). Statistical Analysis: Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy and health outcome analy ses will be conducted on the intent -to-treat populatio nand safety analyses will be conducted on those patients who receive at least 1 dose of investigational product .

If a patient needs to use rescue medication, the data after rescue onward will be considered missing and missing data will be imputed using the nonresponder imputation (NRI) method. All patients who discontinue the study or study treatment at any time for any reason will be defined as nonresponders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables after discontinuation onward. Additional analyses will be done using all observed data whether rescue medication was used or not. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be made using mixed -effects model ofrepeated measures (MMRM) with treatment , region, baseline severity , visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interaction as fixed continuous effects. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within -patient variance –covariance errors. TypeIII sums of squares for the least squares means (LSMs) will be used for the statistical comparison and c ontrasts will be set up within the model to compare treatment groups at specific time points of interest . Fisher exact test will be used for all adverse events (AEs), baseline, discontinuation, and other categorical safety data. Continuous vital signs and laboratory values will be analyzed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and baseline valu es in the model."

Patients with AD may present with skin lesions that can be acute with oozing, crusted, eroded vesicles or papules on erythematous pl aques. Pati ents m ay also present with lesions that have a subacute appearance, with thick and excoriated plaques, or chronic appearance, with lichenified, slight ly pigmented, excori ated pl aques (Bieber 2010 ). Atopic dermat itiscauses pruri tus attacks through out the day , which is the primary source of morbidity in this disorder (Simpson 2012 ).Pruritus often leads to an “itch–scratch” cy cle,further compromising the epi dermal barri er and result ing in dry skin, microbial co lonizat ion, and secondary infect ions (Krakowski et al. 2008 ), with 36% of patients reporting that they often or al ways scratch unt il their skin bleeds (Langenbruch et al. 2014 ). Pruri tus fro m ADcan worsen at night, result ing in sleep disturba nces, wi thapproximately 27% of adul t pati ents wi th AD experiencing sleep disturbance as a result of itching (Langenbruch et al. 2014 ).In adult patients with moderate to severe AD, sl eep quali ty and latency were significant ly associ ated wi th poor quali ty of life (QoL) (Yano et al. 2013 ). In clinical pract ice, AD is classified as mild, moderate ,or severe based on a variet y of clinical features, including severit y of skin lesi ons and pruri tus, and exte nt of disease (body surface area [BSA] invo lved) . Until recent ly,there were no Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved systemic treatm ents for pati ents wi th moderate to severe AD, with the exception of systemic corticosteroi ds. In March 2017, Dupixent (dupilumab) inject ion, anIgG4 m onocl onal ant ibody that inhibits interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, was approved by the FDA for thi s pat ient populat ion. In the European Unio n, only cycl osporine has been approved for the treatment of patients with severe AD (Bieber and Straeter 2015 ). A recent ly completed Phase 2 study (I4V -MC-JAHG [JAHG]) eval uated the safet y and efficacy of baricit inib ( a Janus kinase [JAK]inhibitor) in AD and results showed si gnificant improvement in disease severit y compared to pl acebo and no new safet y concerns were i dentified . In addit ion to AD, b aricitinib has also been studied in Phase 3in pat ients with rheumatoi d arthri tis (RA) and in Phase2 in pat ients with diabeti c nephrop athy, moderate to severe psoriasis , and systemic lupus erythematosus. Through 04June 2016, baricit inib has been studied in more than 450 heal thy vol unteers and 4200 patients have received baricit inib in clinical studies .Of these, m ore than 2400 patients have been treated with baricit inib for more than a year and more than 900 patients have been treated with baricit inib for more than 2 years at doses of 2 -mg QD and/o r 4-mg QD across the RA clinical program. Baricit inib has been administered as single doses ranging from 1 -to 40-mg and as repeat oral doses ranging fro m 2-to 20 -mg to healt hy subjects . Bari citinib has also been administered to patients with RA at doses up to 15 -mg daily for 4 weeks, 10 -mg daily for 24weeks, 8- mg daily for 76 weeks, and lower doses up to 4- mg daily for up to approximately 5years ."
19,page_19,"I4V-MC-JAHL(a)Clinical Protocol Page 19 LY30091043.2. Study Rationale The underlying cause of AD is not com pletely understood. Loss of function mutations in the gene for filaggrin (filament aggregating protein), a key protein in terminal different iation of the epidermis contribut ing to barrier function, has been identified as the strongest genetic risk factor for AD in European populat ions(Palmer et al . 2006) . At a cellular level, AD is characteriz ed by excessive T cell act ivation caused by genetic and environmental factors, l eadin g to si gnificant skin infiltrat ion by T cells and dendrit ic cells. Thecytokine thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) is thought to act as a master switch that triggers the init iation and m aintenance of AD (Moni aga et al . 2013 ; Ziegler et al. 2013 ). Overexpressio nof TSLP in kerat inocytes, the most prevalent cell t ype in the skin, triggers robust itch -evoked scratching and the development of an AD-like skin phenoty pe in mice (Li et al . 2005 ). In addit ion to di rectly inducing itch by activat ing sensory neurons in the skin, TSLP also enhances maturation and different iation of dendrit iccells and naive CD4+ T cells and induces production of Th2 -related cy tokines invo lved in ADpathogenesis (Wilso n et al . 2013 ; Divekar and Kita 2015 ). Thymic strom al lymphopoi etin and other key cytokines invo lved in AD pathogenesis, such as IL -13, IL -5,IL-22, and IL -31, signal through receptors associated with intracellular JAK1 /JAK2/ty rosine kinase 2(TYK2) signaling(Ziegler et al . 2013; Nom ura and Kabashima 2015 ). Janus kinases are afamily of tyrosine kinases that mediate cytokine receptor signallingthrough phosphorylat ion and activat ion of signal transducers and activators of transcript ion(STAT) proteins . There are 4 known JAK family members: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 (Clark et al . 2014). The relat ive affinit y of JAK inhibitors for different members of the JAK kinase family allows for different iation of JAK inhibitors in relatio n to thei renzymat ic inhibitory profile. In vitro assays indicate that baricit inib is a select ive inhibitor of JAKs with potency and selec tivity for JAK 1/2 and less potency for JAK3 or TYK2 ( Fridman et al . 2010 ). The balanced JAK1/JAK2 inhibitory profile o f baricit inib suggests that baricit inib will have the greatest modulatory effect in cy tokines signalling through a JAK1/JAK2 heterodimer intracellularly (or a JAK1/JAK2/TYK2 ), such as IL -6, TSLP , IL-13, or IL - 31 (Vaddi and Luchi 2012 ). The recent ly co mpleted Phase 2 study of baricit inib in AD, JAHG, met its primary object iveof proporti on of patients achieving a 50% improvement fro m baseline in EASI scores compared to placebo . Baricit inib also showed statist ically significant improvements for other disease severit y analyses as well as mult iple different patient -reported outcome (PRO) scales compared to placebo, further validat ing the hypothesis that JA K1/JAK2 signaling plays a key role in AD pathogenesis . 3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) and reasonably ant icipated adverse events (AEs) of baricit inibare to be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB) ."

The study isdivided into 3 periods, a 5 - week Screening period, a 16 -week Double -Blinded Treatm ent period, and a 4-week Post-Treatment Follow -Up period. For those patients who complete the 16 -week treatm ent peri od,there is an option to participate in the long -term extens ion study I4V-MC-JAHN (JAHN ). Approximately 600 pat ients ≥18years of age who have responded inadequately to or who are intolerant to topical therapy will be randomized at a 2:1:1:1ratioto receive placebo QD, baricit inib 1-mgQD , baricit inib 2 -mg QD, or baricit inib 4 -mg QD (240 patients in the placebo group ; 120 patients in each baricit inib treatm ent group). Patients will be stratified at rando mizat ion according to disease severit y (Investi gator’s Gl obal Assessment [ IGA]3 vs. 4) and geographic region. All procedures to be conducted during the study , including timing of all procedures, are indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Secti on9.4.4 describes co llection of laboratory samples; Appendix 2 ,Appendix 4 ,and Appendix 5 list the specific laboratory tests that will be perform ed for this study . Study governance considerations are described in detail in Appendix 3 . Secti on10.3.7.1 outlines informat ion regarding the data monitoring co mmittee (DMC) and interim analyses. 5.1.1. Period 1: Screening The durati on of the Screening Period is between 8 and 35 days pri or to Visit 2 (W eek0). At Visit 1,the patient will sign the informed consent form (ICF) prior to any study assessments, examinat ions, or procedures being performed (see Appendix 3 ). All screening procedures will be perform ed according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2). Patients who receive a purified protein derivat ive (PPD) skin test at Visit 1 will need to return within48to 72hours laterto read the skin test. Prior to randomizat ion, treatm ents for AD will be washed out: 4weeks for systemic treatments and 2 weeks for topical treatments (not including emo llients). Patients will be required to use emo llients daily during the 14days preceding randomization and throughout the study .If patients have been using emo llients daily at the tim e of screening ,then those cumulative days can be utilized to meet inclusio n criterion [8 ]. Addit ionally, collect ion of data through daily diaries and act igraphy devices will be required through outthe screening period. The baseline for the daily PRO and act igraphy assessments will be the average score of the 7days prior to randomization; thus,the minimum screening window was set at 8days. All patients who have not previously received the herpes zoster vaccine by screening will be encouraged (per local guidelines) to do so prior to rando mizat ion.

Number of Participants Approximately 600 parti cipants will be enrolled ; approximately 840 patientswill be screened to achieve this enro llment . 5.3. End of Study Definition End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule o f Activities(Secti on2)for the last patient . 5.4. Scientific Rationa le for Study Design This study will enroll m oderate tosevere ADpatients with a history of inadequate response or intolerance to exi sting topical therapies for whom a systemic treatm ent such as baricit inib may therefore be appropriate. During the screening period (Period 1), a washout of systemic and topical treatments for AD was incorporated prior to randomizat ion to minimize confounding effects due to background treatm ent. The double -blind, pl acebo -controlled treatment period (Period 2) is desig ned to minimize bias in the evaluat ion of the efficacy and safet y of 3baricit inib doses, relative to placebo, through 16 weeks of treatment. In consideration o f the disease severit y, all patients in Study JAHL are eligible for rescue to TCS.Invest igator s areallowed to rescue patients who are experiencing unacceptable or worsening symptoms of AD. Once rescue medicatio n is used, the patient will be determined to be a non responder (See Section 7.7.3 ). Invest igator ’sGlobal Assessments are commonly used in clinical trials, both for qualifying patients f or enrollment and for evaluat ing treatment efficacy (Langle y et al . 2015 ; Futam ura et al . 2016). There is no single “gold standard” disease severi ty scale for AD; however, IGA scale s provi declinically meaningful measures to patients and invest igators that are easily described and that correspond to disease severit y categori es (e.g., m oderate to severe). The scale that will be used in this trial, the validated Invest igator’s Global Assessment of Atopic Dermat itis (vIGA -AD, referred to throughout the protocol as IGA), has been developed internally and assesses AD severit y using a 5-point scale . A 2:1:1:1 randomizat ion scheme of placebo, 1 -mg baricit inib, 2 -mg baricit inib, and 4 -mg baricit inib was implemen ted because increased placebo enrollment across treatment groups has been reported to decrease placebo response and to also increase statist ical power (Mallinckrodt 2011). The 16-week efficacy endpoint was chosen because it is likely that a robust clinical effect will be observed with baricitinib within this timeframe based on the Phase 2 study resul ts in AD and from previ ous studi es in another inflammatory skin condit ion. The Post -Treatment Follow -Up Peri od (Peri od3) is for safet y monitoring after the patient has been o ff invest igational product for approximately 28 days."
26,page_26,"I4V-MC-JAHL(a)Clinical Protocol Page 26 LY30091045.5. Justification for Dose The doses proposed for AD Phase 3 studi es are baricit inib 1-mg, 2-mg,and 4 -mg QD . These doses were chosen primarily based on the recently completed Phase 2 AD study , JAHG ,and are additionally supported by PK, safet y, and efficacy data for baricit inib in Phase 2 and Phase 3 RA studi esanda Phase 2 psoriasis study . In the Phase 2 Study JAHG, both the 2 -mg and 4 -mg doses showed benefit on the primary and major secondary endpoints (EASI, IGA, SCORAD, POEM and DLQI) as com pared to pl acebo, and both doses had an acceptable safety profile at Week 16.However , the 4 -mg dose appeared to demonstrate a more rapi d benefit (at 4 weeks) on the more stringent endpo ints (EASI75, EASI90 ,and IGA0 or 1) compared to 2 -mg dose particularly in the subgroup of pat ients with baseline EASI scores ≥16. The 4 -mg dose resul ted in statistically significant improvement in these endpo ints at Week 4 and this level o f response was maintained through Week 16. A similar trend betwee n the baricit inib 4 -mg and 2 -mg doses was observed in pat ients with RA. Although in Study JAHG the 4 -mg dose seemed to perform better than the 2 -mg dose on more stringent endpo ints, on other endpo ints, including EASI -50, and EASI change from baseline, 2-mg and 4 -mg doses show edsimilar efficacy compared to placebo. Thus b ased on available data, 3doses will be included in Phase 3, including a 1-mg dose, to cover the range of exposures where clinical responses could be anticipated 5.5.1. Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment Baricitinib exposure increases wit h decreased renal funct ion. Based on PK simulat ions of baricit inib exposures for the mild and moderate categories o f renal funct ion (stratified as estimated glo merular filtrat ion rate [eGFR ]60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2and eGFR 30 to <60mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively), dose adjust ment is not required for patients with eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2. Pati ents wi th eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2who are randomized to the 4-mg dose will receive a dose of 2 –mg QD , which will ensure that exposures do not exceed those of the 4 -mg QDdose in pat ients with eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m 2. For pati ents randomized to the 2-mg dose or 1-mg dose , there will be no dose adjustm entbased on renal funct ion. The dose adjustm entfor renal impairment will be managed by interact ive web -response system ( IWRS )to ensure m aintenance of the treatment blind. This study will not enroll pat ients with screening eGFR <40mL/min/1.73 m2. See Secti on8.1.1 for eGFR thresholds that trigger interruption of investigat ional product . The procedure of dose adjust ment based on renal funct ion (eGFR) dur ing the study is detailed in Secti on7.2.2 ."

Randomization will be stratified by geographic regi on(Europe [EU], Japan [ JPN], rest-of-world [ROW ])and disease severi ty at baseline ( IGA 3 vs. 4). Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a computer -generated random seque nce using an IWRS. The IWRS will be used to assign blister packs , each containing doubl e -blind invest igational product tablets to each patient , starti ng at Visit 2 (Week 0), and at each visit up to and including Visit 7 (Week 12). Site personnel will confirm that they have l ocated the correct blister packs by entering a confirmat ion number found on the blister packs into the IWRS. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses The invest igational product ( 3tablet sfrom blister pack ) shoul d be taken once daily without regard to food and, if possible, at approximately the same t ime every day , usually at the start of the pati ent’s day ,to aid pati ent com pliance.

Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment The rati onale of dose adjust ment for pati ents wi th docum ented renal impairment (defined as screening eGFR ≥40 to <60mL/min/1.73 m2) is detailed in Sect ion5.5.1 . The dose adjust ment for renal impairment will be managed by IWRS to ensure maintenance of the treatment blind. The eGFR value from the screening visit (Visit 1) will be entered into IWRS atVisit 2, and IWRS will assign the treatment doses accordingly. Patients wi th docum ented renal impairment (defined as screening eGFR ≥40 to < 60mL/min/1.73 m2), who are randomized to the 4-mg active treatment armwill receive a dose of 2-mg QD by the IWRS .For patients randomized to the 2 –mg dose or 1–mg dose , there will be no dose adjust mentbased on renal funct ion."
38,page_38,"I4V-MC-JAHL(a)Clinical Protocol Page 38 LY3009104No dose adjust ment will be made for p atients with screening eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2. These patients who are randomized to active treatment will receive their assigned dose, either baricit inib 4 –mg, 2–mg, or 1–mg, respectively . During the study , for pati ents wi th docum ented renal impai rment when the subsequent eGFR falls <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, invest igational product will be wit hheld unt il their eGFR beco mes ≥40mL/min/1.73 m2, whereupon the invest igational product dosing may resume.

Blindin g This is a double -blind study .To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study is complete. All study assessments will be performed by study personnel who are blinded to the patient’s treatment group. Except in clinical circumstances where unblinding is required, the patients, invest igators, Lilly study team, and any personnel interact ing direct ly wit h pat ients or investigat ive sites will remain blinde d to barici tinib and placebo assignment until after completion of the Double -Blinded Treatm ent Peri od. It i s expected that the need for unblinding a pati ent’s treatm ent pri or to com pletion of the Double -Blinded Treatm ent Peri od will be extrem ely rare. Ev ery effort shoul d be made to preserve the blind unless there is a compelling reason that knowledge of the specific treatment would alter the medical care of the patient. In case of an emergency , the investi gator has the sol e responsibilit y for determinin g if unblinding of a patient’s treatment assignment is warranted for medical management of the event. Patient safet y must al ways be the first considerat ion in making such a determinat ion. If a patient ’s treatm ent assi gnment i s unblinded, Lilly must be no tified immediately . If the invest igator decides that unblinding is warranted, it is the responsibilit y of the investi gator to prom ptly docum ent the decisio n and rat ionale and notify Lilly as soon as possible. Emergency unblinding for AEs m ay be perform ed through the IWRS . This option may be used ONLY if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment. All unblinding event sare recorded and reported by the IWRS . If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or pati ent is unblinded, the patient must be discont inued fro m the study . In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study , the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly clinical research physician for the pat ient to con tinue in the study . Processes to maintain blinding during the interim analysis con ducted by the DMC are described in Section 10.3.7.1 . 7.4. Dosage Modification Not applicable ."

Rescue Therapy Criteria for rescue therapy initia tion Invest igators should attempt to manage patients with emollients , however , invest igators are allowed to rescue patients who are experiencing unacceptable orworsening symptoms of ADat any time . Prior to rescue, i t is recommended that increased frequency of emo llient use is attem pted to at l east twi ce a day or m ore in an effo rt to control symptom s. The rati onale for rescue will be documented. Choice of r escue therapy treatment Triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/orhydrocortisone 2.5% ointment . Where possible , both of these treatments will be supplied by the sponsor .In the event where providing 1or both of these topical formulat ions is not possible ,an alternate, equivalent potency TCS cream and/orointment may be provided by the sponsor. TCS use, supplied by the sponsor, should be recorded via weight of returned tubes as indicated in the S chedule of Activities(Secti on2). oIn the event that the sponsor i s unable to supply TCS, commercially available triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocorti sone 2.5% ointment may be supplied by the sites. Where providing triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocortisone 2.5% ointment is not possible, an equivalent -potency TCS cream and/or ointment that is in line wit h local pract ices can be supplied . Refer to Appendix 7 for guidance on potency equivalence . oIf the TSC supplied by the sponsor is not considered suitable for an individual patient, an equivalent -potency TCS cream and/or oint ment that is in line with"

Refer to Appendix 7 for guidance on potency equivalence . Invest igators may also select to use TCNIs and/or crisaborole where approved, although use of eitherduring the study is neither encouraged nor provided. If TCNIs are prescribed, use should be limited to problem areas only (e.g. ,face, neck, skin folds, genital areas , etc.) . On the days of study visits, topi cal therapy shoul d not be applied before the patient has undergone all study procedures and clinical evaluations in order to allow adequate assessment of skin dryness Patients rescued to topical therapy will continue to take invest igational product and use of rescue therapy will be docum ented in the eCRF. In pati ents who do not improve sufficient ly wit h the provided rescue topical therapy after7days, a higher potency TCS m ay be used (see Appendix 7 ) and invest igational product may continue . Higher potency TCS will not be supplied centrally by the sponsor. It is reco mmende dthat if a patient reaches “clear ”to “almo st clear ”skin after topical rescue ,thenmedium -and/or high-potency TCS and TCNI shoul d be stopped, and low–potency TCS (e.g., hy drocorti sone 2.5% ointment) shoul d be used once daily for an addi tional 7days, then stopped .If lesions return, patients can be retreated with TCS with or wi thout TCNI s and/or crisaborole as before at the discret ion of the invest igator. If topi cal rescue therapy as described above fails to sufficient ly control AD symptoms, then oral systemic medicat ions may be used as rescue (e.g. ,corticosteroi ds, cycl osporine, m ethotrexate); however, investigational produ ctwill be requi red to be perm anent ly discont inued for the remainder of the 16 -week study durati on. If these medicat ions are needed for other medical condi tions (e.g .,asthma flare) ,they will st ill be treated as rescue medicat ions.

Temporary Interruption from Investigational Product In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of AEs or abnorm al laboratory values that m ay have an unclear relationship to invest igational product. For example, investigational product sh ould be temporarily interrupted if the patient experiences a cardi ovascular adverse event considered to be related tostudytreatm ent,isgraded asmoderate (Grade 2according to Common Termino logyCriteriaforAdverse Events [CTCAE] Version 3.0), and that does not resolve promptly withsupporti vecare. Except in cases of emergency, it is recommended that the invest igator consult with Lilly (or its designee) before temporarily interrupting therapy for reasons other than those defined in Table JAHL. 4. For the abnormal laboratory findings and clinical events (regardless of relatedness) listed in Table JAHL. 4,specific guidance is provided for temporarily interrupting treatment and when treatm ent m ay be restarted. Retest frequency and timing of f ollow-up laboratory tests to m onitor the abnormal finding isat the di scret ion of the investigator. Invest igational product that was temporarily interrupted because of an AE or abnormal laboratory value not specifically covered in Table JAHL. 4may be restarted at the discret ion of the invest igator. Table JAHL. 4. Criteria for Temporary Interruption of Investigational Product Hold Investigational Product if the Following Laboratory Test Results or Clinical Events Occur:Investigational Product May Be Resumed When : WBC count <2000 cells/µL (<2.00x10 3/µL or <2.00 GI/L)WBC count 2500 cells/µL (≥2.50x10 3/µL or ≥2.50 GI/L) ANC <1000 cells/L (<1.00x10 3/µL or <1.00 GI/L)ANC ≥1200 cells/µL (≥1.20x10 3/µL or ≥1.20GI/L) Lymphocy te count < 500cells/µL (<0.50x10 3/µL or <0.50 GI/L)Lymphocy te count 750cells/µL (≥0.75x10 3/µL or ≥0.75 GI/L) Platelet count <75,000/µL (<75x10 3/µL or <75 GI/L)Platelet count 100,000/µL (≥100x10 3/µL or ≥100 GI/L) eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2(from serum creatinine) for patients with screenin g eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2eGFR 50mL/min/1.73 m2 eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2(from serum creatinine) for patients with screening eGFR ≥40 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2eGFR 40mL/min/1.73 m2 ALT or AST >5x ULN ALT and AST return to <2x ULN, and IP is not considered to be the cause of enzyme elevation Hemoglobin <8 g/dL (<80.0 g/L) Hemoglobin 10g/dL ( ≥100.0 g/L) Symptomatic herpes zoster All skin lesions have crusted and are resolving Infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, merits the IP be ing interruptedResolution of infection Clinical features of VTE (such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmo nary embolism) are present aAfter evaluation and institution of appropriate treatment of VTE b"

If upon evaluation VTE is ruled out and no other temporary or permanent discontinuation criteria aremet,then IP may be resumed . bIf after evaluation and institution of treatment the investigator deems that the patient is still at significant risk ,or if this would constitute a second VTE for the patient, then IP should be discontinued permanently Although temporary interruption of invest igationalproduct is not a requirement at times of increased pot ential risk of VTE (e.g., surgery , significant air travel, or other situations inv olving prolonged immo bilizat ion) we recommend following appropri ate VTE prophylaxis guidelines to help manage the VTE risk under these circumstances . For specific guidance on temporary interruption of IP after use of a prohibited medicat ion, please refer to Section 7.7.1 (Prohibited Medicat ions and Procedures) . Lastly, invest igational product should be temporarily interrupted for suicidal ideation or any suicide-related behaviors as assessed by the following patient responses on th e C-SSRS : A “yes”answer to Question 4 (Act ive Suicidal Ideation with So me Intent to Act, Without Specific Plan) or A “yes” answer to Question 5 (Act ive Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent) on the “Suicidal Ideat ion” porti on of the C -SSRS or A “yes”answer to any of the suici de-related behaviors (actual attempt, interrupted attem pt, aborted attempt, preparatory act or behavior) on the “Suicidal Behavi or”porti on of the C -SSRS. NOTE: Prior to resum ption of invest igationalproduct , it is recommended that a patient be assessed by a psychiatrist or appropri ately trained professio nal to assist in deciding whether the subject should remain on invest igational product and ult imately continued participat ion in the study. Apatient does not necessarily have to have invest igational product interrupted if they have self -injuri ous behavi or that woul d be classified as non -suicidal self -injurious behavior. 8.1.2. Permanent Discontinuation from Investigational Product Invest igational product should be permanent ly discontinued if the patient requests to discont inue investigat ional product. Discontinuati on of the invest igational product for abnormal liver tests should be considered by the invest igator when a pat ient meets 1 of thefollowing condit ions after consultation with the Lilly -designated m edical m onitor: ALT or AST > 8xULN ALT or AST > 5xULN for more than 2 weeks ALT or AST > 3xULN and total bilirubin level (TBL) > 2xULN or internat ional norm alized rati o (INR) >1.5"

Invest igational product should be permanent ly discontinued if any o f the following laboratory abnorm alities are observed: white blood cell count <1000 cells/µL ( 1.00x10 3/µL or 1.00 GI/L) ANC <500 cells/µL ( 0.50x10 3/µL or 0.50 GI/L) lymphocy te count <200 cells/µL ( 0.20x10 3/µL or 0.20 GI/L) hemoglobin <6.5 g/dL (<65.0 g/L). NOTE: Temporary interrupti on rul es (see Sect ion8.1.1 ) must be fo llowed where applicable. For l aboratory values that meet permanent discont inuat ion thresho lds, investigat ional product should be discont inued . However, if in the opinio n of the investi gator the laboratory abnorm ality is due to intercurrent illness such as cholelithiasis or another i dentified factor , laboratory tests m ay be repeated . Only when the laboratory value m eets resum ption threshol ds (Table JAHL. 4) following the resol ution of the intercurrent illness or other identified factor , may the invest igator restart invest igational product, after consultation wit h the Lilly -designated m edical monitor.

Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regul ations, or laboratory certificati on standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessments Validated Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA- AD): The IGA used in this study, the vIGA -AD (refer red to as the IGA throughout the protocol ) measures the i nvest igator’s global assessment of the patient’s overall severit y of theirAD, based on a static, numeric 5-point scale fro m 0 (clear skin ) to 4 (severe disease) . The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of ery thema, papulation/indurati on,oozing/crusting, and lichenification. 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments 9.1.2.1. Eczema Area and Severity Index S cores The EASI assesses extent of disease at 4 body regions and measures 4clinical signs: (1)erythema, (2) i ndurat ion/papulat ion, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenificat ion each on a scale of 0to 3. The EASI confers a maximum score of 72. The EASI evaluates 2dimensio ns of AD: disease extent and clinical signs (Hani fin et al . 2001). Body surface area affected by AD will be derived from data collected as part of the EASI assessment. 9.1.2.2. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis The SCORing Atopic Dermat itis (SCORAD )index uses the rule o f nines to assess disease extent and e valuates 6clinical characterist ics to determine disease severit y: (1) ery thema, (2)edema/papulat ion, (3) oozing/crusts, (4) excoriation ,(5) lichenification , and (6) dryness . The SCORAD index also assesses subject ive symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss . These 3aspects: extent of disease, disease severit y,and subjective symptoms co mbine to give a maximum possible score of 103 (Stalder et al . 1993; Kunz e t al. 1997; Schram et al. 2012) . 9.1.2.3. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale The Hospi tal Anxiet y Depressi onScale (HADS) i s a 14 -item self-assessment scale that determines the levels of anxiet y and depressio n that a patient is experiencing over the past week. The HADS utilizes a 4 -point Li kert scal e (e.g., 0 to 3) for each quest ion and i s intended for ages 12to 65years (Zigmond and Snait h 1983 ; White et al. 1999 ). Scores for each domain (anxiet y"
50,page_50,"I4V-MC-JAHL(a)Clinical Protocol Page 50 LY3009104and depression) can range from 0 to 21 ,with higher scores indicat ing greater anxiet y or depressio n (Zigmond and S naith 1983 ; Snait h 2003 ). 9.1.3. Health Outcomes and Quality -of-Life Measures Thepatientself-reported questionnaires will be administered via either an electronic pat ient diary or via an electroni c tablet andin countries where the quest ionnaires have been translated into the native language of the region and linguistically validated. 9.1.3.1. Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM i s a simple, 7- item, pati ent-administered scale that assesses disease severit y in children and adults. Patients respond to questions about the frequency o f 7symptoms (itching, sleep disturbance, bleeding, weeping/oozing, cracking, flaking, and dryness/roughness) over the last week. Response categories include “No days ,” “1-2 days ,” “3- 4 days,” “5-6 days ,” and “Every day” wi th corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Scores range from 0 -28 with higher total scores indicating greater disease severit y (Charman et al . 2004). 9.1.3.2. Itch Numeric Rating Scale The Itch N umeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a pati ent-administered , 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing “no itch” and 10 represent ing “worst itch imaginable.” Overall severit y of a pati ent’s i tching is indicated by select ingthe num ber that best describes the worst l evel of itching in the past 24 hours (Naege li et al . 2015; Kimball et al. 2016 ). 9.1.3.3. Nocturnal Sleep –Wake and Itch Patterns An act igraphy device, ahypoallergenic device worn on the wrist , will be used to collect sleep -wake patterns and quant ify nocturnal scratching events .Each patient will be dispensed 2actigraphy devices. One will be worn on the wrist at all t imes and the other will be worn only during hours of sleep(one on each wrist) .Further details on use of the device will be provided in other instructional materi als. 9.1.3.4. Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale The Atopic Dermat itis Sleep Scale (ADSS) is a 3-item, pati ent-administered quest ionnaire developed to assess the impact of itch on sleep including difficult y falling asleep, frequency of waking, and difficult y getting back to sleep last night . Patient’s rate their d ifficult y falling asleep and difficult y getting back to sleep, i tems 1 and 3, respectively , usinga 5-point Likert -type scale with response opti ons ranging fro m 0 “not at all” to 4 “very difficult. ”Patients report their frequency of waking l ast ni ght, i tem 2, by selecting the number of times they woke up each night, ranging fro m 0 to 29 times. The A DSS is desi gned to be com pleted each day with responde nts thinking about sleep “last night. ”Each item is scored individually . 9.1.3.5. Skin PainNumeric Rating Scale Skin Pain NRS is a patient -administered, 11 -point hori zontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0represent ing “no pain” and 10 represent ing“worst pain imaginable.” Overall severit y of a patient’s skin pain is indicated by select ing the number that best describes the worst level o f skin pain in the past 24 hours."
51,page_51,"I4V-MC-JAHL(a)Clinical Protocol Page 51 LY30091049.1.3.6. Patient Global Impression ofSeverity The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Severi ty–Atopic Derm atitis(PGI -S-AD) is a single -item question asking the patient how they woul d rate thei r overall ADsymptoms over the past 24hours . The 5categories o f responses range from “no symptoms ” to“severe .” 9.1.3.7. Dermatology Life Quality Index The Derm atology Life Qualit y Index (DLQI )is a simple, patient -administered, 10 -item, validated, qualit y-of-life quest ionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activi ties, leisure, work and school, personal relat ionships, and treatment. The recall period of this scale is over the “last week.” Response categories include “not at all, ” “a l ot,” and “very much,” with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3 ,respect ively ,and unanswered (“not relevant”) responses scored as 0. Scores range fro m 0-30 wi th higher scores indicat ing greater impairment of qualit y of life. A DLQI total score of 0 to 1 i s consi dered as having no effect on a patient’s healt h-related QoL(Hongbo et al. 2005 ), and a 4 -point change from baseline is considered as the minimal clinically important difference thresho ld (Khilji et al. 2002 ; Basra et al. 2015 ). 9.1.3.8. European Quality of Life –5Dimensions –5Levels The European Qualit y of Life –5 Dimensi ons–5 Levels (EQ- 5D-5L) is a standardized measure of healt h status thatprovide sa simple, generic measure of healt h for clinical and economic apprai sal. The EQ -5D- 5L consists of 2 components: a descript ive system o f the respondent’s healt h and a rating of his or her current health state using a 0 to 100 mm VAS. The descript ive system com prises the foll owing 5 dimensio ns: m obility, self -care, usual act ivities, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensi on has 5 levels: no problems, slight probl ems, m oderate probl ems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The responden t is asked to indicate his or her healt h state by ticking (or pl acing a cross) in the box associated with the most appropri ate statement in each of the 5 dimensio ns. It should be noted that the numerals 1 to 5 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as an ordinal score. The VAS records the respondent’s self -rated heal th on a vert ical VAS where the endpo ints are labeled “best imaginable healt h state” and “worst imaginable health state.” This informat ion can be used as a quant itative measure o f healt h outcome. The EQ-5D- 5L healt h states, defined by the EQ -5D- 5L descript ive system, may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essent ially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the levels in each dimensio n (Herdman et al . 2011; EuroQol Group 2015 [WWW] ). 9.1.3.9. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire –Atopic Dermatitis The Work Productivit y and Act ivity Impairment Questi onnai re–Atopic Dermat itis (WPAI -AD) records impairment due to AD during the past 7 days. The WPAI -AD consists of 6items grouped into 4domains: absenteeism (work time missed), presentee ism(impai rment at work/reduced on -the -job effect iveness), work productivit y loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activit yimpairment. Scores are calculated as impairment percentages (Reilly et al. 1993 ),with higher scores indicat ing greater impairment and less productivit y."
52,page_52,"I4V-MC-JAHL(a)Clinical Protocol Page 52 LY30091049.1.4. Appropriateness of Assessments All assessments utilized in this study are standard, widely used, and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant except ADSS and Skin Pain NRS ,which are current ly being developed and validated according to regulatory guidances. 9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the sa fety of patientswho have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical c are of patientsduring the study. Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically importan t, considered rel ated to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused the patientto discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patientshoul d be f ollowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diag nostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency of follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatm ent effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study . In ad dition, site personnel will record any change in the condi tion(s) and any new condi tions as AEs. Investi gators shoul d record thei r assessment of the potenti al relatedness of each AE to invest igational product, vi a eCRF. The invest igator will interpret and docum ent whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomitant treatment, or pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause- and-effect relationship between the invest igational product, study device ,and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs u nless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient ’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF , clarifying if possible the circumstances leading to any dosagemodificat ions, or discont inuat ions of treatment. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in 1of the f ollowing outcom es: death"

Examples of such m edical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at hom e, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the sponsor begin s after the pati ent has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the sponsor as per SAE reporting requirements a nd timelines if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued vi a telephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This 24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and all fo llow -up SAE inform ation. Patients with a serious hepat ic AEshould have addit ional data collected using the hepat ic safet y eCRF . Pregnancy ( during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements ,any pregnancy should be repor ted following the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in subjects once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patientsummary CRF has been co mpleted). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he or she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipati on, the investigator must promptly notify Lilly. 9.2.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigatio nal product or procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the associ ated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory requirements in parti cipat ing countries requi re the reporting of SUSARs . Lilly has p rocedures that will be fo llowed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and the associated detailed guidances."

Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest will include the following: infect ions(including TB, herpes zoster, or opportunist ic infections) malignancies hepat ic events (see Section 9.4.9 ) major adverse cardi ovascular events (MACE) (see Section 9.4.10 ) thrombotic events (such as deep vein thro mbosis [ DVT ]and pulmo nary embo lism) . Sites will provide deta ils on these AEs as instructed on the eCRF and may be asked for additional descripti on by Lilly . 9.2.3. Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies to ensure the safet y of study participants, monitor qualit y, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product so that the situation can be assessed. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose Refer to the IB. 9.4. Safety Any clinically significant findings from ECG testi ng, physical examinat ion, vital signs measurements, or laboratory measurement sthat resul t in a di agnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatm ent shoul d be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF. 9.4.1. Electrocardiograms A single 12- lead standard ECG will be obtained lo cally at Visit 1 and read by a qualified physician (the invest igator or qualified designee) at the site to determine whether the patient meets entry criteria. Electrocardiograms may be obtained at addit ional times, when deemed clinically necessary . 9.4.2. Vital Signs For each patient, vitalsigns shoul d be measured according to the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2)."
55,page_55,"I4V-MC-JAHL(a)Clinical Protocol Page 55 LY30091049.4.3. Physical Exam For each patient, acomplete physical examinat ion (excluding pelvic and rectal examinat ions) will be per formed at Visi t1 (Screening). Asymptom -directed physical examinat ionwill be perform ed at other visits as specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). A com plete physical examinat ion may be repeated at the investigator’s discretion at any time a patient presents with physical co mplaints. 9.4.4. Laboratory Tests For each patient, laboratory testsdetailed in Appendix 2 shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2). With the excepti on of laboratory test resul ts that m ay unblind the study , Lilly or i ts desi gnee will provide the investi gator wi th the resul ts of laboratory tests analyzed by a central vendor, if a central vendor is used for the clinical trial. 9.4.5. Columbia Suicide Se verity Rating Scale The C -SSRS captures the occurrence, severit y, and f requency of suicidal ideat ion and/or behavior during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the ty pe of inform ation needed to determine if suicidal ideati on and/or behavior occurred. The C -SSRS i s administered by an appropri ately trained health care professio nal with at least 1 year of pat ient care/clinical experience. The tool was developed by the Nati onal Inst itute of Mental Healt h trial group for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algori thm of Suicide Assessment categori zation of suicidal events. For this study, the scale has been adapted (with permission fro m the scale authors) to include only the porti on of the sc ale that captures the occurrence of the 11 preferred ideat ion and behavior categories. The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur pri or to the collect ion of the C -SSRS. If a suicide-related event is discovered during the C -SSRS but was not captured during the nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form. If an event i s seri ous or l eads to discontinuat ion, thi s is an except ion where the SAE and/or AE leading to discont inuat ion should be included on the AE form and the process for reporti ng SAEs shoul d be fo llowed. 9.4.6. Self-Harm and Follow -up Supplement Forms Suicide-related events (behavior and/or ideat ions) will be assessed and evaluated at every visit with the administrati on of the C -SSRS and the Self -Harm Supplement Form. The Self-Harm Supplement Form is a single quest ion to enter the number of suicidal behavior events, possible suicide behavi ors, or nonsui cidal self -injuri ous behavi ors. If the number of behavioral events is greater than zero ,it will lead to the complet ion of the self -harmfollow-up form. The self -harm follow-up form is a seri es of quest ions that provides a more detailed descript ion of the behavior cases. 9.4.7. Chest x -ray and Tuberculosis Testing A posteri or–anterior view chest x -ray will be obtained l ocally at screening (Vi sit1), unl ess resul ts from a chest x -ray obtained wi thin 6 months prior to the study are available. The chest x -ray will be reviewed by the invest igator or his or her designee to exclude pat ients with active"

In addi tion, pati ents will be t ested at screening (Visit 1) for evidence o f active or latent TB as described in the exclusio n criteria, Secti on6.2. Invest igators should fo llow local guidelines for m onitoring pat ients for TBif a pat ient is at hi gh risk for acqui ring TB or reactivat ion of latent TB. 9.4.8. Hepatitis B Virus DNA Monitoring Patients who are HBcAb positive and HBV DNA negat ive (undetectable) at Visit 1 will require measurement of HBV DNA at Week 16 (Visit 8) or early terminat ion visit, regardless of their hepat itisB surface antibody (HBsAb ) status. The fo llowing acti ons shoul d be taken in response to HBV DNA test results: If a single result is obtained with a value “below limi t of quant itation,” the test shoul d be repeated wi thin approximately 2 weeks. If the repeat test result is “target not detected,” monitoring willresume for those patients enro lling in the long-term extensio n study , JAHN . If the patient has 2 or m ore test results with a value “below limit of quantitation” or a test result above the limit of quant itation, the patient will be permanently discontinued fro m invest igational product (see Section 8.1.2 ) and should be referred to a hepatology specialist . 9.4.9. Hepatic Safety Monitoring and Data Collection If a study patient experiences elevated ALT ≥3xULN, ALP ≥ 2xULN, or elevated TBL ≥2xULN, liver testing (Appendix 4 ) shoul d be repeated wi thin 3 to 5 days including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, and creat inekinase to confirm the abnorm ality and to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. If the abnormalit y persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by the invest igator and in consultation wit h the study medical mo nitor. Monitoring of ALT, AST, TBL, and ALP should continue until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline levels. Discontinuati on cri teria of investigational products, either temporary interruption or permanent discontinuat ion, due to abnormal ALT, AST , TBL, or ALP, are detailed in Section8.1. Addit ional safet y data should be co llected via the hepat ic eCRF if 1or more of the fo llowing condi tionsoccur: elevation of serum ALT to ≥5xULN on 2 or more consecut ive blood tests elevated serum TBL to ≥ 2xULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndro me) elevation of serum ALP to ≥ 2xULN on 2 or more consecut ive blood tests patient discont inued fro m treatm ent due to a hepatic event or abnormalit y of liver tests hepat ic event considered to be anSAE ."

Safety Monitoring Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate methods. In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the group l evel, only members of the DMC (an advisory group for this study formed to protect the integrit y of data [refer to Interim Analyses sectio n,Secti on10.3.7 ]) can conduct addit ional analyses o f the safet y data. The Lilly clinical research physician will m onitor safety data throughout the course of the study . Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by co mpany procedures. The Lilly clinical research physician will, as i s appropri ate, consul t with the f unctionally independent Gl obal Patient Safet y therapeutic area physician or clinical scient ist and peri odically review trends in safet y data and l aboratory analy tes. Any concerning trends in frequency or severit y noted by an investigator and/or Lilly (or designee) may require further evaluat ion. All deaths and SAE reports will be reviewed in a blinded manner by Lilly during the clinical trial. These reports will be reviewed to ensure completeness and accuracy but will not be unblinded to Lilly during the clinical trial. If a death or a clinical AE is deemed serious, unexpected, and possibly related to invest igational product, only Lilly Gl obal Patient Safety will be unblinded for regulatory reporting and safet y monitoring purposes. These measures will preserve the integrit y of the data collected during this trial and minimize any po tential for bias while providing for appropriate safet y monitoring. Invest igators will mo nitor vital signs and carefully review findings that may be associated with cardi ovascular and venous thrombotic events . Adverse event reports and vital signs will be collected at each study visit. The cardiovascular monitoring plan includes the fo llowing: regular monitoring of lipid l evels potenti al MA CE (cardi ovascular death, MI, stroke), other cardiovascular events (such as hospitalizat ion for unstable angina, hosp italizat ion for heart failure, serious arrhy thmia, resuscitated s udden death, cardiogenic shock, coronary revascularization such as coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervent ion ), venous thrombotic events and noncardi ovascular deaths w ill be ident ified by the investigative site or through medical review and will be sent to a blinded Clinical Event Committee for adjudicat ion at regul ar intervals. 9.5. Pharmacokinetics A venous blood sample will be drawn at the times indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2)(Weeks 0 [first dose, 2 samples] , 4, 8, 12, and 16). These blood samples will be used to determine the plasma concentrati ons of baricit inibusing a validated liquid chromatography"

Bl ood sam ples that will be used for other laboratory assessments (chemistry , hematol ogy, etc.) should be drawn at approximately the same t ime as the sam ples drawn to determine plasma concentratio ns of baricit inib. The timing will be as follows: At Visit 2 (Week 0), baseline laboratory samples should be taken before administration of invest igational product . Patients will take their investigational produ ct in the clinic, and PK samples will be drawn 15 minutes and 1 hour postdose. At Visit 5 (Week 4), pati ents will be asked to take their investigational product at home prior to visit ing the clinic. The clinic visit should be scheduled so that the blood s ample collected during this visit is drawn 2 to 4 hours after the dose is taken at home. For Visit 6 (Week 8) and Visit7 (Week 12)patients will be asked to not take their investigat ional product before visit ing the clinic, and a blood sample will be collected at any t ime predose on the day of the clinic visits. If the patient has taken the oral dose prior to the visit, the sample may be drawn anyt ime postdose, and the inabilit y to collect a predose sample will not be considered a protocol violation. At Visit8(Week 16), pati ents will be asked to take thei r invest igational product at hom e prior to visi ting the clinic. The clinic visit shoul d be scheduled so that the blood sample co llected during this visit is drawn 4 to 6 hours after the oral dose i staken at home. For the ETV , a sample may be drawn any time if the l ast dose of invest igational drug was taken within the last 48 hours. For vi sits where PK samples will be co llected, the actual date and 24 -hour clock time of sample collect ion, and the date and time of the last 2 doses prior to the sample being drawn, should be recorded. AtVisit 5 (Week 4) and Visit 8(Week 16), t hese 2 doses shoul dbe the dose given the morning o f the day of sample collect ion and the dose given the previous day. At Visit 6 (Week 8) and Visit 7 ( Week 12), the 2 previous doses shoul dbe the dose taken y esterday and the dose taken the day before that. This sampling schedule should be fo llowed as closely as possible; however, failure to take PK samples at these specified times will not be considered a protocol vio lation. If the patient fails to follow the di rections f or a parti cular visit, the sample should st ill be co llected at that visit, and the date and 24 -hour clock time of sample collect ion and the date and time of the 2 doses prior to the sam ple being drawn should be recorded. Only samples from pat ients receiving baricit inib will be assayed; samples from pat ients receiving placebo will not be assayed. Pharmacokinet icsamples will be kept in storage at a laboratory facilit y designated by the sponsor. Pharmacokinet icsamples m ay also be assayed for addit ional exploratory analyses. Pharmacokinet ic resul ts will not be provided to investigative sites unt il the completion ofthe study or to the blinded study team until the study has been unblinded."

Pharmacodynamics Not applicable . 9.7. Pharmacog enetics 9.7.1. Blood Sample sfor Pharmacogenetic Research A blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenetic analysis as specified in the Schedule o f Activities (Secti on2)where local regulat ions allo w . There is growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy . Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion, the mechanism of act ion of the drug, the disease etiology, and/or the m olecular subt ype of the di sease being treated. In the event of an unexpected AE, the samples may be genoty ped and analy sis may be performed to evaluate a genet ic associat ion with response to baricit inib. These invest igations may be limited to targeted exome sequencing approach of known targets involved in drug metabo lism or, if appropriate, geno me-wide associ ation studies may be perform ed to i dentify regio ns of the geno me associated with the variabilit y observed in drug response. Samples will only be used for investigations related to di sease and drug or class of drugs under study in the context of this clinical program. Samples will notbe used to conduct unspecified disease or populat ion genet ic research either now or in the future. Samples will be used to investigate variable response to baricit inib and to investigate genet ic variants though t to pl ay a rol e inADor ot her inflammatory skin diseases . Assessment of variable response may include evaluati on of AEs or differences in efficacy. All samples will be coded with the patientnumber. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patientonly by the invest igator site personnel. Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15years after the last patient visit for the study , or for a shorter peri od if local regulations and/or (ethical review boards ( ERBs )/invest igational review boards )impose shorter ti me limits, at a facilit y selected by Lilly . This retenti on peri od enables use of new techno logies, response to regulatory quest ions, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later in the development of baricitinib or after bar icitinib beco mes commercially available . Molecular techno logies are expected to improve during the 15 -year storage period and therefore cannot be specifically named. However, exist ing approaches include who le geno me or exome sequencing, geno me-wide associ ation studies, and candidate gene studies. Regardless of techno logy utilized ,genoty ping data generated will be used only for the specific research scope described in this sect ion."

Biomarkers Biomarker research is performed to address questions of relevance to drug di sposi tion, target engagement, pharmacodynamic s (PD), mechanism of act ion, variabilit y of pat ient response (including safet y), and clinical outcome. Sample collect ion is incorporat ed into clinical studies to enable examinat ion of these quest ions through measurement of bio molecules including DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular elements. Bloodsamples for non pharmaco geneti c biomarker research will be co llected at the times specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2)where local regulat ions allow. Samples will be used for research on the drug target, disease process, variable response to baricit inib, pathways associated with AD, mechanism of action of baricit inib, and/or research method or i n validat ing diagnost ic tools or assay(s) related to AD. All samples will be coded with the patientnumber. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patientonly by the invest igator site personnel. Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15years after the last patient visit for the study ,or for a shorter peri od if local regulations and ERBs impose shorter time limit s, at a facilit y selected byLilly .

The proposed sample size will ensure a >90% power to detect an abso lute difference of 20% between the baricit inib 4-mg and placebo treatment group sand the baricit inib 2-mg and placebo treatm ent group s, each using a 2 -sided alpha of 0.0 25,assuming a 10% placebo response rate for the primary endpoint. The assumpt ions are based on what was observed in the Phase 2 study (JAHG) . The proposed end point of IGA 0or 1 represents pati ents whose AD is cl ear or alm ost clear from a baseline of moderate or severe disease. The ant icipated effect size represents 3times m ore pati ents achieving this benefit compared to placebo ,which, in discussio n with therapeuti c experts, i s of a magnitude that is considered clinically relevant. Sample size and power estimates were obtained from nQuery ® Advisor 7.0. 10.2. Populations for Analyses Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy and heal th outcom e analyses will be conducted on the intent-to-treat populat ion, defined as all randomized patients ,even if the patient does not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise d idnot fo llow the protocol. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned. Significant protocol vio lation s will be described in the SAP. Safety analyses will be done on all rando mized patients who receive at least 1 dose of investigat ional product and who did not discontinue fro m the study for the reason “Lost to Follow -up” at the first postbaseline visit. Further details of other populat ions will be described in the SAP. Patients will be analyzed according to the dosing regimen to which they were assigned in the Treatment Period. 10.3. Statistical Analyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibilit y of Lilly o r its desi gnee. Adetailed SAP describing the statist ical methodol ogies will be developed by Lilly or i ts desi gnee. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendm ent ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report (CSR) . Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided al pha level of 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables between baricit inib and placebo will be made using a logist ic regressio n analysis wit h regi on, di sease severi ty,and treatm ent group in the model. The percentages, difference in percentages, and 95% confidence interval"
62,page_62,"I4V-MC-JAHL(a)Clinical Protocol Page 62 LY3009104(CI) of the difference in percentages will be reported. Treatment -by-region interacti on will be added to the logist ic regressio n model of the primary and key secondary variables as a sensit ivity analysis. If this interaction is significant at a 2- sided 0.1 l evel, further inspect ion will be used to assess whether the interacti on is quant itative ( i.e., the treatment effect is consistent in direct ion but not size o f effect) or qualitat ive (the treatment is beneficial for some but not all regions). The p-value fro m the Fisher exact test will also be produced. When evaluat ingcontinuous measures over time, a restricted maximum likelihood -based mixed -effects model ofrepeated m easures (MMRM) will be used. The model will include treatm ent, regi on, baseline severi ty, visi t, and treatment -by-visit interact ion as fixed c ategori cal effects and baseline score and baseline score-by- visitinteracti on as fixed continuous effects. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the between -and within -patient errors. If this analysis fails to converge, other stru ctures will be tested. The Kenward–Roger m ethod will be used to estimate the degrees of freedo m. Type III sums of squares for the least squares means (LSMs) will be used for the statist ical com parison; 95% CI will also be reported. Contrasts will be set up within the model to test treatment groups at specific time po ints of interest. Further details on the use of MMRM will be described in the SAP. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables may also be made using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with region, disease severit y, treatm ent group ,and baseline value in the model. Ty peIII tests for LS Mwill be used for statistical co mpar ison between treatment groups. The LSM difference, standard error, p -value, and 95% CI may also be reported. The method used to handle missing data will be specified in the SAP. Fisher exact test will be used for the AEs, discont inuat ion, and other categorical safet y data for between -treatm ent group com parisons. Continuous vital signs, body weight, and other continuous safet y variables including laboratory variables will be analyzed by an ANCOVA with treatm ent and baseline value in the model. Shift tables for categorical safet y analyses ( e.g., “high”or “low”laboratory resul ts) will also be p roduced. Missing data imputation: 1.Nonresponder imputation (NRI): All patients who discont inue the study or the study treatm ent at any time for any reason will be defined as nonresponders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables such as IGA 0/1 or EASI 50/75/90 after discontinuat ionand onward. Patients who receive rescue therapy will be analyzed as nonresponders afterrescue and onward. An addit ional analysis will be performedthat includes all available data whether rescue medicat ion was given or not. 2.MMRM: Continuous variables such as EASI and SCORAD scores will be assumed to be missing afterrescue or discontinuation and then anMMRM analysis will be perform ed. An additional analysis will be performed that includes all available data whether rescue medicat ion was given or not . 3. L ast observed carried forward (LOCF) : An addit ional analysis will be performedthat uses the last observed value on or prior to discont inuat ion or res cue therapy . Thi s will"

Addit ional sensitivityanalyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints such as tipping po int analyses as well as a reference based mult iple imputation method may be done and will be specified in the SAP. Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons: Multiplicity controlled analyses will be performed on the primary and maj or secondary endpoints to con trol the overall family -wise Ty peI error rate at a 2 -sided α level o f 0.05. The graphical multiple testi ng procedure described in Bretz et al. (2011) will be used. The graphical approach is a closed testing procedure ;hence it strongly controls the family -wise error rate across all endpo ints (Alosh et al. 2014). Details of the specific graphical testing scheme (including testing order, interrelat ionships, Ty peI error allocat ion, and the associated propagation) will be prespecified in the SAP. The fo llowing i s a list of primary and keysecondary endpo intsto be test ed: Primary: proporti on of baricit inib 4 -mg patients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 and ≥2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16. proporti on of baricit inib 2 -mg patients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 and ≥2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16.

Data Monitoring Committee membership will include, at a minimum, specialist s with expertise in dermatology , stati stics, and other appropriate specialt ies. The DMC will be authori zed to revi ew unblinded re sults of analyses by treatm ent group pri or to database lock ,including study discont inuat ion data, AEs including SAEs, clinical laboratory data, vital sign data, etc. The DMC may reco mmend continuation o f the study , as designed; temporary suspensi on of enrollment; or the discontinuat ion of a particular dose regimen or the entire study . While t he DMC may request to review efficacy data to investigate the benefit /risk relationship in the context of safet y observations for ongoing patients in the study , no information regarding efficacy will be communicated . Moreover , the study will not be stopped for posi tive efficacy resul tsnor will it be stopped for fut ility. Hence, no alpha is spent. Details of the DMC , including its operating characterist ics,will be docum ented in a DMC charter and DMC analysis plan. Besides DMC members, a limited number of pre -ident ified individuals may gain access to the limited unblinded data, as specified in the unblinding plan, prior to the interim or final database lock to ini tiate the final populat ion PK/PD model development processes or for preparation of regul atory docum ents.

Eczema Area and Severity Index Scores The EASI assesses extent of disease at 4 body regions and measures 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulat ion, (3) excoriat ion, and (4) lichenificat ion each on a scale of 0to 3. The EASI confers a maximum score of 72. The EASI evaluates 2 dimensio ns of AD: disease extent and clinical signs (Hani fin et al. 2001). 9.1.2.2. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis The SCORing Atopic Dermat itis (SCORAD) index uses the rule o f nines to assess disease extent and evaluates 6 clinical characterist ics to determine disease severit y: (1) ery thema, (2) edem a/papulati on, (3) oozing/crusts, (4) excoriation, (5) lichenificat ion, and (6) dryness. The SCORAD index also assesses subject ive symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss. These 3 aspects: extent of disease, disease severit y, and subjective symptoms combine to give a maximum possible score of 103 (Stalder et al . 1993; Kunz e t al. 1997; Schram et al. 2012) . 9.5. Pharmacokinetics A venous blood sample will be drawn at the times indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2) (Weeks 0 [first dose, 2 samples], 4, 8, 12, and 16). These blood samples will be used to determine the plasma concentrati ons of baricit inib using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Bl ood sam ples that will be used for other laboratory assessments (chemistry , hematol ogy, etc.) shoul d be drawn at approximately the same t ime as the sam ples drawn to determine plasma concentratio ns of baricit inib. The timing will be as follows: At Visit 2 (Week 0),baseline laboratory samples should be taken before administration of invest igational product . pPatients will take their investigational product in the clinic, and PK samples will be drawn 15 minutes and 1 hour postdose. 10.1. Sample Size Determination Study JAHL will aim to enroll approximately 600 patients ≥18years o f age. The proposed sample size will ensure a >90% pow er to detect an absolute difference of 20% between the baricit inib 4-mg and placebo treatment group sand the baricit inib 2 -mg and placebo treatment group s, each using a 2- sided alpha of 0.025, assuming a 10% placebo response rate for the primary endpoint using a 2 sided al pha of 0.05 ."

Gener al Statistical Considerations … All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 sided alpha level o f 0.05, unl ess otherwise stated. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables between baricit inib and placebo will be made using a logist icregressio n analysis wit h regi on, di sease severi ty, and treatm ent group in the model. The percentages, difference in percentages, and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in percentages will be reported. Treatment by region interacti on will be added to the logist ic regressio n model of the primary and key secondary variables as a sensit ivity analysis. If this interaction is significant at a 2 sided 0.1 level, further inspect ion will be used to assess whether the interaction is quant itative (i.e. , the treatment effect is consistent in direct ion but not size o f effect) or qualitat ive (the treatment is beneficial for some but not all regions). When logist ic regressio n sample size requirements are not met (<5 responders in any category for any factor), tThe p-value from the Fisher exact test will also be isproduced instead of the odds rati o and CI . … Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons: … The fo llowing i s a list of primary and keysecondary endpo intsto be test ed: Primary: proporti on of baricit inib 4-mg patients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 and ≥2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16. proporti on of baricitinib 2 -mg pat ients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 and ≥2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16.
