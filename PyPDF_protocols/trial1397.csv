The trial will be financed by research funding of the clinic (E-rare/DFG) . Insurance A patient's insurance in accordance to § 40 (1) and (3) No.8 AMG will be completed by the sponsor (the insurance policy number will be filed subsequently) . Risk Benefit Assessment Nicotinamide is a classical class III HDAC inhibitor (Vaquero et al., 2007 ), has a good bioavailability , rapidly penetrates all tissues, and readily crosses the blood brain barrie r (Hoane et al., 2006 ; Spector and Kelley, 1979 ). Nicotinamide has over the past forty years been given at high doses for a variety of therapeutic applications. A review on safety of high -dose nicotinamide has revealed that the therapeutic index of nicotinamide is wide but at very high doses reversible hepatotoxicity has been reported in animals and humans (Knip et al., 2000 ). Minor abnormalities of liver enzymes can infrequently occur at the high or mega doses. There is no evidence of teratogenicity from animal studies and nicotinamide is not in itself oncog enic; at very high doses it does however potentiate islet tumor formation in rats treated with streptozotocin or alloxan. There is no evidence of oncogenicity in man. Growth inhibition can occur in rats but growth in children is unaffected. High -dose nicot inamide should still, however, be considered as a drug with toxic potential at adult doses in excess of 3 g/day and only applied under supervision. To our knowledge nicotinamide has been applied in Friedreich´s ataxia in such high doses (> 3 g) only in the exploratory, open -label, dose -escalation study in Friedreich´s ataxia in the UK (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01589809) (Libri et al., 2014 ). Nicotinamide has been given safely for 5 years at about 3 g (1.2 g/m2) per day to more than 250 individuals including children from 3 years and above, adolescents and adults in an attempt to prevent diabetes in an at -risk population (Gale et al., 2004 ). No serious adverse effects were observed. In a recent exploratory, open -label and dose -escalation study on t en patients with Friedreich ataxia, nicotinamide was given in single doses, 2 -8 g per day oral nicotinamide for 5 days and 8 weeks (Libri et al., 2014 ). Nicotinamide was generally well tolerated with nausea being the most frequent dose -related adverse event in this study; this was readily controlled with the use of antiemetics and by modification of the dose. Here, nicotinamide was rapidly absorbed after o ral administration and generally well tolerated in Friedreich´s ataxia patients after repeated daily dosing for 8 weeks.

It is caused by a pathological expansion of a GAA repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene (FXN) and results in decreased levels of FXN protein. FXN deficiency results i n a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative condition which frequently presents around puberty. Patients gradually lose coordination, become dysarthric and are frequently wheel -chair bound as adolescents. There is no disease modifying therapy and many p atients die prematurely of cardiomyopathy. It was subsequently found that the FXN gene is silenced at the chromatin level by the formation of heterochromatin and that this heterochromatin formation can be antagonized by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC i) (Chan et al., 2013 ). A recent proof -of-concept clinical study o n ten patients with Friedreich ataxia demonstrated that FXN levels can be restored to those seen in asymptomatic carriers using the class III HDACi nicotinamide at a dose that is well tolerated by patients (Libri et al., 2014 ). Since carriers are asymptomatic, this degree of restoration of FXN expression might be expected to halt disease progression. Nicoti nami de readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has previously been given at high doses for long periods to normal individ uals without serious adverse effects (Gale et al., 2004 ; Knip et al., 2000 ). This study will be the first to provide clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of nicotinamide in patients with Friedreich´s ataxia. Primary Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of daily doses of nicotinamide in slowing disease progression as measured by changes in the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) as compared with placebo in patients with Friedreich´s ataxia."

Adult patients will receive nicotinam ide 4 g p.d. or placebo for a period of 24 months (minimum dose: 2 g p.d. ). The blood chemistry will be evaluated at screening, baseline as well as 1, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of the therapy. If a patient is eligible to participate in the study according to the in - and exclusion criteria the patient will randomly be assigned to one of the two treatment arms. The randomisation of eligible patients will take place after all screening examinations are complete d and prior to the treatment phase. A randomisation code will be assigned for each randomised patient. This code will be used to label all information that are gathered for each patient (e.g. blood sampl es and case report forms (CRFs) and to label the stud y medication. The Randomisation list will be prepared by Department of Medical Statistics of the RWTH Aachen University Hospital, using randomiz eR.

It is caused by a pathological expansion of a GAA repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene (FXN) and results in decreased levels of FXN protein. FXN deficiency results i n a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative condition which frequently presents around puberty. Patients gradually lose coordination, become dysarthric and are frequently wheel -chair bound as adolescents. There is no disease -modifying therapy and many p atients die prematurely of cardiomyopathy. It was subsequently found that the FXN gene is silenced at the chromatin level by the formation of heterochromatin and that this heterochromatin formation can be antagonized by histone deacetylase inhibi tors (HDAC i) (Chan et al., 2013 ). A recent proof -of- concept clinical study on ten patients with Friedreich´s ataxia demonstrated that FXN levels can be restored to those seen i n asymptomatic carriers using the class III HDACi nicotinamide at a dose that is well tolerated by patients (Libri et al., 2014 ). Since carriers are asymptomatic, this degree of restoration of FXN expression might be expected to halt disease progression. Nicotinamide readily crosse s the blood brain barrier and has previously been given at high doses for long periods to normal individuals without serious adverse effects (Gale et al., 2004 ; Knip et al., 2000 ). This study will be the first to provide clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of nicotinami de in patients with Friedreich ataxia. 2.1 Description of evidence and medical need Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive inherited ataxia. This devastating and incurable neurodegenerative disease often manifests in childhood and in many cases leads to severe disability by early adulthood. Although FRDA is th e most common hereditary ataxia in caucasian populations, however, with an estimated prevalence of about 2 –4/100 ,000 people, it remains a rare disease (Schulz et al., 2009 ) In 1996, the genetic mutation that underlies most Friedreich ataxia cases (Campuzano et al., 1996 ) was discovered as a homozygous pathological expansion of GAA triplet repeats in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene, which encodes for the mitochondrial protein frataxin. FXN deficiency results in spinocerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, proximal weakness, sensory loss and cardiomyopathy, and leads to dependence on a wheelchair and reduced life expectancy with a mean of 20 years after disease onset . Many Friedreich ataxia patients die from cardiomyopathy. To date, there is no disease -modifying therapy for this disabling progressive disease. Before a phase IIa trial (Libri et al., 2014 ) with nicotinamide was initiated in patients, careful preclinical studies were performed. First, nicotinamide was tested on EBV -transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (Chan et al., 2013 ). Modest up -regulation of FXN mRNA levels was obtained in patient -derived cell lines with relatively little effect on FXN expression in the normal control cell line. Second, to assess the effect of nicotinamide under more physiological conditions, fresh primary lymph ocytes derived fro m Friedreich ataxia -affected or normal healthy individuals were treated. A small effect (2 -fold increase) in FXN mRNA level was produced for healthy primary cells after nicotinamide treatment suggesting that minor chromatin effects might occur at the healt hy FXN locus. Notably, the increase in FXN mRNA level in Friedreich ataxia individuals was much larger (4.5 -fold). Third, in Friedreich ataxia transgenic mice (Al-Mahdawi et al., 2006 ) treated with nicotinamide for 6 days with a dose of"
19,page_19,"Protocol AMG -NICOFA - CTC-A-No.: 15-138 V03.4, 05.12.2018 Principal Investigator Site EudraCT - No.: Univ. -Prof. Dr. med. Jörg Schulz Department of Neurology – University Hospital Aachen 2017 -002163 -17 PM12TL02_AMG_Protocol_V01_2017 Page 20 of 63 750 mg/kg increa ses of FXN mRNA expression were found in all Friedreich´s ataxia – relevant tissues and the most substantial increases, in terms of fold up -regulation, were observed in spinal cord and cerebellum with 1.8 -fold up -regulation of frataxin (Chan et al. , 2013 ). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that nicotinamide can reactivate the silenced FXN gene in both human Friedreich ataxia cells and in vivo transgenic Friedreich´s ataxia models. Also, mechanistic preclinical investigations were performed. Treating prima ry lymphocytes from Friedreich ataxia patients with nicotinamide strongly reduced the disease -associated increase in histone H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylations and increased the histone acet ylation at the FXN gene. Furthermore, the DNase I accessibility at the FXN gene was increased in Friedreich ataxia patient cells. High -throughput RNA sequencing on libraries generated from untreated and nicotinamide -treated Friedreich ataxia primary lympho cytes revealed that 67% of the genes known to be dysregulated in Friedreich´s ataxia was ameliorated by the treatment. Thus, it was demonstrated that expanded GAA -triplet repeats can induce gene silencing in vivo leading to the archetypal epigenetic gene silencing phenomenon of position effect variegation (PEV) (Saveliev et al., 2003 ). This GAA -repeat silencing was exquisitely sensitive to the gene dosage of PEV modifiers which encode enzymes that modify chromatin. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the FXN gene is silenced at the chromatin level by the formation of heterochromatin. This heterochromatin formation can be antagonized by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) (Chan et al., 2013 ). Nicotinamide is a classical class III HDACi. 2.2 Rationale and Clinical Evidence Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal -recessive inherited disorder due to a gene mutation resulting in expansion of a repeating DNA sequence (GAA) which partia lly switches off the frataxin gene. The deficiency of frataxin causes the disease. A recent exploratory, open -label and dose - escalation study on ten patients with Friedreich´s ataxia demonstrated that frataxin levels can be restored towards asymptomatic ca rrier levels using nicotinamide (Libri et al., 2014 ). Friedreich ataxia patients were given single doses, as well as repeated daily doses of 2 -8 g oral nicotinamide for 5 days and 8 weeks. Nicotinamide was generally well tolerated with nausea being the most frequent dose -related adverse event in this study. In addition nicotinamide has a good bioavailability and rapidly penetrates all tissues, readily crosses the blood brain barrier, and has previously been given at high doses from 1.2 g/m2 up to 3 g/d for long periods (up to 5 years) to normal individuals including children from 3 years and above, adolescents and adults without serious adverse effects (Gale et al., 2004 ). Moreover, a sensitive clinical rating measure to assess disease progression, the Scale for t he Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) is now available, which was proved most suitable to measure clinical disease progression within the registry of the European Friedreich´s Ataxia Consortium for Translational Studies (EFACTS, www.e -facts.eu) framework. Other current clinical trials in Friedreich ataxia (based on www.clinicaltrial s.gov) stratified by their mechanism of action are: I. Antioxidants and mitochondrial enhancers: Two phase 3 trials using idebenone as a mitochondrial enhancer and anti oxidant showed a negative outcome (Lynch et al., 2010 ) despite a very positive phase 2 trial (Di Prospero et al., 2007 ). The antioxidant α-tocopheryl quinone (A0001) was tested in a randomized placebo -controlled phase 2"

There is no registered follow -up trial. The approach to scav enge mitochondrial iron overload with deferiprone resulted in a negative outcome in a randomized, placebo -controlled phase 2 trial. There is an ongoing phase 2 trial using the Nrf -2 activator RTA -408 to improve mitochondrial function (NCT02255435). II. Frataxin stabilizers, enhancers and replacement: Erythropoietin has been shown to increase frataxin protein concentration by posttranscriptional/ -translational mechanisms (Mariotti et al., 2013 ). However, a long term study of 48 weeks did not show any neurological improvement and did not replicate the findings of frataxin up - regulation in PBMCs (Sacca et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, frataxin up -regulation was not replicated in a phase 2 trial with carbamylate d erythropoietin (Boesch et al., 2014 ). III. Increase of frataxin gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms: In addition to the strategy of using nicotinamide as a HDAC inhibitor, a specific HDAC class 1 inhibitor, RG 2833 (or HDACi 109), was developed and similarly to nicotinamide showed an increase in frataxin mRNA and protein expression in the blood of patients with Friedreich ataxia in a phase 2 trial (Soragni et al., 2014 ). However, the development of this drug was discontinued due to side -effects and poor penetration of the blood brain barrier. An effect of resveratrol to increase frataxin expression in PBMCs could not be demonstrated in a phase 2 trial (Yiu et al., 2015 ). In a non -blinded twelve -week phase 2 trial subcutaneous injection of interferon γ -1b led to a small but significant increase in frataxin levels in red blood cells, platelets and PBMCs (Seyer et al., 2015 ). A phase 3 trial on interferon γ -1b in the US was initiated (NCT02415127) but had a negative outcome (press release). IV. Increase of frataxin gene expression by virus -mediated gene transfer: In animal models, very promising results have been published to treat manifest cardiomyopathy with AAV -mediated gene (Perdomini et al., 2014 ). Similar results using viral gene transfer with tropism to DRG neurons do not exist so far. Although our knowledge about the pathophysiological processes and clinical progression has increased substantially over the last years, all vigorous international attempts to establish a disease -modifying therapy for Friedreich ataxia have failed to show any beneficial effect. Thus, many patients are severely disabled by adulthood or die prematu rely of cardiomyopathy. Previous clinical trials have all focus sed on attempts to ameliorate the downstream effects of FXN deficiency (Perlman, 2012 ). They all lacked statistical significance, indicating that more specific and potent candidate drugs, as well as more sensitive clinical measures and better - powered clinical trial designs are needed. Recent research now provides both, (1) a novel and radical therapeutic cost -effective approach to restore FXN expression, and (2) sensitive clinical measures. If successful, this therapeutic approach could be applied to the growing number of diseases which have been shown to be caused by a similar mechanism."

To date, there is no cure or treatment that can slow down the disease which frequently results in severe disability by early adulthood. Patients become progressiv ely more dependent on carers and frequently die prematu rely of heart disease. This multinational study NICOFA will investigate whether nicotinamide is an effective treatment for Friedreich´s ataxia. 3.1 Primary objectives The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of daily doses of nicotinam ide in slowing disease progression as measured by changes in the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) as compared with place bo in patients with Friedreich ataxia. 3.2 Secondary objective Secondary objectives are to determine the change of seco ndary endpoints such as quality of life, functional motor and cognitive measures , clinician ’s and patient’s global impression - change scales as well as the up -regulation of the frataxin protein level , safety and survival/death . 3.3 Tertiary objectives Tertiary objectives are mainly neuroimaging measures of the central nervous system (spin al cord and brain) ."

The lists will be sent to the pharmacy before packaging the treatments. The packaging will be done at the pharmacy of the University in Mainz , Germany . The pharmacy will send out the packages (placebo or drug) that are labelled according to the randomization list. 4.1.2 Management of IMP Administration of IMP to patients will be delegated to the responsible study nurse by the investigator. The study nurse will document charge number, expire date and randomization number and will maintain the drug accountability log (including return o f IMP by patients). 4.1.3 Administration of IMP Subjects will receive an oral dose of 4 g/d nicotinamide (pyridine -3-carboxylic amide, [formula C6H6N2O]) or a dose of placebo once a day for the time period of two years. 4.1.4 Advice for using the IMP Subjects will be instructed to take the study medication once a day (4g/d or placebo , 8 capsules ) in the morning after breakfast at approximately the same time a day throughout the study. Subjects will swallow the study medication whole, and will not manipulate or chew the medication prior to swallowing. Daily dosing of 3.5 -6 g has been shown to up regulate frataxin expression . However, treatment above 4 g/d (such as 6 -8 g/d) is associated with nausea. Our experience is that if nicotinamide is introduced gradually nausea is frequently transient and resolves over a few days. To maintain blinding, there will be a Phase A (weeks 1 -4): All patients will be slowly titrated with an increase of 0.5 g nicotinamide every three days up to a dose of 4 g/d ay [titration would be: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 g per day ]. Thus, the titration period will be three weeks, patients should then be stable on 4g per day or the highest tolerated dose for one week. If nausea or vomiting occur it is at the dis cretion of the investigator to flexible reduce the dosing and then reach the highest possible dose. Domperidone as first choice medication (1 -3 x 10 mg/day) and/or metoclopramide as second choice (1 -3 x 10 mg/day) may be used individually as rescue treatme nts. Phase B (week 5 - 104): Phase A is immediately followed by a 2:1 randomization. Randomization includes safety visit. ⅓ of the FRDA patients will be withdrawn from active"

The switch from phase A to phase B will be done without discontinuation of treatment to prevent a second titration period. Again, i n the event of nausea, the dose will be ad justed and the patient will be maintained on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A telephone safety assessment following each dose increment will allow dose -adjustment if necessary. The minimal dose would be 2 g/d. Dose escalation will be adjusted or stopped on the basis of tolerability and anti-nausea treatments will be given when needed. Drug will be dispensed to the subject at each clinic visit. Between clinic visits, subjects will be responsible for establishing a process for reliable outpatient dosing to ensure dosing compliance. To facilitate compliance assessment, a dosing diary will be supplied to the subject, who will be instructed to record the time for each daily dose s of study medication. Subjects will be instructed to bring the completed diary to the clinic at the time of each visit, along the used and in -use packs to assess compliance. If a subject misses a scheduled dose, that dose should be taken as soon as possible, but not later than 12 hours beyond the scheduled time of administration. If it is greater than 12 hours beyond the scheduled dose, the subject should be instructed to skip that dose and resume dosing at the next regularly sched uled time. Missed doses and reasons for missed dos es should be recorded on the dosing diary. Storage conditions: Receipt, usage and return must be documented on the respective forms for Drug Accountability of the Center for Translational & Clinical Research Aachen . Account will be given for any discrepancy. See instruction of use (SmPC). 4.2 Placebo The approved manufacturer pharmacists at the University of Mainz in Germany will further provide an oral dose of placebo with identical appearance. 4.3 Preclinical data of Nicotinamide See Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). 4.4 Benefit Risk Assessment Nicotinamide is a classical class III HDAC inhibitor (Vaquero et al., 2007 ), has a good bioavailability and rapidly penetrates all tissues, readily crosses the blood brain barrier (Hoane et al., 2006 ; Spector and Kelley, 1979 ). Nicotinamide has over the past forty years been given at high doses for a variety of therapeutic applications. A review on safety of high -dose nicotinamide has revealed that the therapeutic index of nicotinamide is wide but at very high doses reversible hepatotoxicity has been reported in animals and humans (Knip et al., 2000 ). Minor abnormalities of liver enzymes can infrequently occur at the high or mega doses. There is no evidence of teratogenicity from animal studies and nicotinamide is not in itself oncogenic; at very high doses it does however pote ntiate islet tumor formation in rats treated with streptozotocin or alloxan. There is no evidence of oncogenicity in man. Growth inhibition can"

High -dose nicotinamide should still, however, be considered as a drug with toxic potential at adult doses in excess of 3 g/day and only applied under supervision. To our knowledge nicotinamide has been applied in Friedreich ataxia in such high doses (> 3 g) only in the exploratory, open -label, dose -escalation study in Friedreich´s ataxia in the UK (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01589809) (Libri et al., 2014 ). Nicotinamide having been given safely for 5 years at about 3 g (1.2 g/m2) per day to more than 250 individuals including children from 3 years and above, adolescents and adults in an attempt to prevent diabetes in an at -risk population (Gale et al., 2004 ). No serious adverse effects were observed. In a recent exploratory, open -label and dose -escalation study on ten patients with Friedreich ataxia (Libri et al., 2014 ), nicotinamide was given single doses, repeated daily doses of 2 -8 g oral nicotinamide for 5 days and 8 weeks. Nicotinamide was generally well tolerated with nausea being the most frequent dose -related adverse event in this study; this was readily controll ed with the use of antiemetic’s and by modification of the dose. Here, nicotinamide was rapidly absorbed after oral administration and generall y well tolerated in Friedreich ataxia patients after repeated daily dosing for 8 weeks. 4.5 Known adverse events for Nicotinamide The following most common adverse events have been described in the exploratory, open - label, dose -escalation study by (Libri et al., 2014 ): Nausea, headache, lightheadedness, vomiting , hypersomnia, fatigue, diarrhea, ra ised AST and ALT , falls, anorexia, migraine, dizziness, sore throat, retching, cold, fever, infections, cough, anemia, flu -like symptoms. 4.5.1 Dose -Response Assessment The following section accords the Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on the tolerable upper in take levels of Nicotinamide, European Commission, Brussels, Belgium 17 -April-2002: Vasodilatory effects (flushing) The flushing reported with nicotinic acid does not occur following nicotinamide, either given as an intravenous injection (Bean and Spies, 1940 ) or when i t is given orally at high -doses to patients with diabetes (Knip et al., 2000 ). Gastrointestinal effects Gastrointestinal effects are rare following high -dose treatment with nicotinamide (Knip et al., 2000 ). Nausea was reported in a sing le subject who had taken nicotinamide 3 g daily followed by 9 g per day for sever al days (Winter and Boyer, 1973 ). Hepatotoxicity Only one patient has been reported to have developed hepatitis after nicotinamide alone, and this subject had been given 3 g daily followed by 9 g per day for several days (Winter and Boyer, 1973 ); other subjects who developed liver disease after nicotinamide had also received prolonged treatment with nico tinic acid (Rader et al., 1992 ). Increased serum transaminase levels were reported for 17 out of 41 children with attention deficit disorders treated for 12 weeks with daily doses of 3 g nicotinamide, in combination with"

Whether this hepatotoxi c effect was related to the high dose of nicotinamide, or to the combination with the high doses of pantothenic acid, vitamin C and pyridoxine, cannot be concluded from this study, and therefore, this study cannot be used in risk assessment of nicotinamide . The supplementation trials on the use of nicotinamide to prevent or delay the development of diabetes mellitus have not reported hepatitis as an adverse effect (Knip et al., 2000 ); however these have involved smaller number of subjects, have been of shorter duration and at lower doses than the trials on the use of nicotinic acid for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Ten newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetic patients were given 1 g/ day for 45 days (Mendola et al., 1989 ), and compared over the following year with a group who were treated with placebo; the authors reported that no adverse effects were observed when physical, biochemical and haematological parameters were considered (no details of the tests were given and the main aim of the paper was to study efficacy). A group of 35 patients, aged 6 to 18 years, were given either placebo (n=17), or up to 1.5 g/day of slow -release nicotinamide (n=18) for 12 months (Chase et al., 1990 ); various tests, including measurement of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase an d bilirubin, were performed after 4 and 12 months, and remained normal in all subjects. No adverse effects were reported in a group of nine Type 1 diabetic patients with ketosis given 3 g of nicotinamide per day, three of whom were treated for up to 12 mon ths, compared to 7 similar patients given placebo (Vague et al., 1987 ). Major long -term studies in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, at dosages of 2 -3 g of nicotinamide per day, have been undertaken recently [ ENDIT - (Pociot et al., 1993 ); IMDIAB III - (Pozzilli et al., 1995 ); DENIS - (Lampeter et al., 1998 )]. The ENDIT (European Nicotinamide Diabetes Intervention Trial) has reviewed the safety data on nicotinamide before starting the clinical phase, but no results of the trial have yet been published (Knip et al., 2000 ; Pociot et al., 1993 ). The IMDIAB III study involved a double -blind trial in which 28 newly diagnosed patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus were given 25 mg/kg bw of nicotinamide daily for 12 months, and a similar number treated with placebo; no adverse effects were reported and biochemical parameters including liver and kidney function were normal during follow -up (the publication describes the measurement of bilirubin). The DENIS trial (Deutsche Nicotinamide Intervention Study) was a study in young children (average age 3 years) at high risk of developing Type 1 diabetes mellitus in whic h 25 subjects were randomized to receive nicotinamide (1.2 g per m2 per day), and 30 to receive placebo; the trial continued for 3 years and during this period all biochemical markers (including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and bili rubin) were in the normal range. Cardiac Events In mo re than 40% of patients with FRDA the heart is affected as well. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of premature death in Friedreich Ataxia, by arrhythmia or cardiac failure, reducing life expectancy to 29 to 38 years. Thus, we expect ongoing cardiac events during the study and the cardiac situation needs and will be controlled upon a regular basis (see study design)."

Jörg Schulz Department of Neurology – University Hospital Aachen 2017 -002163 -17 PM12TL02_AMG_Protocol_V01_2017 Page 27 of 63 Glucose intolerance Nicotinamide has been studied in relation to reducing the risk of the development of diabetes mellitus; none of the studies (see above) has reported a worsening of symptoms in the treated groups. Other effects and overall dose -response relationships There have been no other adverse effects reported following the administration of nicotinamide in trials in patients with diabetes. Determination of the NOAEL from the intervention trials is difficult, because of the different dosage regimens employed. Studies have used fixed doses of 1 g/day (Mendola et al., 1989 ), 1.5 g/day (Chase et al., 1990 ), 3 g/day (Vague et al., 1987 ), 25 mg/kg bw/day (IMDIAB III trial) and 1.2 g/m2/day (DENIS trial). These different doses can be calculated on a body weight basis using the data on body weights or ages in the different publications; the doses approximate to 17 mg/kg bw/day [(Mendola et al., 1989 ); average age 18.3 years), 37 mg/kg bw/day (Chase et al., 1990 ); average age 12.5 years), 43 mg/kg bw/day adults (Vague et al., 1987 ), 25 mg/kg bw/day (IMDIAB III trial; ages in the range 5 -35 years) and 50 -40 mg/kg bw/day (DENIS trial; ages 3 -12 years] . The lowest of these values (25 mg/kg bw/day) was from one of the largest published studies, and this has been used as the NOAEL for nicotinamide."

Thus, the titration period will be three weeks, patients should then be stable on 4g/d or the highest tolerated dose for one week. Phase A is immediately followed by a 2:1 randomization. Phase B (weeks 5 -104): Multicent re, prospective, controlled, double -blind, randomized, two arm parallel, placebo -controlled, phase IIb/III study, with a 2:1 allocation ratio. Nicotinamide Group (2/3): Nicotinamide 4 g ( capsules ) or highest tolerated dose with a minimum of 2 g/d per os once daily Placebo Group (1/3): Matching Placebo ( capsules ) once daily 5.2 Study Duration The recruitment of patients for the inclusion of the study will start 2019. The expected duration of study inclusion will be 12 months; the study will be 24 months per patient and in total 36 months including evaluation and clinical study report . 5.3 Stratification The study will be stratified according to center. There are ten centers to be included in the trial : Aachen, Bonn, Tübingen, Munich (all in Germany), Innsbruck (Austria) , Milan (Italy) , Paris (France) , 2x London (ICL & UCL, UK) and Madrid (Spain ). Accordingly, the randomi zation list prepared by Department of Medical Statistics of the RWTH Aachen University Hospital, using randomizeR is stratified by center. The packaging following the randomization list will be done in Mainz, Germany, labelled and A or B . The allocation of the nicotinamide or placebo group to A or B will be balanced by study site. This will maintain concealment and double blinded trea tment allocation. 5.4 Allocation Ratio Patients will be allocated to treatment groups by randomi zation stratified by center . The Randomisation list will be prepared by Department of Medical Statistics of the RWTH Aachen University Hospital, using randomiz eR. A 2:1 allocation ratio favouring the active treatment is intended. To make the trial more attractive to FRDA patients, we will use a 2:1 randomisation , in which the probability that a patient is assigned to the experimental treatment arm is 2/3. The best practice randomization procedure to minimize the impact of selection and time trend bias on the type one error will be selected via a simulation study (ERDO)."

Medical History Details of any history of disease , medical history, or clinical relevant surgical interventions . Concomitant Medication All over -the-counter or prescription medication, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements will be recorded on CRFs. Physical Examination / Vital signs Height, weight and body temperature will be recorded on CRFs. Resting pulse, blood pressure (BP) and respir atory rate measurements will be measured after the participant has sat for at least five minutes. Questionnaire about physical exercise (QPE) At each visit, physical exercise performance of the study participants will be obtained ( average duration in minutes per week, frequency, kind of exercise (e.g. aerobic, strength) , change in contrast to exercise performance before ). We will further request not to change their typical physical exercise performance during the study. Laboratory tests The follo wing routinely used laboratory tests will be necessarily determined at baseline in all potential participants: Hemoglobin levels, white blood cell count (total and differential blood count) , creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, bilirubin levels, blood urea, aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] , blood glucose, HbA1c, PTT, Quick/INR , CRP and BNP (should be measured in the morning, fasten and at rest [not after any exercise]) . All laboratory results will be reviewed and the reports signed by the investigator who will record in the CRF whether they are normal, abnormal but not clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. In the latter case the eligibility of the participants will be reviewed. As th e following are of particular interest in terms of safety, we apply the following definitions: Liver function tests such as aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]: According to previous definitions used in the phase II study for nicotinamide in Friedreich ataxia, we define mild increase as 3 -5x upper normal limit (Grade 1), moderate as >5 -20x"

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level: in general, a cut -off of > 200 pg/ml is used , however as these results are age - and gender -dependent , we extend this to values that are 2 times upper the normal level. 7.2.2 Subsequent assessment For each visit, we will consider inclusion of: 1. Eligibility check. 2. Assessment of endpoints/outcome measures. 3. Assessments of safety including general (e.g. physical examination ; electroc ardiogram ), specific safety assessments (e.g. specific laboratory tests according to the applicable product information and/or population , clinical assessments (e.g. specific questionnaires) and adverse event collection. 4. Dispensing of study drugs. 5. Assessment of compliance with study drugs. 6. Recording of concomitant medications. 7. Lab test to evaluate treatment respo nse as defined in the schedule. 7.2.3 End of trial assessment The end of trial will be the date of the last scheduled vi sit of the last parti cipant. The end of trial study (EOT) visit form should include: 1. Assessment of endpoints/outcome measures. 2. Assessments of safety including general (e.g. physical examination; echocardiography; echocardiogram), specific safety asse ssments (e.g. specific laboratory tests according to the applicable product information and/or population; MRI), clinical assessments (e.g. specific questionnaires) and adverse event collection. 3. Assessment of compliance with study medication. 4. Record ing of concomitant medications. 7.3 Blinding This trial is double -blinded. After randomization neither the patients nor the investigator or sponsor will be aware of the treatment allocation. Patients assigned to one of the double - blinded treatment will take Nicotinamide capsules or matching placebo. The capsules will be identical in appearance. The involved staff of the Department of Medical Statistics of the RWTH Aachen University Hospital as well as the involved staff of the pharmacy are aware about the randomized treatment allocation sequence but keep the list and information concealed till closure of the database.

Jörg Schulz Department of Neurology – University Hospital Aachen 2017 -002163 -17 PM12TL02_AMG_Protocol_V01_2017 Page 40 of 63 Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, the EQ -5D health quest ionnaire provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index (SCAFI) Quantitative performance measures or timed tests are used to supplement the results of clinical rating scales. Presumed advantages include high interrater and retest reliabilities. The SCAFI is composed of a timed 8m walk at maximum speed (8MW), the 9 -hole peg test (9HPT), and the PATA rate, a measure of speech performance. SCAFI was validated in a large multi - center cohort of SCA patients. Composite Cerebellar Functional Severity (CCFS) The CCFS is a simple and validated method for assessing cerebellar ataxia over a wide range of severity. The pegboard and click tests are easy to perform and accurately reflect the severity of the disease. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visual constructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Scale for the Assessment and Rating Ataxia (SARA) SARA is a clinical scale that is based on a semi quantitative assessment of cerebellar ataxia on an impairment level. SARA has 8 items that are related to gait, stance, sitting, speech, finger -chase test, nose -finger test, fast alternating movements and he el-shin test. Although the cerebellum is directly involved in the coordination of eye movements, oculomotor functions are not considered, as the validation trials indicated that they are determined by other factors than appendicular and midline ataxia. SAR A underwent a rigorous validation procedure involving three large multi -center trials in SCA and non -SCA ataxia patients, as well as controls. Global Impression -Change Scale (CGI -C and PGI -C) The Clinical Global Impressions -Change (CGI -C) Scale is used for the clinician to quantify and track patient progress and treatment response over time . The self-report Patient Global Impressions -Change (PGI -C) Scale is used for the patient to quantify and track patient progress and treatment response over time. 8.2.6 Electrocardiogram (ECG ) The 12 -lead ECG records the electrical activity of your heart at rest. It provides information about your heart rate and rhythm, and shows if there is enlargement of the heart due to high blood pressure (hypertension) or evidence of a previous heart attack (myocardial infarction)."

Subjec ts are asked to move as little as possible and will receive headphone s and earplugs to protect the ears from the MR noise. The whol e procedure takes about 45 minutes. 8.2.8 AEs AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by the patient, or discovered as a result of general non-directed questioning by the study personnel or by physical examination. All AEs will be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator. For further detailed description see section 10."

The investigator will be provided with AE and SAE reporting forms by CTC -A, receive training for AE/SAE definition, documentation and reporting. AE and SAE documentation and reporting will be monitored on site. 9.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs) An adverse event (AE) is defined in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as “any untoward medical occurrence, including an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition , in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.” (ICH E6:1.2) 9.1.1 Instructions for completing adverse event case report forms Each adverse even t is to be reported on an Adverse Event Case Report Form. As far as possible, each adverse event must also be described by: 1. its duration (start and end dates), 2. its severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) 3. its relationship to the study drug (suspected / not suspected) 4. treatment required and action taken with trial drug 5. outcome 6. seriousness Examples of the severity grade, relationship to study treatment and actions taken, as presented in the case report form, are provided below. The severity grade of an adverse event provides a qualitative assessment of the extent or intensity of an adverse event, as determined by the investigator or as reported by the subject. The severity grade does not reflect the clinical seriousness of the event, only the degree or extent of the affliction or occurrence (e.g. severe nausea = nausea including vomiting , mild seizure), and does not ref lect the relationship to study drug."

Assessment of causal relationship must be recorded for each adverse event. Causality will be reported as either “Yes” or “No”. Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product administered and the AE. No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product administered and the AE. Examples for clinically notable laboratory abnormalities Blood glucose: fasting glucose > 240 mg/dl or randomly determined glucose level of > 400 mg/dl and confirmed by a second measurement (not the same day).

A hospitalization meeting the regulatory definition for “serious” is any inpatient hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility. Any adverse event that does not meet one of the definitions of serious (eg, emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or requires urgent investigation) may be considered by t he investigator to meet the “other significant medical hazard” criterion for classification as a serious adverse event. An event does not need to be reported as a SAE if it represents only a relapse or an expected change or progression of the condition th at was the cause of treatment without any other symptoms and signs than those present before treatment. This type of event needs only to be reported as an AE. 9.3 Reporting Procedures of SAEs All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported by the principle investigator to the sponsor (CTC -A) within 24 hours of discovery or notification of the event. The sponsor will forward all SAE reports to the BfArM within 24 hours after receipt. More information on filling in the SAE form is provided in the “General In structions for Completion of SAE Form” you find in the investigator site file. 9.4 Pregnancy If a subject becomes pregnant or fathers a child during the study or within one month after treatment, the investigator should report to the sponsor within 1 working d ay and use the provided pregnancy notification form. The sponsor will inform BfArM and provide respective initial and follow -up information in cooperation with the investigator."

This can be treated with usage of antinausea drugs and/ or dose reduction. If nausea or vomiting occurs it is at the discretion of the investigator and/or a medical team member to flexible reduce the dosing and then reach the highest possible dose. Domperidone as first choice medication (1 -3 x 10 mg/day) and/or metoclopramide as second choice (1 -3 x 10 mg/day) may be used individually as rescue treatments .  Mild to moderate i ncreases in abnormal results from liver function tests. Study medication should be reduced and liver function controlled, until normal levels are reached.  The dose should be 4g/d p.o.. If side effects or any other situation requires a dose reduction, this will be allowed up to the smallest unit of 2 g/d p.o..  Study medication will be stopped immediately in p atients with severe nausea including vomiting and/or severe increased liver enzymes (Grade 3, see chapter 7.2.1) . If this occurs during phase A, we will wait for clinical recovery and normalization of liver function tests ( serum AST, ALT, y-GT, AP and bilirubin), and ask the patient for a second attempt to take the study medication . This requires a new begin of phase A with the above mentioned titration procedure. If this occurs in phase B , the participant needs to drop out of the study. Termination The study will be prematurely terminated for an individual subject, if one of the following criteria is fulfilled:  The subject experiences severe and nausea including vomiting , that cannot be sufficiently treated with antinausea drugs (prokinetica such as metoclopramid e and domperidon e) and/ or dose reduction.  Severe increases in abnormal results from liver function tests (serum AST, ALT, y-GT, AP and bilirubin Grade 3, see chapter 7.2.1) .  Severe progression and/or unstable cardiac situation (cardiomyopathy, unstable arrhythmias).  The subject experiences an AE that does not resolve or requires continued treatment that meets exclusion criteria.  Pregnancy (to be reported to Sponsor on Pregnancy Notification Form)  Non-compliance.  Subject withdraws informed consent."

The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the subject (and record his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the subject is alive or dead.  If a subject exits the trial prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. Reason, time point, and specific reason for premature study termination of each subject will be documented. The investigator should determine a primary reason for premature study termination of each subject. All relevant safety data until subject’s study termination will be collected and reported. This study may be prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause related to the benefit risk assessment of partic ipating in the study or for regulatory or medical reasons. Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  The incidence or severity of adv erse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to patients  Recommendation of DMC for safety issue  Determination of futility (endpoint cannot be reached given the trial design and number of enrolled participants)  Non-compliance wit h the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki  Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements The study will entirely be terminated in case the risk -benefit -ratio changes in such way, that premature study termination is indicated in order to protect subject’s health."

No other exclusion is eligible. 95% confidence intervals based on the contrast of the treatment progression derived from the above mentions linear mixed effects model will be used taking into account the sequential nature of the trial, i.e. a linear mixed effects model (LMEM) with the fixed effects of treatment, treatment -by-time inter action, center, SARA baseline score and age as well as the random intercept and time. Similar models will be used to test the treatment effects for FARS , SCAFI, CCFS, EQ -5D and ADL. Details of the statistical analysis (in particular for the secondary endpo ints), including statistical design aspects, primary hypotheses, statistical model, risk of error probabilities, definition of analysis set, statistical software and reporting (e.g. MOC tables and graphs) will be included the trial statistical analysis pla n (TSAP). Connected to this document is the data management and validation plan (DMVP). By slope (progression) analysis we assume a progression of 1.18/year increase in control patients with a SARA score between 8 and 28 at baseline. We estimate a reduct ion of this progression by 50% i.e. 0.59/year in the treatment group, giving a mean difference after 2 years of 1. 19. A SARA score of 1 has been used in former studies as a meaningful difference between placebo and vehicle treatment (Romano et al., 2015 ). Within the range of observed SARA measurements, it has been shown, that SARA progression is perfectly linear over ti me (Reetz et al., 2015 ; Reetz et al., 2016 ). Due to the specific type of disease and health care a s trong physician -patient -relationship ensures a low withdrawal rate. Thus, with respect to withdrawals and intercurrent events, we assume that our linear mixed effects model the bias, i.e. overestimation of the treatment effect is negli gible. Taking into account the concept paper on an addendum to ICH E9, we will further model estimands by an advanced sensitivity analysis, i.e. fitting a MMRM model to the data (Mallinckrodt et al., 2001 ). We not intend to perform futility stops, taken into account, that nicotinamide has no major side effects and that patient’s perspective is expressed by deriving a convi ncing level of evidence data from a convincing sized study. Due to potential biased effects and with regard to the above -mentioned uncertainty of the effect estimands , results in the suggestion to conduct the trial without interim analyses. 11.2 Interim analys es No interim analysis will be applied. 11.3 Data analyses Efficacy of nicotinamide versus placebo is tested by the linear contrast of the time by treatment interaction applied to the linear mixed effects model (LMEM , assumed variance – covariance error structure = unstructured) with treatment, treatment -by-time interaction, center, SARA baseline score and age as fixed effect and random intercept and time. Test of the primary hypothesis will be tested by the linear cont rast on the treatment by time interaction at the"

Analysis will be performed within the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which is the set of subjects who have been randomized and have taken at least one dose of the trial medication. N o other exclusion is eligible. 95% confidence intervals based on the contrast of the treatment progression will be used taking into account the sequential nature of the trial. Equal models will be used to test the treatment effects for INAS, SCAFI, CCFS, E Q5D and ADL. In a sensitivity analysis a mixed effects repeated measures model (MMRM) using the method described in Mallinckrodt (2001) with the fixed effects treatment, time and treatment by time interaction as well as the covariates baseline SARA score a nd the baseline - by-visit interaction age of onset, age will be fitted to the data. 11.4 Power calculation Within the EFACTS register (Reetz et al, 2015 and 2016), inclusion of patients with a SARA < 28 and an age < 50 years the slope is 1.19 with a treatment ef fect after 2 years of 2.38. With an intended 2:1 allocation ratio, a sample size of 150 + 75 = 225 is required (90% power) . An overall type one error rate by 5% (two -sided) is used to test the pr imary hypothesis at a power of 90%. A reduction of 0.5 is assumed for the treatment effect after 2 years. 11.5 Bias protection To minimize selection bias and chronological bias the treatment allocation will use the appropriate randomization procedure and randomization is stratified by center . The selection of the randomization procedure will be based on an evaluation of the risks of bias prior to the generation of the randomization list. Details will be given in a randomization report by the Institute for Medical Statistics at the RWTH Aachen University, which will be kept concealed until closure of the database. Performance bias will be minimized by definition of the eligible co-treatments in the protocol and monitoring during the trial. Compliance will be documented in patient diaries and vi sits. Attrition bias will be reduced by strict follow -up of the patients, which are closely linked to the treating physician, as is usual for patients with rare diseases. Ascertainment and concealment bias will be kept as low as possible, by double -blindin g, although the investigators are aware of the effect of unblinding due to observed side effects. With a sensitivity analysis, a statistical model including the selection bias and chronological bias effect will be fitted to the data. Details are given in t he TSAP."

This includes a copy of the letter sent to the subject’s primary physician about the subject’s participation in the study (provided the subject has a primary physician and has agreed to the primary physician bei ng informed). The subject file must also contain a descriptive statement on the informed consent procedure (see Section “Informed consent”). All entries have to be entered first in the subject file (CRF -Case Report Forms). The subject’s participation in th is study must be appropriately documented in the subject file with study number, subject number, date of subject information, date of informed consent, date of each visit, and date of each telephone contact. If a study site is using an electronic system fo r documenting source data, a member of the site staff must print out the source data after each visit. The paper print -outs must be overlapping, if possible (i.e., must contain at least the last row of data from the subject’s previous visit). If it is not possible to obtain overlapping paper print -outs, the completeness of source data must be ensured by other suitable means. The print -out must be signed and dated by a member of the site staff who can confirm the accuracy and completeness of data in the pape r print -out. The monitor should also sign and date after verifying the source data. The paper print -out should be stored in the ISF. If source data information is entered retrospectively, this must be done directly on the paper print -out and should be init iated and dated. The same applies to any corrections of initial data. If the site is using a validated computer system including audit trail with a separate access for the monitor (i.e., the monitor can only access the data of the study subjects), then no such paper print -outs are required."

The sponsor’s data management function will be responsible for data processing, in accordance with the sponsor’s data management procedures. Database lock will occur only after qual ity assurance procedures have been completed. 13.3 Data management All data to be collected will be entered on a case report form (CRF) and are to be considered source data. Automatic print outs as well as patient records and electronic patients are considered source data. Investigators will enter the information required by the protocol into an electronic data collection system via internet (eCRF). The eCRF will be developed by the data manager for the study. Detailed information on the eCRF completion will be provided during the site initiation visits. Each site will also be provided with an eCRF completion manual. In general, all persons who will enter data into the eCRF will be trained by an e -learning tool. After the successful completion of the training al l participants will receive a training certificate. The access to the e - learning tool and to the eCRF is password controlled. Plausibility checks will be performed according to a data validation plan. Inconsistencies in the data will be queried to the investigators via the electronic data collection system; answers to queries or changes of the data will directly be documented in the system. Laboratory and antibody test data will be received electronically. Plausibility checks will be performed to ensure cor rectness and completeness of these data. After all data are entered and all queries are solved, the database will be closed. 13.4 Direct Access to Source Data The investigator is obliged to allow study specific monitoring, auditing, and inspections by the compe tent ethics committee, enable direct access at source data and source documents as well as support the respective person at his best knowledge. 13.5 Monitoring This study will be monitored regularly by a qualified monitor chosen by the CTC-A according to GCP guidelines and the respective SOPs. Monitoring procedures include one or more visits designed to clarify all prerequisites before the study commences. Interim monitoring visits will take place on a regular basis according to a mutua lly agreed schedule. During these visits, the monitor will check for completion of the entries on the eCRF/CRF; for compliance with the clinical study protocol, ICH -GCP principles, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory authority requirements; for the integrity of the source data with the eCRF/ CRF entries; and for subject eligibility. Monitoring also will be aimed at detecting any misconduct or fraud. In addition, the monitor will check whether all AEs and SAEs have been reported appropriately within the time periods required."

The investigator must be available to answer questions arising during regular monitoring visits . In addition, the investigator is required to:  Have all data properly recorded in the eCRF and subject files prior to each monitoring visit.  Have the source documentation available at the monitoring visits.  Record all IP dispensed in the eCRF and the drug inventory records. All subjects who give their informed consent, including those screened, but not entered into the study, will be listed on the subject screening/ enrolment log. Further details of monitoring activities will be set forth in the monitoring manual. 13.6 Auditing Audits will be performed according to the corresponding audit program, including the possibility that a member of the sponsor’s quality assurance function may arrange to visit the investigator in order to audit the performance of the study at the study site, as well as all study documents originating there. Auditors conduct their work independently of the clinical study and its performance. Audits may also be performed by contract auditors. In this case, the sponsor’s quality assurance func tion will agree with the contract auditor regarding the timing and extent of the audit(s). In case of audits at the investigational site, the monitor will usually accompany the auditor(s)."

The subject should date the correction, but not initial it. The investigator should n ot make any changes to these documents. The sponsor’s data management function will be responsible for data processing, in accordance with the sponsor’s data management procedures. Database lock will occur only after quality assurance procedures have been completed. 14.3 Record keeping Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application (whether pending or contemplated) in an ICH region, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of IP clinical development. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the sponsor. Essential documents at the investigational site include (among other documents ):  Subject files.  Subject identification code list (i.e., provided by template to the investigator, along with the ISF, at the beginning of the study), which identifies the subject by number, name, and date of birth.  A signed copy of the final clinical stu dy protocol and any amendment.  CD/DVD with eCRF data, and any associated subject -related source data (or, where applicable, authorized copies of source data).  Signed informed consent forms.  Copies of site investigators’ and co -workers’ curricula vitae.  Copies of all direct correspondence with the IEC/IRB and with the regulatory authority(ies).  Copies of laboratory normal ranges and methods.  Copies of study supply receipt forms and drug inventory forms.  Copies of all correspondence between the investigato r and the monitor, and between the investigator and the sponsor."

The investigator should maintain the trial documents as specified in the ICH -GCP -Guideline for at least 10 years. The investigator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature dest ruction of these documents. 14.5 Destruction of study documents Study documents may not be destroyed by study site personnel prior to the retention period specified above without the prior written consent of the sponsor. The principal investigator must inform t he sponsor in due time if the principal investigator leaves the institution during the retention period. This rule also applies when the institution closes within the retention period. 15 Oversight Committee 15.1 Data Monitoring Committee The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be formed of an independent group of experts that advises NICOFA and the study investigators. The members of the DMC serve in an individual capacity and provide their expertise and recommendations. The DMC will periodically review and evaluate the accumulated study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and, when appropriate, efficacy, and make recommendations to NICOFA concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial. The DMC considers study -spec ific data as well as relevant background knowledge about the disease, test agent, or patient population under study (see DMC Charta) ."

The study is financed by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The financial aspects of this study are specified in separate agreements between the institution , the sponsor (CTC -A) and the investigator. 17.2 Insurance From the beginning of the study until its termination, each subject is insured against any health impairm ent occurring as a result of participation in the study in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country in which the study is performed. The subject will be informed by the investigator and through the subject’s informed consent form about the e xistence of this insurance and the resulting obligations. The insurance conditions will be handed out to the subject, if requested or if required by local law. Any medical deviation from the clinical study protocol that is deemed to have occurred through t he subject’s own fault is not covered by this insurance. The sponsor is usually not liable for injuries/cases of death that occur solely as a consequence of the subject’s underlying disease or condition, or from diagnostic or therapeutic measures not speci fically required by the agreed clinical study protocol. The sponsor is also usually not liable for events resulting from negligence of the investigator, clinical study staff, and/or CRO, including failure to act according to ICH -GCP principles or to comply strictly with the agreed clinical study protocol. A patient's insurance in accordance with § 40 (1) and (3) No.8 AMG is submitted (the insurance policy number will be filed subsequently) . In addition, a travel accident insurance is completed."
