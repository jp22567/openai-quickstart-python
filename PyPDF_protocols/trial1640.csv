The presence (CRSwNP) or absence (CRSsNP) of nasal polyps based on results from endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) is a critical item to phenotype CRS . Additional subtypes can, however , be identified based on underlying conditions, such as allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, CRS associated with a cetylsalicylic acid -exacerbated respiratory disease, CRS in patients with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, systemic diseases, or immune de ficiency (all present in CRSwNP or CRSsNP) [Bachert 2015 ]. Additionally, subjects might have comorbidities, such as inhalant allergies and asthma (30% of patients with CR SwNP) . Nasal polyposis (NP) is a clinical condition characterized by the presence of multiple polyps in the upper nasal cavity, originating from the ostiomeatal complex (OMC) . Up to 4% of the general population is estimated to be affected by nasal polyps [ Lange 2013 ]. Symptoms experienced by patients with NP include nasal blockage, loss of smell, rhinorrhea, and symptoms derived from lower airway involvement [ Alobid 2005 ]. Nasal polyps often have a deleterious effect on many aspects of quality of life (QoL), including physical health, general health, social functioning, sleep, a nd mental health [Erskine 2016 , Hoehle 2016 , Rudmik 2011 ]. Recent efforts to better characterize the pathophysiology of CRS has led to a refined classification by endotype [Bachert 2016a , Avdeeva 2018 ]. The latter can be differentiated on cells involved, such as by the abundance of eosinophils or neutrophils, on T helper cell populations or levels of immunoglobulin E ( IgE) or cytokines, including interleukin ( IL)-4, IL-5, or IL -13. As an example, m ucosal eosinophilia exhibits significant geographic and ethnic differences . In Europe and in the U S, the most prevalent endotype in CRSwNP present s a type 2 inflammatory response [Mygind 2000 ] and is characterized by high prevalence of eosinophils, mast cells, with elevated type 2 cytokines (IL -4, IL -5, IL -9, IL -13, IL -25, and IL-33), and Th2 cells. In contrast, in East Asia, this eo sinophilic endotype constitutes less than half of the CRSwNP cases [Cao 2009 ]. Current treatment options for patients with NP are not based on endotypes , and are limited to intra nasal and oral cortico steroids, long -term antibiotics and surgery [ Sharma 2014 , Van Zele 2010 , Fokkens 2012 ]. Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) are usually the initial treatment for nasal polyps, with good outcome s for patients with mild NP [ Kalish 2012 ]. The use of systemic corticosteroids is reserved for more severe cases but due to the side"

As the goal is to maintain CRTH2 blockade over the full dosing interval, ACT -774312 trough concentration is a critical parameter. ACT -774312 can therefore be administered with or without food. ACT -774312 fully blocked CRTH2 at the surface of eosinophils for at least 9 h post -dose at 50 mg b.i.d. The Emax model indicated that ACT -774312 was able to maintain 90% of CRTH2 blockade over the full dosing interval in 80% of healthy subjects at a dose of 110 mg b.i.d. Neither severe nor ser ious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) observed following multiple -dose intake of ACT -774312 were headache and dizziness. No clinically relevant effects on vital signs, laboratory variables, or 12 -lead ECG were obs erved. More detailed information can be found in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) [ACT -774312 IB]. 1.3 Study rationale NP is a Th -2-driven inflammatory process in which eosinophils are the predominant inflammatory cells found in the sinuses and nasal polyps . ACT -774312 is an antagonist of CRTH2 which is expressed on the surface of blood -borne cells that play a central role in allergy and type -2 inflammation: eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, ILC2, and Th -2 cells. Therefore, ACT -774312 might reduce the inflammatory process involved in NP . 1.3.1 Medical and regulatory background This s tudy is a proof -of-concept Phase 2 study designed to assess the effects of ACT -774312 on bilate ral NP. In addition, tolerability, safety, PK, and PD of ACT -774312 in this population will be investigated. Risk -benefit assessment In Europe and in the US, the most prevalent endotype in CRSwNP presents a type 2 inflammatory response [ Mygind 2000 ] and is characterized by high prevalence of eosinophils, mast cells, and Th -2 cells, with elevated type 2 cytokines (IL -4, IL -5, IL -9, IL-13, IL -25, and IL -33), in NP. Recent clini cal studies with monoclonal antibodies against IL-5 (reslizumab and mepolizumab [ Gevaert 2011 , Bachert 2017 ]) or against IL -4 receptor α (dupilumab [ Bachert 2016b ]) have shown improvement of CRSwNP symptoms combined with significant reduction of polyp a nd computed tomography scores. Therefore, it is expected that ACT -774312, by targeting the type 2 inflammatory pathway like the monoclonal antibodies, has the potential to be effective in the treatment of patients suffering from diseases with a Th -2-associ ated allergic etiology, including NP."

Therefore, based on the limited information available from healthy subjects receiving ACT -774312 in this study, no safety concerns have been identified. Steady -state conditions are reached on the second day of b.i.d. treatment, therefore no additional safety concerns are expected with a 12 -week treatment period compared to the 4 -day treatment of the MAD. In addition, there ar e no specific safety concerns due to potential class effects based on the experience with other CRTH2 antagonists currently in late -stage development (mainly for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis) [ Norman 2014, Ratner 2017 ]. Due to the absence of data in patients with renal function impairment and hepatic function impairment, these will be excluded from the study. NP is not considered a life -threatening disease wi th irreversible morbidity if not treated immediately. It is hence considered acceptable and ethical to include a placebo -treated arm in a clinical study of subjects with NP [ ICH 2000 ]. Subjects will be aware of the probability of being assigned to the placebo arm and of the therapeutic alternatives. No particular safety concern related to the concomitant administration of ACT -774312 and mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS ) is exp ected. Subjects with any contraindications or warning/precaution of use related to MFNS, as described in the Summary of Product Characteristics, will be excluded from the study [see ]. In conclusion, based on available data on ACT -774312, the expected risk -benefit assessment supports the conduct of the proposed ID -084A201 study in subjects with bilateral NP. Exclusion criteria, safety monitoring activities, a nd strict medical management will further ensure the safety of the subjects included in the trial. 1.3.2 Subject population The study population of ID -084A201 will consist of subjects with a physician endoscopic diagnosis of bilateral NP (nasal polyp score [NPS] of ≥ 5, with a minimum of 2 in each nostril ) despite having complet ed a prior INCS treatment for at least 8 weeks before screening, with at least the 6 last weeks on INCS spray . A bilateral score of 5 is the standard grade at which INCS is not able to red uce the NPS further . In this study , ACT -774312 will be administered on top of MFNS , see the Summary of Product Characteristics . Taking the high co -morbi dity of NP with asthma, chronic sinusitis, and previous surgeries into account , these subjects will be allowed to enter the study unless they meet any of the exclusion criteria described in Section 3.2.3 ."

The clinical study consists of three periods:  Run-in period on MFNS for 4 weeks .  Treatment period (1 2 weeks) .  Post-treatment period ( 30 days ). The study is double -blind to avoid the bias incurred by an unblinded design on safety and efficacy assessment s. Both the subject and investigator are blinded to the assigned study treatment s. The study is placebo -controlled to provide a control group to which efficacy and safety can be compared. A 2:1 randomization ratio was chos en to obtain more information on ACT -774312. This unequal randomization ratio is only 6% less precise than a 1 :1 ratio (as measured by the standard error [SE] of the mean difference ). 1.3.4 Dose selection The selection of the dose is based on the tolerability, safety , and PK/PD data from the completed entry -into-man study . In th at study , doses of ACT -774312 up to 1000 mg and 500 mg b.i.d. were administered in the SAD and MAD part, respectively. The dose in this P hase 2 study will be an intermediate dose of those investigated in the MAD study, namely, a 400 mg b.i.d. dose of ACT -774312. This dose is anticipated to maintain a 90% block ade of CRTH2 over the full dosing interval. In the AC-084-101 study, PK/PD modeling predicted that 110 mg b.i.d. ACT -774312 would be able to fully block ex vivo the agonist effect of 300 nM of DK -PDG2 in whole blood . 1.3.5 Safety margin calculations, dose selection, and stopping criteria The safety margins calculated by comparing the plasma exposure in animals at the NOAEL with the human exp osure after multiple -dose administration of 500 mg are shown in Table 2. The dose of 500 mg b.i.d. of ACT -774312 is the closest dose for which actual PK data are available ."

Both study treatments will be administered on top of standard background therapy: MFNS. 1.3.7 Treatment duration The study treatment duration will be 12 weeks. This period has been proven sufficient to observe significant change in NPS [Gevaert 2011 ]. 1.3.8 Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is the change from baseline at Week 12 in bilateral NPS. Bilateral NPS is an objective endpoint commonly used to evaluate the effect of medications or surgery in NP at the early stage of clinical development. The secondary efficacy en dpoints , including symptom evaluations required as co -primary endpoint in late r stage s of development , are measured to more comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of ACT -774312. This study will also explore the improvement of NP and associated sinus inflamm ation on a CT scan, and improvement in condition with specific and general medical questionnaires to obtain a better understanding of the impact of NP on the subject s’ QoL. These endpoints, together with the biomarkers analysis , will provide information o n the therapeutic value of ACT -774312 to reduce the NPS and to improve symptoms in NP. 1.3.9 Statistical hypotheses and sample size Statistical hypotheses will not f ormally be tested in the estimation study. Thus, n o formal sample size calculation was performed. Twenty -four subjects (16 in the ACT -774312 group and 8 in the placebo group) provide a certain precision to estimate the treatment difference in the mean change from baseline in NPS [see Section 5.5]. 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary objective To evaluate the effect of ACT -774312 on bilateral NP. This primary objective will be assessed by several endpoints including the change from baseline to Week 12 in NPS assessed by endoscopy (the primary endpoint) as well as secondary endpoints assessed by CT, University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), Sino -Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT -22), Phy sician Global Assessment ( PGA ), visual a nalog scales (VAS), and patient global impression of change in disease severity. 2.2 Secondary objectives  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ACT -774312 during 12 weeks of treatment ."

At screening, subjects must have been on a stable regimen of INCS for at least 8 weeks. If the subject is using an INCS product different from MFNS pri or to the screening visit, the investigator must switch the subject to MFNS at screening. At Visit 1, all subjects will enter a run -in period of 4 weeks on MFNS of 2 actuations (50 μg/actuation) in each nostril b.i.d ., total daily dose of 400 μg, unless they are intolerant to b.i.d.

Provided that the NPS does not change during the run -in period, subjects will be randomized to one of the following study treatments:  ACT -774312 400 mg b.i.d. for 12 weeks.  Placebo b.i.d. for 12 weeks. During the double -blind randomized treatment period , all subjects will continue MFNS (200 μg) either b.i.d. or o.d. in addition to the investigational medicinal product (IMP) . The End-of-Treatment (EOT ) will take place at Visit 6 (or earlier in the event of premature discontinuation) between Day 81 and Day 84 to ensure subjects will still be receiving the study treatment. 3.1.3 Post-treatment period The post -treatment period will start after Visit 6 (Week 12) and will end at Visit 7 (Week 16).

Provisions will be in place to maintain the blinding of sponsor personnel. 3.5.5 Emergency procedure for unblinding The investigator, study staff , and sponsor staff must remain blinded to the subject ’s study treatment assignment. The identity of the study treatment may be revealed only if the subject experiences a medical event, the management of which would require knowledge of the blinded treatment as signment. In this case, the investigator can receive the unblinded randomization code for study treatment allocation from the emergency code -break envelope. In these situations, the decision to unblind resides solely with the investigator. Whenever it is p ossible and if it does not interfere with (or does not delay) any decision in the best interest of the subject, the investigator is invit ed to discuss the intended code break with Idorsia . The occurrence of any code break during the study must be clearly justified and explained by the investigator. In all cases, Idorsia must be informed as soon as possible before or after the code break. The circumstances leading to unblinding must be documented in the hospital charts and the Investigator Site File (ISF). At each monitoring visit, the monitor must check the code -break envelopes. At the end of the study, the monitor must collect all code -break envelopes and code -break reports and return them to the sponsor for filing. 3.5.6 Study treatment administration The subjects will receive sufficient study treatment to cover the following period s:  From Day 1 (Visit 2) to Visit 4 .  Visit 4 to Visit 5 .  Visit 5 to Visit 6 ( EOT ). Subjects will be instructed to store the study treatment at room temperature, protected from light and moisture. They will be asked to return all used, partially used, and unused study treatment bottles at each visit. Should the treatment bottle dispensed at a scheduled visit be lost or damaged, a replacement bottle can be requested. The protocol -mandated study treatment dispensing procedures may not be altered without prior written approval from the sponsor. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., if the subject"

An accurate study treatment record of the date and amount of study treatment dispensed to each subject must be available at the site for inspection at any time. The inventory of study treatment dispensed to and returned by the subject (i.e., study treatment accountability) must be performed by site personnel on the day of the visit and before dispensing further study treatment. The Study Treatment Dispensing and Administration Log(s) for ACT -774312 and placebo must be kept current by the investigator or his/her designee, and must contain as a minimum the followin g information:  Subject number to whom the study treatment was dispensed.  Initials and date of the person who dispensed the study treatment .  Dispensed bottle ID number.  Date dispensed / number of capsules dispensed ( recorded in eCRF).  Date returned / number of capsules returned (recorded in the eCRF) . All study treatment supplies, including partially used or empty bottles must be retained at the site until they are verified by the unblinded monitor . If the subject omits to bring the remaining study treatment to a study visit, he/she must be instructed not to take any capsules from the remaining study treatment bottle and to return it at the next visit. At Visit 4 and Visit 5 , study treatment will be taken from the newly dispensed bottles. The Study Treatment Dispensing and Administration Log(s) will be collected upon completion of the study for archiving in the Trial Master File ( TMF ). 3.5.7 Storage and return of study treatment The pharmacist is responsible for safe and proper handling and storage of the study treatment at the study site in an appropriate lockable room at room temperature ( below 25 °C but not refrigerated ). The study treatment should be protected from light. Only the pharmacist or his/her designee, who are otherwise not involved in the study, ma y handle the study treatment. Upon receipt of the study treatment , the responsible pharmacist or his/her designee must inspect and count all study treatment for completeness.

Interruptions of study treatment must be kept as short as possible. The interruption or premature discontinuation of study treatment might be triggered by an AE, a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, an abnormal assessment (e.g., laboratory abnormalities), or for administrative reasons – in particular , withdrawal of the subject ’s consent. A subject has the right to prematurely discontinue study treatment at any time, without any justification, by withdrawing from study treatment only or by withdrawing from any further participation in the study (i.e., premature withdrawal from the study). Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason for prematu rely withdrawing from the treatment or the study, it is recommended that the investigator makes a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject ’s rights. A subject who prematurely discontinues study treatment is not consi dered as withdrawn from the study and will be followed in the post -treatment period, provided that the subject ’s consent for this participation in the study has not been withdrawn. A subject who prematurely discontinues study treatment and withdraws conse nt to participate in any further study assessments is considered as withdrawn from the study. Subjects who die or are lost to follow -up are also considered as withdrawn from the study. Withdrawal from the study and follow -up medical care of subjects withdr awn from the study are described in Sections 3.6.5 and 3.6.6 , respective ly. The date and the reason for study treatment interruption or premature discontinuation must be documented in the eCRF and the sponsor must be informed. If the reason for study treatment interruption or premature discontinuation from study treatment is an abnormal result on laboratory test, vital sign, ECG recording, or physical examination, this information must be recorded as an AE in the eCRF. The EOS assessments must be performed as planned 30 (+ 2 days) after the last study treatment administratio n. Study treatment may be temporarily interrupted in response to an AE (maximum 2 weeks of interruption) , or other reasons (e.g., diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, study treatment forgotten)."

All study treatment interruptions must be recorded in the eCRF. If the number of subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment is higher than expected, additional subjects may be randomized, see S ection 3.5.3 . 3.6.3 Study -specific criteria for interruption / premature discontinuation of study treatment Pregnancy If a subject becomes pregnant while on study treatment, study treatment must be permanently discontinued. The investigator/delegate must counsel the subject and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Vital signs If a subject experiences SBP < 80 mmHg and DBP < 60 mmHg (confirmed by repeated BP measurement within 10 min) and associated with significant clinical symptoms while on investigational treatment , study treatment must be permanently discontinued. Severe thrombopenia If a subject experiences a severe thrombopenia (platelets count < 50 ,000/μL) while on investigational treatment , study treatment m ust be permanently discontinued . 3.6.4 Subject ’s follow -up after study treatment discontinuation A subject who prematurely discontinues study treatment will be followed in the post-treatment period . 3.6.5 Study discontinuation Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study without justification for any reason at any time. Subjects are considered withdrawn if they state an intention to withdraw further participation in all components of the study (i.e., withdrawal of consent), die, or are lost to follow -up. If a subject withdraws consent, no further data will be collected in the eCRF from the date of withdrawal onward. The investigator may withdraw a subject from the study (without regard to the subject ’s consent) if, on balance, he/she believes that continued participation in the study would be contrary to the best interests of the subject. Withdrawal from the study may also result from a decision by the sponsor for any reason, including premature termination or suspension of the study. Subjects are considered as lost to follow -up if all reasonable attempts by the investigator to communicate with the individual fail. The site must take preventive measures to avoid a"

If the subject cannot be reached, the site must make a reasonabl e effort to contact the subject and document all attempts and follow -up information on source . The following methods must be used: at least three telephone calls must be placed to the last available telephone number and one registered letter must be sent by pos t to the last available home address. Additional methods may be acceptable if they are compliant with local rules/regulations (e.g., site staff visit to the subject ’s home), respecting the subject ’s right to privacy. If the subject is still unreachable aft er all contact attempts listed above, he/she will be considered to be lost to follow -up. The date and the reasons for premature discontinuation of the study must be documented in the eCRF, and the sponsor must be informed. 3.6.6 Subject follow -up after study di scontinuation If for whatever reason (except death or loss -to-follow -up) a subject is withdrawn from the study, the investigator should make best efforts to schedule a last appointment / telephone call to assess the safety and well -being of the subject, co llect unused study treatment , and discuss follow -up medical care. Data obtained during this last appointment / telephone call will be recorded in the subjects ’ medical records but it will not be collected in the eCRF. The investigator must provide follow -up medical care for all subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care. Subjects who discontinue the study may request that all biological samples drawn in the course of the study be destroyed. 3.6.7 Medical care of subjects after study completion / withdrawal from study After the subject ’s study completion or premature withdrawal from the study, whichever applies, the investigator/delegate will explain to subjects what treatment(s) / medical care is necessary and available according to local regulations. Female subjects of childbearing potential will be reminded of the contraception requirements as described in Section 3.2.2 . 3.7 Study treatment exposure and compliance Records of study treatment used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits are to be kept during the study. Study treatment accountability is to be performed on an ongoing basis by the study staff, and checked by the monitor during site visits and at completion of the study. Study treatment compliance will be assessed based on the difference between the number of capsules prov ided to the subject and the number of capsules brought back at each"
61,page_61,"ACT -774312 Nasal polyposis Protocol ID-084A201 Final Version 3 25 July 2019, page 61/103 Confidential EudraCT: 2018 -000851 -42 Doc No D -19.158 dispensing visit. In the event of loss of study treatment, the Subject Diar y will be used to calculate compliance. Study treatment compliance with the prescribed study treatment dose regim en will be confirmed by the sponsor based on Subject Diary data. On each day, subjects will be asked to enter in the Subject Diary the number of capsules taken in the morning and evening as well as the dosing time . For each time i nterval between two visits , study treatment compliance will be calculated by the sponsor using the following formula: Study treatment compliance = Number of capsules taken during the period / Total number of times the study treatment should have been taken during the period  100 The prescribed dose corresponds to 400 mg ACT -774312 / placebo. The period is defined as the number of days between visit n (or date of first study treatment intake if randomization visit) and visit n+1 (or date of last study treatment intake if EOT visit) . The number of times the study treatment should have been taken at the prescribed dose regimen in each period is calculated as follows:  (Number of days in the period – 1) 2 + 1 for the first period and the last period as only 1 administration will take place on Day 1 and on EOT  Number of days in the period 2 for the period Visit 4 to Visit 5 Study treatment interruption(s) will be ignored when calculating study treatment compliance. Between visits, study treatment compliance is expected to be at least 80%. The sponsor will inform the site staff and monitor about any compliance values below 80%. Compliance values below 80% without medical justification (e.g., AE) and not related to a Subject Diary completion issue will be considered as a protocol deviation, which will be reported as such to the sponsor by the monitor . In such cases, the investigator must discuss and clarify the reas ons for non -compliance with the subject and take appropriate actions to avoid re -occurrence. The measurement of plasma levels of ACT -774312 in the analytical phase will serve as a further check of compliance. 3.8 Study endpoints 3.8.1 Efficacy endpoints Baseline : Defined as the last value measured prior to first intake of study treatment."

Further details on nasal endoscopy will be available in a separate operati onal manual provided to the site. 3.9.1.2 CT scan CT of the sinuses should be performed at Visit 2 and at EOT (Visit 6). For Lund -Mackay score, Zinreich -modified Lund -Mackay score , and 3D volumetric measurement of the maxillary sinus, the same acquisitions (sequences) will be used for centralized imaging data assessments and scoring by independent physician reviewer s for the imaging data. The subject -identifying information (subject and visit identifiers) will be removed by ERT prior to sending the data to the reader. The final results of central reading will be made available after EOS. Local assessment of the Lund -Mackay score will also be performed . Details on CT will be available in a separate operational manual provided to the site. The Lund -Mackay and the Zinreich -modified Lund -Mackay system s are based on localization , with points given for degree of opacification. Lund -Mackay score The right or left sinuses are divided into six portions, i.e., maxillary sinus, anterior ethmoid sinuses, posterior ethmoid sinuses, sphenoid sinus, frontal sinus, and OMC . The score assignments are 0 if the sinus is totally patent, 1 if the sinus is partially opacified, and 2 if"

The maximum score for each side is thus 12, with a total score determined out of 24. The OMC is scored either 0 if not occluded or 2 if occluded. Modification of the Lund -Mackay score Each sinus is assigned a score based on the perce ntage of opacification from mucosal thickening as follows: 0 = 0%, 1 = 1% to 24%, 2 = 25% to 74%, 3 = 75% to 99%, 4 = 100% or completely occluded. Similar to the Lund -Mackay system, each side is graded and their sum is the total score out of a maximum of 48. The OMC is given a score of 0 (no obstruction) or 1 (obstruction) for the frontal recess, middle meatus, infundibulum , and the sphenoethmoidal recess channels . For subjects in whom the O MC is missing (because of a previous surgery) the reader should consider the location of the former O MC and provide a scoring (as if the O MC was there). 3D volumetric measurement of the maxillary sinus (left and right) This method is used to calculate:  the volume of air (mL)  the volume of mucosa (mL)  % occupied by disease  thickness of lateral wall The subject -identifying information from the imaging data header will be removed by ERT prior to sending the imaging data to the physician for reading . Both the Lund -Mackay score and the 3D volumetric measurement s of the maxillary sinus will be reported in the eCRF . 3.9.1.3 UPSIT UPSIT should be performed at all visits except Visit 1. The UPSIT test is a rapid and easy -to-administer method to quantitatively assess human olfactory function [Doty 1984 ]. The UPSIT shows a high test -retest reliability (r: 0.981) and scores on this test are strongly correlated with the detection threshold for phenylethylalcohol in the same individuals. When the UPSIT is admin istered in the standardized manner, clinical subjects show a high degree of uniformity in UPSIT performance when tested in different laboratories. The test consists of four booklets, each containing 10 odorants with one odorant per page. The test -time is a bout 15 min. The stimuli are embedded in 10 50 (m) diameter plastic microcapsules on brown strips at the bottom of each page. Above each odorant strip is a multiple -choice question with four alternative words to describe the odor. The subject will"

The PGA C-DS questionnaire is a self-administered 1 -item questionnaire designed to assess the physician ’s impression of change i n disease severity since study treatment start. The physician will rat e the change since the subject started study treatment in the overall severity of the disease symptoms on 7 -point scales (1 to 7) scored as: “very much improved, ” “much improved, ” “minimally improved, ” “no change, ” “minimally worse, ” “much worse, ” or “very much worse ”. A sample of the PGAC -DS is provided . The answer s to the 2 questionnaire s will be recorded in the eCRF. 3.9.1.6 Patient questionnaires  SNOT -22 The SNOT -22 is a validated questionnaire to assess the impact of CRS on QoL. The score ranges from 0 to 110. Higher total scores on the SNOT -22 imply greater impact on QoL. The SNOT -22 was validated and recommended for routine clinical practice. A minimal clinically important d ifference in score has been established to be 8.9 point s [Hopkins 2009 ]. The s core will be reported in the eCRF. The sponsor has obtained approval from the developer of the SNOT -22 for its use in this study. Validated translation for Flemish has been obtained A sample of the SNOT -22 questionnaire is provided for each symptom .  Patient Global Impression of Cha nge in Disease S everity (PGIC -DS) A PGIC -DS questionnaire will be completed by the subject at Week 2 (Visit 3) and at each subsequent site visit until EOS. The questionnaire will be administered in a paper format. The PGIC -DS questionnaire is a self-admini stered 1 -item questionnaire designed to assess subject ’s impression of change in disease severity since study treatment start.

See Table 1 for the time points of assessments. 3.9.2.1 Specific safety and t olerability assessments 3.9.2.1.1 Weight and height Height will be measured in cm at screening only. Body weight will be measured in kg at screening and the EOS visit. The results should be provided to one decimal place and the values , as well as the BMI , will be recorded in the eCRF. The subjects ’ body weight will be measured using the same weighing scale for all subjects and throughout the study. The weighing scale should have a precision of at least 0.5 kg. 3.9.2.1.2 Physical examination Physical examination (i.e., inspection, percussion, palpation, and auscultation) will be performed at Visit s 1, 2, 6, and 7 . Clinically relevant findings found after informed consent form (ICF ) signature and meeting the definition of an AE (new AE, or wors ening of previously existing condition) must be recorded on an AE form of the eCRF. Date and time of physical examination and its results will be recorded on source documents only. 3.9.2.1.3 Vital signs SBP, DBP and pulse rate will be measured at all visits using an automatic oscillometric device, always on the dominant (i.e., dominant arm right = writing with right hand). In this study the normal range for vital signs is defined as follows: SBP: 100160 mmHg DBP: 50100 mmHg Pulse rate: 45100 bpm Measurements should be recorded from the subject in the supine position after having rested for a 5 -minute period.

If felt necessary by the investigator, additional vital signs may be recorded to substantiate abnormal findings on the vital signs , which will be also recorded in the eCRF . 3.9.2.1.4 Electrocardiography A standard 12 -lead ECG is to be recorded at rest with the subject in the supine position for a 5-minute period. Printouts for each ECG (at least three complexes for each standard lead) will include date and time of recording , subject ’s identification, physician ’s evaluation, and physician ’s initials. The date and time of the ECG recordings as well as the overall ECG evaluation and potential abnormal findings of the ECG recordings will be transcribed into the subjec t’s eCRF . The following variables are to be collected on the eCRF: PR (ms), QRS (ms), QT (ms), QTcB (ms) , HR (bpm), and RR. If felt necessary by the investigator, additional ECGs may be recorded to substantiate abnormal findings on the ECG , which will be also recorded in the eCRF . Significant findings made after study treatment initiation, which meet the definition of an AE, must be recorded on an AE form of the eCRF. 3.9.2.2 Laboratory assessments 3.9.2.2.1 Type of laboratory For each laboratory, the investigator must prov ide the sponsor with the name and professional degree, a copy of the laboratory ’s certification, and the normal range (by sex, if appropriate) for each variable being evaluated in the study. These laboratory references must be forwarded to the sponsor befo re study start, and be updated whenever necessary. However, the investigator must request that the clinical laboratory does not change any normal range during the course of the study. If a sample is lost or cannot be analyzed by the laboratory the sample w ill not be re-collected. For each assessment of routine laboratory variables, a total of 18 mL of blood will be taken from each subject (9 mL for hematology and 9 mL for clinical chemistry). Urinalysis will be performed by dipstick. Virus serology and IgE titer will be measured at screening only; a total of 18 mL of blood will be taken from each subject."

A negative result must be obtained at Visit s 1 and 2 prior to randomization. Additional urine pregnancy tests will be performed at each visit until EOS visit. For cyp2c9 genotyping , a total of 4 mL of blood will be t aken from each subject at screening. The blood samples will be taken under fasted conditions. As a rule, the blood samples will be taken from the subject in the sitting position by puncture of a vein in the cubital or the antebrachial region. The samples will be sent to the local certified laboratory immediately after blood sampling. The date and time of the blood sampling will be recorded in the eCRF. If subjects present with abnormal laboratory test results during the study , additional re-checks and monitoring will be performed as applicable . All abnormal lab oratory values must be assessed by the investigator and marked as clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS) on the laboratory printout and in the eCRF . Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities observed after study treatment administration, which meet the definition of an AE, must be reported by the investigator as an AE or SAE as appropriate [see Section 4].

All medication that is study -concomitant (i.e., ongoing or initiated after first study drug administration) must be captured in the eCRF. Previous/concomitant medications (including contraceptives and traditional and alternative medicines, i.e., plant -, animal -, or mineral -based medicines) from 3 months prior to screening, or started during the course of the study, until EOS must be recorded in the eCRF. The generic name, start/end dates of administration (as well as whether it was ongoing at start of treatment), route, dose, and indication will be recorded in the eCRF. 3.9.4.5 Immuno globulin E titer Total IgE will be measured at Visit 1 and will be recorded in the eCRF . 3.9.4.6 Spirometry Spirometry test will be performed at Visit 1 for subjects with asthma as based on their medical history . The following must be avoided for the duration shown prior to spirometry testing: caffeine -containing drinks (1 hour), alcoholic beverages (4 hours), strenuous exercise (30 minutes), and large meals (2 hours). Cold air should also be avoided immediately prior to testing . Testing should be started after the patient has rested fo r at least 5 minutes. Testing will be conducted with the patient seated and wearing nose -clips. Subjects should be given clear instructions before and during the testing , and should be actively coached and encouraged during the test. When performing the te st, subjects should remain erect and not bend forward excessively. The FEV 1 value will be recorded in the eCRF . 3.9.4.7 Asthma Control Questionnaire The Asthma Control Q uestionnaire (ACQ) will be completed by subjects with asthma (based on medical history) only. The ACQ is a self -administered tool that measures the adequacy of asthma control and the change in asthma control which occurs either spontaneously or because of a treatment [ Juniper 1999 ]. The ACQ has seven questions, the first five of which score the asthma symptoms, and the last two of which score the daily reliever bronchodilator use during the previous week and the FEV 1% predicted on the day of the assessment. In the A CQ, subjects are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week, and to respond to the symptom and bronchodilator use questions on a 7 -point scale (0 = no impairment, 6 = maximum impairment). Clinic staff score the FEV 1% predicted on a 7-point scale. The questions are equally weighted and the ACQ"

The sponsor has obtained approval from the developer of the ACQ for its use in this study. Validated translations for Flemish have been obtained. 3.9.4.8 Asthma Quality o f Life Questionnaire The Asthma Quality o f Life Questionnaire with Standardis ed Activities (AQLQ) will be completed by subjects with asthma (based on medical history) only. The AQLQ was developed and validated to measure the functional problems (physical, emotional, social, and occupational) that are most troublesome to adults (17 –70 years) with asthma [Juniper 1992 ]. This instrument has 32 questions in four domains (symptoms, activities, emotions, and environment) and takes 3 –4 minutes to complete. Subjects are asked to think about how they have b een during the previous 2 weeks and to respond to each of the 32 questions on a 7 -point scale (7 = not impaired at all to 1 = severely impaired). The overall AQLQ score is the mean of all 32 responses, and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains. The responses to the AQLQ questions are collected in the eCRF. The AQLQ will be assessed at Visit 1 only, and only for the subjects with asthma . A sample of the AQLQ (in English) is provided .

A treatment -emergent AE is any AE temporally associated with the use of a study treatment , whether or not considere d related to the study treatment . AEs include:  Exacerbation of a pre -existing disease.  Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing episodic disease or medical condition."
79,page_79,"ACT -774312 Nasal polyposis Protocol ID-084A201 Final Version 3 25 July 2019, page 79/103 Confidential EudraCT: 2018 -000851 -42 Doc No D -19.158  Disease or medical condition detected or diagnosed after signature of the ICF even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsen following the first study treatment administration .  Abnormal assessments, e.g., ECG, vital signs, or physica l examination findings, if they represent a clinically significant finding that was not present at baseline or worsened during the study.  Laboratory test abnormalities if they represent a clinically significant finding, symptomatic or not, which was not pr esent at baseline or worsened during the course of the study or led to dose reduction, interruption or permanent discontinuation of study treatment . Overdose, misuse , and abuse of the study treatment should be reported as an AE and, in addition, study trea tment errors must be documented in the study treatment log of the eCRF. 4.1.2 Intensity of adverse events The intensity of clinical AEs is graded on a three -point scale – mild, moderate, severe – and is to be reported on specific AE forms of the eCRF. If the in tensity of an AE worsens during study treatment administration, only the worst intensity is to be reported on the AE page. If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required. If an AE occurs during a washout or placebo run -in phase and a fterwards worsens during the treatment phase, a new AE form must be filled out with the intensity observed during study treatment administration. The three categories of intensity are defined as follows:  Mild The event may be noticeable to the subject. It does not influence daily activities, and usually does not require intervention.  Moderate The event may make the subject uncomfortable. Performance of daily activities may be influenced, and intervention may be needed."
80,page_80,"ACT -774312 Nasal polyposis Protocol ID-084A201 Final Version 3 25 July 2019, page 80/103 Confidential EudraCT: 2018 -000851 -42 Doc No D -19.158  Severe The event may cause noticeable discomfort, and usually interferes with daily activities. The subject may not be able to continue in the study, and treatment or intervention is usually needed. A mild, moderate, or severe AE may or may not be serious [see Section 4.3.1 ]. These terms are used to describe the intensity of a specific event. Medical judgment should be used on a case -by-case basis. Seriousness, rather than severity assessment, determines the regulatory reporting obligations. 4.1.3 Relationship to study treatment Each AE must be assessed by the investigator as to whether or not there is a reasonable possibility of causal relationship to the study treatment, and reported as either rela ted or unrelated. The determination of the likelihood that the study treatment caused the AE will be provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. 4.1.4 Adverse events related to study design or protocol -mandated procedures An AE is defined as relat ed to study design or protocol -mandated procedures if it appears to have a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship to either the study design or to protocol -mandated procedures. Examples include discontinuation of a subject ’s previous treatment dur ing a washout period leading to exacerbation of underlying disease. 4.1.5 Reporting of adverse events All AEs with an onset date after signing of the ICF and up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation or up to EOS must be recorded on specific AE forms o f the eCRF. Information to be collected in an AE form in the eCRF includes date of onset, action taken with the study treatment, outcome of AE, date of resolution (if applicable) and investigator ’s assessment of intensity, and relationship to study treatme nt, study design or protocol -mandated procedures. If the intensity of an AE worsens during study treatment administration, only the worst intensity should be reported on the AE form. If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required to be reported. For AEs ongoing at the start of study treatment, information on worsening of intensity after the start of study treatment will be collected on the AE form. Follow -up information on ongoing AE obtained after the subject ’s EOS visit will not be collected in the eCRF."

The final outcome of AEs that were ongoing at the EOS examination will not be recor ded in the eCRF (kept in source document only) ; these events will be marked as ongoing in the eCRF. The final outcome of these AEs will be provided in the clinical s tudy report. 4.2 Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions The expectedness of an SAE is determined by the sponsor according to the reference safety information (RSI) section provided in the most recent version of the IB. Any SAE that is assessed as related and unexpected against the RSI is known as a SUSAR. 4.3 Serious adverse events 4.3.1 Definitions 4.3.1.1 Serious adverse events An SAE is defined by ICH guidelines as any AE fulfilling at least one of the following criteria:  Fatal.  Life-threatening: refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death had it been more severe.  Requiring inpatient hospitalization, or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  Resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  Congenital anomaly or birth defec t.  Medically significant: refers to important medical events that may not immediately result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered to be SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject, and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions above. The following reasons for hospitalization are exempted from being reported:  Hospitalization for cosmetic elective surgery, or social and/or convenience reasons.  Hospitalization for pre -planned (i.e., planned prior to signing informed consent) surgery or standard monitoring of a pre -existing disease or medical condition that did not worsen, e.g., hospitalization for coronary angiography in a subject with stable angina pectoris."

Examples include discontinuation of a subject ’s previous treatment during a washout period leading to exacerbation of underlying disease or a complication of an invasive procedure that is specifically required by the protocol. 4.3.2 Reporting of serious adverse events All SAEs occurring after signing of the ICF up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation or up to EOS must be recorded on an SAE form. 4.3.2.1 After the follow -up period New SAEs occurring at any time after the 30 -day follow -up period after study treatment discontinuation must be reported to the Idorsia Global Drug Safety department within 24 h of the investigator ’s knowledge of the event, if considered causally related to previous exposure to study medication by the investigator. These SAEs are only entered in the drug safety data base, and hence will not affect study closure. 4.3.2.2 Reporting procedures All SAEs must be reported by the investigator to the Idorsia Global Drug Safety department without delay and at the latest 24 h after the investigator ’s first knowledge of the event. All S AEs must be recorded on SAE forms, irrespective of the study treatment received by the subject, and whether or not this event is considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment . These SAE forms must be e-mailed to the Idorsia Global Drug Safety department (for contact details , see page 3). The investigator must complete the SAE form in English, and must assess the causal relationship of the event to study treatment . Such preliminary reports must be followed by detailed descrip tions that should include copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, hospital discharge summaries and other documents when requested and applicable. Follow -up information about a previously reported SAE must also be reported within 24 hours of recei ving it. The Idorsia Global Drug Safety department may contact the investigator to obtain further information.

Such follow -up information will only be entered in the sponsor ’s drug safety database, and hence will not affect study closure. 5 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY AND ANALYSES 5.1 Statistical analysis p lan A statistical analysis p lan (SAP) will be written and finalized before study closure, i.e., database closure and unblinding of the randomization code. The SAP will provide full details of the analyses, data displays, and algorithms to be used for data derivations. The SAP will include the definition of major and minor protocol deviations and the link between major protocol deviations and the analysis sets. Major and minor protocol deviations will be identified by trained staff before study closure. 5.2 Analysis sets Four analysis se ts are defined.  All-treated set (ATS) This analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of the study treatment. The ATS will be employed in the analysis of the demographic , baseline, (primary) efficacy , and safety variables.  Per-protocol set (PPS) This analysis set includes all randomized subjects who completed the treatment up to Week 12 without protocol deviations that may affect the evaluation of the primary endpoints (to be defined in the SAP). The PPS will be employed i n the analysis of efficacy variables. The target number of subjects in the PPS is 21. If this number is unlikely to be reached, the number of subjects to be randomized may be increased over 24.  Pharmacokinetic set (PK set) This analysis set comprises all subjects from the ATS who completed treatment with ACT -774312 at least up to Week 2, had evaluable plasma concentrations, and did not deviate from the protocol in a way that might affect the evaluation of the PK endpoint s. The PK set will be employed in th e analysis of the PK parameters."

The PD set will be employed in the analysis of the PD variables. 5.3 Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to Week 12 in NPS as measured by nasal endoscopy (centrally assessed). 5.3.1 Statistical model The statistical model for the cha nges from baseline in NPS is a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM): Yijt = µ + αi + β t + (αβ)it + γXij + δ tXij+ εijt where Yijt is the change from baseline to time t (Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 or Week 12) for subject j in treatment group i; µ is the overall mean change from baseline; αi is the effect of treatment group i ( ∑αi = 0); βt is the effect of time t ( ∑βt = 0); (αβ)it is the interaction of treatment i and time t ( ∑(αβ) it = 0); Xij is the baseline NPS for subject j in treatment group i; δt is the interaction of baseline NPS and time ( ∑δt = 0); εijt is an error term where the vector εij follows a multivariate normal dist ribution with mean (vector) 0 and an unstructured covariance matrix ∑. Inference for the linear mixed model is based on restricted maximum likelihood estimation [Verbeke 2000 ]. Study site is not shown above but will be added to the model. 5.3.2 Hypotheses and statistical inference Statistical hypotheses will not formally be tested in this estimation study. 5.3.3 Primary endpoint analysis 5.3.3.1 Main analysis The main analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted o n the PPS. All NPS values observed between baseline and Week 12 will be included in this analysis. Changes from baseline to post -baseline visits in NPS will be analyzed using an MMRM with factors for treatment group, study site, visit, treatment by visit interaction and covariates for baseline NPS and the interaction between baseline NPS and visit.

Estimation of the treatment difference for the primary endpoint, change from baseline to Week 12 in NPS, will be based on the mixed model. Missing data handling in the primary analysis All subjects in the PPS are expected to have a Week 12 NPS. Any intermediate missing data will be handled by the mixed model. Missing values will not be imputed. 5.3.3.2 Confirmatory analyses A sensitiv ity analysis will be conducted o n the ATS using the same mixed model as for the primary analysis. In this approach missing va lues will not be imputed, but will be handled by the model assuming that the data are missi ng at random. Additionally, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed for the change from baseline to Week 12 in NPS with missing data imputed using last observation carried f orward. 5.3.4 Primary endpoint display The primary endpoint will be summarized by visit and treatment group displaying number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum , and maximum. 5.4 Secondary efficacy endpoints All secondary endpoints are listed in Section 3.8.1 . 5.4.1 Secondary efficacy endpoint analysis Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the PPS. Change from baseli ne to Week 12 in Zinreich -modified Lund -Mackay s core will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with a factor for treatment group and a covariate for the baseline score. 5.4.2 Secondary efficacy endpoint display All secondary endpoints will be summarized by visit an d treatment group using descriptive statistics (i.e., number of observations, mean, median, SD, minimum , and maximum for continuous endpoints; number and percentages for categorical endpoints). 5.4.3 Other efficacy endpoint display The display of the other efficacy endpoints is similar to that of the secondary endpoints . Additionally, the correlation between the primary and secondary efficacy e ndpoints (restricted to Wee k 12) versus the change in disease severity from baseline to Week 12 as assessed by the physi cian as well as by the patient will be explored."

The treatment -emergent period for the safety assessments is defined as the time from the fir st administration of study treatment to Visit 7 (EOS ) except for ECG (up to Visit 6, EOT) . All AEs and SAEs will be coded using MedDRA (Version 20.0 or a more recent version, if available). ECG abnormalities will be coded using CDISC SDTM terminology. All safety and tolerability data will be listed by treatment group and subject number. 5.7.1 Adverse events Treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated by primary system organ class (SOC), preferred term (PT) , and treatment group. The number (%) of subjects who experienced AEs coded with the same PT will be displayed (in descending order according to the incidence). Treatment -emergent AEs will also be tabulated by severity and by relationship to study treatment by SOC and PT. AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study treatment will be summarized in a similar manner to that used for AEs. Reasons for premature discontinuation of study treatment will be listed , in particular to asses s whether treatment dis continuation was caused by cortic osteroid administration for NP and/or surgery for NP. Treatment -emergent SAEs and deaths will be summarized in a similar manner to that used for AEs. SAEs/deaths occurring before study treatment initiation or after EOS will be listed . 5.7.2 Vital signs At each time point, absolute values and change from baseline of supine BP and pulse rate will be summarized with mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum values. The number (%) of out -of-range values (based on available observations) will be presented. Values outside the reference range will be flagged in the listing. 5.7.3 ECG recordings Treatment -emergent ECG abnormalities will be summarized and presented in a similar manner to that used for AEs. At each time point, absolute values and ch ange from baseline of ECG numeric variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The number of available observations will be presented. 5.7.4 Clinical laboratory tests At each time point, absolute values and change from baseline of clinical laborat ory variables will be summarized with mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum values."

Values outside the investigator ’s normal range will be flagged in the listing. Treatment -emergent marked laboratory abnormalities will be summarized for each laboratory variable. The sponsor ’s internal guidelines will be used for the standardization of numeric values obtained from different laboratories and/or using different normal ranges. Standard numeric laboratory variables will be transformed into standard units. Absolute values and changes in laboratory values converted to standardized units during the course of the study will be summarized by computing the usual location and sca le statistics by period and treatment group. 5.8 Exposure to study treatment Duration of randomized treatment (i.e., date of last intake minus date of first intake plus one day) will be summarized by treatment group in the ATS. 5.9 Baseline variables and concomit ant medications These analyses will be performed for the ATS. Continuous demographic variables (e.g., age, weight, BMI) will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Categorical demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, race) will be summarized by counts and percentages. Other baseline subject characteristics will only be listed. Previous and concomitant medications will be coded according to the WHO Drug code and the Anatomical Therapeutic C hemical class code (Version March 2018, or a more recent version, if available). Concomitant medications will be listed by treatment group and subject number. All reported medical history conditions will be coded using MedDRA (Version 20.0 or a more recent version, if available). Concomitant medications will be listed by t reatment group and subject number. 5.10 Exploratory analyses Exploratory, data -driven analyses may be performed, with the caveat that any statistical inference will not have confirmatory value. 5.11 Interim analyses No interim analysis is planned."

An amendment could therefore occur before or after the approval of these docum ents by IECs/IRBs or health a uthorities. Each amendment must be documented in writing and approved by the sponsor, and must be reviewed by the investigator. Changes to the Core Subject Information and Informed Consent requested by IECs/IRBs are not conside red to be formal amendments, as long as they do not significantly change the core document or affect the protocol. 6.1.1.1 Non-substantial amendment Purely administrative or minor logistical changes require only a non -substantial amendment. Such changes include but are not limited to changes in study staff or contact details (e.g., the sponsor instead of CRO monitors), or minor changes in the packaging or labeling of study treatment . The implementation of a non-substantial amendment may be undertaken with or without notification to the appropriate IECs/IRBs and health a uthorities (subject to national regulations). It does not require their approval. 6.1.1.2 Substantial amendment A substantial amendment is required for significant changes. These include, but are not limited to, new data affecting the safety of subjects, and changes to the objectives or endpoints of the study, eligibility criteria, dose regimen , study assessments/procedures, or treatment or study duration, with or without the need to modify the Core Subject Information and Informed Consent. Substantial amendments must be approved by the appropriate IECs/IRBs, and in some jurisdictions by the health authorities . The implementation of a substantial amendment may only occur after formal approval by the appropriate IECs/IRBs and/or health a uthorities, and must be signed by the investigators. 6.1.1.3 Urgent amendment An urgent amendment might become necessary to preserve the safety of the subjects included in the study. The requirements for approval must not prevent any immediate action being taken by the investigator or the sponsor in the best interests of the subjects. If deemed necessary, an investigator ma y therefore implement an immediate change to the protocol for safety reasons, and in such exceptional cases the implementation of urgent"

In such cases, the inve stigator must notify the sponsor within 24 hours. IECs/IRBs and health authorities must be notified immediately in writing. A related substantial amendment will be prepared and submitted by the sponsor to the appropriate IECs/IRBs and health a uthorities wi thin 10 working days of receiving the notification. 6.1.2 Monitoring Monitoring of this study is the responsibility of the sponsor. The sponsor ’s monitor must contact and visit the investigator regularly, and must be allowed, on request, to have access to all s tudy-related documents and facilities used in the study, as well as all source documents needed, to verify the entries on the eCRFs; provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in agreement with local regulations. It is the monitor ’s responsibility to inspect the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered on them. The sponsor ’s monitoring standards require full ver ification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of the study treatment dispensing, AEs, and SAEs . The amount of verification of other relevant safety , tolerability , PK, and PD endpoints will be d efined based on the study objectives ; the extent of additional checks for the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs will be discussed before the monitoring visit by the monitor and the clinical pharmacologist, and documented in the corresponding mo nitoring guideline . The investigator must ensure that subject anonymity will be maintained. On all documents submitted to the sponsor, subjects must not be identified by their names and date of birth, but by subject number only. The investigator must keep a subject identification log showing the subject number, the subject ’s name, date of birth, and address or any other locally accepted identifiers. Documents identifying the subjects (e.g., subjects ’ signed ICF must not be sent to the sponsor, and must be k ept by the investigator in strict confidence. The i nvestigator and sub-investigators agree to cooperate with the monitor(s) to ensure that any issues detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. If the subject is hospitalized or dies in a hospital other than the study center, the investigator is responsible for contacting that hospital in order to document the SAE. The investigator must supply the sponsor on request with any required background data from the study documentation or clinic records. This is particularly important when errors in data transcription into eCRFs are suspected. In the event of special problems and/or"

An initiation visit will be performed before the site before the first subject is screened . Following the initiation visit, a copy of the completed initiation visit report and follow -up letter will be provided to the invest igator and filed in the ISF. The study treatment will be shipped to the site upon approval of the required essential documents. Monitoring visits and contacts will occur at regular intervals thereafter, and a close -out visit will be performed after study database closure. 6.1.3 Data management 6.1.3.1 Data collection A subject Screening and Enrollment Log must be completed for all subjects, both eligible and non -eligible, with the reasons for exclusion where applicable. Electronic Data Capture (EDC) via eCRFs ( will be used for this study. eCRFs will be made available by Idorsia . For each subject who received at least one administration of study treatment , an eCRF must be completed and signed electronic ally by the investigator or sub- investigator. This also applies to those subjects who fail to complete the study. If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF. Study data will be collected either by the investigator or by cl inical research staff on paper source data documents and entered by the site staff into the eCRFs in a timely manner or transferred electronically and loaded into the eCRFs by Idorsia Data Management at specified time points. The eCRFs must be kept up -to-date so that they reflect the latest observations on the enrolled subjects. All source documents will be retained by the clinical site. Photocopies of completed source documents will be provided only if essential (i.e., for regulatory purposes) at the reque st of the sponsor. In accord ance with ICH -GCP , the location of data identified as source data will be specified on the Source Document Identification List. The investigator/delegate must confirm by electronic signature that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. All eCRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by the investigator or other, authorized, study site personnel and only by individuals who have received training on the EDC system. Site staff may be allowed access to t he system only after training is completed. Training must be documented and a log of all EDC users and their rights within the system be maintained."

Errors must b e crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted (if necessary the reason must be noted), and the change initialed and dated by the investigator, sub-investigator, or study nurse. After database lock, a CD including printouts of filled eCRFs for all subjects will be provided to the site (for c ontact details, pages 2 and 3). The investigator will have read-only access to the eCRF data until receipt of this CD. 6.1.3.2 Data management and quality control Data management is the responsibility of Idorsia. The data entered into the EDC system will be systematically checked by Idorsia and site staff, using error messages from validation programs and database listings. All queries are raised and answered electronically within the EDC system. Once all queries a re resolved, the authorized physician will review and electronically sign the eCRFs. With the eCRF, the data checks made for consistency and plausibility will be done via the EDC system or performed manually by Data Management as defined in the Data Valida tion Specifications. Sponsor monitoring is performed on -site, reviewing the data for correctness, plausibility, and completeness. Safety laboratory samples will be processed by the local laboratory and the results will be sent by the sites to the external service provider , who will electronically send the data to Idorsia to load into the clinical database. A data review will be performed by trained staff of Idorsia before database closure. SAEs occurring after ICF signature and up to EOS will be reconciled between the clinical database at Idorsia and the Idorsia Drug Safety database before database closure. The PD data will be stored separately and will be merged with the clinical database. Therefore, the availability of the se results will not affect study closure. The PK samples will be processed by the bioanalytical laboratory at Idorsia (Preclinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism) and the results will be sent electronically to Idorsia. The PK data will be stored separate ly and will be merged with the clinical database. Therefore, the availability of these results will not affect study closure. After the clinical database has been declared complete and accurate, the clinical database will be locked. Any changes to the clin ical database after that time may only be requested"

A number of attributes are considered of universal importance to source data and the records that hold those data. These include that the data and records are accurate, legible, contemporaneous, ori ginal (or certified copy), attributable, complete, consistent, enduring , and available when needed. These records are to be classified into two different categories of documents: investigator ’s file, and subject clinical source documents. These records mu st be kept by the investigator for as long as is necessary to comply with Idorsia ’s requirements (e.g., as specified in the clinical study agreement), and national and/or international regulations, whichever would be the longest period. If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements, respecting the data confidentiality, must be made between the investigator and Idorsia to store these documents outside the site , so that they can be retrieved in the event of a regulatory inspection. No study document should be destroyed without prior written approval from Idorsia . Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party, or move them to another l ocation, Idorsia must be notified in advance. If the site is using an electronic/computerized system to store subject medical records, it can be used for the purpose of the clinical study if it is validated (as per 21 CFR Part 11 or equivalent standard) a nd if the monitor has been provided with personal and restricted access to study subjects only, to verify consistency between electronic source data and the eCRF during monitoring visits. If the site is using an electronic/computerized system to store subj ect medical records but it could not be confirmed that the system is validated or if the monitor could not be provided access to the system, the site is requested to print the complete set of source data needed for verification by the mo nitor. The print outs must be numbered, stapled together with a coversheet, signed and dated by the investigator/delegate to confirm that these certifie d copies are exact copies containing the same information as the original subject ’s data. The printouts will be considered a s the official clinical study records. In order to verify that the process the site uses to prepare certified copies is reliable, the monitor must be able to observe this process and confirm that the comparison of the source documents and the certified co py did not reveal inconsistencies. The monitor does not need to verify this process for all data of all subjects but at least for some of them (e.g., first"
95,page_95,"ACT -774312 Nasal polyposis Protocol ID-084A201 Final Version 3 25 July 2019, page 95/103 Confidential EudraCT: 2018 -000851 -42 Doc No D -19.158 subject; regular check during the study of critical data like inclusion/exclusion criteria, endpoint s for some subjects) as per Idorsia ’s instructions. If it were not possible for the monitor to observe this process, it would not be possible to rely on the site ’s certified copies and therefore the site cannot be selected for the clinical study. The print outs should be filed with the subject medical records. The site master file will contain all the essential documents that are required to always be up-to-date and filed at site as per ICH -GCP section 8. The site master file will include a table of content s listing the essential documents. All study related documentation must be maintained in the site master file. In some cases, exceptions can be discussed with the monitor regarding the filing of the study documents outside the site master file. It should be clearly documented where each document is filed. This note to file should be present in the specific tab of the document in the site master file. The site master file must be stored in a secure and restricted -access area during and after the study. It mus t be kept by the site for as long as needed to comply with any applicable rules and regulations, ICH -GCP as well as instructions from Idorsia . If the site needs to transfer the site master file to another location and/or if site facility can no longer stor e the site master file the investigator must inform Idorsia immediately. If the investigator will change, or if the site will relocate, the monitor must be notified as soon as possible. 6.1.5 Audit Idorsia ’s Quality Assurance, Systems & Compliance representati ves may audit the investigator site (during the study or after its completion). The purpose of this visit will be to determine the investigator ’s adherence to ICH -GCP, the protocol, and applicable regulations; adherence to Idorsia ’s requirements (e.g., standard operating procedure s) will also be verified. Prior to initiating this audit, the investigator will be contacted by Idorsia to arrange a time for the audit. The investigator and staff must cooperate with the auditor(s) and allow access to all study documentation (e.g., subject records) and facilities. 6.1.6 Inspections Health a uthorities and/or IEC/ IRB may also wish to conduct an inspection of Idorsia ’s clinical study (during the study or after its completion)."

The investigator and staff must cooperate with inspector(s) and allow access to all study documentation (e.g., subject records) and study facilities. 6.1.7 Handling of study treatment (s) The sponsor will supply all study treatment (s) to the site according to local regulations. Study treatment supplies must be kept in an appropriate, secure area and st ored according to the conditions specified on the study treatment labels. The site must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment (s) on an accountability form, which must be given to the monitor at the end of the study. An accurate record of the date and amount of study treatment (s) dispensed to each subject must be available for inspection at any time. All study treatment supplies are to be used only in accordance with this protocol and not for any other purpose. The res ponsible person must not destroy any study treatment labels or unused study treatment supply. On termination of the study, the monitor will check accountability of all used and unused study treatment. Used and unused study treatment containers must be retu rned to the sponsor depot once study treatment accountability is final and has been checked by the sponsor or its deputy, and written permission for destruction has been obtained from the sponsor. 6.1.8 Publication and reporting of study results Study results wi ll be documented in a clinical study report that will be signed by Idorsia representatives and the investigator . The investigator will have the opportunity to review the analysis of the data and to discuss the interpretation of the study results with Idors ia prior to publication. The sponsor will post the key elements of this protocol and the summary of results within the required timelines on publically accessible databases (e.g., clinicaltrials.gov, EU database), as required by law and regulation. In acco rdance with Good Publication Practices and ethical practice, the results of the study will be submitted for publication in a peer -reviewed journal. Study results can be submitted for presentation at a congress before publication in a peer -reviewed journal. Authorship will be determined in accordance with the International Committee of Journal Editors criteria, and be based on:"

The list of authors of any publication of study results may include representatives of Idorsia , and will be determined by mutual agreement. Any study -related publication written independently by investigators must be submitted to Idorsia for review at least 30 days prior to submission for publication or presentation. Upon review, Idorsia may provide comments, and may also request alterations and/or deletions for the sole purpose of protecting its confidential information and/or patent rights. Neither the institution nor the investigator should permit publication during suc h a review period. 6.1.9 Disclosure and confidentiality By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees to keep all information provided by the sponsor in strict confidence, and to request similar confidentiality from his or her staff and the IEC/IRB. Study do cuments provided by the sponsor (including IBs, protocols, eCRFs , and other protocol -related documents) will be stored appropriately to ensure their confidentiality. The information provided by the sponsor to the investigator may not be disclosed to others without direct written authorization from the sponsor, except to the extent necessary to obtain informed consent from subjects who wish to participate in the trial. 6.1.10 Premature termination or suspension of the study Both the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. The study may be prematurely terminated if the sponsor decides to discontinue the development of ACT -774312 (continuation has become scientifically meaningless) or due to significant safety findings occurring in this study. If a study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor must promptly inform the investigator, the IECs/IRBs and health a uthorities, as appropriate, and provide the reasons for the termina tion or suspension. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended for any reason, the investigator , in agreement with the sponsor , must promptly inform all enrolled subjects, and ensure their appropriate treatment and follow -up."
