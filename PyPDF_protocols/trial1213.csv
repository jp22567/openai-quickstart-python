Protocol Number: M16-098 Name of Study Drug: Upadacitinib Phase of Development: 2/3 Name of Active Ingredient: Upadacitinib Date of Protocol Synopsis: 20 December 2019 Protocol Title: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Upadacitinib in Subjects with Active Ankylosing Spondylitis Objectives: The primary objectives of the study are: Period 1 1. To evaluate the efficacy of upadacitinib compared with placebo on reduction of signs and symptoms as measured by proportion of subjects who achieve an Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) 40 response at Week 14 in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have had an inadequate response to at least two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs, and who are biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD)-naïve. 2. To assess the safety and tolerability of upadacitinib in subjects with active AS who have had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs, and who are bDMARD-naïve. Period 2 To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib through up to 2 years of treatment in subjects who have completed Period 1. Investigators: Multicenter Study Sites: Approximately 107 sites worldwide Study Population: Adults who have a clinical diagnosis of AS and meet the modified New York Criteria for AS prior to study entry, who have had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs over an at least 4-week period in total at maximum recommended or tolerated doses or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs as defined by the Investigator, and who are bDMARD-naïve. Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: Approximately 170 subjects Methodology: This is a Phase 2/3 multicenter study that includes two periods. Period 1 is a 14-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period designed to compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD versus placebo for the treatment of subjects with active AS who have had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs over an at least 4-week period in total at maximum recommended or tolerated doses or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs as defined by the Investigator, and who are bDMARD-naïve. Period 2 is an open-label long-term extension to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD in subjects with AS who have completed Period 1. The study duration will include a 35-day screening period; a 14-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period (Period 1); a 90-week open-label extension period (Period 2); and a 30-day follow-up visit."
4,page_4,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 5 Methodology (Continued): X-ray of the pelvis will be performed within the 35-day screening period to evaluate the sacroiliac (SI) joints to confirm the fulfillment of the modified New York Criteria for AS. X-ray of the spine will also be performed within the 35-day screening period to assess for total spinal ankylosis; subjects with total spinal ankylosis are not eligible for this study. The x-rays of the spine and pelvis will not be required during the Screening Period if the subject had a previous anteroposterior (AP) pelvis x-ray and lateral spine x-rays within 90 days of the Screening Period, provided that the x-rays are confirmed to be adequate for the required evaluations and are deemed acceptable by the central imaging vendor. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups: !Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (n = 85) !Group 2: Placebo (n = 85) Randomization will be stratified by Screening high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) ( ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN] vs. > ULN) and geographic region (United States [US]/Canada, Japan, Rest of the World [RoW]). If entering the study on concomitant conventional-synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) (i.e., methotrexate [MTX], leflunomide, sulfasalazine [SSZ], and/or hydroxychloroquine), the subject must be on a stable dose for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. If entering the study on concomitant oral corticosteroids, subject must be on a stable dose of prednisone ( ≤ 10 mg/day) or oral corticosteroid equivalents for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. The dose(s) of csDMARDs and corticosteroids should remain stable throughout the study (except as described for rescue therapy), but may be decreased only for safety reasons. If entering the study on concomitant NSAIDs, tramadol, combination of acetaminophen and codeine or hydrocodone, and/or non-opioid analgesics, subject must be on stable dose(s) for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug and should remain stable throughout the study (except as described for rescue therapy), but may be decreased only for safety reasons. Starting at Week 16, subjects who do not achieve at least an ASAS 20 response at two consecutive visits will have the option to add or modify doses of NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, low potency opioid medications (tramadol or combination of acetaminophen and codeine or hydrocodone), and/or modify dose of MTX or SSZ at Week 20 or thereafter. Starting at Week 24, subjects who still do not achieve at least an ASAS 20 response at two consecutive visits will be discontinued from study drug treatment. Subjects who complete the Week 14 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the open-label long-term extension portion of the study, Period 2 (90 weeks). Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib in Period 1 will continue to receive upadacitinib in an open-label manner. Subjects who were randomized to placebo at Baseline will also receive open-label upadacitinib 15 mg QD at Week 14. The primary analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Week 14 or have prematurely discontinued prior to Week 14. Study sites and subjects will remain blinded to the treatment assignment in Period 1 for the duration of the study. Optional samples may be collected for exploratory research at designated time points throughout the study."

7,page_7,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 8 Criteria for Evaluation (Continued): Efficacy (Continued):Additional key secondary efficacy endpoints are: !Proportion of subjects with ASAS 20 response at Week 14; !Change from Baseline in MRI SPARCC score (SI joints) at Week 14. Additional pre-specified endpoints are outlined in the protocol. Pharmacokinetic: Blood samples for assay of upadacitinib in plasma will be collected at specified study visits after Baseline. Blood samples at Week 2 and Week 4 visits will be collected prior to dosing, if possible. For all other visits, blood samples will be collected at any time during the visit. Safety: Screening assessments will include medical history, vital signs measurements, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests. The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study: concomitant medication review, adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital sign measurements, physical examination (if required), and laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: All efficacy analyses will be carried out using the Full Analysis Set population, which includes all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. Analysis of the Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints: Analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted comparing upadacitinib 15 mg QD versus placebo. The overall type I error rate of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be strongly controlled. For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment group. Comparisons between the upadacitinib group and the placebo group will be conducted using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusting for main stratification factors. Analysis of the Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints (Continued): For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be reported for each treatment group. Comparisons between the upadacitinib treatment group and the placebo group will be carried out using the Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) with treatment group, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and the corresponding baseline values and the main stratification factors as the covariates. Analysis of Structural Disease Progression:Progression of structural damage will be assessed using the Modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS) with conventional radiograph. In addition, evaluation of structural changes in the spine will be explored in subjects who are participating in the low-dose CT scan substudy. Long-Term Efficacy: Long-term efficacy by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics."
8,page_8,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 9 Statistical Methods (Continued): Pharmacokinetic:Individual plasma concentrations of upadacitinib will be tabulated and summarized. A non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach will be used to estimate the population central values and the empirical Bayesian estimates of the individual values for upadacitinib oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F). Additional parameters may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data. Safety: Safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set, which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. Safety will be assessed by Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), physical examinations, laboratory assessments, and vital signs. The number and percent of subjects experiencing TEAEs by treatment group will be tabulated by the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ®) system organ class (SOC) and preferred terms (PT). In addition, summary of serious adverse events (SAEs) and TEAEs by severity and relationship to study drug as assessed by the Investigators will be provided. SAEs, severe TEAEs, or TEAEs that lead to premature study discontinuation will be listed. The changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory variables at each visit as compared to baseline will be summarized. Shift of laboratory values from baseline at defined time points will be tabulated."

After the failure of one NSAID, a change to a second NSAID is recommended. In patients with persistently high disease activity despite a course of two NSAIDs given over a total of at least 4 weeks, initiation of"
20,page_20,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 21 a biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) is recommended, and current practice is to start with a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor (TNFi). If TNFi therapy fails, switching to another TNFi or an interleukin 17 inhibitor (IL-17i) is recommended. This recommendation is based on randomized controlled AS studies with TNFi and the IL-17i secukinumab that showed an overall good benefit-risk profile. 13-20 Several TNFi have also been successfully evaluated in nr-axSpA in controlled studies. 17,21-23 Despite recent advances in the treatment of axial SpA, there remains a significant unmet medical need as only approximately 45% to 50% of patients show an ASAS 40 response and only approximately 15% to 20% achieve a state of remission. In addition, treatment options are still limited when compared with other rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or PsA. In axial SpA, csDMARDs and long-term corticosteroids are not efficacious and therefore not recommended for treatment of axial symptoms. 12 Other than TNFi and secukinumab, ustekinumab, an IL-12/23 inhibitor, has shown efficacy in axial SpA in a small open-label Phase 2 trial. 24 Also, recently, the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib has demonstrated efficacy in a placebo-controlled Phase 2 AS study, showing efficacy on signs and symptoms, as well as reduction of active inflammation both in the spine and sacroiliac (SI) joints on MRI. 25 Overview of Upadacitinib (ABT-494) Inhibition of JAK-mediated pathways is a promising approach for the treatment of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as axial SpA. AbbVie is developing a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, upadacitinib, that may address the current needs. The JAK family is composed of 4 family members: JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2). These cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases are associated with membrane cytokine receptors such as common gamma-chain receptors and the glycoprotein 130 transmembrane proteins. 26 Activation of JAK pathways initiates expression of survival factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocyte cellular"
21,page_21,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 22 trafficking and cell proliferation, which contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Hence, the JAK family has evoked considerable interest in the area of inflammatory diseases, leading to the development of various JAK inhibitors with different selectivity profiles against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2. Tofacitinib, the first in this class, has been approved in the United States, Europe, and in other countries for treating moderately to severely active RA patients. Although tofacitinib, a non-selective JAK inhibitor, improves the clinical signs and symptoms and inhibits structural progression in RA patients, questions regarding the safety profile remain, including serious infections, herpes zoster reactivation, malignancies, and hematologic adverse events (AEs). The second generation of JAK inhibitors, with different selectivity profiles against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2, are in development. Upadacitinib is a novel JAK1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of adult patients with inflammatory diseases (RA, Crohn's disease [CD], ulcerative colitis [UC], atopic dermatitis [AD], and PsA). Based on in vitro selectivity assays and in vivo animal models, upadacitinib has demonstrated inhibition of JAK1 at efficacious drug exposure levels. The enhanced selectivity of upadacitinib may have the potential for an improved benefit/risk profile by mitigating JAK2 inhibitory effects on erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis. Upadacitinib is also less potent against JAK3, an important component of lymphocyte activation and function. As such, treatment with upadacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor with reduced JAK3 inhibition, could result in a decreased risk for infection (including viral reactivation) and/or malignancy compared to less selective JAK inhibitors. Additional information regarding indications under study can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure. 27 3.1 Differences Statement Study M16-098 differs from other upadacitinib studies as it is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in subjects with AS."
22,page_22,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 23 3.2 Benefits and Risks A detailed discussion of the pre-clinical and clinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology, and safety experience with upadacitinib can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure. 27 The results of all genetic toxicology testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic. Embryonic and fetal development studies indicate that upadacitinib is teratogenic in both rats and rabbits. Based on these findings, all women of childbearing potential must agree to use protocol-specified pregnancy avoidance measures as outlined in the protocol. To date, upadacitinib has been studied in two Phase 2 studies in subjects with RA and is being evaluated in CD, UC, AD, and PsA. Two Phase 2 studies have been completed: two randomized controlled trials (Study M13-550 [NCT01960855] and Study M13-537 [NCT02066389]) in 575 subjects with moderately to severely active RA on background methotrexate (MTX). Four Phase 2 studies are ongoing: one open-label extension to the completed RA studies (Study M13-538 [NCT02049138]); one randomized, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study in subjects with moderately to severely active CD (Study M13-740 [NCT02365649]); one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with moderately to severely active UC (Study M14-234 [NCT02819635]); and one randomized, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study in subjects with moderate to severe AD (Study M16-048 [NCT02925117]). The Phase 3 clinical development programs for RA and PsA have been initiated, and enrollment in the RA studies is ongoing. Results are available from two RA Phase 3 clinical trials (Study M13-549 [NCT02675426] and Study M13-542 [NCT02706847]) evaluating upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD in subjects with moderate to severe RA. Study M13-549 evaluated upadacitinib compared to placebo in subjects with inadequate response to csDMARDs. At Week 12, among subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg (n = 221) or 30 mg QD (n = 219), 64% and 66% achieved ACR20, respectively, compared to 36% of subjects receiving placebo (n = 221) ( P< 0.001). Similarly, the rate of subjects achieving ACR50 and ACR70 was also significantly higher in the upadacitinib groups – ACR50 of 38%,"
23,page_23,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 24 43%, and 15% and ACR70 of 21%, 27%, and 6% in the upadacitinib 15 mg, 30 mg, and placebo groups, respectively ( P< 0.001 for all comparisons). Low disease activity (LDA), based on a DAS28 (CRP) of ≤ 3.2, was achieved by 48% of subjects receiving either dose of upadacitinib, compared to 17% of subjects receiving placebo ( P< 0.001).28 Study M13-542 evaluated upadacitinib compared to placebo in subjects with inadequate response to bDMARDs. At Week 12, among subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg (n = 164) or 30 mg QD (n = 165), 65% and 56% of subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg QD achieved ACR20, respectively, compared to 28% of subjects receiving placebo (n = 169) ( P< 0.001). Similarly, the rate of subjects achieving ACR50 and ACR70 was also higher in the upadacitinib groups – ACR50 of 34%, 36%, and 12% and ACR70 of 12%, 23%, and 7% in the upadacitinib 15 mg, 30 mg, and placebo groups, respectively ( P< 0.001 for all comparisons except ACR70 for the 15 mg dose). Low disease activity, based on a DAS28 (CRP) of ≤ 3.2, was achieved by 43% and 42% of subjects receiving upadacitinib 15mg and 30 mg, respectively, compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo ( P< 0.001). 29 Data on the safety of treatment with upadacitinib are available from the Phase 2 studies in patients with RA. 30,31 Safety data from these two Phase 2 studies (N = 575) showed that the types and frequencies of AEs during upadacitinib treatment were consistent with subjects with moderately to severely active RA receiving immunomodulatory therapy. The incidences of AEs were numerically higher in the upadacitinib dose groups, with a trend toward higher rates with higher doses of upadacitinib. The most frequently reported AEs (≥ 5%) in the upadacitinib-treated subjects were urinary tract infection, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and nausea. There were 6 subjects (1.3% of total combined populations) with herpes zoster reactivation distributed across the upadacitinib dose groups, and 2 subjects (1.9%) in the placebo groups. In these two 12-week studies, a total of 2 subjects in the upadacitinib treatment groups reported malignancies. One subject reported non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma), and 1 subject was diagnosed with lung cancer 11 days after the final scheduled visit and subsequently died 14 weeks after study completion. These events"
24,page_24,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 25 were reported by the Investigators as not possibly related to study drug. No events of gastrointestinal perforation were reported. Elevations of liver function tests were sporadic with no clear dose-response relationship observed. As observed with other JAK inhibitors, treatment with upadacitinib resulted in an increase in lipids (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] and high density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]). There was a trend for lower red blood cell counts, especially at the two highest doses (12 mg twice daily [BID] and 18 mg BID); lower white blood cell counts; and reductions in Natural Killer (NK) cells. Among subjects with laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation (as evidenced by hsCRP > upper limit of normal [ULN]), treatment with lower doses of upadacitinib (3 mg BID and 6 mg BID) was associated with improvements in mean hemoglobin relative to placebo. At higher doses, there was a reduction in mean hemoglobin; however, the mean hemoglobin levels remained within normal range throughout the treatment period. In the two Phase 3 studies in RA (Studies M13-549 and M13-542), the safety profile was consistent with that observed in the upadacitinib Phase 2 clinical trials in RA. Events of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib. No studies in subjects with axial SpA have been performed with upadacitinib. The ability of upadacitinib to modulate inflammation and bone formation in vivo was assessed using collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. The extended rat CIA preclinical model is supportive of inflammation-driven new bone formation in SpA. Oral doses of upadacitinib at 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg BID for 4 weeks, starting at peak inflammation in the model, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of inflammation, as well as bone destruction and new bone formation based on paw swelling scores, microCT evaluation of bone, and histologic evaluation of the arthritic paw. At the study endpoint, there was both significant joint destruction and periosteal bone formation in the arthritic ankle in vehicle-treated animals. Upadacitinib inhibition of new bone formation in an extended rat CIA model provides supportive data for further evaluation of upadacitinib in axial SpA."
25,page_25,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 26 In summary, upadacitinib is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor with the ability to decrease joint inflammation and damage mediated by JAK signaling. The Phase 2 program with upadacitinib in RA demonstrated efficacy for improvement in signs and symptoms of RA, and the safety results were consistent with those known to be associated with JAK inhibition. 30-40 Current clinical data have not identified any new safety issues of concern compared to what is known about JAK inhibition in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Upadacitinib is currently being tested in Phase 3 in RA. Also, the Phase 2 study with tofacitinib established proof of mechanism of JAK inhibition in AS. 25 Taken together, the data from a preclinical extended rat CIA model, the safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2 RA program and two Phase 3 studies in RA, as well as the data from the tofacitinib Phase 2 AS study, support the investigation of upadacitinib 15 mg QD in subjects with AS. A detailed rationale on the selection of the dose is provided in Section 5.6.4. The current Phase 2/3 Study M16-098 will assess the benefit- to-risk profile of upadacitinib in subjects with active AS who have had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs, and who are bDMARD-naïve. 4.0 Study Objective The primary objectives of the study are: Period 1 1. To evaluate the efficacy of upadacitinib compared with placebo on reduction of signs and symptoms as measured by the proportion of subjects who achieve an ASAS 40 response at Week 14 in subjects with active AS who have had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs, and who are bDMARD-naïve. 2. To assess the safety and tolerability of upadacitinib in subjects with active AS who have had an inadequate response to at least two NSAI Ds or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs, and who are bDMARD-naïve."

Period 1 is a 14-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period designed to compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD versus placebo for the treatment of subjects with active AS who have had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs over an at least 4-week period in total at maximum recommended or tolerated doses or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs as defined by the Investigator, and who are bDMARD-naïve. Period 2 is an open-label long-term extension to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD in subjects with AS who have completed Period 1. The study was designed to enroll approximately 170 subjects to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. The study duration will include a 35-day screening period; a 14-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period (Period 1); a 90-week open-label extension period (Period 2); and a 30-day follow-up visit. X-ray of the pelvis will be performed within the 35-day screening period to evaluate the SI joints to confirm the fulfillment of the modified New York Criteria for AS (Appendix C ). X-ray of the spine will also be performed within the 35-day screening period to assess for total spinal ankylosis; subjects with total spinal ankylosis are not eligible for this study. The x-rays of the spine and pelvis will not be required during the"

Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups: ●Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (n = 85) ●Group 2: Placebo (n = 85) Randomization will be stratified by Screening hsCRP ( ≤ ULN vs. > ULN) and geographic region (United States [US]/Canada, Japan, Rest of the World [RoW]). If entering the study on concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., MTX, leflunomide, sulfasalazine [SSZ], and/or hy droxychl oroquine), the subject must be on a stable dose for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. If entering the study on concomitant oral corticosteroids, subject must be on a stable dose of prednisone ( ≤ 10 mg/day) or oral corticosteroid equivalents for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. The dose(s) of csDMARDs and corticosteroids should remain stable throughout the study (except as described for rescue therapy), but may be decreased only for safety reasons.

Starting at Week 24, subjects who still do not achieve at least an ASAS 20 response at two consecutive visits will be disc ontinued from study drug treatment. Subjects who complete the Week 14 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the open-label long-term extension portion of the study, Period 2 (90 weeks). Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib in Period 1 will continue to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD in an open-label manner. Subjects who were randomized to placebo at Baseline will also receive open-label upadacitinib 15 mg QD at Week 14. The primary analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Week 14 or have prematurely discontinued prior to Week 14. Study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the study (Periods 1 and 2). Optional samples may be collected for exploratory research at designated time points throughout the study. Subjects will have an x-ray of the spine at Week 104. All subjects who meet eligibility criteria will have an MRI evaluation of the SI joints, as well as the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of the spine, prior to or at the Baseline Visit, at Week 14, and Week 104.

Spine and Pelvis X-rays Detailed instructions for performing and transmitting the study-related x-rays of spine and pelvis are provided in a separate Imaging Acquisition Guideline (IAG)/Site Operations Manual. Handling of X-rays of Spine and Pelvis at Screening Screening x-rays of spine (lateral views of cervical and lumbar spine) and pelvis (AP view) must be performed within the 35-day screening period. The lateral spine x-rays will be centrally read; subjects with total spinal ankylosis are not eligible for this study. The AP pelvis x-ray will also be centrally read to evaluate the SI joints for the presence of sacroiliitis consistent with AS based on the modified New York Criteria for AS (Appendix C ). The x-rays of the spine and pelvis will not be required during the Screening Period if the subject had a previous AP pelvis x-ray and lateral spine x-rays within 90 days of the Screening Period, provided that the x-rays are confirmed to be adequate for the required evaluations and are deemed acceptable by the central imaging vendor. X-rays will be sent to the central imaging laboratory designated by the Sponsor. Digitalized images are acceptable, provided that they meet the specifications outlined in the IAG/Site Operations Manual. X-rays not meeting the quality requirements must be repeated within the 35-day screening window. The AP pelvis x-ray will be read by the central imaging vendor solely to evaluate the SI joints for the presence of sacroiliitis consistent with AS based on the modified New York Criteria for AS, while the x-rays of the spine will be read by the central imaging vendor only for the purposes of scoring for radiographic progression. Subjects can only receive first dose of study drug after the x-rays have been centrally read and sacroiliitis is confirmed."

Handling of X-rays of Spine after Baseline X-rays of the spine will be obtained at the Week 104 Visit (end of study). If a subject prematurely discontinues the study and/or study drug, depending on the time of discontinuation, new x-rays of the spine may be needed. ●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study and/or study drug before Week 76 will not have x-rays performed at the PD Visit. ○If the subject continues study participation, the subject will follow the regular visit schedule, and an x-ray will be performed at the Week 104 Visit. ●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study and/or study drug at or after Week 76 will have x-rays performed at the PD Visit. ○If the subject continues study participation, the subject will follow the regular visit schedule, but an x-ray will not be performed at the Week 104 Visit. The x-rays of the spine will be read by the central imaging vendor only for the purposes of scoring for radiographic progression. MRI of Spine and SI Joints All subjects who meet eligibility criteria will have an MRI evaluation of the SI joints, as well as the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of the spine, prior to or at the Baseline Visit, the Week 14 Visit, as well as the Week 104 Visit. If a site is unable to obtain the MRI prior to Baseline Visit, a window of 3 days post-dose will be allowed. For the MRI at Week 14, a window of –7 days/+ 3 days will be allowed; for the MRI at Week 104, a window of ± 7 days will be allowed. If subject has a contraindication for MRI prior to enrollment, the site must discuss with the AbbVie TA MD."

Images will be sent to the central imaging vendor designated by the Sponsor. Procedures for performing and shipping the MRIs are provided in a separate manual. The MRI will only be assessed by the imaging vendor for bone marrow edema. Note: Site staff should schedule the Week 14 MRI during the Baseline visit, if possible. For subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study drug for any reason, the site should attempt to reschedule the MRI within 2 weeks (14 days) of the PD Visit. If the MRI cannot be rescheduled within 14 days of the PD Visit, the MRI will be considered missed. Low-Dose Computer Tomography (CT) Scan of Spine Subjects at select sites who consent to participate in the low-dose CT scan substudy and meet eligibility criteria will have low-dose CT scan evaluation of the whole spine (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine) prior to or at the Baseline Visit, Week 52, and Week 104. If a site is unable to obtain the low-dose CT of the whole spine prior to Baseline Visit, a window of 2 weeks (14 days) post-dose will be allowed.

The investigator will be responsible for assessing the images for any clinically significant findings that may impact subject health. TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis The TB screening tests are diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the subject's epidemiology, history, exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility of the Investigator to determine if a subject has previous, active, or latent TB. Expert consultation for the evaluation and/or management of TB may be considered per Investigator discretion. At Screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a risk assessment form ( Appendix G ) and tested for TB infection by QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent). The site staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate eCRF. ●Subjects with a negative TB test and CXR not suggestive of active TB or prior TB exposure may be enrolled. If a subject had a negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold (or IGRA equivalent) within 90 days prior to Screening and source documentation is available, the test does not need to be repeated provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. These cases may be discussed with the AbbVie TAMD. ●If a subject had a negative PPD Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test or Mantoux Test) within 90 days prior to Screening and a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) cannot be performed by Central Lab at Screening and source documentation is available, TB testing by PPD Skin Test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. These cases may be discussed with the AbbVie TAMD. The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation. ●Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent TB, including signs and symptoms and CXR. Subjects with no"
57,page_57,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 58 signs or symptoms and a CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see below). ●Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled. For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening (or the most recent evaluation), an annual TB follow-up test will be performed. If an annual TB test is newly positive (seroconversion), a CXR needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus latent TB. Any positive TB screen after the subject has started the study should be reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable). If the subject is experiencing signs or symptoms suspicious for TB or something has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test before the next scheduled annual TB re-test, the case (including the TB test results) must be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD. TB Testing Additional information regarding TB testing is as follows: ●Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or equivalent) and/or PPD Skin Test are not required to repeat either test at Screening or during the study and should be considered positive. ●For regions that require both PPD and QuantiFERON-TB Gold testing, both will be performed. If either PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold results are positive, the TB test is considered positive. ●The PPD Skin Test should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines). ○The PPD should be read by a licensed healthcare professional between 48 and 72 hours after administration. A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration, and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction. The absence of induration will be recorded as ""0 mm,"" not ""negative."" Subjects who had an ulcerating"

Similarly, if a subject enters the study with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or equivalent) alone, then the subject should have their annual TB test performed with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. ●If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator should perform a local QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or through the central laboratory if not locally available) to rule out a positive test result. If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to be positive for the purpose of this study. If the testing result is negative, then the subject is considered to be negative. For sites participating from the Czech Republic, the following local requirements will also be applicable: ●A pulmonologist will be responsible to obtain a detailed medical history with respect to TB exposure. This information needs to include BCG vaccination, cohabitation with individuals who have had TB, and/or travel to, reside in, or work in TB endemic locations. The information obtained by the pulmonologist must be documented in the subject's source note, dated and signed by the pulmonologist. ●A pulmonologist must review the results of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and/or PPD skin test (or IGRA equivalent such as T-SPOT TB test) and the CXR and has to give his/her opinion about the eligibility of each subject to be enrolled to the study. This opinion must be documented in writing in the subject's source documents. ●All subjects with a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and/or PPD test (or IGRA equivalent such as T-SPOT TB test) and a CXR not suggestive of active TB need to be approved for entry into the trial by both the Czech pulmonologist and the AbbVie TA MD, and all such subjects need to receive prophylaxis for latent TB. Under no circumstances can a subject with a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and/or PPD test (or IGRA equivalent"

TB Prophylaxis At Screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection, prophylactic treatment must be initiated at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer). At least 6 months of prophylaxis (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer) need to be completed; however, the full course of prophylaxis does not need to be completed prior to the first dose of study drug. Note: Rifampicin and Rifapentine Are Not Allowed for TB Prophylaxis Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have documented completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy will be allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant repeat treatment. For subjects with completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy but insufficient documentation, the investigator should consult with the AbbVie TA MD. During the study, subjects with new evidence of latent TB should initiate prophylactic treatment immediately per local guidelines and co mplete at least 6 months of prophylaxis (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer). TB prophylaxis should be initiated, and study drug should not be withheld. Two to 4 weeks later, the subject should be re-evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory assessment of toxicity to TB prophylaxis. Newly initiated prophylactic treatment should be captured in the eCRF and in the source documents. Prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF. Pregnancy Test A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all women of childbearing potential at the Screening Visit. The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory. If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the subject is considered a screen failure.

In order to minimize variability, the same independent joint assessor should evaluate the subject at each visit for the duration of the trial as much as possible. A back-up independent joint assessor should be identified. The independent joint assessors should be qualified medical professionals (e.g., nurse, physician's assistant, physician). Any other joint assessor must be trained and competent in performing such assessments. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained to perform joint assessments. If the independent assessor is not available, the pre-identified back-up assessor should perform such assessments. Dactylitis An evaluation will be conducted at the visits specified in Appendix E to assess the presence or absence of dactylitis in all 20 of the subjects' digits.

ASAS 20 criteria will be calculated by Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomization/Drug Assignment All Screening laboratory results must be reviewed, signed, and dated by the Principal Investigator or Sub-investigator prior to the Baseline Visit. Subjects will not be enrolled into the study if laboratory or other Screening result abnormalities are deemed clinically significant by the Principal Investigator or Sub-investigator. Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they continue to meet all of the selection criteria (Section 5.2) at Baseline and are willing to continue in the study. See Section 5.5.3 for details regarding the method of assigning subjects to treatment groups. Subject Diary During the Baseline Visit, subjects will be dispensed a paper subject diary and will be trained on how to complete the diary by site staff. Subjects will be asked to notate their concomitant medication use and AEs and document date and times of doses of study drug taken between study visits. The subject diary will be reviewed by site personnel with the subject at each visit, and a review and description of the subject diary notations will be documented in the subject's source documentation and recorded on the applicable eCRF. Replacement diaries will be dispensed as needed should a subject misplace a subject diary. The completed diaries will be collected at the subject's final visit and maintained at the site as source documentation."

In order to minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment should complete a PD visit as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks. Afterwards, subjects should continue to be followed for all regularly scheduled visits as outlined in Appendix E and adhere to all study procedures except for dispensing study drug, PK sample collection, blood sample collection for optional exploratory research and validation studies, and x-rays. (New x-rays are dependent on the time of discontinuation; refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for details.) In addition, all future efficacy-driven discontinuation criteria no longer apply (ASAS 20 response). Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if they discontinue treatment with study drug early. If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), the procedures outlined for the PD visit should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks. In addition, a 30-day follow-up visit (or phone call if a visit is not possible) should occur to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs. Subjects who discontinue the study prematurely after randomization will not be replaced.

Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the Investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether the subject decides to continue participation in the study. Lost to Follow-Up For subjects to be considered lost to follow-up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain information on the final status of the subject. At a minimum, two phone calls must be made, and one certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source documentation. 5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination. The Investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination. Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns. If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the Investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination. 5.5 Treatments 5.5.1 Treatments Administered Study drug will be taken orally QD, beginning on Day 1 (Baseline), and should be taken at approximately the same time each day.

Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using IRT to receive double-blind study drug in one of the following treatment groups: ●Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (n = 85) ●Group 2: Placebo (n = 85) Randomization will be stratified by Screening hsCRP ( ≤ ULN vs. > ULN) and geographic region (US/Canada, Japan, RoW). Subjects who were randomized to placebo at Baseline will receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD in an open-label manner at Week 14. The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment group assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by the Statistics Department at AbbVie. IRT will provide the appropriate study drug kit number(s) to dispense to each subject. Study drug will be administered at the study visits as summarized in Section 5.3.1.1. Returned study drug should not be re-dispensed to any subject. 5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject Subjects should take study drug as outlined in Section 5.5.1. On dosing days that occur on study visit days, subjects should follow the regular dosing schedule (refer to Section 5.3.2.1 regarding Week 2 and Week 4 visits). Each subject's dosing schedule should be closely monitored by the site at each study visit by careful review of the subject's dosing diary. This will ensure that all subjects enrolled into the study maintain their original dosing schedule beginning with the first dose of study drug (Baseline/Day 1)."

If a subject only remembers the missed dose within 10 hours before next scheduled dose, the subject should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the scheduled time. If the subject experiences a study drug interruption > 7 consecutive days during Weeks 1 through 14 (Period 1) or > 30 consecutive days during Period 2 they should notify the Investigator, and the Investigator will decide if study drug should be restarted. 5.5.5 Blinding 5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team) will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout Period 1. The Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment assignment in Period 1 throughout the study. In order to maintain the blind, the upadacitinib tablets and placebo tablets provided for the study will be identical in appearance. The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency. In the event of a medical situation that requires unblinding of the study drug assignment, the Investigator is requested to contact the AbbVie TA MD prior to breaking the blind. However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary that warrants breaking the blind prior to contacting the AbbVie TA MD, the Investigator can directly access the IRT system to break the blind without AbbVie notification or agreement. Unblinding is available in the IRT system via the Unblind Subject transaction, which is available only to the Investigator. If the IRT system is unavailable, unblinding may occur by contacting EndPoint technical support via either phone (preferred) or email (support@endpointclinical.com). For country-specific phone numbers, please see the following website: http://www.endpointclinical.com/help-desk/. In the event that the blind is broken before notification to the AbbVie TA MD, it is requested that the AbbVie"

The date and reason that the blind was broken must be conveyed to AbbVie and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. The primary analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Week 14 or have prematurely discontinued prior to Week 14. Study sites and subjects will remain blinded to the treatment assignment in Period 1 for the duration of the entire study. 5.5.5.2 Blinding of Data for Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprised of persons independent of AbbVie and with relevant expertise in their field will review unblinded safety data from the ongoing study. The primary responsibility of the DMC will be to protect the safety of the subjects participating in this study. A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. Communications from the DMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments. As of 18 April 2019, with all subjects having reached the end of Period 1, and after final review of unblinded safety data, the DMC concluded its oversight of this study. 5.5.6 Treatment Compliance The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol. The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol. Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject dosing diary. Subjects will be instructed to return all drug containers (even if empty) to the study site personnel at each clinic visit. The study site personnel will document compliance in the study source documents."

This will be documented by signing and dating the Proof of Receipt or similar document and by registering the arrival of drug through the IRT. The original Proof of Receipt Note and the IRT confirmation sheet will be kept in the site files as a record of what was received. In addition, an IRT will be used to document investigational product accountability including but not limited to date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date dispensed, subject number, and the identification of the person dispensing the drug. All empty/used study drug packaging will be inventoried by the site and verified by the site monitor. Empty/used study drug packaging should be returned by the subject at each visit for accountability and compliance purposes and new packaging issued as necessary. Empty/used packaging will be retained (unless prohibited by local law) until the site monitor is on site to confirm the returned study drug. Site monitor(s) and site staff will complete study drug accountability via IRT, source documents, subject dosing diaries, and by visually inspecting the packaging whenever possible. After drug accountability has been completed, used packaging and unused study drug will be destroyed on site according to local procedures or regulations or returned to the destruction depot by the site monitor (for those sites that do not meet AbbVie's documentation requirements for on-site destruction). The use of a third party vendor for drug destruction must be pre-approved by AbbVie. For sites performing on-site drug destruction or using a third party vendor for drug destruction, a copy of the destruction methodology and date of destruction should be maintained at the site's facility. 5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design 5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups This study is a Phase 2 study with the quality and rigor of a Phase 3 study. Therefore, it is classified as a Phase 2/3 study. The study has 90% power on the primary efficacy"
87,page_87,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 88 endpoint and is well-controlled, with randomization, blinded intervention, high-quality trial conduct, unbiased data analysis and interpretation, and rigorous control of the overall type I error rate, to provide scientifically sound data evidence in efficacy and safety. This study includes two periods:Period 1 is a 14-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period to compare safety and efficacy of upadacitinib versus placebo in subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AS and meeting the modified New York Criteria for AS who have an inadequate response to or intolerance or contraindication for NSAIDs and are bDMARD-naïve. Period 1 is designed to test superiority of upadacitinib versus placebo for achieving the primary endpoint (ASAS 40 response rate) at Week 14 and other secondary efficacy parameters. A comparative study utilizing a placebo-control design provides an unbiased assessment of the efficacy and safety profile of upadacitinib. The purpose of Period 2 is to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD in subjects who have completed Period 1. Subjects will continue to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD per original randomization assignment in an open-label manner. Subjects who were randomized to placebo at Baseline will receive open-label upadacitinib 15 mg QD at Week 14. 5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study. All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with AS. All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted. 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population The intended study population is active AS patients who have had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs over an at least 4-week period in total at maximum recommended or tolerated doses or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs as defined by the"
88,page_88,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 89 Investigator, and who are bDMARD-naïve. The specific population chosen was based on the unmet medical need of these subjects. Key entry criteria are to enroll adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of AS and meet the modified New York Criteria for AS. Eligible study subjects must have a BASDAI score ≥ 4 and a Patient's Assessment of Total Back Pain score ≥ 4 based on a 0 – 10 NRS at the Screening and Baseline Visits. Subjects who enter the study on permitted concomitant medications(s) must have been on a stable dose for the amount of time specified in the inclusion criteria (Section 5.2.1) prior to the first dose of study drug. 5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study This Phase 2/3 study will evaluate a single dose of upadacitinib 15 mg QD using the once-daily tablet formulation."
89,page_89,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 90 Data from the tofacitinib Phase 2b study in AS demonstrated that tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID demonstrated greater clinical efficacy versus placebo in reducing the signs, symptoms, and objective measures of the disease. 25The 15 mg QD dose of upadacitinib is expected to be comparable to or better than the 5 mg BID dose of tofacitinib. The dose to be evaluated in this study is predicted to provide exposures that are lower than the No-Observed-Advers e-Effect-Level (NOAEL) exposures from the preclinical toxicology studies as well as the highest exposures that were previously evaluated and found to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers in Phase 1 and in subjects with RA in Phase 2. Therefore, the dose selected for Study M16-098, upadacitinib 15 mg QD dosed for up to 104 weeks, is expected to be efficacious with an acceptable safety profile. 6.0 Complaints A complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for distribution."

However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE. 6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as an SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE. Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject. Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle)."

Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 6.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest The following AEs of special interest will be monitored during the study (see detailed toxicity management in Section 6.1.7): ●Serious infections ●Opportunistic infections ●Malignancy ●Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) ●Malignancy excluding NMSC ●Lymphoma ●Hepatic Disorder ●Gastrointestinal Perforations ●Anemia ●Neutropenia ●Lymphopenia"

No Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug will be considered ""associated."" Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered ""not associated."" In addition, when the Investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated. If an Investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the Investigator for the SAE. 6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug administration have elapsed will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject. Subjects who discontinue study drug treatment but continue to participate in the study will have SAEs and nonserious AEs collected for the remainder of study participation. In addition, SAEs and protocol-related nonserious AEs will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent. AE information will be collected as shown in Figure 3."

The reference document used for SUSAR reporting in the European Union (EU) countries will be the most current version of the Investigator's Brochure. In Japan, the Principal Investigator will provide documentation of all SAEs to the Director of the investigative site and the Sponsor. 6.1.6 Pregnancy Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy. Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4.1). Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject or the partner of an enrolled subject, including the outcome of the pregnancy, will be collected. Pregnancies in study subjects and their partners will be identified from the date of the first dose of study drug through 30 days following the last dose of study drug, and the pregnancy will be followed to outcome. Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an AE. However, the medical outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly is considered a SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. In the event of pregnancy occurring in the partner of an enrolled subject, written informed consent for release of medical information from the partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any pregnancy-specific information, and the pregnancy will be followed to outcome. 6.1.7 Toxicity Management The toxicity management of the AEs, including AEs of special interest, consists of safety monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis and periodical/ad hoc review of safety"

The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is described below. Note: For subjects who discontinued study drug but continue study participation and are on standard of care therapies, these toxicity management requirements do not apply (including alerts from the central lab), and any intolerability to standard of care therapies should be managed by the prescribing physician. Serious Infections: Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with study drug. Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection. A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergoprompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject. As appropriate, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the subject should be closely monitored. Re-challenge with study drug may occur once the infection has been successfully treated. If study drug has been interrupted for a serious infection for more than 14 consecutive days during Period 1 of the study or 30 consecutive days thereafter, the subject must inform the Investigator and the Investigator can determine if study drug can be restarted. Subjects who develop active TB must be discontinued from study drug. Herpes Zoster: If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting study drug until the episode resolves.Gastrointestinal Perforation: Subjects presenting with the onset of signs or symptoms of a gastrointestinal perforation should be evaluated promptly for early diagnosis and treatment. If the diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug. Cardiovascular Events (MACE): Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular events should be appropriately assessed and carefully monitored. These events will be"

Malignancy: Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix must be discontinued from study drug. Information including histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Periodic skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer. Thrombosis Events: Subjects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately. If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or non-cardiac, non-neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug. ECG Abnormality: Subjects must be discontinued from study drug for an ECG change considered clinically significant and with reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug OR a confirmed absolute QTcF value > 500 msec. Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities: For any given laboratory abnormality, the Investigator should assess the subject and apply the standard of care for medical evaluation and treatment following any local guidelines. Specific toxicity management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values (confirmation by repeat testing is required) are described in Table 4 and may require an appropriate supplemental eCRF be completed. All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically significant by the Investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution."

Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK and exposure-response analyses of only data from this study may not be conducted. The following general methodology will be used for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing. PK models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) approach with NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version). The CL/F and V/F of upadacitinib will be the PK parameters of major interest in the analyses. If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis. The relationship between the conditional estimates of CL/F and V/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic of renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward selection backward elimination approach. Relationships between upadacitinib plasma exposure and clinical observations will be explored. Results of the PK and exposure-response analyses may be summarized in a separate report prior to regulatory filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of AS, rather than in the CSR. Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate. 8.2 Determination of Sample Size The planned sample size of 170 for this study (with 1:1 randomization ratio) provides at least 90% power for a 26% difference in ASAS 40 response rate (assuming a placebo"

See Section 5.5.3 for details. 9.0 Ethics 9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) GCP requires that the protocol, any protocol amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent, and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g.,advertisements used to recruit subjects) and any other necessary documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB. The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific, and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted. IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent, and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site. Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation of any changes made to the study design. The Investigator will be required to submit, maintain, and archive study essential documents according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) GCP and all other applicable regulatory requirements. Any SAEs that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local regulations, will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by local regulations. During the conduct of the study, the Investigator should promptly"
114,page_114,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 115 provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports and any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects. Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie. 9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Responsibilities of the Clinical Investigator are specified in Appendix A . 9.3 Subject Information and Consent The Investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and answer all questions regarding this study. Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements. A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject, and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record. An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy. Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form. Low-dose CT scan of the whole spine will be performed only in subjects who voluntarily sign written consent to participate in the low-dose CT scan substudy and meet eligibility criteria. Written consent will be obtained as part of the main consent form, after the testing and potential risks have been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to"
115,page_115,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 116 ask questions. If the subject does not consent to the low-dose CT scan substudy, it will not impact the subject's participation in the main study. Samples for exploratory research/validation studies will only be collected if the subject has voluntarily signed and dated the separate written consent for exploratory research/validation studies, approved by an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions. The separate written consent must be signed before the exploratory research/validation studies samples are collected and testing is performed. The separate written consent may be part of the main consent form. If the subject does not consent to the exploratory research/validation studies, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study. In the event a subject withdraws from the main study, optional exploratory research/validation samples will continue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject specifically withdraws consent for the optional samples. If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the subject must inform their study doctor, and once AbbVie is informed, the optional samples will be destroyed. However, if the subject withdraws his/her consent and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data. 9.3.1 Informed Consent Form and Explanatory Material In Japan, the Principal Investigator will prepare the consent form and explanatory material required to obtain subject's consent to participate in the study with the cooperation of the Sponsor and will revise these documents as required. The prepared or revised consent forms and explanatory material will be submitted to the Sponsor. Approval of the IRB will be obtained prior to use in the study. 9.3.2 Revision of the Consent Form and Explanatory Material In Japan, when important new information related to the subject's consent becomes available, the Principal Investigator will revise the consent form and explanatory material based on the information without delay and will obtain the approval of the IRB prior to"

117,page_117,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 118 The Investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files. These subject files will serve as source data for the study. All eCRF data required by this protocol will be recorded by investigative site personnel in the EDC system. All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by source documentation. The Investigator or an authorized member of the Investigator's staff will make any necessary corrections to the eCRF. All change information, including the date and person performing the corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the EDC system. For any correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided. The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by AbbVie personnel (or their representatives). AbbVie (or their representatives) will also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the study in order to verify eCRF entries. The Principal Investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide his or her electronic signature and date to eCRFs as evidence thereof. Medidata will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the trial through a password-protected method of internet access. Such access will be removed from Investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study. Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the Investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data. It will be possible for the Investigator to make paper printouts from that media.

The electronic device will be programmed to allow data entry for only the visits specified in the protocol and will not allow for subjects to complete more than one of the same assessment at any one visit. All data entered on the device will be immediately stored to the device itself and automatically uploaded to a central server administrated by (ePRO Vendor). The Investigator and delegated staff will be able to access all uploaded subject- entered data via a password-protected website, up until the generation, receipt, and confirmation of the study archive. 11.0 Data Quality Assurance Prior to the initiation of the study, a meeting will be held with AbbVie personnel, the investigators, and appropriate site personnel. This meeting will include a detailed discussion of the protocol, performance of study procedures, eCRF, subject dosing diary, and specimen collection methods. The AbbVie monitor will monitor each site throughout the study. Source document review will be performed against entries on the eCRF, and a quality assurance check will be performed to ensure that the Investigator is complying with the protocol and regulations. All data hand entered in the database will be verified at AbbVie. Any discrepancies will be reviewed against the eCRF and corrected online. After completion of the entry process, computer logic and manual checks will be created by AbbVie to identify items such as inconsistent study dates. Any necessary corrections will be made by the site to the eCRF. Routine hematology, serum chemistry and serology, and urinalysis, and other tests such as HBV/HCV testing, will be conducted using a central laboratory (refer to Appendix E and"
120,page_120,"Upadacitinib M16-098 Protocol Amendment 2 EudraCT 2017-000431-14 121 Table 2). The data from these analyses will be electronically transferred from the central laboratory to the study database. Laboratory tests including but not limited to urine pregnancy testing and ESR will be conducted locally by each study site (refer to Appendix E and Table 2). Sites will provide AbbVie with laboratory certifications and normal ranges for each local laboratory used. The full name, address, phone number and fax number for each local laboratory will also be included. 12.0 Use of Information Any research that may be done using optional exploratory research samples from this study will be experimental in nature, and the results will not be suitable for clinical decision making or patient management. Hence, the subject will not be informed of individual results, should analyses be performed, nor will anyone not directly involved in this research. Correspondingly, researchers will have no access to subject identifiers. Individual results will not be re ported to anyone not directly involved in this research other than for regulatory purposes. Aggregate data from optional exploratory research may be provided to Investigators and used in scientific publications or presented at medical conventions. Optional exploratory research information will be published or presented only in a way that does not identify any individual subject. 13.0 Completion of the Study The Investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol and complete the study within the timeframe specified in the contract between the Investigator (Director of the Site in Japan) and AbbVie. Continuation of this study beyond this date must be mutually agreed upon in writing by both the Investigator (Director of the Site in Japan) and AbbVie. The Investigator will provide a final report to the IEC/IRB following conclusion of the study and will forward a copy of this report to AbbVie or their representative."

If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the subject is considered a screen failure. If serum pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is necessary (pregnancy is an exclusion criterion). If still bord erline ≥ 3 days later, this will be considered documentation of continued lack of a positive result, and the subject can be enrolled into the study in the absence of clinical suspicion of pregnancy and other pathological causes of borderline results. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 , Study Procedures, Pregnancy Test for additional details. j. For all women of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits. More freque nt pregnancy tests will be performed throughout the study if required per local/country requirements. If urine pregnancy test (which is performed at the site) is negative, begin or continue dosing. If urine pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing, and perform a serum pregnancy test. Pregnant subjects must discontinue from study drug. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 , Study Procedures, Pregnancy Test for additional details. k. Minimum 8-hour fast. If a subject is not able to fast when necessary due to unforeseen circumstances, the non-fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation. l. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits. A microscopic an alysis will be performed in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal. m. FSH should be tested at Screening if the female subject is < 55 years of age AND has had no menses ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization (defined in Section 5.2.4 ). n. In case of re-screening, there is no need to redraw HBV and HCV, provided the conditions noted in Section 5.3.1.1 are met and no more than 90 days have passed. o. For subjects in Japan only: Subjects with positive HBs Ab and/or positive HBc Ab results should have HBV-DNA PCR test performed at the specified visits; in cases where recurrence of HBV-DNA is observed, the subject should be discontinued from the study. This measure is not necessary in subjects with history of HBV vaccination and positive HBs Ab result. p. HIV testing will be performed at Screening. The Investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health a gencies with the subject. The site will report confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary. If a subject has a confirmed positive re sult, the Investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the subject's health, and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly. A su bject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection. AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result. q. In case of re-screening, there is no need to redraw HLA-B27. r. Result does not need to be available to the site prior to enrollment. s. The hsCRP results starting after Baseline (Day 1) will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, or the subject. Local laboratory or site testing for hsCRP or CRP is not allowed after Baseline. Results of tests such as hsCRP may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these tests in the setting of a possible safety assessment or adverse event management. As such, local hsCRP testing should not be pe rformed until the last subject completes Period 1. t.
