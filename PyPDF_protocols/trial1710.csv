Brief title Study of efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib vs. best available therapy (BAT) in patients with corticosteroid refractory chronic graft versus host disease Sponsor and Clinical PhaseNovartis (all countries except US) and Incyte (US only) Phase 3 Investig ation ty pe Drug (INC424/ruxolitinib) Study type Interventional Purpose and rationale The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of ruxolitinib when added to immunosuppression therapy in patients with moderate to severe cortico steroid refractory c hronic graft versus host disease (SR-cGvHD) . The rationale of the study is based on current knowledge of chronic graft versus host disease pathophysiology and published studies that ruxolitinib impairs human dendritic cell activation, modulates cytokine le vels in dendritic cells, and deceases T- cell proliferation in murine models. Further, published data has shown that ruxolitinib has evidence of activity when added to immunosuppressive therapy in patients with steroid refractory chronic graft versus host d isease. Primary Objective(s) and Key Secondary ObjectivePrimary Objective : To compare the efficacy of ruxolitinib versus Investigator’s choice Best Available Therapy (BAT) in patients with moderate or severe SR -cGvHD assessed by Overall Response Rate (ORR) at the Cycle 7 Day 1 visit. The endpoint for this objective is ORR defined as the proportion of patients in each arm demonstrating a complete response (CR) or partial re sponse (PR) without the requirement of additional systemic therapies for an earlier progression, mixed response or non -response. Scoring of response will be relative to the organ score at the time of randomization. Key Secondary Objectives : To compare th e rate of failure free survival (FFS) and the change in the modified Lee Symptom Scale score between treatment groups. FFS will be used as the first key secondary endpoint for all regions except in the US and the change in modified Lee Symptom Scale score will be compared thereafter. In the US, the order will be reversed. The endpoints of this objective are (1) Composite time to event endpoint will incorporate the following FFS events: i) relapse or recurrence of underlying disease or death due to underlyin g disease, ii) non -relapse mortality, or iii) addition or initiation of another systemic therapy for cGvHD, and (2) rate of patients with clinically -meaningful improvement at Cycle 7 Day 1 of the modified Lee Symptom Scale relative to baseline Secondary Objectives ● Best overall response (BOR) ● Estimate ORR at the end of Cycle 3 ● Duration of response ● Overall survival ● Non-relapse mortality (NRM) ● Proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in the daily steroid dose at Cycle 7 Day 1 ● Proportion of patients who successfully tapered off all steroids at Cycle 7 Day 1 ● Cumulative incidence of Malignancy Relapse/ Recurrence (MR) ● Change in FACT -BMT and EQ -5D ● To assess pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib ● Safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib and BAT ● Medical resource utilization"

Patients randomized to the BAT arm are allowed to cross over to the ruxolitinib arm after the Cycle 7 Day 1 visit. Population The study will enroll approximately 324 adults and adolescents ≥12 years old who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transpla ntation and have developed moderate or severe steroid refractory chronic graft versus host disease Inclusion criteria For a full list of inclusion criteria, refer to Section 5.2 . Key inclusion criteria include: ● Male or female patients ≥12 years old at the time of signing the ICF ● Have undergone alloSCT from any donor source (matched unrelated donor, sibling, haplo -identical) using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood. Recipients of non-myeloablative, myeloablative, and reduced intensity conditioning are eligible ● Evident myeloid and platelet engraftment: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1000/mm3and platelet count > 25,000/ mm3 ● Patients with clinically diagnosed moderate to sever e cGvHD according to NIH Consensus Criteria (Jagasia 2015) prior to randomization: ● Moderate cGvHD: At least one organ (not lung) with a score of 2, 3 or more organs involved with a score of 1 in each organ, or lung score of 1 ● Severe cGvHD: at least 1 o rgan with a score of 3, or lung score of 2 or 3 ● Patients currently receiving systemic or topical corticosteroids for the treatment of cGvHD for a duration of < 12 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (if applicable), and have a confirmed diagnosis of steroid re fractory cGvHD defined per 2014 NIH consensus criteria (Martin 2015) irrespective of the concomitant use of a calcineurin inhibitor, as follows: ● A lack of response or disease progression after administration of minimum prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for at least 1 week (or equivalent) , OR ● Disease persistence without improvement despite continued treatment with prednisone at >0.5 mg/kg/day or 1 mg/kg/every other day for at least 4 weeks (or equivalent) , OR ● Increase to prednisolone dose to >0.25 mg/kg/day after two unsuccessful attempts to taper the dose (or equivalent) ● Patient must accept to be treated with only one of the following BAT options on Cycle 1 Day 1. (Additions and changes are allowed during the course of the study, but only with BAT from the foll owing BAT options): extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), low -dose methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mTOR inhibitors (everolimus or sirolimus), infliximab, rituximab, pentostatin, imatinib , ibrutinib Exclusion criteria For a full list of exclusion criteria, refer to Section 5.3 . Key exclusion criteria include: ● Patients who have received two or more systemic treatment sfor cGvHD in addition to corticosteroids ± CNI for c GvHD ● Patients that transition from active aGvHD to cGvHD without tapering off corticosteroids ± CNI and any systemic treatment ● Patients who were treated with prior JAK inhibitors for aGvHD; except when the patient achieved complete or partial response and has been off JAK inhibitor treatment for at least 8 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 ● Failed prior alloSCT within the past 6 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 ● Patients with relapsed primary malignancy, or who have been treated for relapse after the alloSCT was performed ● SR-cGvHD occurring after a non -scheduled donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) administered for pre -emptive treatment of malignancy recurrence. Patients who have received a scheduled DLI as part of their transplant procedure and not for management of malignancy relapse are eligible ● Any corticosteroid therapy for indications other than cGvHD at doses >1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 Investigational and reference therapyRuxolitinib (INC424) is the investigational drug administered orally Best Available Therapy (BAT) varies depending upon Investigator’s choice identified prior to randomization."

17,page_17,"Novartis Confidential Page 17of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 Amendment 2 ( 07-Oct -2021) Study Status Enrollment has closed and 197 patients are ongoing, as of 07-Oct-2021. Amendment rationale The main purpose of the amendment is to restrict the use of live attenuated vaccines (specifically against SAR S-CoV -2) in this population with immunocompromised state while on study treatment . Due to feedback from health authorities and based on a risk assessment , protocol language was revised for prohibited concomitant medication .These changes do not add risk to the patient population. Furthermore, Novartis standard language, referred to as disruption proofing language, has been added to specify trial conduct during public health emergencies. The added language addresses study participan t safet y and trial integrit y. At the time of the amendment finalization enrollment was complete and 329 patients were randomized ; allpatients have surpassed the Cycle 7 Day 1visit used for the primary endpoint. Overall, the changes included in this amend ment are not expected to impact subject safet y.

18,page_18,"Novartis Confidential Page 18of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 Amendment 1 (20-Dec -2017) Study Status As of 19-Dec- 2017 , a total of 15 patients have been screened and 15patients randomized. Amendment rationale The main purpose of the amendment is to extend the available patient population. Due to protracted enrollment and feedback from health authorities and investigators , several inclusion and exclusion criteria were revised . Additionally, with the recent approval of ibrutinib the original protocol -defined list of BAT options would not allow for a complete comparative assessment versus ruxolitinib . Therefore, adding ibrutinib to this list was necessary to reflect the complete list of treatment options for this patient population. Lastl y, a Data Monitoring Committee has been added based on health authority feedback to include an independent review group. These changes may add limited heterogeneit y to the patient population, yet without expected consequences on the trial design and interpretability . As at the time of the amendment finalization, 15 patients were randomized, and none of these patients have reached th e 6-month visit that is used for the primary endpoint. Overall, the changes included in this amendment are not expected to lead to a cohort effect. Inclusion Criteria #7 The window for patients currentl y receiving systemic or topical corticosteroids for the treatment of cGvHD was extended from six months to twelve months prior to C ycle 1 Day 1 to allow for a larger population of eligible patients. The original criterion was written to avoid enrolling those patients that had permanent fibrotic changes that would not be assessable per the NIH criteria. This risk was outlined in the NIH consensus manuscript (Lee 2015) . However, the growing body of literature on the use of ruxolitinib in patients with GvHD has shown that measureable improvement can be seen in ve ry heavily pre-treated patients; even those patients with sclerodermatous skin cGvHD (Hurabielle 2017). Therefore, this criterion has been extended to allow a broader group of patients that could potentially benefit from this treatment option, and would mo re closel y reflect a real -world patient population. Inclusion Criteria #9 Ibrutinib is added to the protocol list of allowed best available therapies (BAT), as it has received regulatory approval in the US and Canada for the treatment of chronic graft versus host disease since the original protocol was finalized. Exclusion Criteria #1 Previously , patients who received any systemic treatment for cGvHD in addition to corticosteroids ± CNI for cGvHD were excluded. This has been amended to exclude those patients who received two or more systemic therapies, thus patients who have received one prior systemic treatment in addition to corticosteroids for cGvHD are potentially eligible. Similar to the ration ale for the revision of Inclusion #7, this original criterion was intended to"
19,page_19,"Novartis Confidential Page 19of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 enroll patients that were comparable in disease presentation and chronicity . However, the growing body of literature on the use of ruxolitinib in this wider patient population supports the inclusion of a more pre-treated patient population (Boiko 2017; Zeiser 2015 ) . Therefore, this criterion was extended to allow for 1 additional prior systemic treatment in addition to corticosteroids. Exclusion Criteria #2 Patients with overlap syndrome ,defined as presence of simultaneous features of both chronic and acute GvHD, were previously excluded. This criterion was too broad and unclear in scope which resulted in morepatients being excluded from the trial than intended. Therefore the criterion was clarified to exclude those patients with active acute progressive disease. The question of overlap was then clarified and added to the appropriate organ specific exclusion criteria below. Exclusion Criteria #15 The definition of severely impaired renal function was updated by adding the text “having estimated creatinine clearance <30 ml/min measured or calculated by Cockroft Gault equation (confirmed within 48 hours prior to study treatment start) ”. This criterion was updated to provide a more sensitive measure of mild or moderate kidney injury at study entry . Exclusion Criteria #16 Updated cholestatic criterion to add total bilirubin >2mg/dL attributable to GvHD. This criterion was added as a more specific exclusion of patients with ongoing hepatic acute -like GvHD, and provides for a more clear definition of the “overlap” population that was removed from Exclusion Criteria #2. Exclusion Criteria #17 Added impairment of GI function example of diarrhea attributed to GvHD. This criterion was added as a more specific exclusion of patients with ongoing acute -like GI GvHD, and provides for a more clear definition of the “overlap” population that was removed from Exclusion Criteria #2. Secondary Endpoints The number of patients required for the “extensive PK” sampling schedule was decreased from 25 adults and all adolescents to 8 adults and 4 adolescents. The sampling schedule was simplified to a smaller number of samples as well as a smaller amount of blood per sample. A planne d PK analy sis was performed on data from the first 23 patients randomized in the acute GvHD CINC424C2301 trial. Following the review of this data, the assessment schedule in this study (CINC242D2301) was reevaluated and thereby reduced. The PK data generated in these 8 adult patients and 4 adolescent patients with extensive PK sampling (the absolute minimum number of patients needed to obtain reliable PK parameter estimates), especiall y when combined with the number of sparse samples that will be collected in all patients enrolled in this study and taking ruxolitinib, is considered sufficient to provide information on any deviation of the PK characteristics in chronic GvHD compared to other known indications."

25,page_25,"Novartis Confidential Page 25of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 1 Background 1.1 Overview of disease pathogenesis, epidemiology and current treatment Allogen eicstem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a curative immunotherapy for patients with blood -related malignancies including leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. AlloSCT also provides normal hematopoietic function in patients with non -malignant hematologic disorder s, including severe aplastic anemia, inherited metabolic disorders, and hemoglobinopathies (Copelan 2006). Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) is a major limitation to the success of alloSCT , and occurs when donor -derived immune cells in a bone marrow or stem cell graft recognize the transplant recipient as foreign, thereby initiating an adverse immune reaction leading to an inflammatory cascade with resultant tissue damage, organ failure , or even death. Chronic GvHD (cGvHD) has been historically characterized by autoimmune and alloimmune dysregulation occurring after the first 100 days of allo -SCT (Baird 2010 ).However, the median onset of cGvHD is approximately 6 months following alloSCT (Baird 2010). Risk factors for cGvHD include prior acute GvHD (aGvHD), grafting with growth factor mobilized blood cells, the use of female donor for male recipient s and unrelated donors ( Flowers 2011). Approximately 32,000 alloSCT procedures are performed annually world- wide (Niederweiser 2016) with up to 60% of patients receiving HLA -identical marrow grafts and 70% of patients receiving alternative donor marrow grafts who survive beyond 100 days developing cGvHD (Lee 2003). Additionally , the prevalence and severity of cGvHD occurring in 30 -70% of alloSCT patients (Lee 2008) , has increased over the past two decades attributable to several factors including: i) the increased use of mobilized peripheral blo od stem cell (mPBSC )grafts (containing higher numbers of donor T -cells than BM), ii) advanced age of transplant recipients rising from 55 to 75 years due to development of better tolerated reduced intensity conditioning, and, iii) improvements in survival during the first months after alloSCT. Unfortunatel y cGvHD remains a serious and common complic ation of alloSCT , and while major progress has been achieved in understanding the pathophy siology of aGvHD; cGvHD is far less defined (Wolff 2010 ).Current concepts include the persistence of allo -reactive T -cells, a Th1- Th2 shift of the cellular immune response, defective peripheral, and central tolerance mechanisms (i .e., failure of control by regulatory T-cells and/or impaired negative selection of T -cells in the thy mus), replacement of antigen presenting cells (APCs) of the host by APCs of the donor leading to indirect antigen presentation of allo -antigens, an increasin g role of B -cells producing auto- and allo-antibodies against the host, and unspecific mechanisms of chronic inflammation leading to fibrosis of involved organs (Schultz 2009). Additionally , the express ion of CD134 (OX40) on the surface of CD8+ and CD4+ T -cells has been associated with cGvHD onset, and marks an early T-cell activation by inflammatory cytokines (Briones 2011). A decline in regulatory T-cells (Tregs) leads to a loss of peripheral tolerance, autoimmunity and cGvHD (Zhang 2006) . In fact, patients with cGvHD have lower numbers of CD4+ Tregs compared to patients without cGvHD (Bruggen 2014). As opposed to aGvHD, which involves only the skin, liver and GI tract, cGvHD can involve almost any organ of the body .It is a multi -systemic disorder and can present as a sy ndrome of variable clin ical features resembling autoimmune and other immunologic disorders with a variet y of clinical signs and symptoms resembling diseases such as scleroderma, Sjogren’s syndrome, bronchiolitis"
26,page_26,"Novartis Confidential Page 26of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 obliterans, and chronic immunodeficiency (Greinix 2011 ), it also can include primary biliary cirrhosis, wasting syndrome, immune cytopenias, and chronic immunodeficienc y (Jagasia 2015, Dhir 2014 ) . Importantly , cGvHD leads to significant morbidity , diminished quality of life and decreased overall survival (Lee 2003 ).Although approximately 50% of newl y diagnose d cGvHD patients are cured within 7 years after starting systemic immunosuppression, 10% require continued systemic treatment indefinitely , and the remaining 40% relapse or die within 7 y ears during ongoing prolonged immunosuppressive treatment (Vigorito 2009). cGvHD is classified into mild, moderate, and severe based on degree of organ involvement according to established NIH Consensus Criteria for cGvHD (Jagasia 2015), and approximatel y half of affected patients have 3 or more involved organs. Systemic immunosuppressive treatment in cGvHD is typicall y required on average for 1 to 3 years, and standard initial treatment of moderate and severe cGvHD includes systemic corticosteroids, generally prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day followed by taper with or without concomitant calcineurin inhibitor treatment. Although corticosteroids are standard of care (SOC) in initial stages of moderate to severe cGvHD, published reports identify that 50-60% of patients become cortico steroid refractory and meet objective criteria per NIH Consensus to be determined to require addition of another systemic therap y beyond systemic corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitor within two years after initial therap y (Inamoto 2014). Few prospective comparative studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of currentl y used second -line therapy for cGvHD. As such, no treatment has been proven superior to another, and no SOC exists following the development of cortico steroid refractoriness. Physicians in clinical practice use various therapies and in various sequence and dosing schedules, mostly driven b y their own clinical experience. Secondary treatments (all off label) include extra -corporeal photopheresis, rituximab, imatinib, pentostatin, mesench ymal stem cells, mycophenolate mofetil, ibrutinib, and mTOR -inhibitors including sirolimus and everolimus. Despite the availability and use of several medicinal products, none of which are approved centrall y, SR-cGvHD remains a serious medical condition associated with high morbidit y and long-term mortality , as well as reduced quality of life, hence representing an area ofhigh unmet medical need. This unmet medical need, alongside robust preclinical and clinical proof -of - concept data provide a strong rationale for investigating ruxolitinib as potential treatment for SR-cGvHD. 1.2 Introduction to investigational treatment(s) an d other study treatment(s) 1.2.1 Overview of ruxolitinib Ruxolitinib [(R)-3-(4- (7H-pyrrolo[2,3 -d]pyrimidin - 4 -yl)-1H-pyrazol-1- yl)-3-c yclopent yl- propanenitrile phosphate ] , (INCB018424, INC424, ruxolitinib phosphate) isa potent, selective , orally available inhibitor of Janus kinases (JAKs) JAK1(inhibition concentration 50% [IC50]=3.3 ± 1.2 nM)and JAK2 (IC50=2.8 ±1.2nM) with modest tomarked selectivi ty against TYK2 (tyrosin ekinase 2) (I C50=19 ± 3.2 nM) andJAK3 (IC50=42 8 ± 243 nM), respective l y. JAKs mediate the signaling of a number of cy tokines and growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune response."
27,page_27,"Novartis Confidential Page 27of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 Dysregulated JAK-STAT signaling, via upregulation of JAK1 and JAK2 or gain of function mutations such as JAK2V617F, has been implica ted as a driver of BCR- ABL -negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), namel y myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocy themia (ET). Ruxolitinib specificall y binds to and inhibits JAK1, JAK2 and mutated JAK2V617F, leading to inhib ition of growth factor -mediated cell signaling and tumor cell proliferation. Given this mechanism of action of ruxolitinib as a JAK inhibitor and the role pla yed by dys regulation of the JAK pathway in the pathogenesis of MPNs, the primar y clinical developm ent plan for ruxolitinib initially focused on studies to support regulator y approval in these disorders. Of importance to GvHD, strong pre-clinical data shows that inhibition of JAK1/2 signaling results in reduced proliferation of donor immune cells, suppr ession of adverse cytokines in response to recipient antigens, as well as impairment of antigen presenting cells in vitro and in vivo (Socie 2014, Spoerl 2014 ).In vivo JAK 1/2 inhibition by ruxolitinib has been shown to improve survival of mice in an established GvHD model incorporating human immune cells, and impairs differentiation of T-cell populations that are linked to GvHD (Spoerl 2014). The role for JAK -inhibition in GvHD was further confirmed with data from a retrospective study in patients with SR-cGvHD, showing that the majority of these patients responded to ruxolitinib treatment with im proved clinical cGvHD symptoms (Zeiser 2015) . In this retrospective study , patients were treated with an empiric regimen of 5 mg BID for 3 days followed with 10 mg BID if no side effects were observed. Novartis selected the 10 mg BID starting dose without the 5 mg BID run -in based on data from the retrospective study (Zeiser 2015), safety data from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, and PK/PD data from patients with poly cythemia vera. Ruxolitinib was originally developed by IncyteCorporation (Wilmington ,Delaware , USA). Incyte and Novartis entered into a joint agreement for the co-development of ruxolitinib in hematology and oncology indications in 2009. More recently on April 7, 2016, Incyte granted Novartis the exclusive rights to research, develop and market ruxolitinib for graft -versus -host disease indications outside the USA under the terms of an amended collaboration and license agreement. Both companies intend to co -develop ruxolitinib for the treatment of cortico steroid refractory acute GvHD (SR-aGvHD) and cortico steroid refractory chronic GvHD (SR-cGvHD) following allogen eicstem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Ruxolitinib is currentl y approved under the trade name of ‘Jakavi’ in over 100 countries for the treatment of disease -related splenomegaly or sympto ms in adult patients with (primar y myelofibrosis) PMF, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV -MF) and post-essential thrombocy themia myelofibrosis (PET- MF) including in the EU and Switzerland . The use of ruxolitinib to treat polycythemia vera (PV) patie nts who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea is currentl y under regulatory review in some countries based on the results from the Ph III trial CINC424B2301 (the RESPONSE study ). To date,approval in this second indication was granted in more than 60countries including the EU and Switzerland. Ruxolitinib is also approved in the USA under the trade name of ‘Jakafi’ and is indicated for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis, including PMF, PPV-MF and PET-MF and for the treatment of PV patients who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, andin May 2019for the treatment of SR-aGVHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older ."

Ruxolitinib was observed tobeefficacious inmouse models of Philadelphia chromosome negative MPNs. Efficacy wasalso observed in rodent models of cytokin e-dependent inflammation. Effects noted inmultiple- dose toxicit y studies inmice (up to 4 weeks), rats (up to 6 months), and dogs (up to 12 month s)were primarily those associated with themechanism ofaction of ruxolitinib, apotent andreversible inhibitor of JAK-STAT signaling. Decreases inredblood cells, reticulocytes, eosinophils and lymphoc yteshave been observed along with lymphoid depleti on in bonemarrow and lymphoi dorgans . In a cardiovascular evaluation of ruxolitinib indogs, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters were unaffected at all doses. Ruxolitinib was not mutagenic orclastogenic, nor did itdemonstrate potential for carcinogenic ity in a 6- mont hstudy in Tg.rasH2 mice orinthe2 -yearratstudy.

AsofFebruary 22, 2021 , approximately 12,600 patients have received ruxolitinib treatment inNovarti s-andIncyte- sponsored investigat ional clinical trials cumulatively since the Development IBD (D IBD). (Refer to [ Investigator Brochure ]for details). 1.2.1.2.1 Clinical Pharmacology Eighteen Phase I, two Phase I/II, thirteen Phase IIandfive Phase III clinical studies (two inMF, two in GvHD, one inPV) provided clinical pharmacology dataonruxolitinib inhealthy volunteers andinpatients with GvHD, MF, ET,PV,as well asinsubjects with renal orhepatic impairment, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, multiple myeloma (MM), thalassemia or rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Please refer to the [Investigational Brochure ]for details on pharmacokinetics 1.2.1.2.2 Summary of Clinical Efficacy Data The results from two phase III registration studies in myelofibrosis (COMFORT-I [INCB 18424- 351]) , and COMFORT -II[INCB 18424- 352]) ) demonstrate the effectiveness of ruxolitinib in patients with PMF, PPV -MF and PET -MF. The results of these two studies were consistent, demonstrating statisticall y significant differences inrates of≥35% spleen volume reduction compared with either placebo or an investigator’s selection of Best Available Therap y (BAT). Although each study assessed spleen volume reduction at a different time point (Weeks 24 and 48 for COMFORT -I and COMFORT -II, respectivel y), the mean reduction in spleen volume is similar at Week 24 (31.6% vs. 29.2%, COMFORT- I and COMFORT -II, respectivel y). Additionally , COMFORT- I met two out of three key secondary endpoints: 1) 50% decrease in total sy mptom score as defined by the MF sy mptom assessment f orm (response rate of 46% in the ruxolitinib arm vs. 5% with placebo) (p<0.0001), and 2) Mean change from baseline in MF symptom assessment form (-8.6 with ruxolitinib from baseline of 18 vs. + 3.2 with placebo from baseline of 16.5). COMFORT -II explorator y endpoints related to sy mptom improvement and Quality of Life (QOL) were consistent with and supportive of the results from COMFORT -I. Grade 3-4 laboratory findings of anemia and thrombocy topenia were reported with ruxolitinib at rates of 38.3% and 8.3%, respectively , compared with 20.6% and 6.8% on BAT (COMFORT -II); and with ruxolitinib at rates of 45.2% and 12.9%, respectivel y, compared with 19.2% and 1.3% on placebo (COMFORT -I). Thrombocy topenia and anemia were predictable and manageable with dose mod ifications. The 5-year follow -up report for COMFORT -I suggested longer survival for patients randomized to ruxolitinib versus control arm patients, with a hazard ratio of 0.693 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.503, 0.956, p = 0.0245). In COMFORT -II, long-term follow -up also suggested a survival advantage with ruxolitinib treatment compared with BAT. There was a 33% reduction in the risk of death for patients treated with ruxolitinib compared with that for patients treated with BAT (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.44- 1.02). The estimated survival probability at 5.0 years was 56% (95% CI:0.40, 0.62) in the ruxolitinib arm and 44% (95% CI: 0.31, 0.56) in the BAT arm. Safety profile in the two studies remained broadly unchanged. There were no new or unexpe cted safet y signals that occurred with the longer treatment exposure and follow -up period."

Significantly more patients randomized to ruxolitinib than patients randomized to BAT met the primary endpoint (hematocrit control and at least 35% spleen volume reduction) at Week 32: 22.7 % vs 0.9%, respectivel y (p < 0. 0001). More patients randomized to ruxolitinib achieved hematocrit control at Week 32 when compared to patients randomized to BAT: 60.0% (95% CI:50.2, 69.2) vs 18.75% (95% CI: 12.7, 28.2), respectively . More patients randomized to ruxolitinib achieved at least 35% spleen volume reduction at Week 32 when compared to patients randomized to BAT: 40% (95% CI: 29.1, 47.9) vs 0.9% (95% CI: 0.0, 4.9), respectivel y. The great majority of these responses in the ruxolitinib arm were also durable atWeek 48. Furtherm ore,significantly more patients randomized toruxolitinib achieved the key secondar y endpoint of complete hematological remission (hematocrit control, platelet count ≤ 400×109/L, and WBC count ≤ 10×109/L) at Week 32 when compared to patients randomized toBAT: 23.6% vs 8.0%, respectively (p=0.0028, when adjusted for baseline platelet and WBC status). The efficacy analyses at Week 80 data cut-off (03-Sept- 2014), Week 208 data cut-off (15-Feb-2017) and Week 256 data cut -off (09 -Feb-2018) of the RESPONSE stud y confirmed the durability of the responses in the patients randomized to the ruxolitinib arm. A second randomized, open label, active -controlled Phase IIIb Study B2401 (RESPONSE -2) was conducted in 149 PV patients who were resistant to or intolerant of hydrox yurea but without palpable splenomegal y. 74 patients were randomized to the ruxolitinib arm and 75 patients to the BAT arm. The starting dose and dose adjustments of ruxolitinib and investigator -selected BAT were similar to the RESPONSE study . Baselin e demographics and disease characteristics were comparable between the two treatment arms and similar to the patient population of the RESPONSE study . The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving it HCT control (absence of phlebotomy eligibility ) at Week 28. The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving CHR at Week 28. Study B2401 (RESPONSE -2) met its primary objective with a higher proportion of patients in the ruxolitinib arm (62.2%) compared to the BAT arm (18.7%) a chieving the primary endpoint (p<0.0001) [Study B2401]. The key secondary endpoint was also met with significantly more patients achieving a CHR in the ruxolitinib arm (23.0%) compared to the BAT arm (5.3%; p=0.0019). At week 28, the proportion of patients achieving a ≥50% reduction in symptom burden as measured by the MPN -SAF total symptom score was 45.3% in the ruxolitinib arm and 22.7% in the BAT arm. Graft vs Host Disease Several recentl y published studies provide evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib when added to immunosuppressive therap y in patients with SR-aGvHD and SR-cGvHD (Zeiser 2015; Khoury 2015; Spoerl 2014). Spoerl included data from 6 SR-aGvHD patients who received an initial ruxolitinib dose of 5 mg BID that was advanced to 10 mg BID after 3 days when no side effects were observed. Responses t o ruxolitinib treatment in terms of improved GvHD grades and reduction of required corticosteroids were observed in all patients; no patient experienced GvHD flare during cortico steroid taper requiring additional systemic therap y (Spoerl 2014). Further clinical experience with ruxolitinib in patients with GvHD was recentl y reported in a retrospective study that gathered experience in 95 patients with SR-GvHD,"
32,page_32,"Novartis Confidential Page 32of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 of whom 41 had SR -cGvHD (Zeiser 2015 ).In this study , 29/41 (70.7%) of SR -cGvHD patients had more than one organ system involved. All patients had moderate (n = 6/41, 14.6%) to severe (n = 35 /41, 85.4%) SR -cGvHD. Most patients were bey ond second -line treatment for cGvHD, with a median number of 3 prior treatments (range: 1 –10) before ruxolitinib was administered. The majorit y of patients were treated with ruxolitinib as an add-on immunosuppression therapy at a dose of 5–10 mg orally twice daily.The overall response rate (ORR) was 85.4% (35/41), with 78% (32/41) having a partial response (PR defined as the discontinuation or long-lasting (4 weeks) reduction of all systemic immunosuppressive therap y by at least 50%) and 7.3% (3/41) having a complete response (CR defined as the absence of any symptoms related to cGvHD). Only 14.6% (6/41) of the patients showed no response. The median time to response was 3 (1 – 25) weeks after initiation of ruxolitinib treatment. The safet y profile of ruxolitinib in SR-cGvHD was generally favorable. Although cytopenias in the Zeiser 2015 publication were observed in 17% of SR-cGvHD patients, cytopenias preceded ruxolitinib administration in 14.6% of these patients. CMV reactivation was observed in 14.6% of SR-cGvHD patients treated with ruxolitinib. This incidence rate compares favorabl y with that reported with other second line GvHD agents including MMF, alemtuzumab, and others where CMV reactivation ranges from 70 to 80% ( Rager 2011). Relapse of the underly ing malignancy occurred in 2.4% (1/41) of the patients with SR- cGvHD. This frequency is comparable to other studies and suggests that ruxolitinib treatment is not linked to a higher relapse risk when compared with other currently applied immunosuppressive drugs (Zeiser 2015). Additional 24 month follow - up was presented at the 2016 American Society of Hematology conference (Zeiser 2016 ) which demonstrated a 1-year overall survival (OS) of 92.7% (CI: 84.7- 100%), with an estimated median OS not being reached for these patients. Twenty -four percent (10/41) of SR-cGvHD patients have an ongoing response and are free of any immunosuppression. Any grade c ytopenias (17.1%, 7/41) and CMV reactivation (14.6%, 6/41) were observed during ruxolitinib -treatment. GvHD relapse or progression after achieved partial response/complete response was observed in 13/36 (36%) patients with SR -cGvHD. Response to re-treatment with ruxolitinib or any immunosuppressive therap y was seen 11/13 (86%) patients with SR-cGvHD. These findings extend the previous report by showing that patients with SR -GvHD may benefit long -term from ruxolitinib treatment ( Zeiser 2016 ). 2 Rationale 2.1 Stud y rationale and purpose Thescientific rationale forthisstudy ofruxolitinib inadult sandadolescent s with moderate or severe SR-cGvH Disbased oncurrent knowledge of cGvH Dpathoph ysiology thatbegins with activation of host antigen -presenting cells (APC) expressed by damaged tissues and/or pathogens (Dhir 2014) . Activated host APC then present host antigens to donor immune cells, leading to donor T -cell proliferation and inflammatory cytokine production. Cytokine dysregulation has also been implicated through observations that high levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IFNγ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α are associated with more severe cGvHD (Socie 2014) .These inflammatory cytokines then recruit and induce proliferation of additional immune effector cells, thereby perpetuating an adverse cycle of allo-reactive tissue injury and"
33,page_33,"Novartis Confidential Page 33of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 inflammation (Paczesny 2010). Inhibition of JAK1/2 signaling results in reduced proliferation of donor effector T-cells, suppression of pro -inflammatory cytokine production in response to alloantigen, as well as impairment of antigen presenting cells in vitro and in vivo (Betts 2011). Ruxolitinib hasbeen shown tolower pro-inflammatory cytokines inMF patients. In addition, pre-clinical data support the mechanism of action of ruxolitinib in GvHD to: i) impair APC function, ii) inhibit donor T-cell proliferation, iii) suppress adverse c ytokine productio n,and, iv) improve survival and disease manifestations in GvHD mouse models (Heine 2013; Spoerl 2014 ).Furthermore, ruxolitinib impairs differentiation of CD4 T -cells into IFN-gamma and IL17A -producing cells; both T-cell phenoty pes are linked to GvHD pathophy siology (Heine 2013). Importantly , Graft - vs-Leukemia (GvL) effects have been shown to be maintained in mice treated with ruxolitinib in two different MHC -mismatched alloSCT models and using two different murine leukemia models (both lymphoid and myeloid) (Choi 2014). This, inaddition totherecent ly published data inwhich ruxolitinib was shown tohave evidence ofclinical efficacy when added toimmunosuppressive thera pyinpatients with SR- aGvHD and S R -cGvH D (Zeiser 2015; Spoerl 2014 ), provides strong rationale totestthe h ypothesis thatruxolitinib added toimmunosuppression thera pyforSR-c GvH Dpatients will provide highe rrates ofdisease response compared with curren tlyused second linesystemic treatment modalities, and further that this response will be sustained during corticosteroid taper . 2.2 Rationale for the study design This trial isdesigned asa randomized (1:1) phase IIIopen label design toinvestigate the efficacy andsafety of ruxolitini b vs. I nvestigator choice BestAvailable Thera py(BAT) added to the patient’s immunosuppressive regimen inadults and adolescents ≥12 years oldwith moderate or severe SR-cGvHD. Very few prospective comparative studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy and safet y of currently used second -line therapies for cGvHD. Therefore, a randomized study provides the best opportunity to assess whether treatment with ruxolitinib in patients with SR-cGvHD provides better effica cy when compared to currentl y used treatments in this setting. A randomized study design will also enable a more robust assessment of ruxolitinib safety in a comparative manner. There areno uniformly used, nor centrally approved second -line treatments following corticosteroid resistance in cGvHD ,andpractices vary as totheselection ofvarious s y stemic therapies sincetodate noimprovement inthehigh mortality rates hasbeen documented despite treatment with these agents. BAT currently used in medical practice includes: extra - corporeal photopheresis, rituximab, imatinib, pentostatin, mesenchy mal stem cells, mycophenolate mofetil, ibrutinib, and mTOR-inhibitors including everolimus and sirolimus. As these treatments vary from administered tablets to cellular therap y and photopheresis, the open - label design of this study is inevitable to accommodate the variety of treatments that may be considered b y investigators for these patients. Additionally , the necessity for modifications and dose adjustments in the se therapies depending on the subject’s response, make utilizing a placebo operationall y impossible, and would present an undue burden to the patient. Patients will be randomized 1:1toreceive either ruxolitinib orBAT, stratif yingo nGvHD severity"
34,page_34,"Novartis Confidential Page 34of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 (moderate vs. severe). The choice ofBAT will bedecided by the Investigator before randomization inthisstudy. The rationale tostratif y patients by severit y of cGvHD atthetime ofrandomization is based onthe factthatresponse rates arevariable inpatients with different cGvHD severity . cGvHD is classified into mild, moderate and severe based on degree of organ involvement according to established NIH Consensus Criteria for cGvHD (Jagasia 2015 ). While milder forms of cGvHD are often manageable with local or low-dose systemic immunosuppression and do not affect long -term survival, more severe forms require intensive medical management and adversel y affect survival (Lee 2003 ). Moderate and severe SR-cGvHD adult and adolescent patients ≥ 12 years of ageare included in this study . While the rates of cGvHD are lower in pediatrics as compared to adults (Dhir 2014 ), adolescents ≥12 years comprise approximately 5% of the cGvHD population (CIBMTR data on file). Although the long-term prognosis of cGvHD appears to be slightly better in children when compared to adults, they suffer from similar complications and also have poor long term outcomes (Dhir 2014) . In addition, the standard treatment of SR-GvHD does not differ between adolescents and adults (Dignan 2012, Jacobsohn 2010). As such, SR-cGvHD represents a significant unmet medical need not only for adult patients but also for children. Adolescent s ≥12 y ears will be enrolled in the proposed pivotal study since the ruxolitinib tablet formulation used in the stud y is acceptable for administratio n in this age group. Pediatric patients <12 years of age will be considered for future studies using a more suitable liquid formulation and following discussion and agreement on the pediatric investigational plan with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO ) . Multiple measures willbeused inthisstudytoreduce bias. For patients randomized to BAT, change or addition of new immunosuppressive therapy will only be allowed for subjects meeting progression, mixed response, or no response criteria, to prevent subjective addition or change of new therap y (see objective response definition sinSection 3). At the study visit where disease progression or intolerable toxicity is assessed the patient is allowed to change or add a new immunosuppressive therapy. However, if mixed response or no response is assessed, change or addi tion of new therap y is allowed. This response must be confirmed prior to addition or change of therapy . This confirmation cannot occur prior to 1 week, and should not be done later than 4 weeks after the initial assessment. The primary and key secondary endpoints of the trial will be based on objective measures delineated by standard NIH consensus criteria (Lee 2015). In order to minimize the potential for differential cortico steroid tapering of BAT and ruxolitinib, equivalent specific guidance for dose increases of s ystemic corticosteroids to manage GvHD flares (seeSection 6.1.5.2) as well as cortico steroid dose -tapering per standard guidelines is provided (seeSection 6.1.5.1). A28-day Screening period isplanned toallow sufficient time to obtain results ofrequired tests and ensure that alleligibilit y criteria aremet. It is important to highlight that the primary analysis is not performed using best response, but the response assessment after6 cycles of treatment (a cycle consists of 28 days) as compared to Baseline. The 6 cycletimeframe was selected as being clinically meaningful for cGvHD patients, and avoids capturing transient responses."
35,page_35,"Novartis Confidential Page 35of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 Cross over to ruxolitinib is allowed in patients randomized to BAT who do not achieve a CR or PR after6 cyclesof treatment, as well as in those who lose their response (i.e. have disease recurrence off treatment) thereafter or those patients who become intolerant to BAT following Cycle 7 Day 1. Allowing cross over at or after the start of Cycle 7will have no impact on the primary endpoint as it is only allowed after assessments for the primary endpoint have been completed. BAT patients who achieve a CR or PR on Cycle 7 Day 1 are not allowed to cross over to ruxolitinib until disease progression, mixed response, or occurrence of a toxicity to BAT, which will allow for a sub-group of patients treated continuously with BAT for a longer duration, increasing the likelihood of being able to generate comparative long-term outcome data. Following Cycle 7 Day 1, asecond visit is not required to confirm disease progression or mixed response prior to allowing cross over. Fixing specific and clear rules based on NIH consensus criteria for response (Lee 2015- see Section 3) to allow change of treatment also minimizes the potential influence on failure -free survival ( FFS)events after Cycle 7 Day 1, and would allow therefore a reliable comparison of FFS between treatment arms. The estimation of FFS probabilities at Cycle 7 Day 1is not impacted b y cross over. Cross over for patients failing BAT is deemed ethically necessary as currently available data suggest that these patients could benefit from treatment with ruxolitinib. In addition, not allowing cross over is likely to negat ively impact patient acceptance to participate in the trial and they may seek ruxolitinib treatment through other means. The primary endpoint of the proposed Phase III study is the proportion of patients in each arm demonstrating overall response rate (ORR ) consisting of either complete (CR) or partial (PR) response at Cycle 7 Day 1as defined by the 2014 NIH response criteria (Lee 2015). The primary endpoint of ORR is being proposed in consultation with cGvHD medical experts based on the fact that patient response is a clinically relevant measure of treatment efficacy .Response rates have been correlated to long-term outcomes in 2 independent trials. The first trial utilized the 2005 NI H consensus respon se criteria and enrolled 40 patients with cGvHD. In that trial, patients were eligible if they were diagnose d with moderate to severe cGvHD and were refractory to at least 2 immunosuppressive lines of therap y. Clinician respon se assessment was performed atbaseline and 6 months. ORR at 6 months was strongly correlated with overall survival at 36 months (Olivieri 2013 ). The second trial utilized the revised 2014 NIH response criteria and enrolled 575 patients with cGvHD. Clinician assessment was performed at Baseline and 6 months. This trial also demonstrated that at 6 months, clinician -reported response predicted OS(Palmer 2016 ) . The response assessments for the primary endpoint will be performed b y the treating clinician at baseline, weekly for 4 weeks, and then every 4 weeks per NIH consensus criteria (Lee 2015). One of the key secondary endpoint sis FFS defined as a composite time to event endpoint incorporating the following FFS events: i) relapse or recurrence of underl ying disease or deat h due tounderl ying disease, ii) non-relapse mortality , or iii ) addition or initiation of another systemic therapy for cGvHD. FFS has been shown to correlate with subsequent non-relapse mortality and survival (Palmer 2015) and will enable the assessment of the durability of the primary response."
36,page_36,"Novartis Confidential Page 36of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 cGvHD has a negative impact on QoL, although this is not equally detectable in all patients. According to the NIH criteria for grading cGvHD severit y, patients with mild cGvHD have higher QoL than those with moderate cGvHD, and both of these categories have higher QoL than patients with severe cGvHD (Fiuza -Luces 2016). Given the significant impact of symptoms on patients with cGvHD, the collection of patient reported outcomes with the Lee symptom scale hasbeen recommended by the 2005 and 2014 NIH consensus conference (Merkel 2016). The Response Criteria Working Group within the NIH Consensus Development Project on Criteria for Clinical Trials in cGvHD r ecommends the Lee Sy mptom Scale as GVHD -specific core measure and the FACT -BMT as cGvHD nonspecific ancillary measure (in adults) for quality -of -life assessments (Pavletic 2006). In a m ulticenter observ ational study (#NCT00637689) enrolling 575 patients diagnosed with cGvHD per 2005 NIH Consensus Criteria from August 2007 to January 2013, improvements in the Lee skin Sy mptom Score at 6 months predicted longer subsequent OS and NRM, and the FACT -BMT trial outcome (total score) at 6 months predicted longer subsequent OS at 36 months (Palmer 2016). Therefore, a second key secondary objective will be to assess the change in a modified Lee s ymptom score. Analy sis of primary and key secondary endpoints will occur when all sub jects will have completed the Cy cle 7 Day 1visit or discontinued study treatment. A final study report will be written when all patients will have completed 3 years(39 cycles) on study , discontinued from the study , or died. Collection ofPKdata willbe implemented inthisstudy inorder toassess exposure data and determine how itcompares with data from previous studies, and explore its relationship with efficacy and safety parameters. The study design was reviewed and agreed with the FDA, CHMP, and the PMDA."

38,page_38,"Novartis Confidential Page 38of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 2.3 Rationale for dose and regimen selection Ruxolitinib will beadministered topatients randomized to the study drug treatment arm at a starting dose of 10 mg orally BID, without regard to food. The ruxolitinib starting dose of 10 mg orally BID is based on the published activity and safet y data generated in a retrospective study in patients with SR -cGvHD (Zeiser 2015 -see Section 1.2.1.2.2 for further details ). The 10 mg BID dose will be the same in adolescent as in adult patients. This is supported by safet y and PK data of ruxolitinib from a Phase I study in pediatri c patients with various malignancies (Loh 2015). The mean values (± SD) for ruxolitinib oral plasma clearance (Cl/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) among all patients were 14.8 ± 5.9 L/h and 59.4 ± 29.1 L, respectivel y, and were independent of dose level. The population PK model in adult MF patients reported the following parameter estimates: CL/F for males was 22.1 L/h and 17.7 L/h for females, with an interpatient variability (IIV) of 39.1%; Vc/F wasfound to be 58.6 L, with an IIV of 28.0%. The PK of ruxolitinib was generally similar in pediatric cancer patients (n=42; median age 14 years, range 2-21) compared to that in adult patients with MF. This pediatric study tested doses of 15 mg/m2to 50 mg/m2BID (equivalent to 10 mg BID – 100 mg BID). The safet y and tolerability across doses was favorable. Additionally , allometric scaling (taking into consideration body weight) for adolescents based on adult exposure data from myelofibrosis trials indicate that the dose for adolescents required to obtain similar exposure in terms of AUC and Cmax is similar to that of adults (20 mg BID in adults would constitute 16 - 18 mg BID in adolescents). Similarly , since ruxolitinib shows dose proportionality , a 10 mg BID dose in adolescents is expected to provide a similar exposure as 10 mg BID dosing in adults. Patients may have dose reductions ormodifications ofruxolitinib durin gthecourse of treatment based on adverse events, clinical evaluation, and laboratory assessments. No dose increases above 10 mg BID will be allowed in the study due to the very limited clinical experience with such doses in patients with GvHD. See Section 6.3 for ruxolitinib dose modifications. 2.4 Rationale for choice of combination drugs Not applicable. 2.5 Rationale for choice of comparators drugs This will be an open -label study of ruxolitinib versus Best Available Therapy (BAT) as selected by the Investig ator. BAT is chosen as comparator as there is currentl y no broadly approved, or uniformly used standard second line therapy in SR -cGvHD. A BAT control arm is required to ensure an adequatel y controlled duration to assess the primary endpoint of the study as well as ruxolitinib comparative safet y. The BAT in this study will be selected by th eInvestigator prior to subject randomization among the following standard systemic treatments: extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), low-dose methotrexate (MTX), mycopheno late mofetil (MMF), mTOR inhibitors (everolim us or sirolimus), infliximab , rituximab, pentostatin, imatinib , or ibrutinib. Investigational agents only available via clinical trials including JAK inhibitors or combination of different treatment are not permitted on the BAT arm. No other BAT will be allowed."

At Cycle7 Day 1or later after randomization, patients randomized to BAT that do not achieve or maintain a CR or PR,or who develop toxicity to BAT are allowed to cross over from BAT to ruxolitinib. 2.6 Risks and benefits Appropriate eligibility criteria, as well as specific dose modification and stopping rules, are included in this protocol. Recomme nded guidelines for prophy lactic or supportive management of study -drug induced adverse events are provided in Section 6.3 andSection 6.4. The risk to patients in this trial may be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria and study procedures, as well as, close clinical monitoring, and, protocol -defined ruxolitinib dose modifications guidelines and treatment discontinuation criteria. Ther e may be unforeseen risks with ruxolitinib which could be serious. Refer to the most recent [Investigator Brochure ]. As outlined previously , the potential benefit of ruxolitinib for alloSCT patients with SR-cGvHD is based on published pre-clinical and clin ical data. Important risks of treatment with ruxolitinib based on the MPN clinical development and post - authorization experience to date include: i) myelosuppression (thrombocy topenia, anemia and leukopenia), ii) infections (including opportunistic infecti ons), iii) tuberculosis, iv) use in patients with hepatic impairment, v) use in patients with moderate or severe renal failure or end stage renal failure requiring hemodial ysis, vi) elevated transaminases, vii.) bleeding, viii) progressive multifocal leuko encephalopath y, ix.) Increased systolic blood pressure, x.) non- melanoma skin cancer, xi) hepatitis B reactivation, xii) developmental toxicity , xiii.) Overexposure with concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole, xiv) use with CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, and xv) pharmacod ynamic interaction between ruxolitinib and hematopoietic growth factors or combination with cytoreductive therapies. These identified and potential risks will be monitored closel y and mitigated throughout this study in patients randomized to receive ruxolitinib vs. BAT as these risks are also common in the alloSCT setting particularl y patients with SR - cGvHD. No substantial additional risk for subject safety due to the SARS -CoV -2 virus and the COVID -19 pandemic has been identified at this time and therefore the benefit risk remains unchanged. In case of active COVID -19 infection, a careful benefit risk evaluation should be performed by the investigator to determine whether a subject can remain on study treatment. Myelosup pression Myelosuppression is a common occurrence in alloSCT patients, is commonly experienced with the majority of BAT used to treat cGvHD, and is also a commonly experienced effect from cGvHD. Case series in acute and chronic GvHD have identified worsenin g of myelosuppression in approximately 10-20% of GvHD patients treated with ruxolitinib at doses ranging 5 -10 mg orally BID spanning several months (Zeiser 2015). This was managed with dose reduction of ruxolitinib to 5 mg orally BID and required holding ruxolitinib in some patients whose ANC dropped below 500/mm3. Administration of hematopoietic growth factors will be allowed per Investigator judgement."
40,page_40,"Novartis Confidential Page 40of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 Bleeding Hemostatic disturbances are common in patients undergoing alloSCT and have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality . Ruxolitinib dose adjustment or dose holding will be based on platelet count (see Table 6 -2), and platelet transfusions may be given as clinically indicated. Use in pa tients with hepatic impairment As the liver is a target organ in c GvHD pathoph ysiology , elevated liver function tests including bilirubin and AST/ALT cannot be used as a parameter to exclude SR- cGvHD patients or determine starting dose. Diagnostic evaluation and manageme nt of hepatic impairment in SR-cGvHD patients treated on this study will follow institutional guidelines. Guidelines for the required diagnostic tests for ruxolitinib induced liver injury are outlined in Section 6.3.1.3. Use in patients with renal impairment Renal impairment is a common occurrence in patients with SR- cGvHD due to episodes of mild dehy dration attributable to GI involvement in the outpatient setting causing decreased oral intake aswell as concurrent administration of CNI. AlloSCT patients with severel y impaired renal function are excluded from enrollment. Diagnostic evaluation and management of renal impairment in SR -cGvHD patients will f ollow institutional guidelines. Infections Serious bacterial, mycobac terial, fungal, viral and other infections have occurred in MPN patients treated with ruxolitinib. Actions to minimize the risk of serious infections in SR- cGvHD patients will follow standard alloSCT guidelines including close monitoring of clinical signs and s ymptoms of infection, their prompt recognition and treatment. Patients with positive serologies pre-transplant for CMV, EBV, HHV-6, HBV, HCV require peripheral blood viral load (viral copies/ml) to rule out presence of active viral infection as eligibility requirement. As CMV reactivation with ruxolitinib therapy has been observed in SR-aGvHD patients (Zeiser 2015), this will be m onitored closel y in this trial. Tuberculosis SR-cGvHD patients in both the ruxolitinib and BAT arms will be monitored for any clinical signs and symptoms of active TB infection, and appropriate treatment provided. Skin testing for TB will not be performed in this study of alloSCT patients as this assessment is non- informative due to anergy . Progres sive Multifocal Encephalopathy Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y (PML) is a rare complication in alloSCT recipients. The median time from transplantation to symptom onset has been reported as 11 months, while median time to symptom onset has been notabl y shorter in other viral encephalitis in this population. These other viral entities, including HHV -6, HSV, EBV, CMV, HBV, HCV and VZV, have been reported with a median time to sy mptom onset post-HCT of between 3 and 8 months, respectivel y. The incidence of PML in the HCT population is significantl y less than in patients with HIV, with comparative incidence rates of 35.4 vs. 130 per one- hundred thousand person years, respectively ( Kaufman 2013 ).Actions to minimize the"
41,page_41,"Novartis Confidential Page 41of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 risk of PML in SR-cGvHD patients will follow standard alloSCT guidelines including close monitoring of any clinical signs of progressive focal neurological symptoms, with prompt diagnostic work up and treatment. Long -Term Follow Up: Non -melanoma skin cancers Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), including basal cell, squamous cell, and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in MPN patients treated with ruxolitinib. Skin cancer incide nce is increased in alloSCT patients vs. the general population, including increased risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and malignant mela noma (MM) occurring late, generall y 10-15 years after transplant (Omland 2016). Any occurrence of skin cancers will be monitored throughout this study . Safety in pediatric patients In a Phase I study , ruxolitinib with BID continuous oral dosing in children aged 2.4–21.4 (median 14.4) years with refractory /recurrent solid tumors (ST) and hematologic malignancies was well tolerated and showed similar pharmacokinetics to those in adults. No maximum tolerated dose was reached and the recommended dose for continuous BID oral administration was 50 mg/m2/dose ( Loh 2015 ). 2.7 Rationale for Public Health Emergency mitigation procedures During a Public Health emergency as declared b y Local or Regional authorities i.e. ,pandemic, epidemic or natura l disaster, mitigation procedures to ensure participant safety and trial integrit y are listed in relevant sections of this protocol . Notification of the public health emergency should be discussed with Novartis prior to implementation of mitigation procedu res, and permitted/approved by Local or Regional Health Authorities and Ethics Committees as appropriate. 3 Objectives and endpoints Objectives and related endpoints are described in Table 3 -1below. Efficacy assessments Global and organ -specific cGvHD clinician assessments are performed at baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Da y 1, and then ever y 28 da ys until Cycle 7 Day 1 according to the NIH C onsensus Criteria (Lee 2015 )(see Appendix 3).Following Cycle 7Day 1, response will be assessed on Cycle 9 Day 1 and every 12 weeks thereafter . Complete response is defined as complete resolution of all si gns and symptoms of cGvHD in all evaluable organs without additional therapies . Partial response is defined as an improvement in at least one organ (e.g. improvement of 1 or more points on a 4 to 7 point scale, or an improvement of 2 or more points on a 10 to 12 point scale) without progression in other organs or sites, or addition/ initiation of new systemic treatment . Lack of response is defined as unchanged, mixed response, or progression."

A cGvHD flare is not considered a treatment failure unless severity require saddition and/or change of another systemic immunos uppressive treatment .See Section 6.1.5.2 for details. cGvHD Recurrence is defined as the return of cGvHD symptoms after tapering off study treatment due to response. Following completion of a taper of systemic therap y, if worsening of cGvHD s ymptoms occur ,the patient is allowed to resume treatment for cGv HD as per local institutional practice. However ,this must be docum ented as a recurrence of cGvHD."

This is an open -label study . Investigators, patients, and Sponsor will have full knowledge of the treatment allocation. Approximately 324 patients will be randomized in this study .Each patient will be treated and/or followed for a total of 3 years (39 cycles/156 weeks). The study design is outlined below , with each cy cle comprised of 4 weeks ( 28 day s): 4.1.1 Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1) Screening activities and assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria are performed after the patient and / or the parents or legal guardian hassigned the required Informed Consent Form(s). Patients will continue to receive their systemic immunosuppressi ve regimen of corticosteroids +/-CNI for SR-cGvHD per standard of care by the Investigator during the Screening and Treatment period s. The Investigator must identify the Investigator ’schoice BAT prior to randomization. The Investigator’s choice BAT must be entered in the database and IRT at screening. The dose and administration schedule of initial BAT may be changed only after initiation of the treatment based on the judgment of the I nvestigator and in accordance with accepted medical practices. Patients meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to receive either ruxolitinib or BAT ,and stratif ied based on c GvHD severity per 2014 NIH consensus criteria (Jagasia 2015) at the time of randomization ( moderate vs. severe)."

Regardless of the assigned randomized treatment, patients experiencing cGvHD recurrence after tapering off study treatment will be treated per Investigator discretion. Patients that were originall y randomized to the BAT arm experiencing cGvHD recurrence may re-start a single agent BAT (±corticosteroids ± CNI) , or cross over to the ruxolitinib treatment arm. If a second recurrence occurs, the patient must cross over to the ruxolitinib treatment arm, or discontinue study treatment and enter the Long-Term Survival Follow -Up.For treatment of a recurrence , addition or initiation of a second BAT s ystemic treatment is not allowed. Adolescent patients will continue to follow the assessments for “adolescents on ly”in the Visit Evaluation Schedule even if they become 18 years of age and older during the course of the study . 4.1.3 Primary Efficacy Period (Cycle 1 through end of Cycle6) Cycle 1 Day 1isdefined as the day study treatment begins. This must occur after randomization . Typically this is the same day as randomization, but if not logistically possible (i.e., based on BAT access) should not be more than 72 hours after randomization. Study visits will occur per the following schedule to monitor tolerability and efficacy of the study treatments during the Primary Efficacy Period: Cycle 1: Day 1, 8, 15, 22 Cycle 2 to 6: Day 1of each cy cle Patients willbe treated for a minimum of 6 cycles, until Cy cle 7 Day 1,unless they experience intolerable toxicity , cGvHD progression, or withdraw from the study (see Section 6 for Study Treatment details and permitted/pro hibited concomitant therapies). Addition or initiation of a new systemic therapy in the BAT arm is allowed only after documented lack of response (as defined in Section 3), intolerable toxicity , or cGvHD flare and will be considered a treatment failure for both the primary and ke y secondary objectives. At the study visit in which the patient meets the criteria for disease progression, intolerable toxicity , or cGvHD flare treatment failure, addition or initiation of a new systemic BAT treatment is allowed. However, if mixed response or no response is assessed, change or addition of a new systemic BAT treatment is allowed. This response must be confirmed prior to the addition or change of therapy . This confirmation cannot occur prior to 1 week, and should not be done later than 4 weeks after the initial assessment (See Figure 4 - 2).If the confirmation is assessed prior to the next scheduled visit at an unscheduled visit, the original visit schedule based on the subject’s enrollment date should be resumed. Primary efficacy assessments will be performed on Cycle 7 Day 1, after completion of 6 cycles of treatment."

Patients in the Extension Period willeither continue treatment with ruxolitinib, the current BAT treatment, cross over to the Ruxolitinib treatment arm, or permanently discontinue study treatment and enter the Long-Term Survival Follow -Up. Addition or initiation ofanother system icBAT treatment is not allowed in the Extension Period (See Figure 4 - 3). 4.1.5 Cross -Over for BA T patients only (from Cross -Over up to Cycle 3 3) OnCycle 7 Day 1 and thereafter, patients randomized to BAT may cross over to ruxolitinib treatment due to disease progression, mixed response, or unchan ged response, due to toxicity to BAT, or due to cGvHD flare . Cross -Over patients will switch to and follow the visit evaluation schedule (starting on C ross- Over Cycle 1 Day 1)as specified inTable 7-2. Cross -Over patients will be treated and/or followed on -study for a total of 39 cy cles, inclusive of the initial randomized treatment, Cross- Over treatmen t, and long-term survival follow up(i.e. if patients cross over on randomized treatment atCycle 7, they will complete up to cy cle 33 in the CrossOver treatment period). Patients who meet Cross-Over criteria to receive ruxolitinib are allowed to continue their systemic immunosuppressive regimen of corticosteroids +/-CNI for SR-cGvHD treatment as per standard of care, with cessation required of the BAT treatment before starting treatment with ruxolitinib. Patients undergoing dose tapering should be monitored for cGvHD flare occurrences, which must be reported in the database. 4.1.6 Long-Term Survival Follow- Up (EOT to 39 cy cles on study ) Patients who permanently discontinue the study treatment prior to completion of 39 cycles on study for reasons other than achieving a CR or PR will enter the Long -Term Survival Follow - Up (LTSFU) , and may be treated per Institutional practice . They will be followed approximately every 3 months by telephone call for survival andreporting of new cGvHD therapies until 39 cy cles are completed. New cGvHD therapies will be entered in the New cGvHD Treatment Since Discontinuation of Study Treatment eCRF. See Section 7.1.5 for permanent treatment discontinuation details. 4.1.7 Safety Follow -Up (Last Dose + 30 day s) A 30-day safety follow - up assessment will be performed after the last dose of ruxolitinib or BAT , for patients that permanentl y discontinue study treatment for reasons other than CR or PR."

See Section 7.1.5 for details on discontinuation of study treatment. Dose modifications and follow - up guideline s for continuation of treatment are described in Section 6.3. 6.1.5 Treatment duration Thetreatment period will begin for each patient on Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients will be randomized to anassigned study treatment arm (ruxolitinib or BAT) and continue study treatment and/or assessments until discontinuation criteria are met (see Section 7.1.5 for Discontinuat ion of Study Treatment criteria ).Patients permanentl y discontinued from stud y treatment (ruxolitinib or BAT) , except for patients who are tapered off study treatment due to response, will enter the Long -Term Survival Follow -Up, and may be treated per Institutional practice . An individual patient will be treated and/or followed on study for 39 cycles(156 weeks /3 years), inclusive of randomized treatment, Cross-Overtreatment (BAT patients only), and long-term survival follow up . During thetreatment period, the patients’ treatment will be managed according to their response as follows: Patients that achieved CR or PR Ruxolitinib Arm: On Cy cle 7 Day 1, p atients rando mized to ruxolitinib that achieved a CR or PR, may continue ruxolitinib and will follow the Visit Evaluation Schedule per Table 7 -1 .A taper of ruxolitinib is allowed on ly onor after Cycle 7 Day 1. BAT Arm: P atients responding to BAT with a CR or PR will continue on the current BAT treatment and assessments per Table 7 -1.On or after Cycle 7 Da y 1, if the patient develops toxicity to BAT treatment ,has worsening of cGvHD symptoms , or experiences cGvHD flare, the patient may cross over to the ruxolitinib treatment arm and follow the Visit Evaluation Schedule per Table 7-2for Cross -Overtreatment ,or discontinue study treatment. Both treatment arms: A taper of CNI is allowed after Cycle 7 Day 1. A taper of corticosteroids is allowed at any point following documented CR or PR. See Section 6.1.5.1 for details. Patients without CR or PR Ruxolitinib Arm: On Cycle 7 Day 1, patients randomized to ruxolitinib and still receiving benefit from ruxolitinib per investigator decision may continue on study treatment .However, if the patient is not receiving benefit from ruxolitinib therapy per investigator decision, the patient must discontinue study treatment and be treated per institutional practice. These patients will enter the Long -Term Survival Follow -Up until the completion of 39 cy cles. BAT Arm: Prior to Cycle 7 Day 1, addition or initiation of a new systemic therap y in the BAT arm is allowed only after documented lack of response (as defined in"

At the study visit in which the patient meets the criteria for disease progression, intolerable toxicity , or cGvHD flare, addition or initiation of a new sy stemic treatment is allowed. However, if mixed response or no response is assessed, addition or initiation of a new sy stemic treatment isallowed. This response must be confirmed prior to addition or change of therap y. This confirmation cannot occur prior to 1 week, and should not be done later than 4 weeks after the initial assessment. On or after Cycle 7 Day 1, patients who are randomized to BAT and not achieving partial response or better may cross over to the ruxolitinib treatment arm (see Table 7-2for Cross - OverVisit Evaluation Schedule )andaddition or initiation of new systemic treatment is not allowed. Corticosteroids and CNI for cGvHD treatment are allowed to be continued. Both treatment arms: A taper of CNI is allowed per institutional practice. A taper of corticosteroids is allowed at any point following documented CR or PR. See Section 6.1.5.1 for details. Patients who taper off study treatment and all immunosuppressive therapy due to achieving a CR or PR will continue to follow the currentl y assigned Visit Evaluation Schedule (Table 7-1 Randomized Treatment, or Table 7 -2Cross-Over Treatment), including all safet y and efficac y assessments, and will be monitored for cGvHD recurrence which must be reported in the database (See Section 3 for definition of recurrence). Regardless of the assigned randomized treatment, patients experiencing cGvHD recurrence after tapering off study treatment will be treated per Investigator discretion, which may include crossing over to the ruxolitinib treatment arm, and will follow the assigned Visit Evaluation Schedule (Table 7-1for Randomized Treatment VES, or Table 7-2for Cross - OverTreatment VES). Patients that were originall y randomized to the BAT arm experiencing cGvHD recurrence may re-start a single agent BAT (±corticosteroids ± CNI). If a second recurrence occurs, the patient must cross over to the ruxolitinib treatment arm, or discontinue study treatment and enter the Long -Term Survival Follow -Up.For treatment of a recurrence: addition or initiation of second BAT systemic treatment is not allowed , and a more frequent schedule of safety assessments is recommended (i.e. every 2 weeks). Patients who permanentl y discontinue the study treatment for reasons other than achieving a CR or PR prior to completion of 39 cycles on study will enter the Long -Term Survival Follow - Up, and may be treated per Institutional practice . They will be followed approximately every 3 months by telephone call for survival and reporting of new cGvHD therapies until 39 cycleson study arecompleted. See Section 4.1 for additional details on study design. 6.1.5.1 Tapering guidelines Tapering of corticosteroids ,CNI, and ruxolitinib will follow 2 steps: first taper systemic corticosteroids following documented CR or PR , and follow with taper of CNI /ruxolitinib."
61,page_61,"Novartis Confidential Page 61of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 The taper of corticosteroids ,as outlined inFigure 6-1,should be attempted at the time of documented CR or PR.However, the taper of ruxolitinib and CNI should not be attempted until the patient is off corticosteroids AND the patient has completed the assessments for Cycle 7 Day 1.Ruxolitinib may notbe tapered prior to Cycle 7 Day 1for patients initially randomized to the ruxolitinib arm . During the Treatment Period in both the ruxolitinib and BAT arms, immunosuppression taper guidelines are: Corticosteroids: Every effort should be made to use the minimum dose of corticosteroid that is sufficient to control cGvHD manifestations. It is recommended that a taper of corticosteroids should be attempted approximately 2 weeks after achieving a CR.Guidel ines are included inFigure 6-1.If a flare should occur during the taper, treatment should continue for at least 3 months prior to attempting to resume the taper. Figure 6-1 Corticosteroid taper guidelines (Flo wers 2015) Week (time from achieving a CR) Dose, mg/kg body weight 0 Current dose of corticosteroid Qday (example 1mg) 2 Current dose of corticosteroid (1 mg)/ decrease alternate day dose by 50%* (0.5 mg) 4 Current dose of corticosteroid (1 mg)/decrease alternate day dose by 50%* (0.25 mg) 6 Current dose of corticosteroid every other day (QOD) : 1 mg every other day 8 Decrease current doseof corticosteroid by 10% every 2 weeks until off *Alternate -day administration CNI (cyclosporine or tacrolimus): Once off systemic corticosteroids, and documented CR or PR, starting atCycle 7 Day 1 a 25% dose reduction per month is allowed, or to be tapered per institutional practice. Ruxolitinib: Once off systemic corticosteroids, and documented CR or PR, starting at Cycle 7 Day 1 a 5 0% dose reduction every 2 m onths (56 days) can be initiated. Initial dose reduction is to 5 mg orally BID.If sustained cGvHD response is observed ( i.e. no worsening of cGvHD signs and symptoms), patient is further tapered by a second 50% dosage reduction to 5 mg orall y QD for an additional 2 months (56 day s), prior to cessation . 6.1.5.2 cGvHD flare If a cGvHD flare occurs during the taper of any immunosuppressive medications, the dose of corticosteroids may be re-escalated at the Investigator's discretion and will not be considered treatment failure .IfcGvHD flare requires addition or initiation of a new sy stemic therapy due to inability to taper cortico steroids below methy lprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent <1.25 mg/kg/day of prednisone) for a minimum 7 day s, OR due to re-escalation of corticosteroids to methy lprednisolone >2 mg/kg/day (or equivalent >2.5 mg/kg/day ofprednisone) , the subject will be considered to have experienced treatment failure. For BAT patients, if cGvHD flare requires the addition/initiation of new systemic therapy before C7D1 they may receive this as study treatment in the treatment period. After Cycle 7 Day 1, BAT patients may cross over to ruxolitinib or discontinue the treatment period and enter the Long -Term Survival Follow -up."
62,page_62,"Novartis Confidential Page 62of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. C INC424D2301 If cGvHD flare occurs during ruxolitinib taper after Cycle 7 Day 1, patients may have their ruxolitinib dose increased to the prior dose level (maximum 10 mg BID), their response monitored, and ruxolitinib taper attempted again if patients have a response within 28 days. If the flare is unresponsive to increased ruxolitini b dose within 28 day s, or more than one flare is observed, the subject will be considered to have experienced cGvHD flare-failure, and further treatment with ruxolitinib is allowed per Investigator’s judgement . For an y subject who develops severe worsening cytopenias necessitating abrupt interruption of ruxolitinib, flare of cGvHD may occur. To avoid significant cGvHD flare during abrupt ruxolitinib interruption, the subject’s corticosteroid dose should be maintained or increased to > 0.4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone (or equivalent prednisone to > 0.5 mg/kg/day ) for a minimum 7 day s after abrupt cessation of ruxolitinib. See Section 6.3.1.1 for more details. 6.2 Dose escalation guidelines Not applicable 6.3 Dose modifications 6.3.1 Dose modification and dose delay For patients who do not tolerate the protocol -specified dosing schedule, dose interruptions and/or reductions are either recommended or mandated in order to allow patient s to continue the study treatment. Thes e dose modifications are summarized inTable 6-2. Deviations to mandatory dose interruptions and/or reductions are not allowed. Permanent treatment discontinuation is mandatory for specific events indic ated as such in Table 6-2 or listed in Section 7.1.5 . The ruxolitinib dose will not exceed 10 mg orall y BID and will not be less than 5 mg QD. The dose for Best Available Therap y, CNI, and/or corticosteroids can be modified as per Investigator discretion, institutional guidelines, or as per product label. A standardized dosing paradigm in Table 6-3and Table 6-4will be used to determine dose adjustments for safet y and efficacy so that each subject is titrated to their most appropriate dose. These dose changes must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record eCRF. Amore frequent schedule of safet y assessments is recommended (i.e. every 2 w eeks) after restarting study treatment due to a dose hold . If a patient requires a dose interruption of > 21 day s from ruxolitinib or BAT, then the patient must be permanentl y discontinued from the stud ytreatment, and will be enter edinto the Long- Term Survival Follow -Up. 6.3.1.1 Dose adjustments for ruxolitinib hematologic safety Dose reductions or interruptions for worse ning cytopenias attributed to ruxolitinib are permitted in order to allow the subject to continue on the study treatment. D oses adjustments for different ranges of cytopenias are described inTable 6-2.

To avoid significant cGvHD flare durin g abrupt ruxolitinib interruption, the subject’s corticosteroid dose should be maintained or increased to >0.4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone (or equivalent prednisone to >0.5 mg/kg/day ) for a minimum 7 day s after abrupt cessation of ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib dosing may be restarted or increased following recovery of the hematologic parameter(s) to acceptable levels. The objective for restarting or escalating after a reduction for hematologic safet y is to find the highes t safe dosing regimen of ruxolitinib for each subject that is necessary to obtain a clinical response, with increases in dose not more than in increments of 5 mg BID and not more often than every 2 weeks. SeeTable 6-4. Treatment with ruxolitinib may be delay ed up to 21days to allow for resolution of toxicity . Patients may resume treatment if no medical condition or other circumstance exists that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subjec t unsuitable for further participation in the study . 6.3.1.2 Dose adjustments for ruxolitinib non- hematologic safety Dose reductions or interruptions for non-hematologic toxicity are permitted in order to allow the subject to continue on the study treatment. Dose adjustments for different ranges of non- hematologic toxicity are described in Table 6-2andTable 6-3. The objective of the dose adjustment rules isto optimize treatment response for each individual subject while avoiding significant non -hematologic toxicities. As organ toxicities are relatively common in alloSCT patients, any adverse event must be assessed to determine whether it is suspected to be r elated to ruxolitinib treatment. Ruxolitinib dose adjustments are only required for adverse events that are suspected to be related to the study drug. This has particular relevance in evaluation of elevated serum creatinine, as elevations related to CNI administration are often seen.Dose adjustment of CNI will follow institutional guidelines and investigator judgement, with CNI dose reductions anticipated if rising creatinine occurs, to potentially alleviate the need for ruxolitinib dose reductions. Treatm ent with ruxolitinib may be delay ed up to 21 days to allow for resolution of toxicity . Patients may resume treatment if no medical condition or other circumstance exists that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for further participation in the study . Ruxolitinib must be permanently discontinued upon any one of the following adverse events attributed to study drug that fails to resolve to Grade 2 or better within 14 days or if a lower re - start dose or administration schedul e subsequent to any of the following non-hematologic toxicities is either not available or likel y to be clinically ineffective : occurrence of a Grade 4 laborator y or non -laboratory abnormality attributable to ruxolitinib occurrence of a Grade 3 laborator y or non -laboratory abnormality attributable to ruxolitinib that remains at Grade 3 or worse for greater than 14 days"

The threshold for potential DILI may depend on the patient’s baseline AST/AL T and TBIL value; pati ents meeting any of the following criteria will require further follow -up as outlined below: For patients with normal ALT and AST and TBIL value at baseline: AST or ALT > 3.0 x ULN combined with TBIL > 2.0 x ULN For patients with elevated AST or ALT or TBIL value at baseline: [AST or ALT > 2 x baseline AND > 3.0 x ULN] OR [AST or ALT > 8.0 x ULN], combined with [TBIL > 2 x baseline AND > 2.0 x ULN] Medical review needs to ensure that liver test elevations are not caused by cholestasis, defined as ALP elevation > 2.0 x ULN with R value < 2 in patients without bone metastasis, or elevation of AL P liver fraction in patients with bone metastasis. Note: (The R value is calculated by dividing the ALT by the ALP, using multiples of the ULN for both values. It denotes whether the relative pattern of ALT and/or ALP elevation is due to cholestatic (R ≤ 2), hepatocellular (R ≥ 5), or mixed (R >2 and < 5) liver injury ). In the absence of cholestasis, these patients should be immediately discontinued from study drug treatment, and repeat LFT testing as soon as possible, preferabl y within 48 hours from the awareness of the abnormal results.

See Appendix 7 for a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. Strong CYP3A 4 inhibitors A dose reduction of ruxolitinib (e.g. by 50%) should be considered when using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. No dose adjustment of ruxolitinib is needed for use with topical ketoconazole. See Section 6.4.2. Mild or moderate CYP3A 4 inhibitors No dose adjustment is recommended when ruxolitinib is co-administered with mild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dual CYP2C9 and CYP3A 4 inhibitors A dose reduction of ruxolitinib (e.g. by 50%) should be considered when using medicinal products which are dual inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g. fluconazole).

Following an y abrup t interruption or discontinuation of ruxolitinib, sy mptoms of cGvHD flare are expected. If considered to be medically necessary , the Investigator may use any treatment to manage withdrawal from ruxolitinib including a gradual tapering of the study drug dosage or use of other medications including corticosteroid as minimum dosage ≥ 0.4 mg/kg/day methy lprednisolone (or equivalent prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day ) to manage cGvHD flare anticipated after abru pt ruxolitinib discontinuation. When a decision has been made to discontinue the subject with utilization of a tapering strategy, regardless of the use of concomitant medications, safet y data will continue to be assessed in accordance with the protocol for a period of time at least through the continued administra tion of ruxolitinib and until the safet y follow -up visit is completed (30 days from last ruxolitinib dose intake) for adverse event monitoring. 6.4 Concomitant medications 6.4.1 Permitted concomitant therapy Supportive treatments per institutional guidelines for management of alloSCT patients with SR- cGvHD are allowed. The patient must be told to notify the investigational site about any new medications he/she takes after randomization and the start of treatment. All medications (other than ruxolitinib and BAT) inclu ding over-the-counter and vitamins/herbal/natural medications must be listed on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. Significant non-drug therapies (including physical therap y and blood transfusions) administered during the study must be listed on the Surgeri es and Procedures eCRF. Any prior medication received up to 30 days prior to the first dose of ruxolitinib or BAT must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Patients will be instructed not to take an y additional medications (including over-the-counter produ cts) during the course of the study without consultation with the Investigator. In addition to ruxolitinib or BAT, patients may receive other cGvHD medications administered either as cGvHD prophy laxis or treatment prior to randomization which can include CNI (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), and corticosteroids. In addition, viral prophy laxis and antibiotics are allowed as needed for prevention an d treatment of any infections. Corticosteroids may be taken or administered without regard to food except on days when extensive PK samples are drawn; on those day s, patients should be instructed to fast and refrain from taking corticosteroids until after PK samples are collected. See Section 7for additional information. Doses of methy lprednisolone will be converted to prednisone equivalents by multiply ing the methy lprednisolone dose by 1.25. Prednisone doses for each subject are converted to mg/kg/day . For patients that weigh over 100 kg, maximal starting dose of prednisone will be 200 mg (or 2"
73,page_73,"Novartis Confidential Page 73of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. CINC424D2301 mg/kg/day based on a modified starting weight of 100 kg). For calculation of subsequent prednisone doses/kg on subsequent measures, the modif ied starting weight of 100 kg will be used. Change of systemic immunosuppressive therapy after randomization and up to completion of Cycle 7 Day 1 will be considered a treatment failure. At the study visit in which the patient meets the criteria for diseas e progression, intolerable toxicity , or cGvHD flare, addition or initiation of a new systemic treatment is allowed. However, if mixed response or no response is assessed, addition or initiation of a new systemic treatment is not allowed until the next scheduled study visit where mixed response or no response is confirmed, at least 4 weeks later. It is recommended that any subject receiving a CNI at stud y entr y will remain on the same CNI as needed while being in the study treatment period. Patients who unde rgo alloSCT are at risk for a variet y of infections based on the degree of immunosuppression induced by the conditioning regimen prior to transplant. As such, it is considered routine practice to utilize antibiotics, anti-infectives, and immunizations as prophy lactic therapies (Tombly n 2009 ). In cases where post-transplant anti-infective prophy laxis measures are necessary , ongoing therapy may continue at Investigator's discretion per institutional guidel ines. This includes any viral prophy laxis indicated based on pre-alloSCT serologies. Additional supportive care measures (e.g., use of anti-emetics and anti-motility agents for diarrhea management) are permitted at Investigator's discretion. 6.4.2 Permitted conc omitant therapy requiring caution and/or action SR-cGvHD patients receiving ruxolitinib with concomitant medications provided per standard institutional guidelines for management after alloSCT including: anti-emetics, calcineurin inhibitors, azole fungal prophy laxis, broad spectrum antibiotics in the event of fever (either semi -synthetic penicillin or third generation cephalosporin with vancomy cin, gentam ycin or equivalent), acyclovir prophy laxis, G-CSF, steroid pre-meds prior to RBC/platelet transfusions, narcotics, and sedatives warrant close monitoring of potential drug-drug interaction effects of these concurrent drugs. Ruxolitinib dose adjustments may be required, particularl y in patients treated with CYP450 modulators (See Section 6.3.1.4). Upon initiation of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or a dual CYP3A4/CYP2C9 inhibitor , including fluconazole up to a dose of 200 mg, the dose of ruxolitinib may be reduced (e.g. by 50%), and more frequent monitoring of hematology parameters and clinical signs and symptoms of ruxolitinib related adverse events is recommended The patient and the Investigator should be aware of potential signs of overdose of the concomitant medications and in the event of suspected study drugrelated toxicity ; administration of ruxolitinib should be dose reduced or held according to guidelines (See Table 6-2) and Investigator judgment, with appropriate corticosteroid immunosuppression provided to avoid cGvHD flare."
74,page_74,"Novartis Confidential Page 74of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No. CINC424D2301 6.4.3 Prohibited concomitant therapy The following therapies are prohibited during the study until treatment discontinuation: Due to the high risk of bleeding in alloSCT patients with SR- cGvHD, NSAIDs and related medications that would expectedly reduce platelet function, and/or heparin, warfarin sodium (Coumadin®) or related medications that would adversel y affect blood coagulation are prohibited. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) , acetaminophen, and ibuprofen are allowed. In patients in whom aspirin is indicated for secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, aspirin dail y dose must not exceed 150 mg/day . Concomitant use of another JAK inhibitor besides ruxolitinib. Herbal preparations/medications are not allowed, as a potentia l drug-drug interaction is possible. These herbal medications include, but are not limited to, St. John’s Wort, Kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehy droepiandrsterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng. Patients must stop using herbal medic ations at least 7 days prior to first dose of study treatment. Any investigational medication (other than ruxolitinib) that is not approved for any indication. Use of such medications is prohibited within 30 day s or 5 half -lives, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study treatment and until treatment discontinuation. Use of chemotherapeutic agents and/or non-scheduled DLI for malignancy recurrence /relapse is not permitted.

Randomization will be stratified b y cGvHD severity : moderate vs severe. The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigator staff. A patient randomization list will be produced by the Interactive Response Technolo gy (IRT) provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of patient numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication randomization list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Novartis Global Clinical Supply using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to medication packs containing each of the study treatments. Prior to dosing, all patients who fulfill all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized via IRT to one of the treatment arms. The investigator or his/her delegate will call or log on to the IRT and confirm that the patient fulfills all the inclusio n/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the patient, which will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the first package of study treatment to be dispensed to the patient. The randomization number will not be communicated to the caller. 6.5.3 Treatment blinding This is an open label study. 6.6 Stud y drug preparation and dispensation The investigator or responsible site personnel must instruct the patient or caregiver to take the study drugs as per protocol.

The screening period can last 28 day s (Day -28 to Day -1). During screening, the patient’s disease history will be assessed. These specific screening procedures are outlined in the visit evaluation schedule . For details on the schedule of assessments, see Table 7-1. Screening l ab evaluations per formed ≤ 10 daysof Cycle 1 Day 1 can be used for C ycle 1 Day 1 . A patient with a laboratory test result(s) that does not satisfy the eligibility criteria, may have the test(s) repeated during the screening period . These tests may be repeated as soon as the Investigator believes that the retest result is likely to be within the acceptable range to satisfy the entrance criteria during the 28 day screening period. In this case, the patient will not be required to sign another ICF, and the original patient ID number assigned bythe Investigator will be used. In the event that the laboratory test(s) cannot be performed within the 28 day screening period, or the re -test(s) do not meet the entrance criteria or the patient’s medical condition has changed signific antly during the screening period so that inclusion/exclusion criteria are no longer met, the patient is considered a Screen Failure, and must be discontinued from the study . If the Investigator chooses to re-screen the patient, the patient must sign a new ICF, a new patient ID number will be assigned by the Investigator, and all required Screenin g activities must be performed. Once the number of patients screened and enrolled in the respective arm is likely to assure target enrollment, the Sponsor may, at its discretion, close the stud y to further screening. In this case, patients who screen fail will not be permitted to re- screen. 7.1.2.1 Eligibility screening Patient eligibility will be confirmed by the investigative staff and captured within the source documents maintained at the site. Only when eligibility has been confirmed will the site follow instructions to enter the patient into the IRT s ystem to be assigned to a treatment arm and dose level. This information will be made available during planned interim monitoring visits and compared against the clinical database for accuracy .

The chronic GvHD screening staging assessment is a global and organ -specific clinician assessment which focuses on symptom activity in chronic GvHD patients. To classify the cGvHD severit y, the staging assessment collec ts individual organ symptom scores (mouth, gastrointestinal, lungs, eyes, joints and fascia, liver, skin, genital tract). Assessments for all organs must be performed at Screening . The list of organ specific assessments and scoring can be found in Appendix 2 . Skin Skin features are to be scored by % b ody surface area (BSA), presence of skin abnormalities (maculopapular rash/er ythema, papulosquamous lesion or ichthy osis, lichen planus -like features, scle rotic features, keratosis pilaris –like, and sclerotic involvement), and skin feature score . Mouth Mouth features are to be scored by presence of lichen planus -like features and degree of oral intake limitation. Eyes The eye score is determined by assessi ng severity of dry eye symptoms and degree of vision impairment. Gastrointestinal The GI tract score is determined by assessing presence and degree of various symptoms (esophageal web/proximal structure or ring, dysphagia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarr hea, weight loss, failure to thrive). Liver The liver score is based on AL T, alkaline phosphates, and total bilirubin. Lungs The lung organ score is collected from performing a pulmonary function test, scores are derived from the %FEV1 (percentage) results."
96,page_96,"Novartis Confidential Page 96of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No . CINC424D2301 Joints and Fascia The joints and fascia score is determined by assessing range of motion and activity of daily living (ADL). Individual joints and fascia ROM scores arecollected for symptom severity of shoulder, elbow, wrist/finger, and ankle. Genital Tract The genital tract score is determined by assessing applicable signs and level of discomfort during exam. If there is any organ -specific abnormality present but explained entirely by non-GvHD documented cause, this should be indicated on the cGvHD Disease Staging eCRF, and the applicable conditioned reported in the Medical History or Adverse Event eCRF. 7.2.1.2 Chronic GvHD Disease Assessment The primary efficacy variable endpoint of the study is overall response rate at Cycle 7 Day 1 per NIH consensus criteria (Lee 2015). Secondary endpoints include the Best Overall Response (BOR) and the overall response rate at Cycle 4 Da y 1.The assessment will be performed b y the treating ph ysician according to the detailed schedule found in Table 7 -1orTable 7-2. 7.2.1.2.1 Baseline o rgan involvement The chronic GvHD assessment is a global and organ -specific clinicia n assessment which focuses on symptom activity in chronic GvHD patients.

CINC424D2301 Liver The baseline liver involvement is assessed using AL T, alkaline phosphates, and total bilirubin. Please ensure the liver parameters are obtained, and observed values, units and normal ranges are documented. Gastrointestinal Individual GI scores are to be collected for frequency of esophageal symptoms (dysphagia or odynophagia), upper GI symptoms (earl y satiet y, anorexia, or nausea and vomiting), and lower GI (diarrhea). Lungs The lung baseline status is assessed by a pulmonary function test to determine the %FEV1 (percentage) results. In addition, a lung score based on clinical symptoms is used. Joints and Fascia Individual joints and fascia scores are to be collected for s ymptom severit y of shoulder, elbow, wrist/finger, and ankle. If there is any organ -specific abnormality present but explained entirely by non-GvHD documented cause, this should be indicated on the cGvHD Disease Assessment eCRF, and the applicable conditioned reported in the Medical History or Adverse Event eCRF. As part of thechronic GvHD assessment, a biopsy of the organs involved may be performed per institutional practices at investigator’s discretion. If performed, the investigator will indicate the results in the appropriate eCRF pages. 7.2.1.2.2 Post -baseline organ involvement and cGvHD response assessment The chronic GvHD assessment will be performed by the treating physician according to the detailed schedule found in Table 7-1orTable 7-2. At each post-baseline asses sment , each organ must be assessed using the same criteria as for baseline . Additionally ,the response evaluation of each organ should be made by comparing the current organ assessment versus the baseline organ status documented on Cy cle 1 Day 1. To assess the response to ruxolitinib in cross -over patients, the baseline is defined as the latest cGvHD evaluation before the start of ruxolitinib. A high level summary of organ -specific response assessment criteria as per NIH consensus guideline ( Lee 2015 ) are listed in Table 7-3. Table 7-4summarizes the rules for overall response assessment based on organ specific evaluations at each scheduled post-baseline visit. These overall response assessments will be used to derive response rates for the primary and secondary endpoints.

Additional Tanner Staging assessments will be based on the score at screening and subsequent scores : Stage 5 = no additional Tanner Staging assessments needed Stage 4 or less = continue Tanner Staging assessments per Table 7 - 1orTable 7 -2. 7.2.3 Pharmacokinetics Blood sampling for PK of ruxolitinib will be performed in all patients enrolled in the study . Extensive PK sampling schedule Earlyenrolling patients randomized to ruxolitinib arm will follow an “extensive PK” sampling schedule as outlined in Table 7-7. Approximately the first eight (8) adult patients and four (4) adolescent patients enrolled are required to follow the “extensive PK” sampling schedule. P atients should be instructed to fast and refrain from taking corticosteroids until after PK samples are collected on “extensive PK ”sampling day s. Sparse PK sampling schedule Once this requirement for “extensive PK sampling” for Cycle 1 day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15 is fulfilled ,the sponsor will notify all sites. Subsequent patients randomized to ruxolitinib ,any randomized patients receiving ruxolitinib after Cycle 6 ,andany randomized patients receiving BAT that cross over to ruxolitinib will follow the “sparse PK” sampling schedule as outlined Table 7-8. Cross over patients from BAT to ruxolitinib follow a different visit schedule according to Table 7-2. PK samples for cross over patients will be taken only at the time of a scheduled visit."

If the event worsens the event should be reported a second time in the eCRF noting the start date when the event worsens in toxicity . For grade 3 and 4 adverse events only, if improvement to a lower grade is determined a new entry for this event should be reported in the eCRF noting the start date when the event improved from having been Grade 3 or Grade 4. All adverse events should be treated appropriately . If a concomitant medication or non-drug therap y is given, this action should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until i t is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently , if necessary ) of any changes in severity , the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. The following events, which are components of study endpoints: worsening of study indication (chronic GvHD) including occurrence of cGvHD flare, relapse or recurrence of underl ying disease (including fatal outcomes), should not be reported as a serious adverse event and will be reported on specific eCRFs other than AE eCRF. Adverse events separate from the events listed above (example, deep vein thrombosis at the time of progression or hemopty sis concurrent with finding of disease progression) will be repor ted as per usual guidelines used for such events with proper attribution regarding relatedness to the drug. 8.1.2 Laboratory test abnormalities 8.1.2.1 Definitions and reporting Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an Adverse event in their own right (are considered clinically significant, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therap y or require changes in study treatment), should be recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF. Whenever possible, a diagnosis, rather than a symptom should be provided (e.g. anemia instead of low hemoglobin). Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for Adverse Events should be followed until they have returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. When an abnormal laboratory or test result corresponds to a sign/s ymptom of an already reported adverse event, it is not necessary to separately record the lab/test result as an additional event. Laboratory abnormalities, that do not meet the definition of an adverse event, should not be reported as adverse events. A Grade 3 or 4 event (severe) as per CTCAE does not automatically indicate a SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined below and/or as per investigator’s discretion. A dose hold or medication for the lab abnormality may be req uired by the protocol in which case the lab abnormality would still, by definition, be an adverse event and must be reported as such."

Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study Who will have access to that information and wh y Who will use or disclose that information The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI ."
116,page_116,"Novartis Confidential Page 116of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No . CINC424D2301 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect follow -up safet y information (e.g. has the subject experienced an y new or worsened AEs) at the end of their scheduled study period. The data collection system for this study uses built-in security features to encry pt all data for transmission in both directions, preventing unauthorized access to confidential participant information. Access to the system will be controlled by a sequence of individually assigned user identification codes and passwords, made available only to authorized personnel who have completed prerequisite training. 9.2 Site monitoring Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, Novartis personnel (or designated CRO) will review the protocol and Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) with the inve stigators and their staff. During the study , the field monitor will visit the site regularl y to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enroll ment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information recorded on eCRFs must be traceable to source documents in the patient's file. The investigator must also keep the original signed informed consent form (a signed copy is given to the patient). The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confir m their consistency with the eCRF entries. Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria and documentation of SAEs. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. 9.3 Data collection This study will use Electronic Data Capture (EDC), the designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the eCRF. The eCRFs have been built using fully validated secure web-enabled software that conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements, Investigator site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs and, allow modification or verification of the entered data b y the investigator staff. The Principal Investigator is responsible for assuring that the data entered into eCRF is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely manner. Blood samples for PK samples and/or data, and ePRO data will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronically to Novartis as described in the Data Transfer Specification."

Note that response is relative to the assessment of cGvHD at randomization . Complete response is defined as complete resolution of all signs and symptoms of cGvHD in all evaluable organs without initiation or addition of new s ystemic therapy . Partial response is defined as an improvement in at least one organ (e.g. improvement of 1 or more points on a 4 to 7 point scale, or an improvement of 2 or more points on a 10 to 12 point scale )without progression in other organs or sites, initiation or addition of new systemic therapies . Lack of response is defined as unchanged, mixed response, or progression. cGvHD Flare is defined as any increase in symptoms or therapy for cGvHD after an initial response (CR or PR). A cGvHD flare is not considered a treatment failure unless a change of therap y oraddition of another sy stemic salvage treatment occurs. cGvHD Recurrence is defined as the return of cGvHD disease after tapering off study treatment due to response. Following completion of a taper of systemic therap y, if worsening of cGvHD s ymptoms occur, the patient is allowed to resume treatment for cGv HD as per local institutional practice. For the statistical analy ses re -start of treatment for cGvHD is handled in the same way as addition or initiation of new sy stemic treatment. 10.4.2 Statistical hy pothesis, model, and method of analy sis The following statistical hypotheses will be tested to address the primary efficacy objective: H0: ORR rux≤ ORR BATvs.H1: ORR rux> ORR BAT where ORR ruxand ORR BATare the overall response rates at Cycle 7 Day 1in the ruxolitinib and BAT groups, respectively. The Cochrane -Mantel -Haenszel chi-square test, stratified by the randomization stratification factor (i.e., cGvHD moderate vs severe), will be used to compare ORR between the two treatment groups, at the one -sided 2.5% level of significance. The primary efficacy variable, ORR at Cycle 7 Day 1, will be analyzed at the time when all patients have completed their Cycle 7 Day 1 visit or discontinued earlier. The primary anal ysis will be performed on FAS according to ITT principle. ORR and its 95% confidence interval will be presented by treatment group . P -value, odds ratio and 95% Wald confidence limits calculated from stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test will also be presented. 10.4.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations Patients with missing assessments that prevent the evaluation of the primary endpoint will be considered non-responders on that treatment arm.

CINC424D2301 The second ke y secondary objective (all regions except for US) is to assess the improvement of symptoms based on the total sy mptom score (TSS) using the modified Lee Symptom Scale. A responder is defined as having achieved a clinically relevant reduction from baseline of the total symptom score (TSS) . Details will be described in the statistical analy sis plan (SAP). The rate of T SS responders and its 95% confidence interval will be presented by treatment group. The Cochrane -Mantel -Haenszel chi-square test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors (i.e. cGvHD moderate vs severe), will be used to compare TSS response rates between the two treatme nt groups, at the one -sided 2.5% level of significance . Supportive analy ses The FFS distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, and the Kaplan -Meier curves, medians, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month FFS estimates and 95% confidence intervals (Brookmey er and Crowley 1982) will be presented for each treatment group. The hazard ratio for FFS will be calculated, along with its 95% confidence interval , using a stratified Cox model. The cumulative incidence curve of each of the three FFS components (considering the other twocomponents as a competing risk) as well as estimates at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months will also be presented with 95% confidence intervals. 10.5.2 Other secondary efficacy objectives Best overall response (BOR) Best overall response (BOR) is defined as proportion of patients who achieved overall response (CR or PR) at any time point upto and including Cycle 7 day 1 and before the start of additional systemic therapy for cGvHD. BOR and its 95% confidence interval will be presented b y treatment group. P -value, odds ratio and 95% Wald confidence limits calculated from stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test will also be presented. ORR at Cycle 4 Day 1(end of Cy cle3) ORR at Cycle 4 Day 1 and its 95% confidence interval will be presented by treatment group. P-value, odds ratio and 95% Wald confidence limits calculated from stratified Cochran -Mantel - Haenszel test will also be presented. Duration of Response Duration of response (DOR) is assessed for responders only. DOR is defined as the time from first response until cGvHD progression, death, or the date of additional systemic therapies for cGvHD. Patients without event will be censored at the last contact date. Kaplan -Meier method and the Kapla n-Meier curves, medians, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months survival probabilities with 95% confidence intervals will be presented."

CINC424D2301 Overall survival (OS) OS will be analy zed according to the randomized treatment group and strata assigned at randomization (cGvHD moderate vs severe). The OS distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, and the Kaplan -Meier curves, medians, 3, 6, 12 and 24 month survival probabilities and 95% confidence intervals (Brookmey er and Crowley 1982 )will be presented for each treatment group. The hazard ratio for OS will be calculated, along with its 95% confidence interval, using a stratified Cox model. Non Relapse Mortality (NRM) Non-relapse mortality (NRM), defined as th e time from date of randomization to date of death not preceded by underlying disease relapse/ recurrence . Cumulative incidence of NRM and derived probabilities at Months 1, 2, 6, 12, 18 & 24 will be estimated, considering underl ying disease relapse/ recurre nceas competing events. Incidence of Malignancy Relapse/ Recurrence (MR) The cumulative incidence curve for MR and estimates at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months with 95% confidence intervals will be presented for patients with underly ing hematologic malignant disease, accounting for NRM as the competing risk. I n addition, the proportion of patients who had hematologic malignancy relapse/ recurrence and its 95% confidence interval at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months will be presented by treatment group for patients with underly ing hematologic malignant disease. Odds ratio and 95% Wald confidence limits calculated from stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test will be also presented. Reduction of daily cortico steroid dose and successful tapering of all cortico steroids This will include the assessment of proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in daily cortico steroid dose at Cy cle 7 Day 1 proportion of patients successfull y tapered off all corticosteroids at 6 months 10.5.3 Safety objectives 10.5.3.1 Analysis set and grouping for the anal yses For all safet y analyses, the safet y set will be used. All listings and tables will be presented by treatment group. The overall observation period will be divided into three mutually exclusive segments: 1.Pre-treatment period: from day of patient’s informed consent to the day before first dose of study medication 2.On-randomized treatment period: from day of first dose of study medication to 30 days after date of last actual administration of randomized treatment (including start and stop date) or end of randomized treatment per end of randomized treatment disposition eCRF, whichever is later. For those patients who cross over from BAT to ruxolitinib, the period is from day of first dose of randomized study medication to earlier of (i) 30 days after last dose of randomized study medication, (ii) the day before first dose of cross over treatment"

The main comparative safety anal yses will be performed for the time period from the day of the first dose up to Cycle 7 Day 1to avoid potential bias due to different exposure durations related to possible cross over from BAT to ruxolitinib after Cycle 7 Day 1.Furthermore, separate safet y summaries will be generated for the no-randomized treatment period and the on-cross over treatment period. 10.5.3.2 Adverse events (A Es) Summary tables for adverse events (AEs) willinclude only AEs that started or worsened during the on-treatment period (either randomized or cross- over period) , the treatment -emergent AEs. The incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by system organ class and or preferred term, severit y (based on CTCAE grades), type of adverse eve nt, relation to study treatment Serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest (AESI) during the on -treatment perio d will be tabulated. All deaths (on- treatment and post -treatment) will be summarized . All AEs, deaths and serious adverse events (including those from the pre and post-treatment periods) will be listed and those collected during the pre-treatment and post-treatment period will be flagged. 10.5.3.3 Laboratory abnormalities Grading of laboratory values will be assigned programmaticall y as per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The calculation of CTCAE grades will be based on the observed laboratory values only, clinical assessments will not be taken into account. CTCAE Grade 0 will be assigned for all non -missing values not graded as 1 or higher. Grade 5 will not be used. For laboratory tests where grades are not defined by CTCAE v4.03, results will be categorized as low/normal/high based on laboratory normal ranges. The following summaries will be generated separately for hematology , and biochemistry tests: Listing of all laboratory data with values flagged to show the corresponding CTCAE v4.03 grades if applicable and the classifications relative to the laboratory normal ranges For laboratory tests where grades are defined b y CTCAE v4.03 Worst post-baseline CTCAE grade (regardless of the baseline status).

In addition to the above mentioned tables and listings, other exploratory analy ses, for example figures plotting time course of raw or change in laboratory tests over time or box plots might be specified in the anal ysisplan. 10.5.3.4 Other safety data Vital signs Data on vital signs will be tabulated and listed, notable values will be flagged. Pediatric data Pediatric data will be tabulated and listed, notable values will be flagged. 10.5.4 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS) will be used in all pharmacokinetic data analysis and PK summary statistics. For patients with the “extensive PK” sampling scheme, PK parameters of ruxolitinib will be calculated using non-compartmental methods using Phoenix WinNonlin (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA) software. Additional PK parameters may be estimated as needed.

127,page_127,"Novartis Confidential Page 127of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No . CINC424D2301 Statistical methods for pharmacokinetic analy ses Ruxolitinib concentrations data will be listed by treatment and dose. Descriptive summary statistics will be provided by treatment and dose at each scheduled time point. Summary statistics will include n (number of patients with non-missing values), mean (arithmetic and geometric), standard deviation (SD) , coefficient of variation (CV%)(arithmetic and geometric), median, minimum and maximum. Individual profiles with median by treatment as well as arithmetic mean with SD and geometric mean ruxolitinib plasma concentration versus time profiles b y treatment will be displayed graphicall y. Ruxolitinib plasma PK parameters data will be listed by treatment and dose. Descriptive statistics (n, arithmetic mean, SD, CV% for mean, geometric mean, geometric CV%, median, minimum and maximum) will be provided for all PK parameters by treatment and dose except for Tmax where median, minimum and maximum will be presented. The potential impact of occurrence and severit y of GI GvHD on ruxolitinib pharmacokinetic parameters will be explored. Population PK approach The population pharmacokinetics of stud y treatment is likely to be adequately described b y a 2 compartment structural pharmacokinetic model with either a zero or a first order absorption model. While all concentration measurements will be modeled, clearl y outly ing observations that have a strong influence on the estimated parameters will be excluded. The dependence is to be explored. The choice of covariates to be tested in the model will be guided b y exploratory plots of random effects (inter -individual variability parameters). Those that are judged to show evidence of a relationship with the random effects will be tested for entry into the model, using the likelihood -ratio test with p < 0.05. The final covariate model will be derived using a rigorous and acceptable model building procedure. The population PK analy sis will be reported separately . During modeling of the pharmacokinetics of study treatment, the broad principles outlined in the FDA guidance will be followed (Guidance for Industry : Population Pharmacokinetics; http//www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/1852fnl.pdf). Exposure -Response analy sis A detailed description of exposure -response analy sis will be developed in the analysis plan. Briefl y, the objectives are to: Characterize the exposure -efficacy relationship of ruxolitinib in terms of concentration - effect and dose -effect (effect: overall response rate at Month 3 and 6;Overall survival at 3, 6 and 12 months) Characterize the exposure -safety relationship of ruxolitinib in terms of concentration -AEs and/or dose -AEs (AEs: frequency of AEs, severity of AEs, AEs of interest). Average stead y-state exposures and/or other PK parameters for the population will be derived from observed values (e.g. trough concentrations) or computed (e.g. by population PK analy sis model accounting for dose modifications or dose interruptions up to the day prior to the day of assessments ). Derived PK parameters will be used for exposure -response analysis by logistic regression or other methods."

This will allow for comparison of the exposure of 10 mg BID in the SR cGvHD population to the known exposure in other indications at the same dose level. The data will also be ex plored in the context of concomitant medications. However in this study there will be no comparison between the ruxolitinib treatment arm and the BAT treatment arm since there is no PK collected for BAT. 10.8 Sample size calculation The sample size calculation is based on the primary variable ORR onCycle 7 Day 1 . In a meta- analysis Olivieri et al. (Lancet Hematology 2015 ) obtained an estimated pooled effect size for ORR for systemic treatment of SR-cGvHD of 0·66 (95% CI 0·62–0·70). However, as most studies in this analysis did not use objective response criteria it can be expected that application of the NIH Consensus to assess ORR on Cycle 7 Day 1would lead to lower response rates. Sample size calculations were performed to achieve 90% power for different scenarios (Table 10 - 3), assuming a targeted odds ratio of 2.35 and 2.5, respectively. A sample size of 324 patients is considered as reasonable for this study ."
132,page_132,"Novartis Confidential Page 132of 178 Amended Protocol Version 02 ( Clean ) Protocol No . CINC424D2301 With sample size 162 patients in each treatment arm and assuming that the assumptions made for sample size calculations are correct (e.g. ORR=0.66 on Cycle 7 Day 1for BAT for each stratum) an observed odds ratio greater than or equal to 1.68 would achieve statistical significance. Table 10-3 Sample size for different scenarios BAT ORR Ruxolitinib ORR Odds ratio1 Total sample size* 0.58 0.775 2.5 N=247 0.62 0.803 2.5 N=265 0.66 0.829 2.5 N=289 0.58 0.764 2.35 N=278 0.62 0.793 2.35 N=298 0.66 0.820 2.35 N=324 *based on stratified CMH test with one-sided alpha=2.5% (assuming same ORR and 50% of patients in each stratum) 10.9 Power for analy sis of key secondary variables The 6-month FFS estimate based on published work is expected to be 0.56 ( Inamoto 2013). It is assumed that treatment with ruxolitinib might reduce the risk of FFS with expected hazard ratio = 0.64 (considering a 6 months FFS rate of 0.69 for ruxolitinib and 0.56 for BAT). To ensure 90% power for a one-sided log rank test with α=2.5% significance level a total numbers of 212 FFS events would be required. Assuming that enrolment will continue for18 months with increasing enrolment during the first 6 months and at a uniform rate about 20 patients per month thereafter, a total of N=312 patients would needed to be randomized to observe the targeted 212 FFS events at about 25 months after the randomi zation date of the first patient. Thus the targeted sample size of N=324 patients is considered adequate for the analysis of FFS. 11 Ethical considerations and administrative procedures 11.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance This clinical study was designed, shall be implemented and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC and US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21), and with the ethic al principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. 11.2 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC/REB The protocol and the proposed informed consent form must be reviewed and approved by a properl y constituted Institutional Review Board/I ndependent Ethics Committee/Research Ethics Board (IRB/IEC/REB) before study start.

CINC424D2301 14.4 Appendix 4: Guidelines for response assessment in cGvHD 14.4.1 Introduction and scope The response assessment described in this appendix is based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guideline to measure ‘therapeutic response in Chronic Graft -versus- Host Disease’ published by Lee et al (2015). These response criteria will be referred to as NIH criteria. The objective of this appendix is to provide details on the implementation of the NIH criteria in study CINC424D2301. 14.4.2 Efficacy Assessments -Organ specific response at one time point Chronic Graft -versus- Host Disease may impact different organs. The involvement of each organ needs to be assessed at baseline and response will be assessed at each pre -specified post - baseline visit (e.g. at Cy cle 7 day 1 for the primary endpoint ORR response at month 6) during the study . Response determination for all organs is defined in Table 4 of the published NIH response criteria (Lee 2015). For an overall response assessment it is required to assess the status of all organs at each time point, including those organs which are not involved at baseline. Table 14-3 below display s the NIH response criteria by organ and introduces the response category ‘unchanged/no involvement’ which is in line with the published NIH criteria. Further details and examples for the assessment of liver, lung, joints and fascia and skin are given in the text below. 14.4.2.1 Liver Liver response assessment is based on the following biochemistry lab parameters: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) , alkaline phosphatase (AP) and total bilirubin (BILI) . Observed lab values and corresponding ULN at baseline should be documented. Observed post- baseline values will be compared to observed baseline values in order to determine the liver response for the post-baseline visit. The steps to apply the rules per NIH criteria and some examp les are display ed in Figure 1 4-1, Figure 14-2 and Figure 14-3. Example 1 (Figure 14 -2): At baseline ALT and AP are increased (> ULN ) and BILI is within the normal range. At the post-baseline visit ALT and BILI are within the normal ranges and the value ofAP decreased from baseline by 56%: Therefore, the liver response for this visit is assessed as ‘partial response (PR)’ Example 2 ( Figure 14 - 3): At baseline Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) is increased (> ULN), whereas ALT and BILI are within the normal range. At the post-baseline visit all 3 parameters are increased (> ULN) but the absolute increase for each of the parameters is less than the corresponding value of 2 x ULN. Therefore, the week 4 liver response is considered as ‘unchanged’ from baseline."
