Synopsis Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ravulizumab in Complement-Inhibitor- Naïve Adult Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Short Title: Safety and Efficacy Study of Ravulizumab in Adults With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Rationale: Ravulizumab (ALXN1210) was engineered from eculizumab (h5G1.1-mAb), humanized monoclonal a ntibody that specifically binds with high affinity to the human terminal complement component (C5), inhibiting C5 enzymatic cleavage and thereby preventing the generation of the proinflammatory/prothrombotic complement activation products , C5a , and the cytolytic and proinflammatory/prothrombotic membrane attack complex, C5b -9, which are responsible for the antibody-mediated destruction of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), loss of acetylcholine receptors, and failure of neuromuscular transmission associated with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). Eculizumab is approved for the treatment of gMG, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in many countries worldwide, including Japan, the USA, and countries in the European Union under the trade name Soliris ®. Ravulizumab preserves immediate and complete C5 inhibition while providing sustained complement inhibition throughout a prolonged dosing interval; it was specifically designed (and has subsequently been proven) to have an i ncreased half -life relative to eculizumab. Therefore, ravulizumab requires less frequent (once every 8 weeks [q8w]) infusions than eculizumab ( once every 2 weeks [q2w] infusions). Given that gMG is a chronic disease with a significant treatment burden, the relative convenience of the ravulizumab dosing regimen may increase pat ient satisfaction and treatment adherence, and ultimately, lead to improved health outcomes. Ravulizumab was designed based on comprehensive modelling and simulation analyses to mainta in efficacious concentrations across an extended dosing interval. The enhanced pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic profile of ravulizumab, with fewer PK troughs than eculizumab, has the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy while maintaining a safety profile similar to that of eculizumab. Furthermore, the q8w dosing regimen minimizes the risk of incomplete complement inhibition."

16,page_16,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 17 of 109 Alexion Confidential Overall Design: This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel- group, placebo -controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ravulizumab for the treatment of patients with gMG. Approximately 160 eligible patients will be stratified by region (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Japan) and randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 treatment groups: (1) ravulizumab infusion or (2) placebo infusion. There will be 3 periods in this study: Screening Period, Randomized- Controlled Period, and an Open -Label Extens ion (OLE) Period. Eight weeks after the final dose of study drug is administered, all enrolled patients will return for an End of Study (EOS) Visit (Visit 25) at Week 132, during which final study assessments will be conducted. If a patient withdraws from the study or completes the study early because ravulizumab has become registered or approved (in accordance with country- specific regulations) prior to Visit 24, the patient will be encouraged to return for an Early Termination Visit, 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug was administered, during which final planned safety assessments will be conducted. Attempts should be made to follow all patients for safety for 8 weeks following the patient’s last dose of study drug. Patients being treated with an immunosuppressive therapy (IST) at the time of the Screening Visit may continue to receive ISTs throughout the Randomized-Controlled and OLE Periods. However, the dosage of IST must not be changed and no new ISTs may be added during the Randomized-Controlled Period of the study, unless deemed by the Investigator to be medically necessary. Throughout the study, rescue therapy (eg, high- dose corticosteroids, plasmapheresis/plasma exchange, or intravenous immunoglobulin) will be allowed if a patient experiences Clinical Deterioration, as defined by the study protocol. The rescue therapy used for a particular patient will be at the discretion of the Investigator. The primary endpoint for this study will be measured at Week 26. Endpoints will be measured and analyzed irrespective of rescue therapy. For those patients who complete the study, as defined in the protocol, the EOS Visit is defined as patient’s last visit in the (up to) 2 -year OLE Period. Including the 8- week safety follow -up, which begins after the patient’s last dose of study drug is administered, the overall study -duration for an individual patient is estimated to take up to 132 weeks (from enrollment through the end of the Safety Follow-up). The period of active patient -participatio n is estimated to take up to 132 weeks (from enrollment through the EOS Visit). Number of Patients : Patients will be screened until enough patients have been enrolled to achieve an est imated total of 160 patients, with approximately 80 patients per group. Intervention Groups and Duration: At the time of randomization, all patients will be reassessed for eligibility based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, have been vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis, within the timeframe specified in the inclusion criteria, and have been cleared for randomization by the Investigator will be randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 treatment groups: (1) ravulizumab infusion or (2) placebo"

The randomization will be stratified by region (North America, Europe, Asia- Pacific, and Japan). Patients randomized to the ravulizumab group will receive a blinded loading dose of ravulizumab on Day 1, followed by blinded maintenance doses of ravulizumab on Day 15 (Week 2) and q8w thereafter, for a total of 18 weeks of treatment. Patients randomized to placebo will receive a blinded dose of placebo on Day 1, followed by blinded doses of placebo on Day 15 (Week 2) and q8w thereafter, for a total of 18 weeks. Both ravulizumab and placebo will be administered by intravenous infusion. After the 26 -Week Randomized -Controlled Period and assessments on Day 183 (Week 26), patients in the placebo group will receive a blinded loading dose of ravulizumab and patients in the ravulizumab group will receive a blinded ravulizumab dose of 900 mg; the 900-mg dose was chosen to ensure maintenance of complete C5 inhibition until the next scheduled maintenance dose at Week 28 (Day 197). Starting at Week 28, all patients will begin open -label ravulizumab maintenance doses q8w. The OLE Period for each patient will commence whe n the patient receives a dose of ravulizumab on Week 26 (Day 183) and will continue for up to 2 years or until the product is registered or approved (in accordance with country- specific regulations), whichever occurs first.

Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare disorder, which based on studies conducted in Europe, has an estimated prevalence between 145 to 278 per million inhabitants (Cetin, 2012; Fang, 2015; Heldal, 2009). P atients with gMG suffer from a devastating inflammatory neuromuscular disorder with limited therapeutic options. Generalized myasthenia gravis patients differ from the ocular myasthenia gravis ( MG) population in that neuromuscular inflammation and the resu ltant clinical findings are not just limited to the ocular muscles, but involve all voluntary muscle groups: the bulbar, respiratory, head, neck, trunk, or peripheral muscles with or without involvement of the eyes. Profound weakness and devastating conseq uences, including slurred speech, dysarthria, dysphagia, disorienting vision, shortness of breath (both with activity and at rest), weakness of the upper and lower extremities, impaired mobility, marked reductions in the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), extreme fatigue, and episodes of pulmonary failure requiring mechanical ventilation are hallmarks of gMG. Compared with patients with isolated ocular MG, patients with gMG have a greater incidence of morbidities and a higher burden of di sease ( Engel -Nitz, 2018). Hospitalizations for gMG exacerbations are common, with the need for respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation secondary to respiratory failure (eg, myasthenic crisis) and gastrointestinal tube placement for nutrition al support and prevention of dysphagia- associated aspiration. Patients with more advanced gMG have been reported to experience increased mortality of up to 40% at 10 years following diagnosis (Christensen, 1998). 2.2. Background 2.2.1. Unmet Medical Need in Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis In difficult -to-control cases, patients with gMG experience unrelenting inflammation, tissue destruction, and consequent severe morbidities including profound muscle weakness, impaired mobility, shortness of breath, pulmonary failure, extreme fatigue, risk for aspiration, and markedly impaired ADLs (Sahashi, 1978; Silvestri, 2014; Suh, 2013). These patients are typically diagnosed in the prime of their adult lives, with a median age of onset ranging from 36 to 60 years (Suh, 2013) . As a result of the morbidities associated with gMG, many patients cann ot work or have diminished work- capacity, experience difficultl y caring for themselves and others, and require assistance speaking, eating, ambulating, breathing, and performing ADLs. 2.2.2. Role of Complement in Myasthenia Gravis Uncontrolled terminal complement activation has been implicated in animal models of experimental autoimmune gMG (Sahashi, 1978; Fitch, 1999; Dalakas, 2004; Keshavjee, 2005; Patel, 2005) as well as in other forms of autoimmune neuropathy in humans. Autoantibodies recognize targeted neural or muscle tissues, including the a cetylcholine receptor ( AChR), leading to uncontrolled terminal complement activation at the neural or muscle surface (Ha, 2015)."
26,page_26,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 27 of 109 Alexion Confidential Autoantibody- driven uncontrolled terminal complement activation with membrane attack complex (MAC) -dependent lysis and activation, and C5a- dependent inflammation at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) causes AChR loss and failure of neuromuscular transmission. Consistent with this model, both complement component (C) 3 (C3a and C3b) fragments and the MAC C5b -9 have been found in NMJs of MG patients (Sahashi, 1978). Taken together, the data support that uncontrolled terminal complement activation at the NMJ plays a role in the destruction of post -synaptic structure. Rapid, complete, and sustained inhibition of terminal complement activation is a biologically rational approach to prevent the damage caused in patients with gMG. 2.3. Study Rationale Ravulizumab (ALXN1210) was engineered from eculizumab (h5G1.1-mAb), a humanized monoclonal Ab (mAb) that specifically binds with high affinity to the human terminal C5, inhibiting C5 enzymatic cleavage and thereby preventing the generation of the proinflammatory/p rothrombotic mediators, such as MAC C5b -9, which are responsible for the inflammatory consequences of terminal complement activation. Eculizumab is approved for the treatment of gMG, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in many countries worldwide under the trade name Soliris ®. Ravulizumab preserves immediate and complete C5 inhibition while providing sustained complement inhibition throughout a prolonged dos ing interval; it was specifically designed (and has subsequently been proven) to have an increased half- life relative to eculizumab. Therefore, ravulizumab requires less frequent (once every 8 weeks [q8w]) infusions relative to eculizumab (once every 2 weeks [ q2w] infusions). Given that gMG is a chronic disease with a significant treatment burden, the relative convenience of the ravulizumab dosing regimen may increase patient satisfaction, increase treatment adherence, and ultimately, lead to improved health outcomes. Ravulizumab was designed based on comprehensive modelling and simulation analyses to maintain efficacious concentrations across a longer dosing interval. The enhanced pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of ravulizumab, with fewer PK troughs, than eculizumab, has the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy while maintaining a safety profile similar to that of eculizumab. Furthermore, the q8w dosing regimen minimizes the risk of incomplete complement inhibition. The infusion freque ncy is relatively low (6 infusions per year) ( Figure 1), which offers the potential for improved quality of life (QoL) through fewer missed days of work or school, better treatment adherence, and improved accessibility."
27,page_27,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 28 of 109 Alexion Confidential Figure 1: Ravulizumab Every 8 Weeks Dosage Regimen Versus Eculizumab Every 2 Weeks Dosage Regimen Ravulizumab offers a convenient dosing and immediate onset of action with effective and complete terminal complement inhibition at the end of the first infusion. Additionally, the dose regimen of ravulizumab has been optimized to reduce the exposure differences across the adult body-weight range by utilizing a weight-based dosing paradigm that provides immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition over the entire dosing interval. Therefore, ravulizumab minimizes the risk of inflammation, including C5a recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells as well as direct MAC -complex induced damage of the motor neural endplate (Kusner, 2008). The proposed rationale for the ravulizumab posology for the gMG indication is highly consistent with the approach used in dose- selection for eculizumab in the a HUS and gMG indications. 2.4. Benefit/Risk Assessment Ravulizumab provides patients and physicians with an option for less frequent dosing, which allows greater access to care for those patients who may not initiate treatment on eculizumab, may discontinue eculizumab due to frequency of dosing, or who are currently receiving eculizumab every 2 weeks. 2.4.1. Identified and Potential Risks 2.4.1.1. Identified Risk 2.4.1.1.1. Neisseria meningitidis Increased susceptibility to infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis (N meningitidis) is a known risk associated with complement inhibition. The main risk associated with ravulizumab is the risk of meningococcal infections. Specific risk mitigation measures are in place to address this risk, as described in Section 8.3.6. 2.4.1.2. Potential Risks 2.4.1.2.1. Immunogenicity Administration of any therapeutic protein, including ravulizumab, may induce an immunogenic response potentially resulting in antidrug antibodies (ADA).

Treatment- emergent ADAs have been observed in 3 healthy subjects treated with ravulizumab subcutaneous (SC) and 1 healthy subject treated with ravulizumab IV in Study ALXN1210 -HV-104. All ADA positive titer values were low and negative for ec ulizumab cross- reactivity. There was no apparent impact of immunogenicity on the PK or PD of ravulizumab. More information about the immunogenicity of ravulizumab may be found in the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). Monitoring of immunogenicity for this study will be conducted as described in Section 1.3 and Section 8.2.4.3. 2.4.1.2.2. Local and Systemic Reactions Protein therapies administered IV have the potential risk of causing local (infusion -site reactions) and systemic reactions (infusion- associated reactions). Infusion -site reactions are those localized to the site of IV drug administration and may include reactions such as erythema, pruritus, and bruising. Infusion- associated reactions are those which are systemic in nature and which may be immune or nonimmune -mediated, generally occurring within hours of drug administration. Immune -mediated reactions may include allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis), while nonimmune- mediated reactions are nonspecific (eg, headache, dizziness, nausea). Monitoring for these reactions will be conducted as part of routine safety assessments for this study (Section 8.3.7). 2.4.1.2.3. Pregnancy Exposure No studies of ravulizumab have been conducted in pregnant women. Pregnant or nursing patients will be excluded from the clinical study. Patients enrolled in the study, and their spouses/partners, will use a highly effective or acceptable method of contraception as required in Section 10.4 (Appendix 4). In the event of a pregnancy, the patient will be discontinued from study drug ( Section 7). More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events of ravulizumab may be found in the IB."

Overall Design This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel- group, placebo -controlled, multicenter study to eva luate the safety and efficacy of ravulizumab for the treatment in patients with gMG. Approximately 160 eligible patients will be stratified by region (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Japan) and randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 treatment groups: (1) ravuli zumab infusion or (2) placebo infusion. There will be 3 periods in this study: Screening Period, Randomized- Controlled Period, and an Open -Label Extension (OLE) Period. After the 26 -Week Randomized -Controlled Period and assessments on Day 183 (Week 26), patients in the placebo group will receive a blinded loading dose of ravulizumab and patients in the ravulizumab group will receive a blinded ravulizumab dose of 900 mg. Starting Week 28, all patients will begin open-label ravulizumab maintenance doses q8w. For patients in the ravulizumab group, a blinded ravulizumab dose of 900 mg was chosen to ensure maintenance of complete C5 inhibition until the next scheduled maintenance dose at Week 28 (Day 197). Eight weeks after the final dose of study drug is administered, all enrolled patients will return for an End of Study (EOS) Visit (Visit 25) at Week 132 during which final study assessments will be conducted. If a patient withdraws from the study, or completes the study early (prior to Visit 24; Week 124), the patient will be encouraged to return for an Early Termination (ET)/EOS Visit, 8 weeks after the day the last dose of study drug was administered, during which final planned safety assessments will be conducted (see Section 4.5 for further details regarding end of study and study completion). Attempts should be made to follow all patients for safety for 8 weeks from the day the last dose of study drug is administered. Patients who are being treated with an immunosuppressive therapy (IST) at the time of the Screening Visit may continue taking their baseline ISTs throughout the Randomized-Controlled and OLE Periods. However, the dosage of IST must not be changed and no new ISTs may be added or discontinued during the Randomized-Controlled Period of the study, unless deemed by the Investigator to be medically necessary. Throughout the study, rescue therapy (eg, high-dose corticosteroid, plasmapheresis ( PP)/plasma exchange ( PE), or intravenous immunoglobulin [ IVIg ]) will be allowed if a patient experiences Clinical Deterioration as defined in this protocol (Section 4.2.1). The rescue therapy used for a particular patient will be at the discretion of the Investigator. The primary endpoint for this study will be measured at Week 26 (Day 183), irrespective of rescue therapy. Including the 8- week safety follow -up, which begins after the last dose of study drug is administered, the overall study duration for an individual patient is estimated to take up to 132 weeks (from enrollment through the end of the Safety Follow-up). The period of active patient -participatio n is estimated to take up to 132 weeks (from enrollment through the EOS Visit). Schedules of Activities (SOA) for the Randomized -Controlled Period and the OLE Period are provided in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively."

Screening Period (2 - 4 Weeks Prior to Day 1) At the screening visit, after obtaining informed consent, the patient will be screened for study eligibility through medical history review, demographic data, and laboratory assessments. The medical history review will include MG diagnosis date; initial MG clinical presentation (ocular MG [ oMG] or gMG); time to gMG, if initial clinical presentation was oMG; maximum MGFA classification since diagnosis; ventilatory support since diagnosis; dates of MG exacerbation or crisis since diagnosis and prior to Day 1; and any MG- related hospitalizations in 2 years prior to screening. MG -specific medication or therapy (eg, thymectomy, ISTs including corticosteroids, IVIg, and PE/PP) within 2 years prior to screening will be recorded. If all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are met, patients will be vaccinated against N meningitidis, if not already vaccinated within the 3 years prior to their enrollment in the study. Patients who initiate study drug treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination . If a patient experiences a Clinical Deterioration or MG Crisis during the Screening Period, the Sponsor must be notified. 4.1.2. Randomization At the time of randomization, all patients will be reassessed for eligibility based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients who are vaccinated, continue to meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at Randomization [Day 1]), and have been cleared for randomization by the Investigator, will be randomized 1:1 to the ravulizumab group or the placebo group. Patients will be centrally randomized using interactive response technology (IRT). The randomization will be stratified by region (North America, Europe, Asia -Pacific, and Japan) . 4.1.3. Randomized Controlled Period (26 Weeks) Throughout the study, rescue therapy (eg, high-dose corticosteroid, PE /PP, or IVIg) will be allowed when a patient’s health would be in jeopardy if rescue therapy was not administered (eg, emergent situations), or if a patient experiences Clinical Deterioration as defined in this protocol. The rescue therapy used for a particular patient will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Patients must be informed of potential signs and symptoms of Clinical Deterioration or MG Crisis and instructed to contact the Investigator to be evaluated within 48 hours of notification of the Investigator of the symptom onset. At the evaluation visit, the Investigator or the Investigator’s designee will perform the assessments as specified by this protocol. The Investigator or designee will determine whether or not the patient meets the definition of Clinical Deterioration as defined by this protocol in Section 4.2.1 and treat the patient accordingly. The primary endpoint for this study will be measured at Week 26 (Day 183), irrespective of rescue therapy. See the SOA for further details regarding visit procedures throughout the study ( Section 1.3)."

Open- Label Extension Period After the 26 -Week Randomized -Controlled Period and assessments on Day 183 (Week 26), patients in the placebo group will receive a blinded loading dose of ravulizumab and patients in the ravulizumab group will receive a blinded ravulizumab dose of 900 mg; the 900-mg dose was chosen to ensure maintenance of complete C5 inhibition until the next scheduled maintenance dose at Week 28 (Day 197). Starting at Week 28, all patients will begin open -label ravulizumab maintenance doses q8w. The OLE Period for each pa tient will commence when the patient receives a dose of ravulizumab on Week 26 (Day 183) and will continue for up to 2 years or until the product is registered or approved (in accordance with country- specific regulations), whichever occurs first. 4.2. Standard Protocol Definitions 4.2.1. Clinical Deterioration For this protocol, Clinical Deterioration is defined as any of the following: 1. Patients who experience an MG Crisis, which is defined as weakness from MG that is severe enough to necessitate intubation or to delay extubation following surgery. The respiratory failure is due to weakness of respiratory muscles. Severe bulbar (oropharyngeal) muscle weakness often accompanies the respiratory muscle weakness, or may be the predominant feature in some patients; or, 2. Significant symptomatic worsening to a score of 3 or a 2-point worsening from Baseline on any one of the individual MG -Activities of Daily Living (MG -ADL ) items other than double vision or eyelid droop; or, 3. Administration of rescue therapy to a patient whose, in the opinion of the Investigator or Investigator-designated physician, health would be in jeopardy, if rescue therapy were not given (eg, emergent situations). 4.2.2. Unscheduled Visits Under exceptional circumstances, additional (unscheduled) visits outside th e specified visits are permitted at the discretion of the Investigator. Procedures, tests, and assessments will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator and efforts will be made to map the corresponding data to the appropriate visit as described in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ) completion guidelines and training materials . 4.2.3. Properly Trained Clinical Evaluator Properly Trained Clinical Evaluators are study staff that have been certified in administering the MG-ADL, QMG, and Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) assessments. Only Properly Trained Clinical Evaluators may administer these assessments. A Properly Trained Clinical Evaluator may be a neurologist, physical therapist, or other study team member delegated by the Investiga tor. Only the Investigator or a neurologist may perform the manual muscle test (MMT), components of the MGC, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America- Post-Interventional Status (MGFA -PIS), and Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America ( MGFA ) Classificatio n."
33,page_33,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 34 of 109 Alexion Confidential Clinical Evaluator training and certification for this protocol will take place either at the Investigator’s Meeting or via the Sponsor’s designated on- line training portal. 4.2.4. Responsibilities for Myasthenia Gravis Assessments Responsibilities for MG assessments are listed in Table 3. Throughout the study, MG assessments should be performed at approximately the same time of day by a Properly Trained Clinical Evaluator, and preferably the same evaluator. The MG -ADL should always be performed first, followed by the QMG. Table 3: Myasthenia Gravis Assessments and Responsibilities Assessment Evaluator MG-ADL Properly Trained Clinical Evaluator QMG Properly Trained Clinical Evaluator MGC Properly Trained Clinical Evaluator MGC (MMT Components) Investigator or Neurologist MGFA -PIS (modified version) Investigator or Neurologist MGFA Classification Investigator or Neurologist Abbreviations: MG -ADL = Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living Profile; MGC = Myasthenia Gravis Composite scale; MGFA = Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America; MGFA -PIS = Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of A merica Post -Intervention Status; MMT = manual muscle test; QMG = Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score for disease severity. 4.3. Scientific Rationale for Study Design Published data support the MG- ADL profile as an established, sensitive, and objective assessment of treatment response over time in patients with gMG (Howard, 2017). The safety parameters being evaluated are commonly used in clinical studies per International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH ) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidance. Placebo was selected as the control and patients will be allowed to continue stable therapy with standard of care therapy (ie, ISTs) throughout the course of the study, which thereby allows for comparison of the safety and efficacy of ravulizumab when administered in addition to the patient’s standard of care treatment to current standard of care therapies in patients with gMG. Given the heterogeneity of the disease and fluctuation in the severity of symptoms, there is no 1 international standard of care accepted, and targeted treatment with complement -inhibitor drugs, such as the recently introduced eculizumab, is not yet widely available to patients worldwide and is not yet considered standard of care for all p atients with gMG. A placebo -controlled study allows for the evaluation of treatment effect and allows for a double-blind design; an important study condition to be maintained when considering endpoints that includes neurological scales, which are known to be especially prone to placebo effects. The placebo -controlled part of the study will be limited to 26 weeks, after which time all patients will transition to open-label treatment with ravulizumab for up to 2 years during the OLE Period. At all points thro ughout the study, physicians will be encouraged to prioritize patient safety, and if patients experience Clinical Deterioration, the full range of rescue therapies will be permitted."
34,page_34,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 35 of 109 Alexion Confidential 4.4. Justification for Dose The r avulizumab dosage regimen for this study (Table 4) was approved for the treatment of adult patients with PNH based on comprehensive modelling and simulation analyses of Phase 1 and 2 PK/PD data in healthy volunteers and PK/PD/efficacy (lactate dehydrogenase) and safety data in patients with PNH . This regimen is considered optimal for achieving immediate, complete , sustained inhibition of terminal complement activity within each dosing interval and for the entire treatment course in adult patients. Table 4: Ravulizumab Weight- Based Dosing Weight (kg) Loading Dose (mg) Mainten ance Dose (mg) (administered q8w) ≥ 40 to < 60 2400 3000 ≥ 60 to < 100 2700 3300 ≥ 100 3000 3600 Abbreviation: q8w = every 8 weeks. Consistent with approved eculizumab labeling for treating adult and pediatric patients with aHUS and adult patients with gMG, supplemental dosing of ravulizumab in the amount of 50% (rounded up if not in integral of 300 mg due to vial configuration) will be given in the setting of concomitant PE /PP rescue therapy. For adult patients with gMG, supplemental dosing of ravulizumab (in the amount of 600 mg) will be given in the setting of concomitant IVIg rescue therapy. The 600 mg supplemental ravulizumab dose has been selected based on PK simulations considering the publishe d data describing the impact of co- administration of IVIg on eculizumab PK/PD ( Fitzpatrick, 2011) (see Table 7 and Table 8). Supplemental study drug (or placebo) dosing is required if PE/PP or IVIg rescue therapy is provided on non-dosing days; no supplemental study drug (or placebo) dosing is required if PE/PP o r IVIg infusion is provided on a dosing day, but it must occur prior to study drug administration. If PE/PP or IVIg is administered on scheduled dosing visits, regular dosing will be started within 60 minutes after the completion of PE/PP or IVIg. If PE/PP or IVIg is administered on non-scheduled dosing visits, for patients receiving PE/PP: supplemental dose administration will be started within 4 hours after the PE/PP session is completed; for patients receiving IVIg: supplemental dose administration will be started within 4 hours after the last continuous session(s) of IVIg is completed (see Section 6.5.1.4). The favorable benefit/risk profiles of ravul izumab from the Phase 3 studies in patients with PNH have confirmed immediate (after the first dose or loading dose), complete (free C5 < 0.5 µg/mL) and sustained (throughout entire active treatment course) terminal complement inhibition under the above in vestigated dosage regimen. Based on the totality of PK, PD, ADA, efficacy, and safety data obtained from the ravulizumab development program, the above body weight- based dosage regimen for treating adult patients with PNH may also be beneficial in treating patients with gMG. After the 26 -Week Randomized -Controlled Period and assessments on Day 183 (Week 26), patients in the placebo group will receive a blinded loading dose of ravulizumab and patients in the ravulizumab group will receive a blinded ravulizumab dose of 900 mg; the 900-mg dose was chosen to ensure maintenance of complete C5 inhibition until the next scheduled maintenance"
35,page_35,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 36 of 109 Alexion Confidential dose at Week 28 (Day 197). Starting at Week 28 (Day 197), all patients will begin open- label ravulizumab maintenance doses q8w. The proposed q8w dosage regimen will facilitate studying a range of PK drug exposures useful in assessing ravulizumab exposure-response relationships in patients with gMG. Safety and tolerability of ravulizumab have been established over a wide range of P K exposures, including those expected under the proposed gMG dosage regimens, in healthy volunteers and patients. 4.5. End of Study Definition A patient is considered to have completed the study if: • The patient has completed all periods of the study including the last visit of the OLE Period, or • In the event the study is completed early, the patient has completed all applicable periods of the study including the EOS visit • The patient completes the study early (and completes the EOS Visit) because the study drug has become registered or approved (in accordance with country -specific regulations) Measurement of the primary endpoints will be complete after the last visit of the last patient in the Randomized-Controlled Period. The EOS is defined as the date of the l ast visit of the last patient in the study or last scheduled procedure shown in the SoA ( Section 1.3) for the last patient in the study globally. The study completion date corresponds to the last visit when the final patient in the study is examined or received an intervention for the primary or secondary endpoints and AEs."

Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability Study drug will be released to the site upon receipt of all required essential documents based upon federal, state, and local regulations. Only patients enrolled in the study may receive study drug and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study drug. All study drug must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator and authorized site staff. The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliat ion, and final disposition records). 6.2.1. Study Drug Preparation Study drug will be prepared and administered by a trained member of the site study team. Study drug is to be administered only to enrolled patients who are confirmed eligible for participation. Preparation of ravulizumab and placebo doses must be performed in accordance with study center -specific local standards by qualified and study- trained pharmacy personnel. The handling and preparation of materials used to prepare and administer the study drug must be carried out using aseptic techniques for sterile products. All study patients, investigative-site personnel, Sponsor staff, Sponsor designees, and all staff directly associated with the conduct of the study will be blinded to patient treatment assignments. Further details on preparation and dose administration of study drug, as well as disposal of study drug, can be found in the pharmacy manual. 6.2.2. Storage The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study drugs received and that any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study drug. Upon arrival at the investigative site, the study drug should be promptly removed from the shipping cooler and stored in refrigerated conditions at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). The pharmacist should immediately record the receipt of the study drug and notify the distributor if vials are damaged and/or if temperature excursions have occurred during transportation. Study drug must be stored in a secure, limited -access storage area and temperature must be monitored daily. Diluted solutions of study drug may be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours prior to administration. The solution should be allowed to warm to room temperature prior to administration. The admixed drug product should be at room temperature prior to administration. The material must not be heated (eg, by using a microwave or other heat source) other than by ambient air temperature."
42,page_42,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 43 of 109 Alexion Confidential Please con sult the pharmacy manual for further information regarding the storage conditions of reconstituted ravulizumab. 6.2.3. Packaging and Labeling The primary packaging of ravulizumab consists of a 30- mL vial (Type I borosilicate glass) with a stopper and a seal. The secondary packaging consists of a single vial carton. Both primary (vial) and secondary (carton) packaging include a booklet label with relevant information. Additional details are presented in Table 5 and in the Pharmacy Manual. The placebo will have an identical appearance to that of ravulizumab. 6.2.4. Accountability When a drug shipment is received at the site, the pharmacist should verify the contents, sign the packing invoice provided with the shipment, and maintain the original copy for review by the site monitor in the pharmacy binder. Additionally, study drug receipt (as well as condition of the study drug at the time of receipt) must be re ported to the IRT system to allow drug randomization, resupply, estimations, and drug expiration control. Unless notified otherwise, empty vials and vials with residual materials should be kept for inspection and accountability by the study monitor prior to their destruction or handled per local pharmacy standard operating procedures for clinical study drugs. Destruction of used and unused vials, either locally or centrally, must be properly documented. Drug accountability will be managed through the IRT system and detailed instructions on managing the IRT drug accountability module will be included in the IRT User Guide. The IRT module will perform accountability in two stages, where site personnel will complete an initial accountability entry in the system followed by confirmation by the Study Monitor that the site has correctly entered the appropriate status for all study drug. The pharmacist or designee must maintain accurate records demonstrating dates and amount of study drug received, to whom dispensed (patient- by-patient accounting), and accounts of any study drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed. These drug accountability records must be readily available upon request, and will be reviewed throughout the study. Each kit will have a label and a p lace for the pharmacist to record the patient number and initials. The study monitor will examine the inventory during the study. Additionally, the inventory records must be readily available to regulatory authorities, the local regulatory agency, or an independent auditor’s inspection at any time. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional information . 6.2.5. Handling and Disposal All clinical study material provided to the Investigator will be stored in a secure place, and allocated and dispensed by appropriately trained personnel. Detailed records of the amounts of the study drug received, dispensed, and destroyed will be maintained. To satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all remaining ravulizumab inventory will be reconciled and destroyed or returned to Alexion at the end of the study according to applicable regulations."

Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 6.3.1. Randomization Patients will be randomized on Day 1 after the Investigator has verified that they are eligible. Patients will be stratified by region (North America, Europe, Asia -Pacific, and Japan) and randomized 1:1 either to ravulizumab IV infusion or to placebo IV infusion. Patients will be centrally randomized using IRT. 6.3.2. Blinding All investigative site personnel, Sponsor staff, Sponsor designees, staff directly associated with the conduct of the study, and all patients will be blinded to patient treatment assignments. The double- blind will be maintained by u sing identical study drug kits and labels for ravulizumab and placebo. The placebo will have an identical appearance to that of ravulizumab. The random ization code will be maintained by the IRT provider. After the 26 -Week Randomized - Controlled Period and a ssessments on Day 183 (Week 26), patients in the placebo group will receive a blinded loading dose of ravulizumab and patients in the ravulizumab group will receive a blinded ravulizumab dose of 900 mg. Starting at Week 28, all patients will begin open- label ravulizumab maintenance doses q8w. For patients in the ravulizumab group, a blinded ravulizumab dose of 900 mg was chosen to ensure maintenance of complete C5 inhibition until the next scheduled maintenance dose at Week 28 (Day 197). Unblinding should only be considered for the safety of the patient. If unblinding is deemed necessary by the Investigator, the Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to contact the Sponsor to discuss possible unblinding. After a reasonable attempt has been made, the Investigator can unblind the patient’s treatment allocation using an IRT. The Investigator must note the date, time, and reason for unblinding. The Investigator should also inform the Medical Monitor that the patient was unblinded; however, they should not reveal to the Medical Monitor the patients’ treatment allocation. When an adverse event ( AE) is an unexpected or related and serious, the blind will be broken for that specific patient only. The blind will be maintained for persons responsible for the ong oing conduct of the study (such as the management, monitors, Investigators, etc.) and those responsible for data analysis and interpretation of results, such as biometrics personnel. Unblinded information will only be accessible to those who need to be involved in the safety reporting to Health Authorities, Independent Ethics Committees ( IECs ), and/or Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ). Any patient who is unblinded during the Randomized-Controlled P eriod will be discontinued from the study. Investigators will receive only blinded information unless unblinded information is judged necessary for safety reasons."

Concomitant Therapy Prior medications (including vitamins and herbal preparations), including those discussed in the exclusion criteria (Section 5.2) and procedures (any therapeutic intervention, such as surgery/biopsy or physical therapy) the patient takes or undergoes within 28 days prior to the start of screening until the first dose of study drug, will be recorded in the patient’s eCRF. In addition, history of meningococcal vaccination must be collected for the 3 years prior to first dose of study drug. MG -specific medication or therapy (eg, thymectomy, ISTs including corticosteroids, IVIg, and PE/PP) within 2 years prior to screening will be recorded . All medication use and procedures undertaken during the study will be recorded in the patient’s source document/medical chart and eCRF. This record will include all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, over- the-counter medications, and any other current medications. Concomitant medications will be recorded from th e first infusion of study drug through 8 weeks after the patient’s last dose of study drug. Any changes in concomitant medications also will be recorded in the patient’s source document/medical chart and eCRF. Any concomitant medication deemed necessary fo r the patient’s standard of care during the study, or for the treatment of any AE, along with any other medications, other than those listed as prohibited medications in Section 6.5.1.5 may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding all medications are recorded in full in the patient’s source document/medical cha rt and eCRF. 6.5. Study Drug Compliance Study drug will be administered in a controlled setting under the supervision of the Investigator or designee, thereby ensuring compliance with study drug administration. 6.5.1. Allowed Medications 6.5.1.1. Palliative and Supportive Care Palliative and supportive care is permitted during the course of the study for underlying conditions. The medications described in the following sections are allowed under certain circumstances and restrictions. 6.5.1.2. Cholinesterase Inhibitors For patients who enter the study receiving a cholinesterase inhibitor at screening, the dose and schedule of their cholinesterase inhibitor should be maintained stable throughout the entire Randomized-Controlled and OLE Periods, unless there is compelling medical need. Increases in cholinesterase therapy that are required as a result of intercurrent illness or other medical cause of deterioration are permitted, but dosing should be returned to dosing levels at study entry as soon as feasible and the Sponsor should be notified of the change. 1. Cholinesterase inhibitor treatment must be withheld for at least 10 hours prior to administration of the QMG and MGC tests. 2. If a decrease in cholinesterase inhibitor is considered based on clinical evaluation, Sponsor approval must be obtained prior to the change in dose."

Immunosuppressive Agents The following immunosuppressive agents are allowed during the study: corticosteroid, AZA, MMF, MTX, TAC, CYC, or CY. The immunosuppressive agent(s) and its appropriate dose level to be used for an individual patient will be at the discretion of the treating physician/Investigator. 1. Corticosteroid: for patients who enter the study receiving oral corticosteroid, eg, prednisone, the dose/schedule may not be changed during the entire double-blind study period (ie, the Randomized- Controlled Period). If a decrease or taper in steroid dose is considered during the Randomized-Controlled Period based on clinical evaluation, Sponsor approval must be obtained prior to the change in order for the patient to remain on study. If the dose level subsequently must be increased, the dose level increase cannot be above the dose level reported at the baselin e (at the start of randomized treatment). 2. High -dose steroid should be reserved for patients that experience Clinical Deterioration as defined by this protocol. Every effort should be made to notify the Sponsor within 24 hours of administration should a pa tient require rescue therapy for Clinical Deterioration. 3. AZA, MMF, MTX, TAC, CYC, or CY: for patients who enter the study receiving above mentioned immunosuppressive agents, the dosing regimen of the immunosuppressive agent may not be changed during the e ntire Randomized -Controlled Period. If a change in the dosing regimen is considered due to known toxicity or side effects associated with the given immunosuppressive agent, Sponsor approval must be obtained prior to the dose change. A different immunosuppressive agent cannot be added or substituted during the 26-week Randomized -Controlled Period. 6.5.1.4. Plasma Exchange/Plasmapheresis/Intravenous Immunoglobulin Use of PE/PP or IVIg (acute use only) will be allowed for patients who experience a Clinical Deterioratio n as defined by this protocol. The rescue therapy used for a particular patient will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Every effort should be made to notify the Sponsor within 24 hours should a patient require rescue therapy. Supplemental study drug (or placebo) dosing is required if PE/PP or IVIg re scue therapy is provided on nondosing days; if PE/PP or IVIg infusion is provided on a dosing day, it must occur prior to study drug administration. 1. If PE/PP or IVIg is administered on nonscheduled dosing visits: a. Patients receiving PE/PP: supplemental dose administration will be started within 4 hours after the PE/PP session is completed (Table 7) b. Patients receiving IVIg: supplemental dose administration will be started within 4 hours after the last continuous session(s) of IVIg is completed (Table 8) 2. If PE/PP or IVIg is administered on scheduled dosing visits : a. Regular dosing will be started within 4 hours after the completion of PE/PP or IVIg 3.

Discontinuation of Study Intervention A patient may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. If a patient discontinues treatment from the study, the Investigator will attempt to perform (if the patient agrees) assessments specified for the ET Visit, or if not possible, a follow -up phone call to be conducted 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug has been administered (SoA, Section 1.3). Attempts should also be made to follow all patients for safety for a total of 8 weeks from the day the last dose of study drug is administered. The Sponsor and site monitor will be notified as soon as possible. If a patient is withdrawn from the study or withdraws consent no further data will be collected. Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. Patients should be discontinued from study drug if any of the following occur during the study: 1. Serious hypersensitivity reaction (such as bronchospasm with wheezing or requiring ventilator support or symptomatic hypotension, refer to Section 10.5 [Appendix 5]) or serum sickness-like reactions manifesting 1 to 14 days after study drug administration; 2. Severe uncontrolled infection; 3. Pregnancy or planned pregnancy; or 4. Sponsor or Investigator deems it is in the best interest of the patient. 5. Use of ri tuximab, eculizumab (or other complement- inhibitors) The Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor prior to discontinuing a patient from study drug. If a patient discontinues from treatment, the patient should be encouraged to return for the ET Visit (SoA, Section 1.3) 8 weeks after the patient’s last dose of study drug. The reason for the treatment discontinuation (ie, patient withdraws consent, patient withdrawal from procedures, physician decision, AE, or other reason specified in eCRF) will be recorded in the eCRF. If a female patient is permanently discontinued from study drug due to pregnancy, the Investigator will make a reasonable attempt to follow -up, in accordance with local laws and regulations, until the outcome of the pregnancy is known ( Section 10.4 [Appendix 4]). If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue to use all data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a patient withdraws from the study, the patient may request destruction of any samples tak en and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records as well as inform the site monitor and Sponsor. 7.2. Lost to Follow Up A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site."
50,page_50,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 51 of 109 Alexion Confidential The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: 1. The site must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the patient wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 2. Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patie nt’s medical record. 3. Should the patient continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have withdrawn consent and future missed visits will not be considered protocol deviations."

Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living Profile The MG -ADL is an 8 -point questionnaire that focuses on relevant symptoms and functional performance of ADL in patients with MG (Section 10.6 [Appendix 6] ). The 8 items of the MG-ADL questionnaire were derived from symptom-based components of the original 13- item QMG scale to assess disability secondary to ocular (2 items), bulbar (3 items), respiratory (1 item), and gross motor or limb (2 items) impairment related to effects from MG. In this functional status instrument, each response is graded 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe). The range of total MG -ADL score is 0 - 24. The recall period for MG- ADL is the p receding 7 days. The MG- ADL profile should be administered by a properly trained evaluator. For consistency, the same evaluator should administer the questionnaire throughout the study. 8.1.4. Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score The QMG scoring system consists o f 13 items: ocular (2 items), facial (1 item), bulbar (2 items), gross motor (6 items), axial (1 item), and respiratory (1 item); each graded 0 to 3, with 3 being the most severe ( Section 10.7 [Appendix 7]). The range of total QMG score is 0 - 39. The QMG scoring system is considered to be an objective evaluation of therapy for MG and is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups. The MGFA task force has recommended that the QMG score be used in prospective studies of therapy for MG (Benatar, 2012). 8.1.5. Myasthenia Gravis Composite Score The MGC is a validated assessment tool for measuring clinical status of patients with MG. The range of tota l MGC score is 0 - 50. The MGC assesses 10 important functional areas most frequently affected by MG and the scales are weighted for clinical significance that incorporates patient -reported outcomes (Burns, 2010) ( Section 10.8 [Appendix 8]). 8.1.6. Euro Quality of Life 5D -5L The Euro Quality of Life- 5L (EQ -5D-5L) (Section 10.9 [Appendix 9]) is a self -assessed, health -related QoL questionnaire. The scale measures QoL on a 5 -component scale including mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each level is rated on a scale that describes the degree of problems in that area (ie, I have no problems walking about, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, or unable to walk). This tool also has an overall health scale where the rater selects a number between 1 - 100 to describe the condition of their health, 100 being the best imaginable. Convergent validity was demonstrated by a correlation between EQ-5D-5L and the dimensions of World Health Organization 5 Well Being questionnaires , (r = 0.43, p < 0.001) (Janssen, 2013). The EQ -5D- 5L approach is reliable, average test -retest reliability using interclass coefficients with mean of 0.78 and 0.73 (Brooks, 1996; Chaudhury, 2006). 8.1.7. Revised Myasthenia Gravis Qualify of Life -15 Scale The revised Myasthenia Gravis Qualify of Life 15 -item scale (MG -QOL15r) ( Section 10.10 [Appendix 10 ]) is a health -related QoL evaluative instrument specific to patients with MG. The MG-QOL15r was designed to provide information about patients’ perception of impairment and disability, determine the degree to which disease manifestations are tolerated, and to be"
54,page_54,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 55 of 109 Alexion Confidential administered and interpreted easily ( Burns, 2016). The MG-QOL15r will be completed by the patient. Higher scores indicate greater extent of and dissatisfaction with MG -related dysfunction. 8.1.8. Neurological Quality of Life Fatigue The Neuro- QOL Fatigue is a reliable and validated brief 19 -item survey of fatigue, completed by the patient (Cella, 2010). H igher scores indicate greater fatigue and greater impact of MG on activities (Section 10.11 [Appe ndix 11]). 8.1.9. Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Classification The MGFA Clinical Classification will be assessed on Day 1 ( Section 10.12 [Appendix 12]). 8.1.10. Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Post- Intervention Status The MG clinical state will be assessed using a modified version of the MGFA -PIS (Section 10.13 [Appendix 13]). Change in status categories of Improved, Unchanged, or Worse, as well as the minimal manifestation (MM) will be assessed and recorded at the time poin ts indicated in the SoA ( Section 1.3) by the Investigator or the same neurologist skilled in the evaluation of patients with MG throughout the study. The subscores of MM, ie, MM -0, MM- 1, and MM- 3, will not be used in this protocol. 8.2. Safety Assessments 8.2.1. Physical Examination A physical examination will include assessments of the following body systems: general appearance; skin; head, ear, eye, nose, throat; neck ; lymph node; chest ; heart ; abdom inal cavity; limb; central nervous system; and musculoskeletal. A n abbreviated physical examination consists of a body-system relevant examination based upon Investigator judgment and patient symptoms. For consistency, all efforts should be made to have the physical examination performed by the same qualified study staff. 8.2.2. Vital Signs and Pulse Oximetry Vital signs and pulse oximetry will be measured at every visit and will include assessments of systolic and diastolic BP (mmHg), temperature (°C or °F), SO 2, and HR (beats per minute). Vital signs will be obtained after the patient has been supine or seated for at least 5 minutes. Ideally, each patient’s BP should be measured using the same arm. 8.2.3. Electrocardiogram Single 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3) using an ECG machine to obtain HR and measures of PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. QT interval will be corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF). Patients must be supine for approximately 5 - 10 minutes before ECG collection and remain supine but awake during ECG collection. The Investigator or designee will be responsible for reviewing the ECG to assess whether the ECG is within normal limits and determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be indicated on the eCRF."
55,page_55,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 56 of 109 Alexion Confidential 8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Laboratory assessments will be tested at a central laboratory facility. Any clinically significant abnormal results should be followed unti l resolution or stabilization. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 10.2 (Appendix 2), must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA ( Section 1.3). The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings associated with the underlying disease are not considered AEs unless they are judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for the patient’s condition. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the Investigator, the etiology should be identified and the Sponsor notified. 8.2.4.1. Urinalysis and Urine Chemistry Urine samples will be analyzed for the parameters listed in Section 10.2 (Appendix 2). A microscopic examination of urine samples will be performed if the results of the macroscopic analysis are abnormal. 8.2.4.2. Virus Serology Human immunodeficiency virus testing for HIV-1 and HIV- 2 is required of all patients prior to enrollment. Patients who are HIV positive will not be enrolled. 8.2.4.3. Immunogenicity Assessments Blood samples will be collected to test for presence of ADAs to ravulizumab in serum prior to study drug administration. Further characterization of antibody responses may be conducted as appropriate, including ADA titer, binding and neutralizing antibodies, PK/PD, safety, and activity of ravulizumab. Antibodies to ravulizumab will be evaluated in serum samples collected from all patients according to the SoA (Section 1.3). Serum samples will be screened for antibodies binding to ravulizumab and the titer of confirmed positive samples will be reported. The detection and characterization o f antibodies to ravulizumab will be performed using a validated assay by or under the supervision of the Sponsor. Detailed instructions on the procedure for collecting, processing, storing, and shipping serum samples for immunogenicity analysis will be provided in the laboratory manual. 8.2.5. Suicidal Risk Monitoring 8.2.5.1. Columbia -Suicidal Severity Rating Scale The Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS; Section 10.14 [Appendix 14] and Section 10.15 [Appendix 15]) is a validated questionnaire used extensively across primary care, clinical practice, surveillance, research, and institutional settings to assess suicidal ideation and behavior (Posner, 2011). The C- SSRS will be administered by the Investigator or a properly"
56,page_56,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 57 of 109 Alexion Confidential trained designee. The C- SSRS wil l be assessed for both lifetime and past 1 year ( 12 months ) as specified in the SoA ( Section 1.3). The C-SSRS is being implemented to ensure that patients who are experiencing suicidal ideation or behavior are properly recognized and adequately managed. 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Advers e Events Adverse events will be reported to the Investigator or qualified designee by the patient (or when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the patient’s legally authorized representative). The Investigator or qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE, and remain responsible for following up events that are serious, considered related to the study drug or study procedures; or that caused the patient to discontinue the study drug ( Section 7). Definitions and procedures for recording, evaluating, follow-up, and reporting AEs and SAEs are outlined in Section 10.3 (Appendix 3). 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Information All AEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug is administered. Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study drug but after obtaining informed consent must be recorded in the AE case report form (CRF) as AEs and not in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions CRF. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated in Section 10.3 (Appendix 3). The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the conclusion of study participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged from the study, regardless of wheth er or not the event is related to the study drug, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in S ection 10.3 (Appendix 3). 8.3.2. Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. 8.3.3. Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proact ively follow each patient at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the patient is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.2). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Section 10.3 (Appendix 3)."
57,page_57,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 58 of 109 Alexion Confidential 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events • The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of an SAE within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. • The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study drug under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC , and Investigators. • The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) or MedWatch reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) (Section 10.3 [Appendix 3]) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary. Alexion procedures for the reporting of SUSARs are in accordance with United States Title 21 Code of Federal Reg ulations (CFR) 312.32 and European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidance documents or national regulatory requirements in participating countries, as well as IRBs/IECs where applicable. • An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and acknowledge the report and notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate, according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Pregnancy Contraception guidance that must be followed for the study duration is detailed in Section 10.4 (Appendix 4). For patients of childbearing potentia l, a serum pregnancy test (ie, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) will be performed at Screening and at the EOS /ET. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at all other required time points, as indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). A negative pregnancy test is required prior to administering ravulizumab to patients of childbearing potential. If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section 10.4 (Appendix 4). Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and should be reported as described in Section 10.3 (Appendix 3). 8.3.6. Vaccine and Antibiotic Prophylaxis As with any terminal complement antagonist, the use of ravulizumab increases the patient’s susceptibility to meningococcal infection ( N meningitidis ). To reduce the risk of meningococcal infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections within the 3 years prior to, or at the time of, initiating study drug. Patients who initiate study drug treatment less than 2 w eeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination."
58,page_58,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 59 of 109 Alexion Confidential Vaccines against serotypes A, C, Y, W135, and B, where available, are recommended to prevent common pathogenic me ningococcal serotypes. Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national vaccination guidelines or local practice for vaccination use with complement-inhibitors (eg, eculizumab). Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningoc occal infection. Consideration should be given per official guidance and local practice on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. All patients should be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infection, evaluated immediately if infection is suspe cted, and treated with appropriate antibiotics, if necessary. To increase risk awareness and promote quick disclosure of any potential signs or symptoms of infection experienced by the patients during the course of the study, patients will be provided a safety card to carry with them at all times. Additional discussion and explanation of the potential risks, signs, and symptoms will occur at each visit as part of the review of the patient safety card as described in the SoA (Section 1.3). Vaccination(s) for N meningitidis will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF. 8.3.7. Study Drug Administration Reactions 8.3.7.1. Local and Systemic Reactions Infusion-site reactions are those localized to the site of IV study drug administration and may include those such as erythema, pruritus, and bruising. Infusion- associated reactions are those which are systemic in nature and which may be immune or nonimmune-mediated generally occurring within hours of study drug administration. Immune- mediated reactions may include allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis), while nonimmune-mediated reactions are nonspecific (eg, headache, dizziness, nausea). Monitoring for these reactions will be conducted as part of routine safety assessments for this study. 8.3.7.2. Infusion-Associated Reactions Infusion- associated reactions are defined as systemic AEs (eg, fever, chills, flushing, alterations in HR and BP, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, di arrhea, and generalized skin rashes) occurring during or within 24 hours of the start of IV infusion that are assessed by the Investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug. 8.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest Meningococcal i nfections will be collected as adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study. 8.5. Pharmacokinetics Blood samples will be obtained to assess pre - and post -treatment serum ravulizumab concentrations at the time points and within the windows indicated in the SoA ( Section 1.3). Samples obtained outside of the allotted windows will be considered protocol deviations. Unused samples may be retained for a period of up to 5 years to perform additional assessments as necessary."

Pharmacodynamics Blood samples will be obtained to a ssess pre - and post -treatment serum free C5 at the time points and within the windows indicated in the SoA Section 1.3). Samples obtained outside of the allotted windows will be considered protocol deviations. Unused samples may be retained for a period of up to 5 years to perform additional assessments as necessary. Additional details on sample collection, including blood volume requirements, are provided in the laboratory manual. 8.7. Genetics Genetics will not be evaluated in this study. 8.8. Biomarkers Blood samples for the assessment of AChR auto -Abs will be obtained at the time points indicated in the SoA ( Section 1.3). Additional details on sample collection, including blood volume requirements, are provided in the laboratory manual. Remaining samples from PK, PD, immunogenicity, and biomarker testing may be stored for future biomarker research. Analyses may be performed on biomarker variants thought to play a role in gMG activity/progression or treatment response to ravulizumab. These samples may also be used to develop methods, assays, prognostics, and/or companion diagnostics related to the study drug target, disease process, pathways associated with disease state, and/or mechanism of action of the study drug. Samples may be stored for a maximum duration according to local regulations following the l ast patient’s last visit for the study , at a facility selected by the sponsor, to enable further analyses. 8.9. Healthcare Resource Utilization Healthcare resource utilization data, associated with medical encounters, will be collected by the Investigator or d esignee for all patients throughout the study. Data will be recorded in the eCRF. The data collected may be used to conduct exploratory economic analyses and will include: • Whether patients were admitted to a hospital, rehabilitation center, or hospice • Whe ther the primary reason for admission was related to MG (yes/no) • Duration of hospitalization ( admission and discharge dates)"

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Statistical methods described in this section will be further elaborated in a separate SAP. The SAP will be developed and finalized before database lock. The analyses will be performed using the SAS® statistical software system Version 9.4 or later. Statistical analyses will include tabulations of summary data, inferential analyses, by -patient listings and figures. Inference from efficacy analyses will be based on 2 -sided Type I error (α) = 5%. Summary statistics for continuous variables will minimally include n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. The baseline value for analysis and reporting will be based on the last nonmissing measurement on or prior to the first dose of study drug. The treatment groups for analysis and reporting will be based on the conventions outlined in Table 9. A ‘Total’ group will be formed to report demographics, baseline characteristics and other prestudy information such as prestudy SAEs, medical history, or prior medications. Details for imputation of efficacy data will be described in the SAP. Missing safety data will not be imputed. A clinical study report (CSR) will be produced based on efficacy, safety, PK, PD, and immunogenicity data collected though the end of the 26- week Randomized -Controlled Period. A final CSR to summarize long -term efficacy, safety, PK, PD, and immunogenicity par ameters will be produced at study completion. 9.1. Statistical Hypotheses 9.1.1. Primary Hypothesis The primary hypothesis for this study is that ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of MG- ADL total score at Week 26. The treatment effect based on the prim ary endpoint will be estimated by the difference in means between the ravulizumab group and placebo group in the change from Baseline in MG- ADL total score at Week 26 irrespective of rescue therapy1. A lower value of the corresponding estimate will indicat e a beneficial treatment effect. 9.1.2. Secondary Hypothes es The following secondary hypotheses will be included in study- wise multiplicity adjustment (provided the null hypothesis for primary endpoint is rejected) ( Section 9.4.5.4): 1. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of QMG total score at Week 26. 2. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in QMG 5-point response (≥ 5 point improvement from baseline in QMG total score) at Week 26. 1 Rescue therapy includes high -dose corticosteroids, PE/PP or IVIg. It will be allowed when a patient’s health is in jeopardy, if rescue therapy was not administered (eg, emergent situations), or if a patient experiences Clinical Deterioration"
61,page_61,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 62 of 109 Alexion Confidential 3. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of the MG- QOL15r total score at Week 26. 4. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of Neuro- QOL Fatigue total score at Week 26. 5. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in MG- ADL 3 -point response (≥3 point improvement from baseline in MG -ADL total score) at Week 26. 9.1.3. Hypotheses Related to Exploratory Efficacy Objectives 1. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of MGC total score at Week 26. 2. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in MGFA- PIS at Week 26. 3. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of EQ- 5D-5L index score at Week 26. 4. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of MG-ADL subcomponent scores (bulbar, limbs, respiratory, and ocular) at Week 26 . 5. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of QMG subcomponent scores (bulbar, limbs, respiratory, and ocular) at Week 26 . 6. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in reducing incidence of hospitalizations/MG- related hospitalizations. 7. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in reducing incidence of Clinical Deterioration/MG crisis. 9.1.4. Estimation of Treatment Effect for Secondary and Exploratory Hypotheses The treatment effect corresponding to the change from Baseline continuous endpoints will be estim ated similarly as the primary endpoint. The treatment effect corresponding to the following dichotomous endpoints will be estimated by the odds ratio (OR) of the proportions of the corresponding endpoint in the ravulizumab group compared with the placebo group: a. MG-ADL 3 -point response at Week 26 irrespective of rescue therapy b. QMG 5 -point response at Week 26 irrespective of rescue therapy c. Incidence of hospitalization/MG -related hospitalizations irrespective of rescue therapy d. Incidence of Clinical Deteriora tion/MG crisis over 26 weeks irrespective of rescue therapy An estimate of OR < 1 corresponding to the hospitalization and Clinical Deterioration endpoint will indicate a beneficial treatment effect, likewise an estimate of OR > 1 corresponding responder e ndpoints will indicate a beneficial treatment effect."
62,page_62,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 63 of 109 Alexion Confidential The treatment effect corresponding to the MGFA-PIS endpoint will be estimated by the proportional OR of the cumulative proportions over the ordinal categories (starting from the best outcome) of this e ndpoint in the ravulizumab group compared with the placebo group at Week 26, irrespective of rescue therapy. An estimate of OR > 1 will indicate a beneficial treatment effect. 9.2. Sample Size Determination Approximately 160 patients will be randomly assigned to ravulizumab and placebo in a 1:1 ratio (ravulizumab:placebo) stratified by region (North America, Europe, Asia- Pacific, and Japan) to ensure at least 90% nominal power to reject the null hypotheses of no treatment difference for the primary and secondary endpoints based on 2-sided Type I error (α) = 5%. Assumptions related to statistical power calculatio ns are based on Study ECU- MG-301. Details are provided in Section 10.16 (Appendix 16). 9.3. Populations for Analyses For purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets are defined in Table 9. Table 9: Study ALXN1210- MG-306: Analysis Sets Population Description Randomized set All randomized patients grouped by randomized treatment group (for reporting disposition, demographics, and baseline characteristics) . PK Analysis Set (PKAS) All ravulizumab treated patients with at least1 post-baseline PK concentration available . Full analysis set (FAS) All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug grouped by randomized treatment group (for reporting efficacy data) . Per protocol set (PPS) Subset of FAS without any major protocol deviations1 during Randomized -Controlled Period groupe d by randomized treatment group (for reporting key efficacy data) . Safety set (SS) All patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug grouped by treatment actually received (for reporting exposure and safety data). For a patient to be analyzed accord ing to the treatment they actually received and not according to the randomization schedule, they would have to receive that treatment for the entire duration of Randomized -Controlled Period. Open -label extension set All patients who received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab starting from Week 26 onward (for reporting all data from the OLE Period) . 1 Determination of applicable major protocol deviations for this purpose will be made prior to database lock and study unblinding. 9.4. Statistical Analyses 9.4.1. Enrollment and Disposition The number of patients screened, screen failures, and randomized patients will be presented. Enrollment information will be presented grouped by stratification factor and treatment group. Number of patients discontinued along with reasons from Randomized -Controlled Period, OLE Period, and the overall study will be summarized."
63,page_63,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 64 of 109 Alexion Confidential 9.4.2. Demographics, Baseline Characteristics, Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria, and Protocol Deviations All demographic information and baseline characteristics will be reported by treatment group and overall. No statistical test will be performed for homogeneity among treatment groups. The number and percentage of patients not meeting specific inclusion or exclusion criterion will be summarized. Similar summary will be provided for major protocol deviations based on prespecified categories. 9.4.3. Medical/Surgical History, Physical Examination, and Myasthenia Gravis History The medical and surgical history will be summarized by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory (MedDRA) Activities, Version 20.1, or later by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term. Myasthenia gravis and abnormal physical examination will also be summarized. 9.4.4. Prior and Concomitant Medications For analysis and reporting purpose, any medication started prior to first dose of study drug will be considered as prior medication; and medications that started on or after the first dose of study drug will be considered as concomitant medications. All pr ior and concomitant medications including MG-specific medications and rescue therapy during the study, if any, will be summarized. 9.4.5. Efficacy Analyses 9.4.5.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The Mixed -effects Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) will be used for the primary efficacy endpoint (change from Baseline in MG -ADL total score at Week 26) using all available longitudinal data (either complete or partial) regardless of whether patients received a rescue therapy 2. Missing data will not be imputed for the primary analysis. The model will include the MG-ADL change from Baseline score at each prespecified time point as the response variable, fixed categorical effects of treatment, study visit and treatment -by-study visit interaction, region; as well as fixed covariate of baseline MG -ADL total score. The treatment effect will be evaluated via contrast for the treatment-by- visit term at Week 26. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the correlations among repeated measurements within each patient. Other covariance structures will be implemented if a convergence issue occurs (details to be provided in SAP). The Kenward-Rogers method will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. 2 Rescue ther apy includes high -dose corticosteroids, PE/PP or IVIg. It will be allowed when a patient’s health is in jeopardy, if rescue therapy was not administered (eg, emergent situations), or if a patient experiences Clinical Deterioration"
64,page_64,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 65 of 109 Alexion Confidential 9.4.5.2. Sensitivity Analyses for Primary Endpoint Two sensitivity analyses will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint to explore the robustness of the MMRM results for the primary efficacy analysis: 1. Placebo -based sensitivity analysis: The placebo -based sensitivity analysis will consider the Missing Not At Random (MNAR) mechanism for the missing data, where it will be assumed that patients who discontinue early from ravulizumab will follow the trajectory of outcomes similar to the one in the placebo group after discontinuation of ravulizumab, taking into account observed values prior to discontinuation. 2. Tipping point sensitivity analysis: This approach assumes that patients who discontinue from ravulizumab treatment experience worsening defined by a prespecified adjustment in the primary efficacy endpoint. 9.4.5.3. Analyses of Seco ndary and Exploratory Endpoints All continuous secondary and exploratory endpoints related to change from Baseline will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint. The QMG 5 -point and MG -ADL 3 -point responder endpoints will be analyzed using a mixed effect repeated measures model. The model will include response variable at each pre- specified time point as the dependent variable, fixed categorical effects of treatment, study visit and treatment-by-study visit interaction, and region; as well as fixed co variate of baseline QMG or MG-ADL total score (depending on the response variable). The treatment effect will be evaluated via contrast for the treatment-by- visit term at Week 26. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the correlations amo ng repeated measurements within each patient. Other covariance structures will be implemented if a convergence issue occurs (details to be provided in SAP). Clinical Deterioration /MG crisis and hospitalization s/MG -related hospitalizations will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with treatment group, region. The MGFA -PIS endpoint at Week 26 will be considered as an ordinal scale. A logistic regression of the cumulative odds (cumulated over the categories starting from best outcome) will be perfor med using treatment as fixed categ orical effect and adjusting for region. Long- term efficacy data will be summarized descriptively based on OLE set. 9.4.5.4. Multiplicity Adjustment for Primary and Secondary Endpoints The study is designed to strongly control the overall 2 -sided Type I error of α = 0.05. The primary null hypothesis will be tested first at α = 0.05. If statistically significant, 5 secondary hypotheses will be tested for superiority using a closed -testing procedure with the following order: 1.

Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting 10.3.1. Adverse Event Adverse Event Definition • An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition • Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radi ological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). • Exacerbation of a chr onic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. • New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of t he study. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. • “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assess ments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition • Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (eg, hospitalization for elective sur gery if planned before the signing the ICF, admissions for social reasons or for convenience). • Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. • Lack of drug eff ect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish drug effect. • A medication error (including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose of the product) or use other than what is defined in the protocol is not considered an AE unless there is an untoward medical occurrence as a result of a medication error. • Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug are to be reported within 24 hours of Investigator/site awareness. Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding will be collected for regulatory reporting and safety evaluation."
73,page_73,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 74 of 109 Alexion Confidential 10.3.2. Serious Adverse Event If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: • Results in death • Is life -threatening The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the patient has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. • Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 1. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 2. Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. 10.3.3. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Definition Susp ected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the Investigator identifies as related to study drug or procedure. The US 21CFR312.32 and EU Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associate d detailed guidance documents or national regulatory requirements in participating countries require the reporting of SUSARs. Alexion has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global r egulations and the associated detailed guidance documents. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the national competent authority and IRBs/IECs where applicable."
74,page_74,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 75 of 109 Alexion Confidential 10.3.4. Recording and Follow -Up of Adverse Event and/or Serious Adverse Event Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording • When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. • It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the patient’s medical records to Alexion or designee in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE report. If applicable, additional information such as relevant medical records, should be submitted with a signed SAE cover page to Alexion Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV) via ClinicalSAE@alexion.com or via Facsimile: + 1.203.439.9347. In this case, all patient identifiers, w ith the exception of the patient number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before sending to GPV . • The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE or SAE. Assessment of Event Severity The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories from National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0, published 27 Nov 2017. Each CTCAE term is a Lowest Level Term (LLT) per MedDRA. Each LLT will be coded to a MedDRA Preferred Term: • Grade 1: Mild (asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated) • Grade 2: Moderate (minima l, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL) • Grade 3: Severe (severe or medically significant, but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL) • Grade 4: Life -threatening (urgent intervention indicated) • Grade 5: Fatal (death related to AE) Any change in the severity of an AE should be documented based on specific guidelines in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. Severity and seriousness must be differentiated: severity describes the intensity of an AE, while the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met specific criteria for an SAE as described above. Assessment of Causality • The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and each occurrence of each AE or SAE. An Investigator causality assessment must be provided for all AEs (both nonserious and serious). This assessment must be recorded in the eCRF and on any additional forms, as appropr iate. The definitions for the causality assessments are as follows: o Not related (unrelated) o Related: Temporal relationship to the study drug. Other conditions (concurrent illness, concurrent medication reaction, or progression/expression of disease state) do not appear to explain the event; the event corresponds with the known pharmaceutical profile; improvement on discontinuation; reappearance on rechallenge. Adverse Event Recording • The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relations hip to the study drug. • Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study drug administration will be considered and investigated."
75,page_75,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 76 of 109 Alexion Confidential Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording • The expectedness and reporting criteria of an SAE will be determined by the Sponsor, based on the Reference Safety Document. The Investigator will also consult the IB in his/her assessment. • There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to Alexion or designee. However, it is very important that the Investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to Alexion GPV. • The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events • The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Alexion or designee to eluc idate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. • If a patient dies during particip ation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the Investigator will provide Alexion or designee with a copy of any postmortem findings including histopathology, if available. • The site will enter new or updated SAE data into the electronic sys tem as soon as it becomes available, but no later than 24 hours. The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the GPV within 24 hours of awareness of the information. 10.3.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Serious Adverse Event Reporting to Alexion o r Designee via the RAVE Safety Gateway All SAEs must be reported to Alexion GPV within 24 hours of the Investigator or site staff awareness. These timelines for reporting SAE information to the Sponsor need to be followed for the initial SAE report and fo r all follow -up SAE information. The Investigator or designee must record the SAE data in the eCRF and verify the accuracy of the information with corresponding source documents. The SAE report should be submitted electronically via the RAVE Safety Gateway. In the event that either the e lectronic data capture (EDC) or the RAVE Safety Gateway is unavailable at the site(s), the SAE must be reported on the paper SAE Contingency Form accompanied by an Investigator signed cover page. Facsimile transmission or email may be used in the event of electronic submission failure. For all SAEs, the Investigator must provide the following: • Appropriate and requested follow -up information in the time frame detailed below • Causality of the SAE(s) • Treatment of/intervention for the SAE(s) • Outcome of the SAE(s) • Supporting medical records and laboratory/diagnostic information • The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to Alexion or designee will be the RAVE Safety Gateway. • If the electronic system is unavailable at the time that the Investigator or site bec omes aware of an SAE, the site will use the paper Contingency Form for SAE reporting via facsimile or email. Facsimile transmission or email may be used in the event of electronic submission failure. Email: clinicalsae@alexion.com Facsimile: + 1.203.439.9347"
76,page_76,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 77 of 109 Alexion Confidential Serious Adverse Event Reporting to Alexion o r Designee via the RAVE Safety Gateway • As soon as the EDC becomes available, the data should be entered in the eCRF and forwarded to Alexion GPV via the RAVE Safety Gateway. • When further information becomes available, the eCRF should be updated with the new information and an updated SAE report should be submitted to Alexion GPV via the RAVE Safety Gateway. • After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC will be taken offline to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. • If a site identifies a new SAE from a study patient or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken offline, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form to Alexion GPV. SAE Reporting to Alexion or Designee via P aper Contingency Case Report Form • If applicable, additional information such as relevant medical records should be submitted to Alexion GPV via the email address or facsimile number noted above. • All paper forms and follow -up information submitted to the Sponsor outside of the RAVE Safety Gateway (eg, discharge summary) should be kept in the appropriate section of the study file."

Contraception Guidance Before receiving study drug, female patients who consider themselves to be postmenopausal must provide evidence of menopause based on a combination of amenorrhea for at least 1 year and increased serum follicle- stimulating hormone level (> 30 IU/L). Patients of childbearing pote ntial must use a highly effective or acceptable method of contraception (as defined below) starting at Screening and continuing for at least 8 months after the last dose of study drug. Highly effective contraceptive methods include: 1. Hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 2. Intrauterine device 3. Intrauterine hormone -releasing system 4. Bilateral tubal occlusion 5. Vasectomized partner provided that the partner is the patient’s sole sexual partner 6. Sexual abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug treatment; reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient Acceptable contraceptive methods include: 7. A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) The above-listed method(s) of contraception chosen for an individual patient can be determined by the Investigator with consideration for the patient’s medical history and concomitant medications. Patients with a spouse/partner of childbearing potential or a pregnant or breastfeeding spouse or partner must agree to use double barrier contraception (male condom plus appropriate barrier method for the female partner) while on treatment and for at least 8 months after the last dose of study drug. Double barrier contraception is required even with documented medical assessment of surgical success of a vasectomy. Male p atients must not donate sperm and female patients must not donate ova while on treatment and for at least 8 months after the last dose of study drug. 10.4.2. Pregnancy Testing Patients of childbearing potential should only be included after a menstrual period and a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test. Additional pregnancy testing should be performed per the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3)."
78,page_78,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 79 of 109 Alexion Confidential Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected . 10.4.3. Collection and Reporting of Pregnancy Information No studies of ALXN1210 have been conducted in pregnant women. Pregnant or nursing female patients are excluded from the study. Patients enrolled in the study, and a spouse or partner, will use a highly effective or acceptable method of contraception. In the event of a pregnancy event, pregnancy data will be collected during this study for all patients and a female spouse/partner of male patients. Exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in utero) can be the result of either maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal exposure. For all Alexion products, both in developmen t or postapproval, exposure during pregnancy must be recorded and the pregnancy followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (ie, spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality), even if the patient discontinues study drug or withdraws from the study. If a female patient or a patient’s female partner becomes pregnant during the conduct of this study, the Investigator must submit the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome/Breastfeeding” form to Alexion GPV via facsimile or email (Section 10.3). When the outcome of the pregnancy becomes known, the form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GPV. If additional follow -up is required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information. Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during br eastfeeding must also be reported (via the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form/Breastfeeding” form) and any AEs experienced by the infant must be reported to Alexion GPV or designee via email or facsimile (Section 10.3). Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. H owever, complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy are AEs and may meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly). Elective abortions without complications should not be reported as AEs."

Appendix 5: Management of Potential Infusion- Associated Adverse Events During Study Drug Administration Intravenous and infusion -associated reactions are a potential risk with the use of mAbs; these reactions can be nonimmune or immune-mediated (eg, hypersensitivity reactions). Signs and symptoms may include headache, fever, facial flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, erythema, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, hypertension, lightheadedness, hypotension, palpitations, and somnolence. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions may include hives, swollen face, eyelids, lips, or tongue, or trouble with breathing. All administration -, IV-, and infusion- associated reactions will be reported to the Investigator or qualified designee ( Section 8.3). The Investigator or qualified designee are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up events that are serious, considered related to the study drug, or study procedures; or that caused the patient to discontinue the study drug ( Section 7). Definitions and procedures for recording, evaluating, follow-up, and reporting AEs and SAEs are outlined in Section 10.3 (Appendix 3). Patients who experience a reaction during the administration of study drug should be treated according to institutional guidelines. Patients who experience a severe reaction during administration of study drug resulting in discontinuation of study drug should undergo all scheduled safety, PK, and PD evaluations required by the protocol. The Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of any infusion reaction requiring interruption or discontinuation of study drug. All AEs that may indicate an infusion- related response will be graded according to the CTCAE v 5.0 or higher. If anaphylaxis occurs according to the criteria listed below, then administration of SC epinephrine (1/1000, 0.3 mL to 0.5 mL, or equivalent) should be considered.

Additional Details on Sample Size Determination The power calculations were based on the longitudinal change from baseline in MG -ADL total score observed in REGAIN ( Study ECU- MG-301). The treatment effect (difference between the eculizumab and the placebo arms in mean change (95% CI) from baseline to We ek 6 for MG- ADL) was estimated to be -1.9 (-3.27, -0.55) and the estimated common standard deviation was 3.7. Based on these parameter estimates and the assumption that ALXN1210- MG-306 study will provide similar results, a total of N = 160 patients is required to ensure at least 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of no treatment effect for MG- ADL at the Type I error rate = 5% (2-sided) based on a t-statistic for two independent samples . A simulation -based approach was also adopted to independently veri fy the sample size calculation in which a large number of virtual datasets were generated with a total of 160 patients (equally distributed between two arms) each having a longitudinal profile of change in MG-ADL and baseline MG -ADL score generated accordi ng to the treatment- specific variance - covariance structure obtained from REGAIN database. The empirical power was calculated by the proportion of times these virtual trials rejected the null hypothesis based on the MMRM model described above. 10.16.2. Additional De tails on Sensitivity Analysis for Primary Endpoint To assess the credibility of the primary analysis, the following sensitivity analyses are planned, based on assumptions that are unfavorable enough to the ravulizumab group to constitute a convincing stres s test of the primary analysis. 10.16.2.1. Placebo -based Sensitivity Analysis The placebo -based sensitivity analysis will consider the MNAR mechanism for the missing data, where it will be assumed that patients who discontinue early from the ravulizumab group will follow the trajectory of outcomes similar to the one in the placebo g roup after discontinuation of ravulizumab, taking into account observed values prior to discontinuation (Little, 1996 ); (Ratitch, 2013). Patients discontinuing early from placebo will be assumed to have unobserved outcomes similar to placebo patients who remain on their randomized treatment. The assumption that the efficacy profiles of dropouts after discontinuation of ravulizumab are si milar to those of patients in the placebo group provides an estimand of efficacy attributable to patients in the ravulizumab group if received through the time point of interest, while limiting efficacy after early discontinuation to that of the placebo group. 10.16.2.2. Tipping Point Sensitivity Analysis An additional sensitivity analysis will be performed based on the delta- adjusted stress testing method (tipping point analysis). This approach assumes that patients who discontinue from the active treatment experien ce worsening defined by a prespecified adjustment (delta) in the primary efficacy endpoint compared with the observed efficacy score of patients that continue the study to next visit ( O'Kelley, 2014). Since a negative change in QMG total score indicates improvement, the prespecified value of delta will be a non -negative fixed quantity. For each value of delta, the treatment effect will be determined and the value of delta for which the"
99,page_99,"Protocol ALXN1210 -MG-306 Amendment 2 Page 100 of 109 Alexion Confidential nominal 2-sided p- value crosses 0.05, will be considered as the ‘tipping point’ in the sense that the positive conclusion drawn from the primary analysis is reversed when patients who drop out are assumed to experience this fixed worsening after the discontinuation visit. After such a tipping point is determined, clinical judgment will be applied as to the plausibility of the assumptions underlying this tipping point. This methodology is expected to inform of what it would take to overturn study conclusions based on varying assumptions about missing data. A value of delta as ze ro will be considered equivalent to the primary analysis."
