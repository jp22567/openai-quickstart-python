Study Design This study includes the following:  Screening Period (Day −28 through Day −1)  Treatment Period (Day 1 through Day 56 ± 5 days)  Safety Follow -up Contact (28 days ± 7 days after the last dose of study drug) Subjects will be stratified by age at the Screening Visi t (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), sex (male versus female), and ppFEV 1 severity determined during the Screening Visit (<40% versus ≥ 40% predicted), and then randomized (1:1) to 1 of the following 2 treatment arms: TEZ/IVA : TEZ 100 mg once daily (qd) + IVA 150 mg every 12 hours (q12h) Placebo : Placebo regimen with visually matched tablets Subjects who complete the Day 56 Visit will be offered the opportunity to receive TEZ/IVA through the Expanded Access Program if they meet the eligibility criteria for that program. Schedule of Study Visits Screening Period: After obtaining consent and assent (where applicable), screening evaluations will be completed at any time during a period of 28 days (Day -28 through Day -1) before the first dose of the study drug. Treatment Period : The first dose of the study drug will be administered on Day 1 and after randomization. Clinic visits will occur on Day 1, Day 15 (± 3 days), and at Day 28 and Day 56 (± 5 days) . Safety Follow -up Conta ct: A Safety Follow -up Contact will be performed 28 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study drug. The Safety Follow -up Contact may be a telephone interview; however, if deemed necessary by the investigator, a Safety Follow -up Visit may be required with necessary assessments to be d etermined by the investigator. Assessments Safety: AEs, clinical laboratory assessments (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical examinations , ophthalmologic examinations , pulse oximetry , and post dose spirometry (Day 1 only) . Efficacy: Spirometry and CFQ -R Tolerability: discontinuation of study drug"
4,page_4,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 5 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Statistical Analyses Sample Size Consideration Sample size calculation is based on the key secondary endpoint of absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline to the average of the D ay 28 and Day 56 measurements. A Bayesian approach will be used to assess the treatment effect on the change in ppFEV 1. The study will be considered successful if the posterior probability that the treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo is greater than 0 is at least 80%, using a noninformative prior distribution. Assuming a 3.0 percentage points mean treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo and a standard deviation (SD) of 6.0 percentage points, with 42 TEZ/IVA subjects and 42 placebo subjects, the Bayesian power to achieve the posterior probability criterion is at least 90% (92.6%) . After adjusting for an assumed dropout rate of 5% a total sample size of 90 subjects is needed. Analyses Sets The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug. The FAS will be used in efficacy analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group. The Safety Set is defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Set is to be used for all safety and tolerability analyses , in which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. Safety Analyses Respiratory safety of TEZ/IVA is the primary objective of this study and will be assessed in terms of AE incidence , including but not limited to the following :  Chest discomfort  Dyspnea (shortness of breath)  Respiration abnormal (chest tightness)  Asthma  Bronchial hyperreactivity  Bronchospasm  Wheezing All safety analyses will be based on the TE Period for subjects in the Safety Set. The overall safety profile of study treatments will be assessed in terms of the following safety endpoints:  Incidence of treat ment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) , SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs  Clinical laboratory values  Vital signs  Pulse oximetry All safety data will be listed by subject in data listings. Summaries of TEAEs will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. Efficacy Analysis The actual posterior/conditional probability will be calculated for the probability of a greater than zero (>0) treatment effect difference in mean p pFEV 1 change between TEZ/IVA and placebo is greater than or equal to 80%, based on the observed data of the efficacy endpoint on the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements . This will serve as the primar y efficacy analysis outcome. Additionally, the key efficacy endpoint of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements will be analyzed using a mixed -"
5,page_5,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 6 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with ppFEV 1 at each time point as the outcome variable. The MMRM model will include the absolute change fro m baseline in ppFEV 1 at each visit as the dependent variable; treatment, visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects; and subject as a random effec t, with adjustment for sex (male versus female), age group at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years old), and pp FEV 1 severity determined during the Screening (or baseline) Period ( <40% versus ≥40 % predicted). The estimated treatment effect within TEZ/ IVA and placebo arm, as well as the estimated treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo arm will be provided based on the MMRM model along with 95% confidence interval ( CI). These results will serve as additional efficacy outcome s, which is in addit ion to the primary actual posterior/conditional probability outcome. Furthermore, treatment effect and treatment difference at each post -baseline visit, obtained from the model, will also be provided. Secondary endpoints including relative change of ppFEV 1, CFQ -R respiratory domain score will be analyzed in a similar fashion as the analysis for the primary endpoint. Tolerability Analysis A tolerability analysis will be based on the Safety Set for a standard summary of study drug discontinuation rate . Rate will be reported as descriptive statistics in percentages and no statistical hypothesis testing will be performed. IDMC Reviews The independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct regular planned safety reviews of study data as outlined in the IDMC Charter."

15,page_15,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 16 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 5 INTRODUCTION Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects more than 70,000 children and adults worldwide1 and is the most common fatal genetic disease in persons of European descent.2 CF is caused by a defect in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an ion channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other ions in epithelia of various tissues, including lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands. Decreased CFTR activity in people with CF results in multisystem pathology3, beginning at birth. Despite progress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the median predicted survival age for a person with CF is approximately 40 years.4 More effective treatments are needed for CF. To address this medical need, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is developing treatment regimens that include CFTR modulators to target the underlying cause of CF: the defective CFTR protein. Two types of CFTR modulators have been developed: potentiators, which increase the channel gating activity of the CFTR protein, and correctors, which increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators can increase the activity of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by correctors: therefore, CFTR potentiators and correctors are complementary therapeutic approaches. Ivacaftor (IVA; Kalydeco®), the first CFTR modulator developed by Vertex, is an orally administered CFTR potentiator that increases the channel-open probability of CFTR protein to enhance chloride transport. Globally, Kalydeco is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients as young as 2 years who have the G551D and certain other gating mutations as well as the R117H mutation in the CFTR gene depending on the country. 5 Lumacaftor (LUM), the second CFTR modulator developed by Vertex, is a CFTR-specific corrector that increases the delivery of CFTR protein at the cell surface by improving the processing and traff icking of the CFTR protein. Orkambi® is a fixed-dose combination pill of LUM/IVA, which increases the quantity and function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. It is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients as young as 6 years and older who are homozygous for F508del . In clinical trials, LUM/IVA therapy significantly improved lung function and other measures of disease and reduced the rate of pulmonary exacerbations in patients with CF who were homozygous for F508del . However, in Phase 1 studies with healthy subjects, there was a decline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV 1) observed within 4 hours of dosing LUM/IVA. Postdose spirometry was not done in P hase 3 studies with LUM/IVA, but the incidence of respiratory symptoms (i.e., ch est discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal) was 22.0% in subjects who received the comm ercialized dose of the LUM/IVA and 13.8% in subjects who received placebo. Post-marketing data for Orkambi suggests that patients have discontinued treatment due to respirator y events. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for treatment of patients homozygous for F508del and who have discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to respiratory symptoms considered related to treatment. Tezacaftor (TEZ) is a CFTR corrector being developed by Vertex that is being evaluated in several ongoing Phase 3 studies. Phase 2 data indicate that TEZ in combination with IVA (TEZ/IVA) showed statistically significant improvements in lung function (ppFEV 1) in subjects with CF who have at least 1 copy of F508del after 28 days of treatment.

In addition, the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) for the Phase 3 program has not identified any meaningful trends in postdose spirometry or adverse event (AE) data to suggest that TEZ/IVA is associated with respiratory symptoms. Because there is no association of respiratory events with TEZ/IVA, it is reasonable to hypothesize that TEZ/IVA may be a treatment for patients who have discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to respiratory symptoms considered related to treatment. 6 STUDY OBJECTIVES 6.1 Primary Objective(s)  To evaluate the respiratory safety of TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF homozygous for F508del and who discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to respiratory symptoms considered related to treatment. 6.2 Secondary Objective(s)  To evaluate the efficacy of TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and who discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to respiratory symptoms considered related to treatment.  To evaluate patient-reported outcomes after treatment with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and who discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to respiratory symptoms considered related to treatment. 7 STUDY ENDPOINTS 7.1 Primary Endpoint  Incidence of respiratory AEs 7.2 Key Secondary Endpoint  Absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppF EV 1) from baseline to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements. 7.3 Secondary Endpoints  Relative change in ppFEV 1 from baseline to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements.  Absolute change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain score from baseline to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements.  Tolerability based on discontinuation of TEZ/IVA through Day 56  Safety assessments based on AEs, clinical laboratory values (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, and urinalysis), vital signs, pulse oximetry, and postdose spirometry"

This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TEZ/IVA. This study includes a Screening Period (up to 28 days), Treatment Period (approximately 56 days), and Safety Follow-up Period (approximately 28 days). Approximately 90 subjects will be stratified by age a t the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) , sex (male versus female), and ppFEV 1 (determined during the Screening Visit; <40% versus ≥40% predicted) and then randomized 1:1 between the 2 study arms. Subjects who complete the Day 56 Visit will be offered the opportunity to receive TEZ/IVA through the Expanded Access Program if they meet eligibility requirements for that program. Figure 9-1 Study VX16-661-114 Design Screening 9.1 .1 Screening Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-1. Screening will occur within 28 days before administration of first dose of study drug. The investigator (or an appro priate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain informed consent/assent from each subject. 9.1.1.1 Repetition of Screening Assessment(s) Repetition of individual screening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted with the following exceptions:  If there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g., hemolyzed sample) or equipment malfunction, collection o f a repeat sample for the appropriate laboratory test or assessment may be permitted with the approval of the medical monitor. Note: Clinical visits are on Days -28, 1, 15, 28, and 56. A telephone contact on Day 3 collects AEs. The Safety Follow -up may be a clinic visit or telephone call."

If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 9.1.1.2 Rescreeni ng Subjects may only be rescreened with the approval of the medical monitor. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated except for CFTR genotyping, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was ≥ 40 mIU/mL during prior screening), and ophthalmologic examination. If a subject is rescreened, the screening window will begin after the first rescreening assessment has been initiated. 9.1.1.3 Extension of Screening Period Window A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 4 weeks for the following reasons:  Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section 9.1.1.1)  Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria  Scheduling of ophthalmologic examination (Section 11.4.7)  Repetition of spirometry assessment if results are of poor quality Treatment Period 9.1.2 The Treatment Period will last approximately 56 days. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: TEZ/IVA or placebo. The dosing regimen for each treatment arm is shown in Figure 9-1 and is as follows:  TEZ/IVA: TEZ 100-mg/ IVA 150-mg fixed-dose combination (light yellow) film-coated tablet for oral administration (morning dose); IVA 150-mg (light blue) film-coated tablet for oral administration (evening dose)  Placebo: 0 mg film-coated matching placebo tablets for oral administration (1 light yellow for the morning dose and 1 light blue for the evening dose) The first dose of study drug will be administered after randomization on Day 1. Dosing details are given in Section 9.5. Study visits during the Treatment Period will occur as shown in Table 3-2. Subjects will be outpatients during the Treatment Period unless hospitalized for illness. All visits should occur within the windows specified. Safety Follow-up Contact 9.1.3 A Safety Follow-up Contact will be performed for the purpose of coll ecting information on AEs 28 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study drug. The assessments performed at the Safety Follow-up Contact are listed in Table 3-2. The Safety Follow-up Contact may be a telephone"

Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment may not be required to have a Safety Follow-up Contact; refer to Section 9.1.4 for details. Early Termi nation of Treatment 9.1.4 If a subject prematurely discontinues study treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the subject decides to terminate study treatment. These subjects will also be required to complete a Safety Follow-up Contact 28 days (± 7 days) after their last dose of study drug. If the ETT Visit occ urs 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Sa fety Follow-up Contact, and a separate Safety Follow-up Contact will not be required. If a subject withdraws consent for the study, no further visits will be required (including an ETT or Safety Follow-up Contact), no further evaluations will be performed, and no additional data will be collec ted. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. Independent Data Monitoring Committee 9.1.5 An IDMC will be formed for this study. The safety and tolerability data will be reviewed by an IDMC to ensure the safety of the subjects in the study. Procedural details of the IDMC's structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened. 9.2 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens Study Design 9.2.1 A randomized, double-blind study design will avoid observer bias and reduce symptoms or outcomes arising from the subjects' knowledge of treatment. Subjects will be r andomized to receive TEZ in combination with IVA, or a matched placebo regimen. All subjects enrolled in the study will continue their normal, stable treatment for CF symptoms throughout the study. Orkambi is the onl y therapy approved for subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation that targets the underlying cause of CF. TEZ, an experimental CFTR corrector, in combination with IVA, is currently being evaluated in several Phase 3 studies in subjects who are both homozygous for F508del and heterozygous for F508del with other CFTR mutations. Scheduled IDMC reviews of each of the TEZ/IVA Phase 3 studies are completed and did not reveal any safety signals. Since subjects entering this study are not taking corrector/potentiator therapy, the use of placebo in this study is deemed ethical and necessary to adequately assess the benefit of treatment with TEZ in combination with IVA. Study 114 is designed to compare active treatment with TEZ 100 mg daily (qd)/IVA 150 mg every 12 hours (q12h) with a matched placebo treatment for 8 weeks. The 8-week duration was selected to all ow ad equate exposure to TEZ/IVA to assess both the safety and efficacy of the treatment. This is appropriate because patients who have respiratory AEs with Orkambi typically do so within the first wee k of exposure, and a significant response in ppFEV 1 is expected after"
23,page_23,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 24 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 14 to 28 days of treatment with TEZ/IVA. In addition, the 8-week duration was selected to allow a robust assessment of the durability of response that will be less affected by short-term variability in ppFEV 1, and to facilitate the demonstration of significant changes in secondary endpoints, including CFQ-R. Study Drug Dose 9.2.2 The dose regimen of TEZ chosen for continued development in Phase 3 was evaluated in Study 101, a Phase 2 study in 2 CF populations: one that was homozygous for F508del and one that was heterozygous for F508del and G551D . The dose regimen of TEZ 100 mg qd in combination with IVA 150 mg q12h provided clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in pp FEV 1 in both populations. Pivotal Phase 3 studies are ongoing; therefore, results are not known. Rationale for Study Assessments 9.2.3 Safety assessments are standard parameters for clinical studies in drug development. The efficacy assessments are widely accepted and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of patients with CF. Spirometry: Since lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with CF, CF lung disease is the desired primary target of TEZ/IVA cotherapy. Spirometry is the most widely implemented standardized assessment to evaluate lung function. Predose and postdose spirometry assessments must be performed in all subjects according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3-1 and Table 3-2). CFQ- R: The CFQ-R is a frequently used CF-specific instrument that measures the health-related quality of life of patients with CF.7-9As both IVA alone and TEZ/IVA are systemic therapies, they have the potential to improve not only respiratory symptoms but other extrapulmonary manifestations of CF as well. These improvements can be captured by the non-respiratory symptoms domains of the CFQ-R. The adolescent/adult version, the parent/caregiver version, and the child version measure quality-of-life domains, including respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, emotion, and health perception. Linguistically validated versions of the CFQ-R10, 11 are available, thereby allowing consistent interpretation of the results in this global study. The CFQ-R will be used to capture and evaluate the impact of TEZ/IVA on patient reports of respiratory symptoms and other aspects of health-related quality of life. 9.3 Study Restrictions Prohibited medications and certain foods are not allowed in this study (Screening Period through the Safety Follow-up Contact) (Table 9-1). Both TEZ and IVA are metabolized predominantly via the hepatic enzymatic pathway using CYP3A4. Therefore, the use of known moderate and strong inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A, which have the potential to significantly alter the exposure of TEZ and IVA, will be restricted in this study. A non-exhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for food and medication will be provided in the Study Reference Manual."

For subjects who are screened but are not subsequently randomized in the study, details of prior medication will only be documented in the subjects' source documents.  Subjects must remain on a stable medication regimen for their CF from screening through the Safety Follow -up Contact; this includes supplements and inhaled antibiotics. A stable medication regimen is defined as the current medication regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 28 days before Day 1. Any potential exceptions to this must be discussed and approved by the Vertex medical monitor. Guidelines for a stable inhaled antibiotic regimen for CF are as follows: • Subjects who are taking daily inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that drug at the current regimen throughout the study. • Subjects who are on inhaled cycling antibiotics should continue on their current schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug should be synchronized as closely as possible to the first day of inhaled cycling antibiotics. • Subjects who alternate 2 different antibiotics monthly should remain on the same schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug should be synchronized as closely as possible to the first day of either of the inhaled antibiotics.  There are no restrictions on the concomitant use of corticosteroids.  Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spirometry assessments performed according to the guidelines provided in Section 11.3.1."

Study drug administration guidelines: 1. Study drug should be administered within 30 minutes after starting a fat-containing meal, such as a sta ndard CF high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack. It is recommended that study drug be administered after the start of and before the end of a meal, and that the duration of each meal associated with study drug intake (i.e., breakfast and dinner/snack, as applicable) should not exceed 30 minutes. 2. On days with no scheduled clinic visits, study drug should be administered q12h (± 2 hours). F or each subject, all doses (morning [TEZ/IVA] and evening [IVA], or matching placebo) of study dru gs will be taken at approximately the same time each day. For example, if the morning dose is taken at 08:00 every morning, the evening dose should be taken at 20:00 every evening (but it could be taken between 18:00 and 22:00). 3. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been completed. The meal or snack will be provided by the site for the morning dose of study drug. 4. If a subject's scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be used:  If the dose in the clinic will be within 6 hours of the subject's scheduled morning dose, the subject should wit hhold their morning dose of study drug and the morning dose will be administered in the clinic.  If the dose in the clinic will be more than 6 hours after the subject's scheduled morning dose, the subject shou ld take the morning dose at home and the evening dose will b e administered in the clinic. In this event, all assessments will be collected relative to the evening dose. 5.

The study monitor will review study drug records and inventory throughout the study. 10.6 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until the study monitor has performed drug accountability. At the end of the study, the study monitor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused investigational product. If the study monitor authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented. Procedures for destruction or return of the study drug will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 10.7 Compliance To maximize treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review subject compliance with study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug count. If a subject demonstrates continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational efforts, the investigator should contact the medical monitor to discuss potential discontinuation of the subject from the study treatment. 10.8 Blinding and Unblinding This is a double-blind study. Blinding 10.8.1 All study personnel will be blinded to subject treatment assignments except for the following individuals:  Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject in the event of a life-threatening medical emergency  Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject and the fetus in the event of a pregnancy  The unblinded site monitor and unblinded trip report reviewer  An unblinded pharmacist at the contract research organization ( CRO ) for dispensing study drug  Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE processing and reporting regulations  External vendor (unblinded) statistician preparing the final (production) randomization list who is not part of the study team  Vertex IXRS Management for IWRS oversight and system administration  Vertex Clinical Supply Chain"
30,page_30,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 31 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Vertex medical monitor may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time Spirometry Data Blinding Despite treatment blinding, knowledge of the spirometry results has the potential to suggest whether a subject has been administered active study drug or placebo. Therefore, during the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will have no access to spirometry data. The vendor for central reading of the spirometry data will only send the blinded spirometry files (blinded treatment group, with real values for screening and baseline, but with dummy values for all the spirometry assessment after baseline) to Vertex to be used for developing the statistical programs. Furthermore, subjects and their caregivers should not be informed of their study- related spirometry results during the Treatment Period, regardless of whether the subject has prematurely discontinued study drug treatment. Unblinding 10.8.2 At the initiation of the study, the study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The unblinding method will be either a manual or electronic process. Unblinding of the individual subject's treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject's study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the medica l monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the situation with the medical monitor. Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be provided in a separate document. In addition, the Vertex Medical Information Call Center ( ) will answer calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year, and will triage these calls to the study medical monitor or appropriate backup. If a subject's tr eatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24 hours of the unblinding event. The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject's study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with the sponsor (Vertex), CRO, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the investigator will consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered a serious adverse event (SAE), according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) or designee, per Section 13.1.2 . Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time."

Informed Consent/Assent 11.1.1 Each subject of age of consent (per local requirements) must sign and date a study -specific ICF before any study-specific procedures can be performed. Subjects not of age of consent must assent, if applicable per local requirements, to participate in the study, and the subject's parent or legal guardian must sign and date a study-specific ICF before any study-specific procedures can be performed. The consent forms will comply with all applicable regulations governing the protection of human subjects. An ICF and Assent Form, approved by Vertex and the site's institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC), must be used. Assigning Subject Number 11.1.2 After a subject has signed an ICF or Assent Form, if applicable, a subject number will be assigned. The subject will retain this number for the entire study. Detailed instructions on assigning subject numbers will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. If a subject is rescreened, the subject retains the original subject number. 11.2 Subject and Disease Characteristics Subject and disease characteristics include demographics, medical history, height, and weight. Medical history will be collected from each subject during screening. The medical history shall include a complete review of systems, past medical and surgical histories, and any allergies. Based on the medical history, the subject will be assessed for any disqualifying medical conditions as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 11.3 Efficacy Spirometry 11.3.1 Spirometry will be performed according to the ATS/ERS guidelines6 at the time points noted in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 according to the additional guidelines that follow. Prebronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for subjects who have  withheld their short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic (e.g., ipratropium bromide [Atrovent®]) for more than 4 hours before the spirometry assessment  withheld their twice-daily, long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) for more than 12 hours before the spirometry assessment; and  withheld their once-daily, long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®]) for more than 24 hours before the spirometry assessment During the Treatment Period, all spirometry assessments must be perf ormed before dosing, except on Day 1, when in addition t o the predose assessments, 2 postdose spirometry assessments will be performed 2 hours (±30 minutes ) and 4 hours (±30 minutes ) after dosing. If the Day 1 predose spirometry is performed postbronchodilator, the subject should withhold any"
32,page_32,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 33 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated further bronchodilator use until completion of the 4-hour postdose spirometry assessment on that day. During the Screening Period, spirometry assessments may be performed pre- or post-bronchodilator. At all the other visits, all spirometry assessments should be performed prebronchodilator. In the event that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed a ccording to the following:  If a subject’s Day 1 spirometry is performed prebronchodilator, but on a subsequent visit the subject does not withhold bronchodilator, a postbronchodilator spirometry will be obtained for that visit only, and the visit will not be rescheduled.  If a subject does not withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator on Day 1, spirometry at that visit and at all subsequent visits (according to the schedule of assessments detailed in Table 3-2) should be performed postbronchodilator.  Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre- or post- bronchodilator. All sites will be provided with spirometers to be used for all study assessments. Spirometry data will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality r eview. Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be informed of their study-related spirometry results from Day 1 through Day 56, regardless of whether the subject prematurely discontinues treatment. The parameters listed below will be normalized using the standards of Wang et al (for female subjects aged 12 to 15 years [inclusive] and male subjects age d 12 to 17 years [inclusive]) or Hankinson et al (for female subjects aged 16 years and older and male subjects aged 18 years and older )12, 13:  FEV 1 (L)  Forced vital capacity (FVC) (L)  FEV 1/FVC (ratio)  Forced expiratory flow 25% to 75% (L/s) Subjects in whom the Wang standard is applied at the Screening Visit will have the Wang standard applied throughout the study, even if there is a change in age during the course of the study that would otherwise necessitate use of the Hankinson standard. Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised 11.3.2 Subjects will be asked to complete the CFQ-R in their native language.14 The CFQ-R will be completed before the start of any other assessments, as noted in Table 3-2. Subjects who are <14 years of age at Day 1 will complete the CFQ- R child version themselves, and their parents/caregivers will complete the CFQ-R Parent version, at all visits, regardless of whether the subject subsequently turns 14 years of age during the study. Subjects 14 years of age and older at Day 1 will complete the adolescent/adult version of the questionnaire themselves at all visits. The questionnaires provide information about demographics; general quality of life, school, work, or daily activities; and symptom difficulties (pertaining to CF). Copies of the"

Validated translations of the CFQ-R, if available, will be provided for participating centers in non-English-speaking countries. 11.4 Safety Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital signs, pulse oximetry, postdose spirometry, and physical examinations (PEs). Adverse Events 11.4.1 All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines. Section 13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for documenting, grading, and reporting AEs. A separate document that details AE case report form (CRF ) completion guidelines for investigators as well as training will be provided. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 11.4.2 Blood samples will be collected before dosing and analyzed at a central labor atory unless otherwise specified. A local laboratory may be used if a subject cannot return to the clinical study site for mandatory liver function testing (Section 11.4.6). Blood samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected according to the schedule shown in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2. Laboratory test results that are abnormal and considered clinically significant will be reported as AEs (see Section 13.1.1.2). The safety laboratory test panels are shown in Table 11-1."

Pregnancy (β -human chorionic gonadotropin) Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential: Serum samples will be obtained as specified in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 and analyzed at the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the site as specified in Table 3-2. The urine pregnancy test on Day 1 must be negative before the first dose o f study drug. FSH (Screening Period only): Blood sample for F SH will be measured for any potentially postmenopausal female. In addition to at least 12 months of continuous spontaneous amenorrhea, serum FSH levels must be ≥ 40 mIU/mL for the subject to be considered postmenopausal. CFTR Genotype (Screening Period only): CFTR genotyping will be performed at the Screening Visit only if the CFTR genotype is not documented in the subject’s medical record. Additional evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate. For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. At the discretion of the local investigator, local laboratories may be used for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically"
35,page_35,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 36 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated significant, it should be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. Physic al Examinations and Vital Signs 11.4.3 A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select study visits (see Table 3-1and Table 3-2). At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom- directed vital sign assessments can be performed at the discre tion of the investigator or healthcare provider . A PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes/ears/nose/throat; respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs. Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), pulse rate, and respiration rate. These will be collected predose at all visits and will be assessed following at least a 5-minute rest in the seated or supine position. Contraception and Pregnancy 1 1.4.4 The effects of TEZ/IVA on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known. 11.4.4.1 Contraception Participation in this study requires a commitment from the subject and his/her partner to use at least 1 acceptable method of contraception, which must be used correctly with every act of sexual intercourse. Methods of contraception should be in successful use from at least 14 days before the first dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug. Contraception for the coup le is waived for the following:  True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through examination of a semen specimen or by demonstrati on of the absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound before the first dose of the study drug.  If the female is of non-childbearing potential, per the following: o Documented hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy. o Postmenopausal: continuous amenorrhea for at least 12 months and serum FSH levels ≥40 mIU/mL. o Has not achieved menarche (has not had her first menstrual period). If a female achieves menarche during the study, she will need to follow acceptable methods of contraception or abstinence."
36,page_36,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 37 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated For subjects for whom contraception methods are not waived due to 1 of the reasons cited above, the foll owing are acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects and their female (non- study) pa rtners, and for female subjects and their male (non-study) partners: Table 11-2 Acceptable Methods of Contraception  Male vasectomy 6 months or more previously, with a negative post -vasectomy semen analysis for sperm.  Male or female condom with or without spermicide (either as a single product if commercially available and/or allowed according to local regulations; otherwise condom and spermicide as separate products).  Female bilateral tubal li gation performed at least 6 months previously.  Female diaphragm, cervical cap, or vaginal sponge, each with spermicide (where available).  Female continuous use of an intrauterine device (non -hormone releasing or hormone releasing) for at least 90 days.  Female combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation if successfully used for at least 60 days. Important notes:  Local requirements may prohibit the use of some of these acceptable methods listed above. Please contact the medical monitor with any questions.  If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements.  Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active.  Female condom used with male condom (as a double method of contraception) is not an acceptable method of contraception due to risk of tearing; a different acceptable method of birth control must be used as described in Table 11-2.  Male subjects must not donate sperm after the first dose of study drug, throughout the study, and for 90 days following the last dose of study drug.  Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant during the study through 90 days following the last dose of study drug.  Female subjects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through 90 days following the last dos e of study drug. Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the Vertex medical monitor on an individual basis. 11.4.4.2 Pregnancy Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug(s). All pregnancies occurring during the study or within 90 days after discontinuation of study drug must be f ollowed until resolution (i.e., birth or voluntary or spontaneous termination of the pregnancy). Any subject found to be pregnant at any time during the study will be withdrawn from the study immediately. Any pregnancy outcome that meets the criteria for an SAE will be reported as an SAE."
37,page_37,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 38 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated If a subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will notify Vertex GPS within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Information Collection Form. The subject or partne r will be followed until the end of the pregnancy and the infant will b e followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow-up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE. Pulse Oximetry 11.4.5 Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be measured at visits noted in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 and will be assessed following at least a 5-minute rest (seated or supine). Pulse oximetry will be collected before study drug dosing at all visits. Liver Function Test Parameters 11.4.6 Liver Functi on Testing Liver function testing must be performed as noted in Table 3-2 while subjects are receiving study drug treatment and at the ETT visit when indicated. These blood sampl es should be processed and shipped immediately per the Laboratory Manual. Subjects with new treatm ent-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN and clinical symptoms must be followed closely, including repeat confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT and AST levels, as clinically indicated. In addition, if ALT or AST is >5 × ULN, repeat follow-up levels must be obtained within 7 ± 2 days. If a subject cannot return to t he site for liver function testing, a local laboratory may be used. Elevations in LFTs at the local laboratory must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). Study Drug Interruption Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), and the medical monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria is met and confirmed with repeat testing:  ALT or AST >8 × ULN  ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  ALT or AST >3 × ULN in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely f or clinical progression. If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol ingestion) for the elevated tests is identified, regardless of whether the levels have im proved, study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued if repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours confirms the initial elevation. Subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated liver tests should have them monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline."
38,page_38,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 39 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Resumption of Study Drug If an alternative, reversible cause of liver test elevation(s) has been identified, study drug may be resumed once the levels return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Approval of the medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, levels should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined elevation occurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. Ophthalmologic Examination 11.4.7 Subjects <18 years of age who did not have an ophthalmological examination prior to starting Orkambi will undergo an ophthalmologic examination if they have not had an ophthalmologic examination within 6 months before the Screening Period. The examination must be performed by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist at screening and includes  measurement of best corrected distance visual acuity of each eye  pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp The screening ophthalmologic examination must be completed before randomization. Subjects who have documentation of bilateral lens removal do not need the ophthalmologic examination. Additional ophthalmologic examinations may be conducted at the discretion of the investigator. The medical monitor should be notified of any abnormal findings from additional ophthalmologic examinations. Spirometry 11.4.8 Postdose spirometry assessment will be performed 2 hours (± 30 minutes ) and 4 hours (± 30 minutes ) after dosing on Day 1; these assessments will be performed in addition to the predose spirometry assessment. If the Day 1 predose spirometry is performed postbronchodilator, the subject should withhold any further bronchodilator use until completion of the 4-hour postdose spirometry assessment on that day. 12 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study and treatment unblinding. 12.1 Sample Size Consideration Sample size calculation is based on the key secondary endpoint of absolute change in ppFEV 1 to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements. A Bayesian approach will be used to assess the treatment effect on the change in ppFEV 1. The study will be considered successful if the posterior probability that the treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo is greater than 0 is at least 80%, using a noninformative prior distribution. Assuming a 3.0 percentage points mean treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo and a standard deviation (SD) of 6 .0 percentage points, with 4 2 TEZ/IVA subjects and 42 placebo subjects, the Bayesian power to achieve the posterior probability criterion is at least"
39,page_39,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 40 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 90% (92.6%). After adjusting for an assumed dropout rate of 5 % a total sample size of 90 subjects is needed. 12.2 Analysis Sets Assignment of subjects to analysis sets will be done before the clinical data lock for the study. The All Subjects Set is defined as all subjects who have been randomized or have received at least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set will be used in subject listings and disposition summary table, unless otherwise specified. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug. The FAS will be used in efficacy analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group. The Safety Set is defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Set is to be used for all safety and tolerability analyses, in which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. 12.3 Statistical Analysis The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the respiratory safety of TEZ/IVA through Day 56 in subjects with CF homozygous for F508del and who discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to respiratory symptoms considered related to treatment. This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses of safety, efficacy, and tolerability. The Vertex Biometrics department or a designated CRO will analyze the data derived from this study. SAS® Version 9.2 or higher will be used to generate all statistical outputs (tables, figures, listings, and data sets). Statistical analysis and presentation details will be provided in the SAP for the study. General Considerations 12.3.1 All individual subject data for all randomized subjects exposed to study drug will be presented in data listings. Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value, and maximum value. The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be presented to 1 decimal place."
40,page_40,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 41 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Baseline value , unless otherwise specified, will be defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the initial administration of study drug. Change (absolute change) from baseline will be calculated as post-baseline value - baseline value. Relative change from baseline will be calculated as (post-baseline value - baseline value)/baseline value. The treatment-emergent (TE) period will include the time from the first dose to the Safety Follow-up Contact or 28 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not have a Safety Follow-up Contact. Background Characteristics 12.3.2 Subject disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant medications, study drug exposure and compliance, and other background characteristics will be summarized. Additionally, all subject data will be presented in subject data listings. All summaries will be based on the FAS unless otherwise specified in the SAP for the study. No statistical hypothesis testing will be performed. 12.3.2.1 Subject Disposition The number and percentage of subjects in the following categories will be summarized as appropriate:  All Subjects Set  Randomized  Dosed (Safety Set)  Randomized, dosed, and carry the intended CFTR mutation (see SAP Appendix 1) (FAS)  Completed study drug treatment  Prematurely discontinued the study during the Treatment Period and the reasons for discontinuation  Completed study/Safety Follow-up Contact  Prematurely discontinued the study and the reasons for discontinuation 12.3.2.2 Demographics, Medical History, and Baseline Characteristics Demographics, medical history, and baseline characteristics will be summarized. The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by dose group for the FAS: sex, race, ethnicity, age, weight, height, region, baseline ppFEV 1, and baseline score of CFQ-R respiratory domain."
41,page_41,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 42 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 12.3.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications Medications used in this study will be coded by using the World Health Organization-Drug Dictionary Enhanced and categorized as the following:  Prior medication: any medication that started before initial dosing of study drug, regardless of when it ended  Concomitant medication: medication continued or newly received at or after initial dosing of study drug through the end of the TE Period  Post-treatment medication: medication continued or newly received beyond the TE Period A given medication can be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post-treatment; or prior, concomitant, and post-treatment. If a medication has a missing or partial missing start/end date or time and cannot be determined whether it was taken before initial dosing, concomitantly, or beyond the TE Period, it will be considered as prior, concomitant, and post-treatment. Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively based on the FAS. Post-treatment medications will be listed for each subject. 12.3.2.4 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance Exposure to study drug (i.e., duration of treatment) will be summarized for the FAS in terms of duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as the last day minus the first day of study drug plus 1. Dosing compliance will be summarized for the FAS and is calculated as the actual number of dosing occasions at which study drug was taken (including when administered at study visits), as a percentage of the planned number of dosing occasions. Duration of treatment and dosing compliance will be summarized by means of descriptive summary statistics. Safety Analysis 12.3.3 Respiratory safety of TEZ/IVA is the primary objective of this study and will be assessed in terms of AE incidence, including but not limited to the following:  Chest discomfort  Dyspnea (shortness of breath)  Respiration abnormal (chest tightness)  Asthma  Bronchial hyperreactivity  Bronchospasm  Wheezing All safety analyses will be based on the TE Period for subjects in the Safety Set. The overall safety profile of study drug will be assessed in terms of the following safety endpoints:"
42,page_42,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 43 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs  Clinical laboratory values  Vital signs  Pulse oximetry All safety data will also be presented in individual subject data listings. 12.3.3.1 Adverse Events AEs will be coded according to MedDRA. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE will be summarized by the MedDRA system o rgan class and preferred term, as well as by dose group. AEs will be classified as pretreatment or treatment-emergent. Pretreatment AEs are defined as AEs that were reported or worsened after signing the ICF up to the start of study drug dosing. Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that were reported or worsened on or after the start of study drug dosing through the Safety Follow-up Contact. Only TEAEs will be summarized in tables. All summaries of TEAEs will be presented by the severity of the AE and relationship to the study drug. Some rules that will apply to the summarization of AEs are (1) a subject with multiple occurrences of the same AE or a continuing AE will only be counted once; (2) only the maximum severity level will be presented in the severity summary; and (3) only the worst relationship level will be presented in the relationship summary. AEs leading to death, SAEs, dose interruption, and permanent discontinuation will be listed separately. All AEs through the Safety Follow-up Contact will be listed in an individual subject data listing, including pretreatment AEs. 12.3.3.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments For the laboratory measurements, the raw values and change from baseline values of the continuous hematology, coagulation, and chemistry results will be summarized in SI units at each scheduled time point. The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 assessment meeting threshold criteria during the Treatment Period will be summarized. The threshold criteria will be provided in the SAP. A listing containing individual subject hematology, coagulation, and chemistry values outside the reference ranges will be provided. This listing will include data from scheduled and unscheduled time points. Results of urinalysis and pregnancy tests will be provided in data listings only. 12.3.3.3 Vital Signs For the on-treatment vital signs measurements, the raw values and change from baseline values will be summarized by treatment group at each scheduled time point during the TE Period: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), HR (beats per minute), and respiratory rate (breaths per minute). Additional vital sign analyses will be described in the SAP, if applicable."

In addition, the mean value at each visit will be plotted by treatment groups for the percent of oxygen saturation. 12.3.3.6 Postdose Spirometry For the 2-hour and 4-hour postdose measurements on Day 1, a summary of raw values for percent predicted FEV 1 will be provided by treatment at each time point. The absolute change from the Day 1 predose value of percent predicted FEV 1 will be summarized by treatment at each time point. In addition, the number and percentage of subjects with percent predicted FEV 1 decline of ≥10, ≥15, and ≥20 percentage points in the absolute change from the Day 1 predose value, and the number and percentage of subjects with percent predicted FEV 1 decline of ≥10, ≥15, and ≥20% in the relative change from Day 1 will be summarized by treatment and by assessment time. Efficacy Analysis 12.3.4 12.3.4.1 Analysis of Key Efficacy Variables The actual posterior/conditional probability will be calculated for the probability of a greater than zero (>0) treatment effect difference in mean ppFEV 1 change between TEZ/IVA and placebo is greater than or equal to 80%, based on the observed data of the efficacy endpoint on the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements. This will serve as the primary efficacy analysis outcome. Additionally, the key efficacy endpoint of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements will be analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with ppF EV 1 at each time point as the outcome variable. The MMRM model will include the absolute change from baseline in pp FEV 1 at each visit as the dependent variable; treatment, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects; and subject as a random effect, with adjustment for sex (male versus female), age group at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years old), and ppFEV 1 severity determined during the Screening (or baseline) Period (<40% versus ≥40% predicted). The estimated treatment effect within TEZ/IVA and placebo arm, as well as the estimated treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo arm will be provided based on the MMRM model along with 95% CI. These results will serve as additional efficacy outcomes, which is in addition to the primary actual posterior/conditional probability outcome. Furthermore, treatment effect and treatment difference at each post-baseline visit, obtained from the model, will also be provided."

Tolerability Analysis 12.3.5 A tolerability analysis will be based on the Safety Set for a standard summary of study drug discontinuation rate. Rate will be reported as descriptive statistics in counts and percentages, separately by the TEZ/IVA arm and the placebo arm. No statistical hypothesis testing will be performed. An additional summary of the tolerability outcome including but not limited to study/study drug discontinuation rate by reasons, by AE of special interest, and by time to discontinuation will also be reported. 12.3.5.2 IDMC Analysis An IDMC will be formed for this study before study initiation. The IDMC’s objectives and operational details will be defined in a separate document (IDMC Charter), which will be finalized before the first subject is screened in the study. The IDMC will conduct regular planned safety reviews of study data as outlined in the IDMC Charter."

This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1 . 13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments Study assessments including laboratory tests, PEs, pulse oximetry, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically-significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., hepatitis). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment i tself will be listed as the AE (e.g., elevated ALT). An abnormal study assessment is con sidered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of the following:  Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator. A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if t he subjec t’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time ICF and assent (where applicable) is signed until the following time points:  For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure or withdrawal of consent  For enrolled subjects who complete the study and for subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug and have a Safety Follow-up Contact: through the Safety Follow-up Contact  For enrolled subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug (including for withdrawal of consent) and do not have Safety Follow-up Contact, the earliest of: o 28 days after the last dose of study drug, or"
46,page_46,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 47 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated o the ETT Visit, if that visit is 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug (see Section 9.1.4 ) All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject's source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  Description of the event  Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  Severity  Causal relationship to study drug(s)  Action taken  Outcome  Concomitant medication or other treatment given 13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. AEs of CTCAE Gr ades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life -threatening.” In considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investiga tor will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Causality Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2."
47,page_47,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 48 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug. Possibly rela ted There is an association between the event and the administration of the investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as charact eristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease. Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug. Not related The event is r elated to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record). 13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3. Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE Classification Definition Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE Dose reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible. 13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE Classification Definition Recovered/ resolved Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms Recovered/ resolved with sequelae Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms Not recovered/ not resolved ( continuing) Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains ongoing Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly related to the AE. Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up)"
48,page_48,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 49 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospitalization, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug)  Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred  Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions)  Congenital anomaly or birth defect  Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home) If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they ar e not synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the Safety Follow-up Contact, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex"
49,page_49,"Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 50 of 56 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated GPS. In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Contact and are considered re lated to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 13.1.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, re gardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities. Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via: Email: (preferred choice) F ax: C ontact Telephone: 1 3.1.2.4 Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities and participating investigators in ac cordance with ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements, as applicable.
