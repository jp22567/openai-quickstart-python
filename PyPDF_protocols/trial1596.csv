PROTOCOL SUMMARY Protocol Title: A Phase 2, Open-Label, Randomized, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pemigatinib Plus Pembrolizumab Versus Pemigatinib Alone V ersus Standa rd of Care as First -Line Treatment for Metastatic or Unresectable Urothelial Carcinoma in Cisplatin -Ineligible Participants Whose Tumors Express FGFR3 Mutation or Rearrangement (FIGHT -205) Protocol Number: INCB 54828-205 Objectives and Endpoints : Table 1 presents the primary objective and endpoint. Table 1: Primary Objective and Endpoint Objective Endpoint Primary To evaluate and compare PFS in participants treated with pemigatinib in combination with pembrolizumab (Treatment Group A) and pemigatinib alone (Treatment Group B) versus SOC (Treatment Group C). Differences in PFS will be evaluated hierarchically, and the comparison between pemigatinib in combination with pembrolizumab (Treatment Group A) and SOC (Treatment Group C) will be evaluated first, and if significant difference is detected, a second comparison will be made in PFS between pemigatinib alone (Treatm ent Group B) and SOC (Treatment Group C). Hypothesis: The combination of pembrolizumab plus pemigatinib has superior PFS as compared with SOC. Contribution of pemigatinib alone to combination will be assessed by comparing Treatment Groups A and C and Treatment Groups B and C. Progression -free survival, defined as the time from randomization date until the date of disease progression (as measured by BICR per RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Overall Design: Table 2 presents the key study design elements. Further study details are presented after the table."

Number of Participants Approximately 372 participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups (124 participants per group): • Treatment Group A: Pemigatinib + pembrolizumab • Treatment Group B: Pemigatinib • Treatment Group C: SOC (gemcitabine/carboplatin or pembrolizumab) Study Design Active -controlled, open -label, and randomized. Randomization will occur after the participant has completed screening. Participants will be stratified by eligible to receive carboplatin vs not elig ible to receive carboplatin , PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10 vs CPS < 10 , and LN-only disease versus other metastatic disease. This is an event -driven clinical study designed to ensure power to detect success of the primary endpoint of PFS . A total of 210 PFS events in the combined treatment groups of pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab and SOC are needed. Estimated Duration of Study Participation Up to 35 days for scree ning followed by continuous treatment in consecutive 21 -day cycles as long as participants are receiving benefit and have not met any criteria for study withdrawal, and at least 30 days after the last dose of study treatment for follow -up. Participants wh o receive pembrolizumab may receive up to 35 cycles of pembrolizumab (approximately 2 years). Participants who receive pemigatinib may receive treatment until disease progression. Participants who receive carboplatin and gemcitabine may receive 4 to 6 cycles . The safety follow -up visit is 30 days after the last dose of study treatment . Report SAEs occurring within 90 days after the last dose of study treatment or within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment when starting a new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier . It is estimated that an individual will participate for approximately 18 months. DMC Yes (internal and external) Treatment Groups and Duration: Table 3: Treatment Groups for Randomization Treatment Group Regimen A Pemigatinib 13.5 mg QD POa until PD + pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W IV up to 35 cycles (approx imately 2 years) or PD, whichever occurs first B Pemigatinib 13.5 mg QD POa until PD C One of 2 SOC treatment options: 1. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 Q3W IV on Days 1 and 8 + carboplatin AUC 5 (or AUC 4.5 if required per local guidelines) Q3W on Day 1 or 2 for 4 to 6 cycles . (Participants whose tumors express PD -L1 CPS < 10 who are eligible to receive carboplatin.) OR 2. Pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W IV up to 35 cycles (approx imately 2 years) . (Participants whose tumors express PD -L1 CPS ≥ 10 or participants who are not considered eligible to receive any platinum -containing chemotherapy regardless of PD -L1 expression status [only applicable in regions where pembrolizumab is used as SOC for participants who are not eligible for any platinum -containing chemotherapy regardless of PD -L1 status ].) a Participants not reaching the target serum phosphate during Cycle 1 will increase the daily dose to 18 mg starting at Cycle 2 as described in Section 6.6.2.1 ."

Background Pemigatinib is an inhibitor of the FGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases that is proposed for the treatment of UC. Aberrant signaling through FGFR resulting from gene amplification or mutation, chromosomal translocation, and ligand-dependent activation of the receptors has been demonstrated in multiple types of human cancers. Fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling contributes to the development of malignancies by promoting tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. In this study, the sponsor is proposing to study pemigatinib monotherapy or pemigatinib in combination with pembrolizumab for th e treatment of metastatic or unresectable UC in the first- line setting in participants who are cisplatin -ineligible and whose tumors have an FGFR3 mutation or rearrangement as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. Refer to the IB for additional background information on pemigatinib. 2.1.1. Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition in Oncology The mammalian FGFR family is composed of 4 highly conserved receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4) that have an extracellular ligand -binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Eighteen FGF ligands, divided into canonical and hormonal FGFs, bind to FGFRs, leading to receptor dimerization, activation of the kinase domain, and transphosphorylation of the receptors ( Eswarakumar et al 2005 ). Subsequent signal transduction occurs through phosphorylation of substrate proteins, such as FGFR substrate 2, which leads to activation of the RAS mitogen –activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase–protein kinase B pathways and of the phospholipase Cγ that activates the protein kinase C pathway. In some cellular context, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins are also activated by FGFRs. Signaling through the FGF -FGFR pathway is tightly controlled through feedback regulation. Mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatases and Sprouty proteins are upregulated upon FGFR stimulation and antagonize FGF- dependent activatio n of extracellular signal -regulated kinases. In many cases, FGFR pathway activation promotes cell proliferation, survival, and migration; however, cellular context plays an important role, and in certain tissues, FGFR signaling results in growth arrest and cellular differentiation ( Dailey et al 2005). In adults, FGF-FGFR signaling is involved in angiogenesis during wound healing. The hormonal FGF ligands contribute to regulation of metabolic pathways involving lipid, glucose, phosphate, and vitamin D ( Itoh 2010). Genetic defects in the FGF23 -signaling pathway lead to disordered phosphate metabolism: loss of function mutations in FGF23 or its signaling results in retention of phosphate and tissue mineralizing, while gain of function mutations in the FGF23 pathway manifests as hypophosphatemic Rickets syndrome ( Farrow and White 2010)."
24,page_24,"Incyte Corporation Page 24 of 111 Protocol INCB 54828- 205 Am 1 Version 2 17 APR 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Strong genetic and functional evidence supports that dysregulation of FGFR can lead to the establishment and progression of cancer. Genetic alterations in FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 have been described in many tumor types ( Knights and Cook 2010, Turner and Grose 2010 ). Thes e include activating mutations, translocations, and gene amplification resulting in ligand independent constitutive activation of the receptors or aberrant ligand-dependent signaling through FGFRs. Mutations that lead to activation of FGFR3 occur in 50% to 70% of low- grade superficial bladder cancer ( Knowles and Hurst 2015). The most prevalent FGFR3 mutations are Ser to Cys changes in the extracellular domain that promote autodimerization and ligand independent activation of signaling ( di Martino et al 2009). These mutations match germline mutations in FGFR3 that are described in congenital skeletal dysplasias ( Greulich and Pollock 2011). In high- grade muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer, activating mutations of FGFR3 occur in 11% of cases and increases in copy number in an additional 3% ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2014). Translocations involving FGFR3 have also been described in bladder cancer including the intrachromosomal rearrangement generating the FGFR3 —transforming acidic coiled -coil– containing protein 3 fusion ( Williams et al 2013 ). Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 is a target of the t(4;14) translocation that affects approximately 15% of multiple myeloma patients (Chesi et al 1997). This balanced translocation adjoins the FGFR3 coding sequence to the strong IgH en hancer elements in plasma cells and drives high levels of FGFR3 expression. Finally, recent large scale tumor sequencing efforts have uncovered multiple, but rare, transforming alterations in FGFR genes across a number of tumor histologies ( Liao et al 2013, Wu et al 2013). In addition to these examples where FGFR dysregulation is a primary driver of tumorigenesis, FGFR has been reported to be a mechanism for resistance to hormone therapy in breast cancer and to EGFR inhibitors in non–small cell lung cancer by providing an alternative survival pathway ( Turner et al 2010, Ware et al 2010 ). A substantial body of evidence supports that a genetical ly activated FGFR pathway sensitizes FGFR -altered cancer cells to knockdown or inhibition of these receptors ( Kunii et al 2008, Lamont et al 2011, Qing et al 2009, Weiss et al 2010 ). A large screen of more than 500 tumor cell lines with a selective FGFR inhibitor demonstrated that only a small percentage (5.9%) of all cells are sensitive to FGFR inhibition, and growth-suppressed cell line s were highly enriched for FGFR alterations ( Guagnano et al 2012). These results demonstrate that FGFR inhibitors are active in a targeted manner against cancers with activated FGFR pathway. An implication of these data i s that selection based on molecular- , genetic -, or protein-based diagnostic tests for specific FGFR alterations in tumors may be important for identifying patients most likely to benefit from an FGFR inhibitor. Results from early clinical studies of selective FGFR inhibitors, including pemigatinib, have shown a tolerable safety profile for the class and preliminary signs of clinical benefit in participants with FGF/FGFR alterations (Seikfer et al 2019 )."

Overview and Treatment of Urothelial Carcinoma Globally, bladder cancer was the 11th most common cancer based on 2018 estimates, accounting for approximately 549,000 new cases and 200,000 deaths ( Global Cancer Observatory 2019). Urothelial carc inoma is the predominant histologic type of bladder cancer in the United States and Western Europe, where it accounts for approximately 90 percent of bladder cancers. Also known as TCC , bladder cancer describes a range of tumors arising from the urothelial endothelium and includes the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, and urethra. The majority of patients with TCC develop localized, non- invasive disease. However, approximately 25% of patients will have muscle -invasive disease and either present with or later develop metastases (von der Maase et al 2005 ). A number of clinical and molecular characteristics have been shown to correlate with survival. Poor performance status and the presence of visceral (ie, pulmonary, liver, bone) metastases correlate with shortened survival in clinical studies. This was illustrated by an intergroup study that compared cisplatin alone with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin in patients with metastatic disease ( Loehrer et al 1992 ). The presence of bone or liver metastases and poor performance status were most predictive of poor response and survival. The presence of these unfavorable features was associated with median survival of 4 months, compared with 18 months in those participants without these features. No p articipants with liver or bone metastases and only 1 participant with a Karnofsky performance status < 80% survived beyond 6 years ( Saxman et al 1997 ). Several subsequent reports confirmed the relationship between shortened survival and poor performance status or the presence of visceral metastases. In the second -line setting (patients with platinum- refractory TCC), multivar iate analysis identified ECOG performance status > 1, hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL, and the presence of liver metastasis as the main adverse prognostic factors for OS ( Bellmunt et al 2010 ). These factors illustrate that since bladder cancer is more often a disease of the elderly and infirm, many patients cannot benefit from modern cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens, and other treatment options are needed for this large population of patients. Based on NCCN guidelines ( NCCN 2019), the current SOC for the initial treatment of metastatic, locally advanced bladder cancer is systemic chemotherapy with or without a platinum-containing regimen. The median survival with combination chemotherapy is approximately 14 to 15 months ( von der Maase et al 2005 ). While this is superior to the estimated 6 -month survival with metastatic disease prior to the development of modern chemotherapy regimens, the 5 -year survival rate is approximately 15% with contemporary chemotherapy regimens. Second -line chemotherapy, usually as a single agent, has had only a limited role, with a modest increase in median 2-month OS) , which was at best 6.9 months as compared with best supportive care ( Bellmunt et al 2009 ). NCCN guidelines for recommendation of chemotherapy also highlight specific medical comorbidities, such as performance status along with cardiac function and renal dysfunction, in consideration of the appropriate treatment. A Phase 3 study comparing gemcitabine /carboplatin with methotrexate/carboplatin/vinblastine in cisplatin -ineligible participants demonstrated a median survival of only 8 to 9 months with both regimens ( De Santis et al 2012 ). Notably, those with both poor renal function and poor performance status fared especially poorly with combination chemotherapy in this study. Thus, there remains a significant unmet medical need for well -tolerated active therapies in this population."
26,page_26,"Incyte Corporation Page 26 of 111 Protocol INCB 54828- 205 Am 1 Version 2 17 APR 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Treatment for bladder cancer has evolved over time to encompass not only traditional chemotherapy, but has been particularly impacted by the use of immunotherapy (Bellmunt et al 2017). The PD -1/PD- L1 in hibitors such as atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and durvalumab have demonstrated activity and are currently being evaluated in randomized clinical studies in patients with UC. These include studies as first - and second -line therapy and as well as in the adjuvant setting. Pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab, and avelumab recently received a ccelerated approval from the FDA for the treatment of advanced UC that has progressed during or after previous platinum- based chemotherapy. In addition, atezolizumab received a ccelerated approval from the FDA for the treatment of advanced UC who were not eligible for cisp latin-containing chemotherapy. On 18 MAY 2017, the FDA granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who were not eligible for cisplatin -containing chemotherapy, based on data from a multicenter, open- label, single -arm study , KEYNOTE -052 (NCT02335424), investigating pembrolizumab in 370 participants . On that same day , the FDA granted regular approval to pembrolizumab for patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Approval was based on data from a multicenter, randomized, active- controlled study, KEYNOTE -045. Participants were randomized to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W IV (N = 270) or the i nvestigator’s choice of paclit axel, docetaxel, or vinflunine ( Bellmunt et al 2017, K eytruda® 2019). In addition to pembrolizumab, atezolizumab was also granted an accelerated approval (18 MAY 2016) for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic UC who were not eligible for cisplatin -containing chemotherapy based on data f rom IMvigor210, which wa s a single -arm, open-label study that included 310 participants . Patients received 1200 mg of atezolizumab Q3W IV (Balar et al 2017b, Tecentriq® 2019). Subsequent to the accelerated approvals of pembrolizu mab and atezolizumab, on 18 MAY 2018, the FDA initiated guidance on decreased survival associated with the use of pembrolizumab or atezolizumab as monotherapy compared to platinum- based chemotherapy in clinical studie s to treat patients with metastatic UC who have not received prior therapy and who have low expression of the protein PD -L1 (FDA 2018b). For these patients, systemic chemotherapy continues to be the recommended treatment option. Based on the revised indication, Pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who are not eligible for cisplatin -containing therapy and whose tumors express PD- L1 (CPS ≥ 10) or in patients who are not e ligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy regardless of PD -L1 status. More effective and less toxic treatments are greatly needed in this patient population, and immunotherapy offers additional options for patients progressing after their initial s ystemic therapy."

Study Rationale Pemigatinib is a potent selective inhibitor of FGFR1, F GFR2, and FGFR3. This compound, as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab, is proposed for the first- line treatment of participants with metastatic or unres ectable UC with FGFR3 mutations or rearrangements who are not eligible to receive platinum containing regimens. 2.2.1. Scientific Rationale for Study Design The planned study will evaluate the safety of pemigatinib as a monotherapy or in combination with pembroli zumab as a first -line treatment in participants with metastatic or unresectable UC with FGFR3 mutations or rearrangements . Current practice guidelines ( NCCN 2019) for metastatic or unresectable bladder cancer indicate that patients who are not eligible to receive cisplatin as the preferred regimen in combination with gemcitabine, should instead receive the combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine. In addition, patients whose tumors express PD- L1, or who are not eligible f or any platinum-containing chemotherapy regardless of PD- L1, may also receive approved checkpoint inhibitors (ie, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab) . Based on available data from a large Phase 2 /3 study conducted in this population, the median PFS in a gemcitabine and carboplatin group is expected to be 5.8 months ( De Santis et al 2012 ). Pembrolizumab was approved based on efficacy results observed in KEYNOTE-052. An ORR of 29% was observed in all participants with 21% and 47% ORR in those with PD- L1 CPS < 10 and ≥ 10 respectively. Both CRs and PRs were also higher in the PD -L1 CPS ≥ 10 group (15% and 32% , respectively) as compared with those in all participants and PD -L1 CPS < 10 (Keytruda 2019 ). Based on data from study KEYNOTE -052, median PFS in first -line treatment of cisplatin -ineligible patients, regardless of tumor CPS score, with pembrolizumab was 2.3 months, and median OS was 11.5 months. In participants whose tumors expressed CPS ≥ 10, the median PFS was 4.9 months, and the median OS was 18.5 months. Preliminary data from the ongoing Phase 2 study (INCB 54828-201) with pemigatinib as monotherapy in second- line or greater treatment have shown clinical activity and tolerable safety in 159 UC participants with FGFR alterations (more pronounced in FGFR3 mutations or translocations) has shown an ORR of 21.3% and a median PFS of 4.1 months. As of a data cutoff date of 25 NOV 2018, the safety and tolerability of pemigatinib admin istered alone or in combination with another chemotherapy/immunotherapy was being evaluated in 5 ongoing clinical studies in participants with advanced malignancies. Participants with metastatic or unresectable UC had received pemigatinib 13.5 mg QD on a 2-weeks -on/1- week -off therapy schedule or on a continuous schedule; 99 participants with FGFR3 mutations or fusions received the interval schedule, and 7 participants with FGFR3 mutations or fusions received the continuous schedule. Based on preliminary unaudited data from these ongoing studies, the most frequently occurring TEAEs (ie, incidence > 20%) were (in descending order of frequency) hyperphosphatemia, diarrhea, alopecia, fatigue, dry mouth, stomatitis, constipation, dysgeusia, nausea, decreased appetite, and anemia."

29,page_29,"Incyte Corporation Page 29 of 111 Protocol INCB 54828- 205 Am 1 Version 2 17 APR 2020 CONFIDENTIAL No change in PK parameters is expected for continuous administration, as steady -state concentrations are expected to be reached at Day 4 based on a half -life of 20.2 hours. However, at the 13.5 mg dose, the continuous dose regimen increased the average per cycle exposure of pemigatinib by 50%. Hyperphosphatemia is an expected on -target pharmacological effect of FGFR inhibition. The magnitude and frequency of hyperphosphatemia (defined as any postbaseline phosphate level exceeding 5.5 mg/dL), which is managed with a low-phosphate diet and introduction of phosphate binders, appears to be dose-dependent as demonstrated in Parts 1 and 2 of Study INCB 54828-101 ( refer to the IB). The majority of participants treated at 13.5 mg experienced hyperphosphatemia. Although hyperphosphatemia has been observed in the majority of participants treated with pemigatinib, some participants do not achieve hyperphosphatemia where pharmacological concentration s of pemigatinib in these participants may be lower. In a population E max model, those participants treated with pemigatinib 13.5 mg who did not develop hyperphosphatemia, the AUC with pemigatinib 18 mg was estimated using a linear exposure relationship. The simulation suggested that the serum phosphate may increase above 5.5 mg/dL after treatment with pemigatinib 18 mg for the participants treated with pemigatinib 13.5 mg who did not develop hyperphosphatemia. Any participant who does not reach the target serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg /dL at any time during Cycle 1 and who is compliant with taking study drug and does not experience an ongoing Grade 2 or higher treatment -related AEs will increase the daily dose to 18 mg QD starting at Cycle 2 Day 1. Refer to the IB for more information. Dose modifications for tolerability issues are noted in Section 6.6. 2.2.2.2. Pembrolizumab The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg Q3W up to 35 cycles . Based on the totality of data generated in the KEYTRUDA development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor type. As outlined below, this dose is justified by: • Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demonstrating flat dose - and exposure - efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q2W. • Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in b enefit -risk including OS at 200 mg Q3W a cross multiple indications. • Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred from PK data) and tumor (inferred from PBPK analysis) at 200 mg Q3W."
30,page_30,"Incyte Corporation Page 30 of 111 Protocol INCB 54828- 205 Am 1 Version 2 17 APR 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Among the 8 randomized dose-comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with melano ma and NSCLC, covering different disease settings (ie, treatment nai ve, previously treated, PD -L1 enriched , and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg /kg Q2W (KEYNOTE -001 B2, -001 D, -002, -010, and -021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KEYNOTE -001 B3, -001 F2, and -006). All of these studies demonstrated flat dose- and exposure-response relationships across the doses studied repre senting an approximate 5- to 7.5-fold difference in exposure. The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. Subsequently , flat dose/exposure-response relationships were also observed in other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastri c cancer and classical Hodgkin l ymphoma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose independent of the tumor type. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, which acts by interaction with immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells. Additionally, pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK d ata in KEYNOTE -001 evaluating target-mediated drug disposition conclusively demonstrated saturation of PD-1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W. Secondly, a PBPK analysis was conducted to predict tumor PD-1 saturation over a wide r ange of tumor penetration and PD- 1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD -1 satu ration in both blood and tumor. Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed-dosing provides similar control of PK variability as weight based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by these PK characteristics, and given that fixed -dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed- dose was selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols. A pembrolizumab monotherapy arm is added in this study in order to establish the magnitude of benefit from pemigatinib in the pembrolizumab plus pemigatinib combination regimen. Dose modifications for tolerability issues are noted in Section 6.6. 2.2.2.3. Gemcitabine and Carboplatin Cisplatin -based combination chemotherapy is standard first- line treatment for patients with advanced or me tastatic bladder cancer based on N CCN guidelines ( NCCN 2019) and EAU guidelines ( EAU 2019). However, cisplatin ineligibility is common in bladder cancer patients because of renal dysfunction ( CrCl < 60 mL/min), poor performance status ( ECOG performance status ≥ 2), New York Heart Association Class III heart failure, or Grade 2 or higher neuropathy or hearing loss ( Galsky 2015). As a result, the guidelines recommend a lternative treatments that include carboplatin plus gemcitabine or pembrolizumab monotherapy."

Overall Design This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized and active-controlled study of pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab or pemigatinib alone versus the SOC for participants with metastatic or unresectable UC not eligible to receive cisplatin and harboring FGFR3 mutation or rearrangement and who have not received prior treatment. Randomization will occur after the participant has completed screening. Participants will be stratified by eligible to receive carboplatin versus not elig ible to receive carboplatin , PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10 versus CPS < 10, and LN-only disease versus other metastatic disease. This is an event -driven clinical study designed to ensure power to detect success of the primary endpoint of PFS. A total of 210 PFS events in the combined treatment groups of pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab and S OC are needed to support the primary objective, where PFS is defined as the time from randomization date until the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first . Participants who are screened and found to have the FGFR3 mutation or rearrangement ) will be randomized 1:1:1 into 1 of the 3 treatment groups indicated in Table 8.

Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 Q3W IV on Days 1 and 8 + carboplatin AUC 5 (or AUC 4.5 if required per local guidelines) Q3W on Day 1 or 2 for 4 to 6 cycles. (Participants whose tumors express PD -L1 CPS < 10 who are eligible to receive carboplatin.) OR 2. Pembrolizu mab 200 mg Q3W IV up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years). (Participants whose tumors express PD -L1 CPS ≥ 10 or participants who are not considered eligible to receive any platinum -containing chemotherapy regardless of PD -L1 expression status [only applic able in regions where pembrolizumab is used as standard of care for participants who are not eligible for any platinum -containing chemotherapy regardless of PD -L1 status].) a Participants not reaching the target serum phosphate during Cycle 1 will increase the daily dose to 18 mg starting at Cycle 2 as described in Section 6.6.2.1 ."
36,page_36,"Incyte Corporation Page 36 of 111 Protocol INCB 54828- 205 Am 1 Version 2 17 APR 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Participant eligibility will be based on genomic testing for FGFR3 . Participants can be randomized based on local results, if available, and results will be retrospectively confirmed by the sponsor' s central laboratory. Previous therapies may include only neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum- containing chemotherapy if completed at least 12 months before the start of treatment for this study; otherwise , participants should be treatment naive before screening and according criteria outlined in Section 5. Treatment will start on Cycle 1 Day 1. Participants will undergo regular safety assessments during trea tment, as well as regular efficacy assessments. Participants will be allowed to continue administration in 3- week cycles , as per protocol for each treatment, until disease progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by BICR or unacceptable toxicity is reported. A futility analysis will be performed as described in Section 10.5. See Figure 1 for the study design. Full study drug administration info rmation can be found in Section 6. 4.2. Overall Study Duration The study begins when the first participant signs the ICF and enters into the screening period. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last scheduled procedure shown in the schedule of activities for the last participant in the study globally. A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of th e study including the last scheduled procedure shown in the schedule of activities (see Table 4 ), or the participant has died , and the date of death is available. If approximately 210 PFS events have been reported, a database lock of the study may occur to allow the analysis of the study data. Any remaining participants may continue to receive study treatment and be seen by the investigator as per institutional guidelines or standard clinical practice. The investigator will be expected to monitor for AEs and report any SAEs, and pregnancies, as detailed in Section 9, and continue to follow procedures for drug accountability. The remaining participants are considered to be on study until a discontinuation criterion is met and written notification is provided to the sponsor. 4.3. Study Termination The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the terms specified in the study contract . The investigator/head of study site (Japan) is to notify the IRB/IEC in writing of the study 's completion or early termination, send a copy of the notification to the sponsor or sponsor's designee, and retain 1 copy for the site study regulatory file. The sponsor may terminate the study electively, if required by regulatory decision or upon advice of the DMC (see Section 10.6).

These records should include dates, quantities, and any available batch or serial numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study participants. Completed accountability records will be archived by the site . The investigator , investigational drug storage manager, or designee will be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug until verified by the study monitor (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor). At the conclusion of the study, the investigator , investigational drug storage manager, or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard operating procedures. If local procedures mandate on -site destruction of investigational supply, the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of accountability by the investigative site . At sites where the study drug is destroyed before monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site's standard operating procedure. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused st udy treatments are provided in the Phar macy Manual. For Japan, phosphate binders are provided by the sponsor. Requirements for the accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance of the binders is the same as for study drug as described above. Further guidance and information are provided in the Japan- specific Pharmacy Manual . 6.4. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding The study will be open-label due to the clear pharmacodynamic impact of pemigatinib on the participant (elevation of serum phosphate/hyperphosphatemia). It is difficult to effectively blind the study, even with a double-dummy, due to serum phosphate elevation that occurs in most participants treated with pemigatinib. An ICR committee that is blinded to the assigned trea tment will be used to evaluate radiographic tumor response to support the primary and secondary endpoints to minimize bias. All participants will be centrally assigned to study treatment using an IRT. Before the study is initiated, the telephone number and call-in directions for the IRT and/or the log in information and directions for the IRT will be provided to each site. Full details will be provided in the IRT Study Reference Manual."

See Table 8 for study treatment groups to be randomized. 6.4.1. Stratification The stratific ation factors were selected to ensure that baseline chara cteristics known to have prognostic impact are distributed equally among the three treatment groups. Participants will be stratified by: • Carboplatin- eligible versus not eligible • PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10 versus PD-L1 CPS < 10 • LN-only disease versus other metastatic disease 6.4.1.1. PD-L1 CPS Results Recently acquired or archived tumor tissue (obtained since most recent therapy) from an unresectable or metastatic site must be analyzed and be evaluable for PD -L1 status during screening in order for a participant to be randomized. PD -L1 status can be evaluated locally or centrally prior to randomization. For pa rticipants who have PD- L1 status evaluated centrally, investigators will be blinded to the central vendor 's PD -L1 CPS results and will be alerted to completion of a participant 's PD -L1 evaluation, as well as to instances where the tumor tissue sample is inadequate for PD -L1 evaluation (not evaluable). PD -L1 CPS will influence stratification of patients prior to randomization into treatment groups. Note : In the event the participant does not have l ocal PD -L1 results or the sample is not evaluable for PD -L1, the participant will not be eligible . If a local result is available and the participant is randomized but the sample fails or the local result is not confirmed by the cen tral laboratory, the site should contact the medical monitor. Treatment Group C • For carboplatin -eligible participants , all participants with PD -L1 CPS ≥ 10 will be assigned to pembrolizumab if randomized to T reatment Group C. • For carboplatin -ineligible participants , all participants who are carboplatin ineligible will be assigned to p embrolizumab regardless of their PD-L1 status, if randomized to T reatment Group C. Note: Only applicable in regions where pembrolizumab is used as standard of care for participants who are not eligible for any platinum- containing chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status . 6.5. Study Treatment Compliance Compliance with all study -related treatments should be emphasized to the participant by the site personnel, and appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance during the study. Compliance with pemigatinib will be monitored/calculated by the sponsor based on the drug"

Participants will be instructed to bring all pemigatinib bottles/pills with them to the study visits in order for site personnel to conduct bottle/pill counts to assess study drug accountability . The drug accountability documentation will be used by the sponsor to calculate treatment compliance. Compliance with study drug administration of pembrolizumab, gemcitabine, and carboplatin will be calculated by the sponsor based on study drug accountability and infusion records documented by the site staff and monitored by the sponsor/designee. Refer to Section 9.10 for additional information on overdose. 6.6. Dose Modificat ions Individual decisions regarding dose modifications of pemigatinib, pembrolizumab, gemcitabine, and carboplatin should be made using clinical judgment and in consultation with the sponsor's medical monitor, taking into account relatedness of the AE to the study treatment and the participant's underlying condition. Adverse events that have a clear alternative explanation, or transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms, may be exempt from dose-reduction rules. Safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. 6.6.1. Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interruptions and Adjustments of Pemigatinib Treatment with pemigatinib may be delayed up to 2 weeks (14 days) to allow for resolution of toxicity. Participants may resume treatment if no medical condition or other circumstance exists that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the participant unsuitable for further participation in the study. The treating investigator should contact the sponsor to discuss the case of any participant whose treatment may be delayed for more than 14 days before restarting treatment with pemigatinib. For participants who present with possible or confirmed serous retinal detachment/retinal pigmented epithelium detachment (SRD/RPED) based on OCT, the guidelines in Table 12 should be followed. It is recommended to discuss the findings with the Incyte medical monitor before making changes to the participant's treatment. For participants randomized to receive pemigatinib in combination with pembrolizum ab (Treatment Group A), participants may continue to receive pemigatinib or pembrolizumab as a monotherapy if criteria are met for dose interruption or discontinuation of either component. Guidelines for interrupting/restarting pemigatinib are provided in Table 12."

Discontinue pemigatinib adm inistration and follow-up per Protocol. For pemigatinib dose adjustments, the following dose reductions are permitted: • Participants dosed at 13.5 mg can reduce a maximum of 2 dose levels down; they can decrease to 9 mg, and, if additional dose reduction is required, participants can decrease to 4.5 mg. • Participants who are up-titrated to 18 mg as described in Section 6.6.2.1 can reduce a maximum of 3 dose levels down (13.5 mg then 9 mg) to 4.5 mg if indicated. Dose reductions below 4.5 mg are not allowed for any treatment group receiving pemigatinib. The frequen cy of dosing remains the same (QD) as well as the schedule (continuous dosing). 6.6.2. Management of Hyperphosphatemia Hyperphosphatemia is an expected on -target pharmacologic effect of FGFR inhibition. Hyperphosphatemia should be managed with diet modifications, phosphate binders and diuretics, or a dose reduction per the recommendations in Table 13. If binders are used to manage hyperphosphatemia during treatment, it is recommended to stop binders at the same time pemigatinib is stopped to reduce risk of hypophosphatemia."

Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Pemigatinib The occurrence of unacceptable toxicity not caused by the underl ying disease will require that the pemigatinib be permanently discontinued. Unacceptable toxicity is defined as follows: • Occurrence of an AE that is related to pemigatinib that, in the judgment of the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor, comprom ises the participant's ability to continue study-specific procedures or is considered to not be in the participant's best interest. • An AE requiring more than the maximum amount of dose reductions. • Persistent AE requiring a delay of therapy for more than 3 weeks ( 21 days) unless a greater delay has been approved by the sponsor. • Increase in QT/QTcF to > 500 ms or to > 60 ms over ba seline. In case of a QTcF > 500 ms , the participant must be hospitalized , and a continuous ECG monitoring must be set up until th e measure of the QTc F interval decreases below 500 ms and until acceptable in the opinion of a local cardiologist. See Section 7 for discontinuation procedures. 6.6.4. Criteria for Procedures for Doses Interruptions or Adjustments of Pembrolizumab , Gemcitabine , and Carboplatin These agents are approved therapies and have specific participant safety management guidelines within the prescribing information; the treating investigator should refer to and follow the labeled guidances . See Appendix B for criteria specific for pembrolizumab. 6.7. Concomitant Medications and Procedures All concomitant medications and treatments (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, vaccines, and/or herbal supplements) must be recorded in the eCRF. Any prior medication received up to 28 days before the fi rst dose of study treatment and 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, or until the participant begins a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, will be recorded in the eCRF . Any addition, deletion, or change in the dose of these medications will also be recorded . Concomitant medications administered 90 days after the last dose of study treatment should be recorded for SAEs as defined in Section 9. Concomitant treatments/procedures that are required to manage a participant 's medical condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF. The medical monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy. 6.7.1. Restricted Medications and Procedures Pemigatinib is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. There is a sufficient safety margin, with doses greater than the recommended Phase 2 dose of 13.5 mg QD having been tested, and up to 20 mg QD is tolerable. The expected 50% increase in exposure in participants who concomitantly use CYP3A4 moderate inhibitors is covered by the safety margin. Therefore, the use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should involve careful monitoring, especially in relation to"
53,page_53,"Incyte Corporation Page 53 of 111 Protocol INCB 54828- 205 Am 1 Version 2 17 APR 2020 CONFIDENTIAL safety, while moderate CYP3A4 inducers and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are prohibited (see Appendix D ). Careful monitoring is required when pemigatinib is concomitantly administered with OCT2 substrates such as dofetilide and metformin. Calcium -based phosphate binding medications should not be used due to a concern for soft tissue mineralization. However, if other types of phosphate binders (eg , calcium -free sevelamer or lanthanum) are not available in certain regions, calcium -based binders may be used with appropriate clinical monitoring. 6.7.2. Prohibited Medications and Procedures 6.7.2.1. Prohibited Medications and Procedures for Pemigatinib A CYP3A4 -mediated DDI study (INCB 54828- 104) indicated there is evidence of a clinically significant effect on pemigatinib exposure when coadministered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole (increased pemigatinib AUC by 88%) or potent CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin (decreased pemigatinib AUC by 85%). A PBPK model was developed and validated using in vitro and clinical DDI data. PBPK model- simulated pemigatinib AUCs were increased by approximately 50% for moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and decreased by more than 50% for moderate CYP3A4 inducers. In addition, PBPK modeling showed no DDI effect when pemigatinib was coadministered with a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer. The following medications and measures are prohibited for pemigatinib. • The concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers and moderate CYP3A4 inducers (s ee Appendix D ). Based on the low overall bioavailability of topica l ketoconazole, there are no restrictions on topical ketoconazole. • Any concomitant use of a selective FGFR inhibitor (other than pemigatinib). • Investigational study drug for any indication. • Use of any anticancer medications other than the study medicatio ns being tested in this Protocol. • Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing study. Refer to the IB for more information on DDIs. Dose modifications for toler ability issues are noted in Section 6.6. 6.7.2.2.

Physiologic doses of corticosteroids not exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent may be used during the study. Note : Inhaled steroids are allowed for management of asthma or seasonal allergies. • Radiation therapy: Palliative radiotherapy is permitted to a single lesion or to the brain (after discussion with the sponsor) if considered medically necessary by the treating physician, as long as the lesion is NOT a RECIST v1.1-defined target lesion and radiotherapy is NOT administered for tumor control. • Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of study intervention and while participating in the study. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist ) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. For participants who, in an assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management, continuation of study treatment and further participation in the study must be discussed and agreed upon with the sponsor. If participants receive additional anticancer therapies, this will be judged to represent evidence of PD, and study treatment will be discontinued. These participants should complete all end -of- t reatment assessments and continue to be followed for survival in the follow-up period. 6.7.3. Permitted Medications and Procedures 6.7.3.1. Rescue Medications and Supportive Care for Pembrolizumab Participants should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the treating investigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potential immunologic etiology are outlined along with the dose modification guidelines in Appendix B . Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV treatment with corticosteroids, as well as additional anti- inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional suppor tive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab."

Discontinuation Procedures In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study treatment, the EOT visit should be conducted. Reasonable efforts should be made to have the participant return for a follow-up visit. These visits are described in the schedule of activities (see Table 4). The last date of the last dose of study treatment and the reason for discontinuation of study treatment will be recorded in the eCRF. If a participant is discontinued from study treatment: • The study monitor or sponsor must be notified immediately. • The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the participant's medical record, and the primary reason for withdrawal must be included in the eCRF. • The EOT visit should be performed. • The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the IRT. • Participants must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until study treatment–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longest. If the participant discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of follow-up data (safety follow-up or disease assessment), then no additional data collection should occur; however, participants will have the option of withdrawing consent for study treatment but continuing in the follow-up period of the study for safety, efficacy, and survival assessments."

Bone scans at baseline must be sent to central imaging vendor for review with initial tumor imaging. Participants with positive bone scans at baseline will be followed with additional scans performed every 9 weeks (± 7 days) from date of randomization, or more frequently if clinically indicated. For participants with new symptoms suggestive of osseous metastasis, a bone scan should be obtained. Additionally, plain X- ray evaluation should be obtained for symptomatic sites with negative bone scan evaluations. When the investigator identifies radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1, the central imaging vendor will perform expedited verification of radiologic PD, and communicate the results to the study site and sponsor. Treatment should continue until PD has been verified. For participants who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by radiographic imaging until the start of new anticancer treatment, disease progression, pregnancy, death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs f irst. 8.2.1.1. Initial Tumor Imaging Initial tumor imaging at screening must be performed within 35 days prior to the date of randomization. Any imaging obtained after Cycle 1 Day 1 cannot be included in the screening assessment. The site study team must review screening images to confirm that the participant has measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. Screening images must be submitted to the BICR committee for retrospective review. Tumor imaging performed as part of routine clinical management is acceptable as screening imaging if it is of diagnostic quality and performed within 35 days prior to the date of randomization and can be assessed by BICR. Tumor imaging required at baseline includes the following: • CT (preferred) or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis • CT of the chest • Bone scan (whole body) and brain imaging only if pa rticipant has clinical symptoms of brain or bone metastases If brain imaging is performed to document the stability of existing metastases, MRI should be used if possible. If MRI is medically contraindicated, CT with contrast is an acceptable alternative . 8.2.2.

Brain imaging and bone scans must be repeated at the same frequency as other imaging assessments if positive at baseline or if pa rticipan ts exhibit symptoms indicative of bone or brain metastases. Objective response should be confirmed by a repeat imaging assessment. Tumor imaging to confirm PR or CR should be performed at least 4 weeks after the first indication of a response. Participan ts will then return to regular scheduled imaging, starting with the next scheduled imaging time point. Participants who have additional imaging for confirmation do not need to undergo the next scheduled tumor imaging if it is less than 4 weeks later; tumor imaging may resume at the subsequent scheduled imaging timepoint.

End of Treatment and Follow -Up Tumor Imaging For participants who discontinue study treatment, tumor imaging should be performed at the time of treatment discontinuation (± 4 weeks) . If previous imaging was obtained within 4 weeks prior to the date of discontinuation, imaging at treatment discontinuation is not mandatory. For participants who discontinue study treatment due to documented disease progression, this is the final required tumor imaging. For participants who discontinue study treatment without documented disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring disease s tatus by tumor imaging with the same imaging schedule used during treatment , calculated from the date of randomization until the start of new anticancer treatment, disease progression, pregnancy, death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. 8.2.3. ECOG Performance Status ECOG performance status (see Table 14) will be assessed at the visits specified in the schedule of activities (see Table 4).

Quality of Life Assessments The EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ-5D- 5L are not pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected by both disease progression and treatment tolerability. Participants will be asked to complete the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ- 5D-5L. Questionnaires must be completed at each interval prior to receiving study treatment as indicated in the schedule of activities (see Table 4 ). 8.3.1. EORTC QLQ -C30 The EORTC QLQ -C30 is the most widely used cancer specific health -related quality of life instrument, which contains 30 items and measures 5 functional dimensions ( ie, physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 3 symptom items ( ie, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), 6 single items ( ie, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global health and quality of life scale ( Aaronson et al 1993). The reliability, validity, and practicality of these instruments have been reported. This instrument is translated and validated into more than 80 languages. For each scale and single item, a linear transformation will be applied to standardize the scores between 0 (worst) and 100 ( best) as described in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual. 8.3.2. EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome ( Rabin and de Charro 2001). The EQ -5D- 5L will provide data for use in economic models and analyses including developing health utilities or quality adjusted life years. The 5 health state dimensions in this instrument include the following: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated on a three point scale from 1 (extreme problem) to 3 (no problem). The EQ -5D- 5L also includes a graded (0 to 100) vertical visual analog scale on whi ch the participant rates his or her general state of health at the time of the assessment. The EQ-5D- 5L will always be completed by participants first before completing the EORTC QLQ -C30."

Safety Assessments See Section 6.6 for guidelines regarding the management of relevant laboratory or other safety assessment abnormalities. 8.5.1. Adverse Events Adverse events (CTCAE v 5.0) will be monitored from the time the participant signs the ICF until at least 30 days for after the last dose of study treatment . SAEs must be reported up until 90 days after the last dose of study tre atment or 30 days if participant starts a new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier . Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse Events F orm in the eCRF regardless of the assumption of a causal relationsh ip with the study treatments . Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded on the Medical History Form in the eCRF. Adverse events (including laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than by individual underlying signs and symptoms. Adverse events will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant 's legally authorized representative) . The inv estigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following-up on AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment /procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant, such as ""How are you feeling? "" is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences . Adverse events may also be detected when they are volunteered by the participant during the screening process or between visits, or through physical examinations, laboratory tests, or other assessments. The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs are described in Section 9. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contac ts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). For Japanese participants , the relationship to phosphate binders should also be collected on the Adverse Events Form in the eCRF. 8.5.2. Physical Examinations Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual, such as a licensed physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, as local law permits . Abnormalities identified after the first dose of study treatment constitute an AE if they are considered clinically meaningful, induc e clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes in study treatment. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. At the screening visit, a comprehensive physical examination should be conducted. The comprehensive physical examination will include height and body weight, and assessment(s) of"
65,page_65,"Incyte Corporation Page 65 of 111 Protocol INCB 54828- 205 Am 1 Version 2 17 APR 2020 CONFIDENTIAL the following organ or body systems: skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; abdomen (liver , spleen); extremities; and lymph nodes; as well as a brief neurological examination. During the study, participants will be assessed by the investigator or medically qualified designee per institutional SOC . These targeted examinations should be an evaluation as indicated by participant symptoms, AEs, or other findings and documented on the AE eCRF. 8.5.3. Vital Signs Vital sign measurements (to be taken before blood collection for laboratory tests), include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature. If vital signs cannot be taken before blood collection for laboratory tests, there must be a minimum of 30 minutes from the completion of the blood collection procedures to the beginning of the vital signs collection. Blood pressure and puls e will be taken with the participant in the recumbent, semirecumbent, or sitting position after 5 minutes of rest. Weight will also be assessed at each study visit . Abnormal vital sign results identified after the first dose of study treatment constitute an AE if they are considered clinically meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes in study treatment . 8.5.4. Electrocardiograms A single 12-lead ECG will be obtained at the study visits noted in the schedule of activities (see Table 4). The ECGs will be performed with the participant in a supine or semisupine position after approximately 5 to 10 minutes of rest . Sites should use an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. If the screening ECG renders abnormal but not clinically significant results, the investigator should use clinical judgement to pe rform additional monitoring during study treatment. Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs. In the event that a single QTc is > 480 ms at screening, the participant may enroll if the average QTc for the 3 ECGs is ≤ 480 ms or with approval from the medical monitor. For participants with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval > 120 ms) at screening, the JTc interval may be used in place of the Q Tc with medical monitor approval. The JTc must be ≤ 340 ms if JTc is used in place of the QTc. In addition, the JTc interval should be used for all subsequent assessments. 8.5.5. Comprehensive Eye Examination A comprehensive eye examination should be performed by a qualified ophthalmologist at screening on all participants , once every 3 cycles (± 7 days starting with Cycle 3 ) for participants randomized to Treatment Groups A and B only , at EOT for all participants , and as clinically indicated. The eye examinati on should include a visual acuity test, slit- lamp examination, funduscopy with digital imaging , and OCT . Every effort should be made to ensure that all subsequent examinations are performed by the same ophthalmologist. 8.5.6. Laboratory Assessments See Table 15 for the list of clinical labora tory tests to be performed and the schedule of activities for the timing and frequency (see Table 4). The site's local laboratory will perform all clinical"

Additional testing may be required by the sponsor based on emerging safety data. All Protocol-required laboratory assessments must be conducted in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and the schedule of activities (see Table 4). Information regarding collection , processing, and shipping of laboratory assessments is provided in the Laboratory Manual. Serum phosphate testing is required on a more frequent basis if a participant develops hyperphosphatemia during Cycle 1 and is up- titrated (see Section 6.6.2.1). Parathyroid hormone (endocrine) testing will be required at baseline and every 3 cycles starting with Cycle 3 (only for participants who are randomized to receive a regimen that includes pemigatinib) as parathyroid hormone plays a role in calcium and phosphate hemostasis ( Khundmiri et al 2016). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlyi ng disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant 's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 30 days a fter the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. Screening laboratory assessments must be performed within 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 . If performed more than 14 days before Cycle 1 Day 1, then the tests must be repeated and eligibility confirmed before study treatment administration on Cycle 1 Day 1. Laboratory samples collected on study Day 1 must be performed before study treatment administration . After Cycle 1, predose laboratory procedures can be conducted up to 72 hours before study treatment administration (within the 3 -day study window), and results should be reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee and found to be acceptable before a new cycle of treatment is initiated. See Section 9.1 for information regarding laboratory abnormalities that should be r ecorded as an AE in the eCRF. Additionally, i f laboratory values from laboratory assessments performed at the institution 's local laboratory require a change in participant management (eg, require treatment), or are considered clinically significant by th e investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the result(s) of the specific laboratory assessment(s) must be recorded in the eCRF."

Pharmacodynamic and Translational Assessments Refer to Table 4, Table 5 , Table 17, and Figure 2 for additional information on timing of assessments. 8.7.1. Tumor Tissue Collection and Requirements All potential participants must have documented FGFR3 mutation or re arrangement and PD- L1 status prior to randomization ; screening and randomization may be based on local genomics and PD- L1 results, but confirmatory testing through the sponsor’s central laboratory will be performed on all participants during the study. Pa rticipants who have a Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx report will not need to have their PD- L1 status confirmed centrally. Participants who have a documented FGFR3 mutation or rearrangement confirmed by Foundation Medicine do not need the FGFR status reconfirmed centrally if the report is within 24 months. Since confirmation via central laboratory is required , a pathologist review/quality check of samples should be performed prior to shipment. Based on data from study INCB 54828-201, the concordance rate for FGFR testing was about 90% for approximately 20 participants. Requirement of biopsies for FGFR3 genomic alteration ( see Section 8.7.1.1 ) and PD- L1 test ( see Section 8.7.1.2): a tumor tissue sample from < 24 months prior to screening from the primary or metastatic lesion or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy from the primary or metastatic lesion that were not previously irradiated must be provided to the central laboratory for testing. Formalin fixed, paraffi n-embedded tissue blocks are preferred to slides. If providing slides, the requirement is 15 to 25 unstained consecutive FFPE slides ( see Figure 2). Newl y obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue. Tissue from a metastatic lesion or advanced bladder cancer is preferred to NMIBC or MIBC. Detailed instructions for tissue collection, handling, processing, and shipment are provided in the Laboratory Manual. 8.7.1.1. Tumor For Genomics Testing for FGFR Genetic Alterations and Gene Expression If submitting unstained cut slides, 10 unstained, consecutive FFPE, newly cut slides should be submitted to the testing laboratory (Foundation Medicine) within 30 days from the date they are cut (details pertaining to tumor submission are in the Procedures Manual). Details for sample collection, processing, and shipping will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. Pa rticipants who have a documented FGFR3 mutation or rearrangement confirmed by Foundation Medicine do not need the FGFR status reconfirmed centrally if the report is within 24 months. Refer to Appendix E for a list of known FGFR3 alterations. Novel alterations may be discovered in which case the Sponsor must be contacted to review eligibility. 8.7.1.2. Tumor Tissue Collection for Testing PD -L1 Expression PD-L1 expression must be tested by a local or central laboratory as part of the prescreening or screening process using an approved IHC companion diagnostic (ie, Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx). A participant can be randomized using a local report but this will need to be retrospectively confirmed by the sponsor’s central lab. Patients who have a Dako PD- L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx report will not need to have their PD- L1 status confirmed centrally. PD-L1 status (CPS ≥10 or CPS < 10) must be determined during the screening period prior to randomization.

Safety Follow- Up The safety follow -up period is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up visit, which should occur no later than 30 days after the EOT visit (or after the last dose of study treatment if the EOT visit was not performed). Adverse events and SAEs must be reported up until 1) at least 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, the date of the follo w-up visit, or the start of a new anticancer therapy or 2) until toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longer. Reasonable efforts should be made to have the participant return for the follow-up visit and report any AEs that may occur during this period. If the participant cannot return to the site for the safety follow-up visit (eg, lives far away), the participant should be contacted by telephone for assessment of AEs and SAEs. Sites should document this contact in the source. If a participant is scheduled to begin a new anticancer therapy before the end of the 30-day safety follow-up period, the safety follow-up visit should be performed before new anticancer therapy is started. Once new anticancer therapy has been initiated, the participant will move into the survival follow-up period. 8.10.2. Post-Treatment Disease Follow -Up Participants who discontinue study treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move into the disease status follow-up period and should continue to be assessed by radiologic imaging to monitor disease status at the same schedule as if continuing on treatment per the schedule of activities (see Table 4). Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease status until: • The start of new anti cancer therapy. • Disease progression (confirmed by BICR) . • Pregnancy . • Death . • Withdrawal of consent. • The end of the study. 8.10.3. Survival Follow- Up Once a participant has received the last dose of study treatment, has confirmed disease progression, or starts a new anticancer therapy, the participant moves into the survival follow-up period and should be contacted by telephone, email, or visi t at least every 12 weeks to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. For participants having entered the survival follow-up period of the study, the site will use continuing participant records to supply data on subsequent treatment regimens, tumor assessments (if discontinued treatment for a reason other than progression), and OS in the eCRF . For participants who do not intend to return to the study investigator for their ongoing care, follow-up should be maintained by phone contact, participant records, and public"

ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, EVALUATING, FOLLOW-UP, AND RE PORTING 9.1. Definition of Adverse Event Adverse Event Definition • An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug- related. • An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study treatme nt. Events Meeting the A dverse Event Definition • Any safety assessments (eg, ECG, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). • Abnormal laboratory test results constitute an AE if they are considered clinically meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes in study drug. Whenever possible, a diagnosis (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia) should be recorded in the eCRF rather than the abnormal lab result (eg, low hemoglobin, platelet count decreased). • Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. • New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though they may have been present before the start of the study. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected DDI . • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication . Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose ta ken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. • ""Lack of efficacy "" or "" failure of expected pharmacological action "" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE . Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE."
74,page_74,"Incyte Corporation Page 74 of 111 Proto col INCB 54828- 205 Am 1 Version 2 17 APR 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Events NOT Meeting the A dverse Event Definition • Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. • The disease/dis order being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant 's condition or considered to be treatment -related by the investigator. • Efficacy endpoints as outlined in Section 3 will not be reported as AE/SAEs, specifically, any event that is related to disease progression of the cancer under study. Unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data will be monitored to ensure the safety of the participant s in the study. Any suspected endpoint that upon review is not progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to Incyte Pharmacovigilance as a SAE within 24 hours of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under study. • Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE if it occurred after signing informed consent . If present before entering the study, the condition should be captured as medical history. • Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). • Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 9.2. Definition of S erious Adverse Event If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death b. Is life -threatening The term 'life-threatening ' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an adverse drug experience that places the participant, in the opinion of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. This does not include an adve rse drug experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death . c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician' s office or outpatient setting . Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs . If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether "" hospitalization "" occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE."

Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions. • This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance , such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) , that may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f. Other situations (Important Medical Event) An event that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers (excluding the disease[s] under study in oncology protocols) , intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. g. May lead to disability (for Japanese participants) An event that exposes a participant to a risk of dysfunc tion to the extent that it interferes with daily life when the adverse drug reaction occurred. It does not mean that the adverse drug reaction could have caused disability if the reaction were more severe. 9.3. Recording and Follow -Up of Adverse Events and/or S erious Adverse Event s Adverse Event and S erious Adverse Event Recording • An AE/SAE that begins or worsens after informed consent is signed should be recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the eCRF . Conditions that were present at the time informed consent was given should be recorded on the Medical History Form in the eCRF. • When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, la boratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. • The investigator (or delegate) will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF and submit the appropriate SAE report. • It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant 's medical records in lieu of completing the AE eCRF page or the SAE report. • There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission. • The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information . Whenever possible, the diagnosis (n ot the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE /SAE . To the extent possible, each AE /SAE should be evaluated to determine: • The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to 5). See below for further instructions on the assessment of intensity. • Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study treatment s (including study drug(s) and/or reference therapy): suspected (yes) or not suspected (no).

Note: If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on Adverse Event F orm and the treatmen t should be specified on the appropriate eCRF (eg, Prior/Concomitant Medications , Procedures and Non- Drug Therapy). Assessment of Intensity The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v5.0 Grades 1 through 5. If an event is not classified by CTCAE, the severity of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to estimate the grade of severity: The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: • Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; treatment not indicated. • Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive treatment indicated; limiting age appropriate activities of daily living. • Grade 3: Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living. • Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent treatment indicated. • Grade 5: Fatal. Assessment of Causality • The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE . If reference therapy is used in combination with an Incyte study drug or multiple Incyte study drugs are used, the relationship to each study drug /reference therapy must be assessed (ie, for the Incyte product(s) and for the other product (s) that is used in combination with the Incyte product) . If appropriate, the relationship to the combination may be asse ssed as well. • A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than that a relationship cannot be ruled out. • The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. • The investigator will also consult the reference safety information in the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. • Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration , will be considered and investigated. • For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. • With regard to assessing causality of SAEs: − There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Therefore, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE."

Follow -Up of A dverse Events and S erious Adverse Events • The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. • If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the investigator will provide the sponsor with a copy of any postmortem findings including histopathology. • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed e CRF. • Any updated SAE data will be submit ted to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of receipt of the information. • Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it has resolved or until it is judged to be permanent; assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat the event, and the outcome. • When the severity of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits), each change in severity will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves. 9.4. Reporting of S erious Adverse Events Regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drugs, reference therapies , or study procedure[s]), all SAEs occurring after the participant has signed the ICF through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment or 30 days after the last dose of study treatment when starting a new anticancer therapy , whichever occurs ear lier must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) in English within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of it being available . For Japan, this information must also be reported immediately to the head of the stud y site. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE information after conclusion of the study participation . However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must notify the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the sponsor's study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently require further information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities . The sponsor or its designee may need to issue an Investigator Notification to inform all investigators involved in any study"

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with national regulatory requirements in participating countries . The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation . The sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC , and investigators. For Japan, suspected expected deaths and life-threatening events will also be reported to the PMDA as per local regulatory requirements. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Inv estigator 's Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. Serious Adverse Event Reporting • Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the eCRF . • The investigator must also comple te the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English. Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious Adverse Event Report Form. o Facsimile or email transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Incyte Pharmacovigilance Department at SafetyReporting@i ncyte.com . The contact information of the sponsor's study- specific representatives is listed in the Study Reference Manual provided to each site . The original copy of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form and the confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site. • Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new Serious Adverse Event Report Form, with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original report. The follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous Serious Adverse Event Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or discontinued), or participant disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation) . Each rec urrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow- up to that event, regardless of when it occurs. • In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile or computer equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable wi th a copy of the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the Serious Adverse Event Report Form within the de signated reporting time frames. • Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Manual . • For Japan, any SAE relating to phosphate binders that were used for treatment of hyperphosphatemia should also be reported in the same manner."

Sample Size Determination The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint PFS. The SOC treatment gro up in this study consists of participants who will receive pembrolizumab or chemotherapy depending on the participant carboplatin eligibility and PD -L1 CPS . In KEYNOTE -052, a large single arm, P hase 2 study with pembrolizumab conducted in cisplatin- inelig ible patients who had not been previously treated with systemic chemotherapy, the median PFS was 2 .1 months (95% CI : 2, 3; Balar et al 2017a). In EORTC 30968, a randomized P hase 2/3 study comparing gemcitabine and carboplatin versus methotrexate/carboplatin/vinblastine, the median PFS was 5.8 months in the gemcitabine/carboplatin group as compar ed with 4.2 months in the other group(s) ( De Santis et al 2012 ). Based on available data from KEYNOTE -052 and EORTC Study 30968 and participan ts' distribution percentages ( see Table 18) , it is estimated that the median PFS in the SOC treatment group (pembrolizumab or gemcitabine/carboplatin) is expected to be 5 months based on simulation. Table 18: Median Progression -Free Survival Assumptions for Standard of Care Treatments Patient Population Total (%) (N = 132) Median PFS Assumption Carbo platin -ineligible p articipants who will receive pembrolizumab 26 (20%) 2.1 months Carbo platin -eligible participants who will receive pembrolizumab (CPS ≥ 10) 16 (12%) 4.9 months Carbo platin -eligible participants who will receive gemcitabine /carbo platin (CPS < 10) 90 (68%) 5.8 months It is expected that treatment with pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab will result in a n HR of 0.68 for PFS compared to SOC, which corresponds to an increase in median PFS of 2.4 months under the exponential model assumption. It is calculated that a total of 210 PFS events in the combined treatment groups of pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab and SOC need to be observed to ensure 80% power to test the null hypothesis: PFS HR = 1, versus the s pecific alternative hypothesis: PFS HR = 0.68 for pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab versus SOC. This calculation assumes analysis using a 1 -sided log- rank test at a 0.025 overall significance level and participants are randomized to the treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. To keep a minimum meaningful hazard ratio of 0.68 for PFS in participants with pemigatinib alone versus SOC , a total of 210 PFS events in the combine treatment groups of pemigatinib alone and SOC need to be observed to achieve 80% power to tes t the null hypothesis: PFS HR = 1, versus the specific alterative hypothesis: PFS HR = 0.68 for pemigatinib alone versus SOC . This calculation assumes analysis using a 1 -sided log-rank test at a 0.025 overall significance level and participants are rand omized to the treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio."

The median OS for the SOC group is about 10 months based on EORTC Study 30968 and KEYNOTE -052. It is calculated that a total of 194 deaths in the combined treatment groups of pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab and SOC need to have been observed to achieve 76% power to detect an HR of 0.68 using a 1-sided log-rank test at a 0.025 overall significant level. Final OS analysis is expected to occur at approximately 52 months after first participant is randomized. At the time when final PFS analysis is conducted, it is expected that about 169 deaths will be observed in the combined treatment groups of pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab and S OC. Overall survival comparison for pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab versus SOC will be conducted at nominal 1 -sided alpha of 0.0147 according to the O’Brien-Fleming spending function. Final OS analysis comparing pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab versus SOC w ill be conducted at nominal 1-sided alpha of 0.0103 when approximately 194 deaths are observed in the combined treatment groups of pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab and SOC. The actual boundaries will be re-calculated from the actual number of deaths at the time when final PFS analysis is conducted using the alpha- and beta -spending functions. 10.2. Populations for Analysis Table 19 presents the populations for analysis. Table 19: Populations for Analysis Population Description ITT The ITT population includes all participants who are randomized into the study. Treatment groups for this population will be determined according to the treatment assignment at the time of randomization. All efficacy analyses will be conducted using the ITT population. PP Participants in the ITT who are considered to be sufficiently compliant with the Protocol comprise the PP population. This population includes all ITT participants who meet all major inclusion and no major exclusion criteria based on blinded review of clinical data. Specific criteria and review of this population will be defined in the statistical analysis plan. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using the PP popula tion as a sensitivity analysis. Safety The safety population includes all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.

Level of Significance The overall level of significance is strongly controlled for primary and key secondary objectives at 1-sided 0.025 using a fixed sequential testing procedure. The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints at final analysis will be tested in the following order: 1. PFS comparison for pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab versus SOC at 1-sided 0.025. 2. OS comparis on for pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab versus SOC at 1-sided 0.0147 at the time when primary analysis of PFS is conducted; OS comparison for pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab versus SOC at 1-sided 0.0103 at final OS analysis. 3. PFS comparison for pemigatinib onl y versus SOC at 1 -sided 0.025. If the pemigatinib group is discontinued early after futility analysis (see Section 10.5), this analysis will not be performed. 4. OS comparison for pemigatinib only versus SOC at 1-sided 0.0147 at the time when primary analysis of PFS is conducted; OS comparison for pemigatinib only versus SOC at 1-sided 0.0103 at final OS analysis. If the pemig atinib group is discontinued early after futility analysis (see Section 10.5), this analysis will not be performed. 10.4. Statistical Analyses 10.4.1. Primary Analysis Progression- free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first . Progression- free survival will be assessed via BICR according to RECIST v1 .1 criteria. Participants without a PFS event at the time of analysis will be censored. Censoring for PFS will follow the FDA Guidance for Industry: Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics (FDA 2018a ). The primary analysis of PFS will be based on ITT population and will compare PFS difference between treatment groups ( pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab vs SOC , pemigatinib alone vs SOC ) using a log-rank test stratified by eligibility to receive carboplatin, primary disease location, and PD -L1 CPS . The stratification will be based on the randomization stratification factors. Kaplan -Meier curves, medians, and 95% CIs of the medians will be presented for each treatmen t group. The HR for PFS will be calculated, along with its 95% CI, from a stratified Cox model using the same stratification factors as for the log -rank test with Efron's likelihood approximation to account for ties in event times. Progression- free survi val analysis for the comparison of pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab versus SOC as well as the comparison of pemigatinib alone versus SOC will be conducted separately. As sensitivity analyses, difference in PFS between pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab and SOC will be analyzed using log -rank test stratified by eligibility to receive carboplatin, primary disease location, and PD -L1 CPS in the PP population; difference in PFS between pemigatinib alone and SOC will be analyzed using log- rank test stratified by same stratification factors in the PP population. Difference in PFS between pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab and SOC as well as the difference between pemigatinib alone and SOC will also be analyzed using a log-rank test stratified by the same stratification factors in the randomized subjects who have known FGFR3 mutation or rearr angement confirmed by the central lab oratory."

Secondary Analysis Secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted for the ITT population. All the secondary analyses for pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab versus SOC and for pemigatinib alone versus SOC will be conducted separately. Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization until death due to any cause. Participants without death observed at the time of analysis will be censored at last date known to be alive. The log- rank test stratified by eligibility to receive carboplatin, primary disease location, and PD -L1 CPS will be used to analyze the OS differences between treatment groups. Kaplan - Meier curves, medians, and 95% CIs of the medians will be presented for each treatment group. The HR for OS will be calculated, along with its 95% CI, from a stratified Cox model using the same stratification factors as for the log -rank test with Efron's likelihood approximation to account for ties in event times. Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response of CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 by BICR. Objective response rate will be presented by treatment groups along with 95% CIs. Objective response rates between treatment groups will be compared using Cochran–Mantel –Haenszel test stratified by eligibility to receive carboplatin, primary disease location, and PD-L1 CPS . Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of the first assessment of CR or PR until the date of the first progressive disease per RECIST v1.1 or death. For participants who achieve a response, Kaplan -Meier curves, medians, and 95% CIs of the medians will be presented for each treatment group. Participants who are still responding at the time of analysis will be censored. Censoring of DOR will follow the same algorithm as the censoring of PFS. EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ-5D- 5L scales as well as change and percent change from baseline will be summarized with descriptive statistics by visit. 10.4.3. Safety Analyses Safety analyses will be conducted for the safety population. Adverse events will be coded by the MedDRA dictionary, and TEAE s (ie, AEs reported for the first time o r worsening of a pre- existing event after first dose of study treatment) will be tabulated by preferred term and system organ class for all events, related events, and events of Grade 3 or higher. Quantitative safety variables and their changes from basel ine (laboratory, vital signs, etc) will be summarized with descriptive statistics. Clinically notable abnormal values will be flagged and tabulated based on predefined criteria. The clinical laboratory data will be analyzed using summary statistics; no formal treatment group comparisons are planned. In addition, distributions of key laboratory parameters may be plotted over time; these values will also be classified into CTCAE v 5.0 toxicity grades and tabulated. Descriptive statistics and mean change fro m baseline will be determined for vital signs at each assessment time. Vital sign results will be reviewed for clinically notable abnormalities. Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will be determined for each ECG parameter at each assessm ent time. Electrocardiogram results will be reviewed for clinically notable abnormalities according to predefined criteria. Participants exhibiting clinically notable ECG abnormalities will be listed."

Futility Analysis A futility analysis will be performed when a total of approximately 150 participants across all 3 treatment groups have been randomized and have had at least 1 tumor assessment or have permanently discontinued from study. Enrollment will not be held while the futility analysis is being conducted. The study can be stopped for futility if the ORR differe nce between pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab group versus SOC group is less than 5%.

Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with appropriate technical and organizational measures as required by local data protection laws . Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator for 10 years after study completion unless local regulations or require otherwise. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. 11.4. Financial Disclosure Before study initiation, all clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA Regulation Title 21 CFR Part 54 – Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (ie, ""covered studies"" ) are required to submit a completed Clinical Investigator Financial Disclosure form that sufficiently details any financial inter ests and arrangements that apply . For the purpose of this regulation, "" clinical investigator "" is defined as any investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research participants, including the spouse and each dependent child of the clinical investigator or subinvestigator. These requirements apply to both US and foreign clinical investigators conducting covered clinical studies. Any new clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its con duct must also submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Form. During a covered clinical study, any changes to the financial information previously reported by a clinical investigator must be reported to the sponsor or its designee. At the con clusion of the covered clinical study, the clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligations . In the event that the clinical investigator is not reminded, they nevertheless will remain obligated to report to the sponsor or its designee any chan ges to the financial information previously reported, as well as any changes in their financial information for a period of 1 year after completion of the covered clinical study. 11.5. Publication Policy By signing the study Protocol, the investigator and his/he r institution agree that the results of the study may be used by the sponsor, Incyte Corporation (Incyte), for the purposes of national and international registration, publication, and information for medical and pharmaceutical professionals. Study results will be published in accordance with applicable local and national regulations. If necessary, the authorities will be notified of the investigator's name, address, qualifications, and extent of involvement. The terms regarding the publication of study results are contained in the agreement signed with the sponsor or its designee. A signed agreement will be retained by the sponsor or its designee. The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings . If this is foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor before submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments."

In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mut ual agreement. Authorship will be determined in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements. 11.6. Study and Site Closure The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion . A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed. For Japan: When the study is completed, the investigator should inform the head of the study site of the completion in writing and submit a written summary of the study's outcome, then the head of the study site should promptly inform the IRB and sponsor or designee of the completion in writing. The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: • Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines. • Inadequate recruitmen t of participants by the investigator . • Discontinuation of further study treatment development."

INFORMATION REGARDING EF FECTIVENESS OF CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD S For male participants in the study: Male participants must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering children (defined as the use of an effective method [barrier method] in combination with a highly effective method in preventing pregnancy ). Male participants should use a condom from screening through 120 days after the last dose of pemigatinib and/or pembrolizumab or 180 days after the last dose of chemotherapy. If the male participant has a partner that is of childbearing potential, the partner should also use contraception during the study and through 120 days after the last dose of pemigatinib and/or pembrolizumab or 180 days after the last dose of chemotherapy . In addition, male participants must refrain from donating sperm from screening through 120 days after the last dose of pemigatinib and/or pembrolizumab or 180 days after the last dose of chemotherapy . Males who have had a vasectomy qualify as having met the requirement for a highly effecti ve birth control method. For female participants in the study: Female participants must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy ( defined as the use of an effective method [barrier method] in combination with a highly effective method in preventing pregnancy) from screening through 120 days after the last dose of pemigatinib and/or pembrolizumab or 180 days after the last dose of chemotherapy. The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods: • Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation a − oral − intravaginal (not ap plicable in Japan) − transdermal (not applicable in Japan) • Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationa − oral − injectable − implantableb • Intrauterine deviceb • Intrauterine hormone -releasing systemb • Bilateral tubal occlusionb • Vasectomized partnerbc • Sexual abstinence (not applicable in Japan) d Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per year include: • Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action • Male or female condom with or without spermicidee • Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicidee • Tubal ligation a Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the investigational medicinal product, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method. b Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user dependency. c Vasectomized partner is a highly effective method of avoiding pregnancy provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential study participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. d In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. e A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods.

PEMBROLIZUMAB DOSE MODIFICATIONS Dose Modifications and Toxicity Management for Immune-R elated Adverse Events Associated With Pembrolizumab AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These irAEs may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than 1 body system simultaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. Based on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticostero ids. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided. Table B1: Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune- Related Adverse Events Associated With Pembrolizumab General instruct ions: • Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks. • For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 an d corticosteroid has been tapered. Pembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of last dose or corticosteroids cannot be reduced to ≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks. • For severe and life-threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral steroid. Other immunosuppressive treatment should be initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by corticosteroids. irAE Toxicity Grade or Conditions (CTCAE v5.0) Action Taken to Pembrolizumab irAE Management With Corticosteroid and/or Other Therapies Monitor and Follow -Up Pneumonitis Grade 2 Withhold • Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent) followed by taper • Monitor participants for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis • Evaluate participants with suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging and initiate corticosteroid treatment • Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections Grade 3 or 4, or recurrent Grade 2 Permanently discontinue"

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES Document Date Amendment 1 17 APR 2020 Amendment 1 (17 APR 2020) Overall Rationale for the Amendment: Requests by Health Authorities for certain changes as well as feedback from Scientific Steering Committee to help with enrollment of pa rticipants . 1. Section 1, Protocol Summary (Table 2: Key Study Design Elements; Table 3: Treatment Gro ups for Randomization); Section 2.2.2, Justification for Dose and Schedule; Section 4.1, Overall Design (Table 8: Treatment Groups for Randomization); Section 6.1, Study Treatments Administered (Table 10: Study Treatment Information) Description of change: Added duration of treatments for the study groups. Rationale for change: Clarification requested by investigators. 2. Section 1, Protocol Summary (Table 4: Schedule of Activities) The following updates were made: a. Description of change: Revised QLQ -C30 and EQ-5D-5L assessments during the treatment period to every 3 cycles on Day 1 starting on Cycle 4. Rationale for change: In order to eliminate the requirement that a participant be seen in the clinic to complete the QLQ -C30 and EQ-5D on the same days as imaging assessments, the schedule for collection of quality-of- life assessments has been updated and will be associated/completed at the time of already planned visits to the clinic. This revision will ensure that the questionnaires are completed by participants at the required timepoints. b. Description of change: Clarified that assessments for up -titration will be completed during Cycle 1 but the first opportunity to up- titrate a participant is at Cycle 2 Day 1. Rationale for change: Requested by the Ital ian Health Authority. c. Description of change: Added that IRT should be contacted during the patient prescreening and Cycle 1 Day 8. Rationale for change: Administrative errors. 3. Section 1, Protocol Summary (Table 4: Schedule of Activities); Section 4.1, Overall Design; Section 5.1, Inclusion Criteria (Criteria 6 and 7); Section 6.4.1.1, PD-L1 CPS Results; Description of change: Updated to indicate that participants can be randomized based on local genomics testing results for FGFR3 mutation or rearrangement and PD- L1 status, but tissue will need to be sent for central laboratory confirmation. Participants who have a documented FGFR3 mutation or rearrangement confirmed by Foundation Medicine do not need the FGFR status reconfirmed centrally if the report is within"
107,page_107,"Incyte Corporation Page 107 of 111 Proto col INCB 54828- 205 Am 1 Version 2 17 APR 2020 CONFIDENTIAL 24 months In addition, participants whose PD-L1 status is not evaluable will not be eligible. Rationale for change: Concordance rates with local genomics assay compared to the central labo ratory have been very high on other studies in the program. The Scientific Steering Committee and numerous sites have voiced their concerns about the turnaround time for the central testing as a barrier to recruitment. MHRA recommended that if a PD-L1 sam ple is not evaluable, it is not acceptable to assign an arbitrary positive score. 4. Section 1, Protocol Summary (Table 3: Treatment Groups for Randomization; Figure 1, Study Design Schema); Section 4.1, Overall Design (Table 8: Treatment Groups for Randomization); Section 5.1, Inclusion Criteria (Criterion 5); Section 6.4.1.1, PD- L1 CPS Results Description of change: Note added to indicate that in certain regions , pembrolizumab monotherapy will be administered only to participants who are not eligible for cisplatin - containing chemotherapy regardless of PD -L1 status. Rationale for change: MHRA recommended as this wording is consistent with the licensed indication included in the pembrolizumab SmPC. The pembrolizumab SmPC does not contain any indication for treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible to receive any platinum-containing chemotherapy regardless of PD -L1 expression status. 5. Section 1, Protocol Summary (Table 4: Schedule of Activities) ; Section 8.2.1, Tumor Imaging; Section 8.2.1.1, Initial Tumor Imaging; Section 8.2.2, Tumor Imaging During the Study Description of change: Updated to indicate that brain imaging and bone scans only need to be done at baseline if participants are symptomatic. Removed notes requiring that bone scans and brain imaging need to be completed to confirm CR if positive at baseline. Clarified that bone scans and brain imaging need to be repeated with other imaging assessments while a participant is on study if they were positive at baseline. Added that all imaging must be sent to central vendor as soon as possible after completion. Rationale for change: For clarification. The notes regarding imaging requirements to confirm CR were removed as all imaging requirements are noted in Table 4. 6. Section 1, Protocol Summary (Table 4: Schedule of Activities); Section 8.5.5, Comprehensive Eye Examination; Section 6.6.1, Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interruptions and Adjustments of Pemigatinib Description of change: Updated to indicate that OCT is mandatory at baseline, every 3 cycles, and at EOT as part of the comprehensive eye examination and to include guidelines for treatment associated with SRD/RPED. Rationale for change: For consistency with other protocols in the INCB054828 program."

Description of change: Exclusion criterion 2 updated to indicate that prior receipt of an anti –PD-1, anti–PD -L1, or anti–PD -L2 agent, or an agent directed to another co-inhibitory T- cell receptor, is allowed , but the last treatment must have been complet ed at least 18 months before enrollment in this study. Rationale for change: After discussion with numerous investigators and the Scientific Steering Committee, it was determined that a large number of patients are now being treated with checkpoint inhibitors for urothelial carcinoma in early-stage disease. Excluding these patients will further limit the number of participants eligible for this study. b. Description of change: Exclusion criterion 8 was updated to specify radiation to the primary tumor site for the sole purpose of sensitizing the tumor to local radiation can be done if there is a 3 -week washout period prior to the first dose of study drug. Rationale for change: For consistency between inclusion criterion 8 and exclusion criterion 8. c. Description of change: In exclusion criterion 17, removed the note stating that no testing for HBV or HCV is required unless mandated by local health authority. Rationale for change: The ICF and Protocol Section 8.5.6.2 state that HBV and HCV testing will be done at screening. d. Description of change: In exclusion criterion 11 (Table 9: Exclusionary Laboratory Values), the hemoglobin units corrected to g/dL. Direct bilirubin value corrected to ≤ ULN. Rationale for change: Administrative error/incorrect unit of measure. 14. Section 6.1, Study Treatments Administered (Table 10: Study Treatment Information) Description of change: Added temperature range and language for room temperature. Rationale for change: Japanese requirement. 15. Section 6.2, Phosphate Binders in Japan (Table 11: Study Treatment 2 [Phosphate Binders for Japan]); Section 6.3, Preparation, Handling, and Accountability; Section 6.6.2, Management of Hyperphosphatemia Description of change: Added phosphate binder information for Japan and clarification that phosphate binders for treatment of hyperphosphatemia for Japanese participants are provided by the sponsor and that the required documentation for binders is the same as for study drug. Rationale for change: To clarify the tested binder s in Japan for the management of hyperphosphatemia, which the sponsor provided with study- specific label, and to meet Japanese requirements."

Section 6.7.1, Restricted Medications and Procedures Description of change: Updated to state that calcium-based phosphate binders may be used with appropriate clinical monitoring if other types of phosphate binders are not available in certain regions. Rationale for change: Clarification that calcium -based phosphate binders can be used with appropriate clinical monitoring if this is the only option in certain regions. 17. Section 7.1.1, Reasons for Discontinuation Description of change: Clarified that participants in Treatment Group A (pemigatinib + pembrolizumab) need to discontinue pembrolizumab after 35 cycles of treatment but can continue pemigatinib until progression. Rationale for change: For c larification. 18. Section 8.5.1, Adverse Events Description of change: Language was added to indicate that, for Japanese participants, the relationship with phosphate binders should also be collected on the Adverse Events Form in the eCRF. Rationale for change: Japanese requirement. 19. Section 8. 5.4, Electrocardiograms Description of change: Clarified that in the event that a single QTc is > 480 ms at screening, the participant may enroll if three ECGs are completed and the average QTc for the 3 ECGs is < 480 ms or with approval from the medical monitor. Rationale for change: To avoid artifact measurements of a single ECG. 20. Section 8.5.6, Laboratory Assessments Description of change: Updated to indicate that the site's local laboratory will complete all safety assessments but will not analyze . The site's laboratory will draw the blood for these tests, but the analyses will be conducted by Incyte. Rationale for change: Administrative error. 21. Section 8.7.1.3, Assessment on Tumor Samples Description of change: Figure 2 was updated to indicate that an archival tumor tissue sample is required from < 24 months prior to screening as stated in Section 8.7.1. Rationale for change: Administrative error/incorrect unit of time. 22. Section 9.2, Definition of Serious Adve rse Event Description of change: Added language about AEs that may lead to disability. Rationale for change: Japanese requirement."

Section 9.4, Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Description of change: Language was added to indicate that in Japan, SAEs must be reported to the head of the study site; suspected expected deaths and life- threatening events will be reported to the PMDA; and events related to phosphate binder use for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia will be reported as SAEs. Rationale for change: Japanese requirement. 24. Section 9.9, Product Complaints Description of change: Language added for medical devices. Rationale for change: Japanese requirement. 25. Section 10.4.1, Primary Analysis Description of change: Clarified that patients with FGFR3 mutation or rearrangement confirmed by the central laboratory will be included in the primary analysis. Rationale for change: The introduction of local testing for FGFR3 in this amendment required that the primary anal ysis population be defined in this way. 26. Section 11.1, Investigator Responsibilities Description of change: Added record retention requirements for Japan. Rationale for change: Japanese requirement. 27. Section 11.6, Study and Site Closure Description of change: Language was added to reflect the responsibility of investigator and head of study site (Japan) upon study completion.
