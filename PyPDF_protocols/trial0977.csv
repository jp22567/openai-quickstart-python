9,page_9,"9 Protocol synopsis Title of study Development of a New Critical Pathway for Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections Rationale Treatment of ABSSSI lacks a clear a pproach to risk stratification of patients and management upon patient presentation to the emergency department. Lack of a clear approach may cause unnecessary hospital admissions and extended length of st ay (LOS) of ABSSSI patients, who otherwise could be treated in an outpatient setting. A paucity of research exists regarding hospita l care pathways for treatment of ABSSSI patients and the place of l ong-acting parenteral antibiotics. Critical pathways, also known as criti cal paths, clinical pathways, or care paths, are management plans that outline steps, such as the sequence and timing of actions, necessary for a complex process. Therefore, implementation of a new critical pathway may potentially demonstrate benefit compared to usual care for the treatment of ABSSSI for patients who could otherwis e be treated in an outpatient healthcare setting. Long-acting parenteral antibiotics may be an important component of the pathway, as a means to increase efficiency of ABSSSI treatment. The new crit ical pathway under study is defined as (1) use of guideline-based patient identification criteria, and, for those who meet these criteria, (2) use of dalbavancin, a long-acting antibiotic with an abbreviated admi nistration schedule. For appropriate hospitalized patients with ABSSSI, the new critical pathway may demonstrate a potential for decr easing hospital length of stay. Objectives To assess the effect of a new critical pathway compared to usual care for the treatment of ABSSSI during in itial care (the date of enrollment to 10-14 days) and follow-up (30 days after initial care) on the following outcomes: Primary outcome  Infection-related total admitted hospital days during initial care and follow-up Secondary outcomes  Total admitted hospital days dur ing initial care and follow-up  Infection-related major surgical interventions that required operating room time during initial care and follow-up  Infection-related hospitalizations during initial care and follow-up  Infection-related hospitalizations during initial care and follow-up that resulted in admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU)"
10,page_10,"10  All cause hospitalizations in the 30 days post discharge from the hospital  Infection-related ED visits during initial care and follow-up  Infection-related outpatient healthcare visits during initial care and follow-up  Use of a PICC line or central lin e to administer antibiotic therapy during initial care and follow-up  Infection-related healthcare visits due to PICC line or central line used to administer antibiotic therapy during initial care and follow-up  Response to treatment at end of treatment visit  Serious adverse events (SAEs) during initial care and follow-up  Patient satisfaction with care  Patient work and productivity loss  Patient Health-related Qual ity of Life (HRQoL) Population Study subjects will be recruited among patients who are admitted to the hospital for the trea tment of ABSSSI and who require coverage for a known or suspected Gram-positive infection. Among all such individuals, attention will be focu sed on those who me et all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria."

16,page_16,"16 1 Introduction 1.1 Background 1.1.1 Skin and skin-structure infections Skin and skin-structure infections (SSS I) are among the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice, with an es timated 14.2 million outpatient visits for cellulitis and abscess reported in 2005 alone.2 The number of visits to the emergency department (ED) for SSSI has nearly tripled between 1996 and 2005.3 In recent years, while some evidence suggests that ED visits for ABSSSI in the United States (US) are stabilizing,4 the overall burden of these infections to the US h ealthcare system remains high—between 2000-2012, the incidence of patients with at least 1 SSSI-re lated hospital, ambulatory care, and ED visit increased by 38%, 46%, and 56%, respectively.5 There is evidence that hospital admissions for these infections have also increased substantially in recent years. Based on examinations of the US National Inpatient Sample (NIS), Edelsberg and colleagues reported a 29% increase in admissions to hospitals for SSSI between 2000 and 2004; increases were greate st among patients aged <65 years (37% vs. 14% for those aged ≥65 years), urban hospitals (32% vs. 11% for rura l hospitals), and among those with “superficial” in fections (e.g., cellulitis, ab scess) (33% vs. 24% for deeper/healthcare-associated infections [e.g., post-operative wound inf ection, infection due to vascular device]).6 The Healthcare Cost and Utilizati on Project (HCUP) 2013 report stated that SSSI infections were responsible fo r over 600,000 hospitalizations annually and were considered the eighth-most rapidly growing cause for hospitalization from 1997- 2011.7 1.1.2 Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections In an effort to focus on acute infection and increase homogeneity of what had traditionally been a relatively diverse population, in 2013 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided guidance to manufacturers developing an tibiotics for a subgrou p of SSSI known as acute bacterial SSSI (ABSSSI). The FDA defined ABSSSI to cons ist of cellulitis /erysipelas, wound infection, and major cutane ous abscess. To be deemed ABSSSI, the infection should have a lesion surface area ≥75 squared centimeters (cm2); additional criteria set forth by the FDA1 were infection-specific and included:  Spreading areas of redness, edema, and/or induration (cellu litis/erysipelas)  Purulent drainage from a wound with surr ounding redness, edema, and/or induration (wound infection)  Pus within the dermis or deeper that is accompanied by redness, edema, and/or induration (major cutaneous abscess) ABSSSI are often caused by Gram-positive pa thogens, including but not limited to Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-resistant [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible strains [MSSA]) and Streptococcus pyogenes .1"
17,page_17,"17 1.1.3 Treatment of ABSSSI As with SSSI in general, initial treatment for ABSSSI is typically empiric and based on patient characteristics, clinical presenta tion, treatment guidelines, knowledge of local pathogen and resistance pa tterns, and the antimicr obials that are most li kely to be effective against them. Given the role of MRSA in this in dication, it is not surpri sing that empiric use of anti-MRSA therapy is fairly common; in one recent evaluation of 13,291 patients hospitalized for community- acquired complicated SSSI (i ncluding but not limited to ABSSSI), empiric use of anti-MRSA thera py increased from 61% during 2007 to 73% in 2010 8 (p<0.01); Consistent with other research,9 vancomycin was the most commonly used agent. Patients requiring parenteral antibiotic treatment for ABSSSI have routinely been admitted to the hospital, regardless of the degree to which they may require other hospital services such as drainage or debridement. 9 In one recent examination of 619 adult patients presenting to 12 US EDs with SSSI, Talan et al noted that for 85% of patients admitted to the hospital (n=94), their doctors indicated that the r eason for admission was the requirement for parenteral antibiotic therapy, and for approximately 41% of admitted patients (n=39), this was the only reason for admission. 10 The advent of outpatient pa renteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT), which has been shown to be a safe and effective means by which parenteral antibiotic treatment can be administered,11 has provided an opportunity to rethink this paradigm. Current practice guidelines for the ma nagement of ABSSSI in EDs and hospitals have suggested that patients without a n eed for admission—defined as presence of hemodynamic instability, necrotizing fasciitis, and/or unstable comorbidities—do not require admission and instead could be managed as outp atients. Interestingly, these guidelines note that the presence of systemic signs of infect ion such as fever, in the absence of the aforementioned risk factors, are not cau se in and of themselves for admission. 3 Guidelines for the selection and management of patients receiving OPAT outline other relevant criteria, including psychosocial factors th at may threaten the ability to render care on an outpatient basis.11 Yet, even with recommendations for outpatient care in clinical guidelines, a lack of clear care pathways for ABSSSI patients in the hospital li mits use in practice. The development of new antibiotic therapies provide s the opportunity to succ essfully design and implement a new care pathway, due to the accelerated dosing schedules and ease of administration provided by long-acting parenter al antibiotics. Long -acting parenteral antibiotics may be an important component of a care pathway in the hospita l for treatment of ABSSSI. Currently, there is a paucity of research that exists regarding a ne w clinical pathway in the hospital for treatment of ABSSSI patie nts and the place of long-acting parenteral antibiotics in therapy. 1.1.4 Dalbavancin Dalbavancin (Dalvance ®) is a novel, long-acti ng, second-generation li poglycopeptide that is indicated for the treatment of ABSSSI caused by susceptible strains of Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (both MRSA and MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group, and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible strains) . 12 In two pivotal clinical trials, the efficacy and safety of two doses of IV dalbavancin administered one week apart (1000 milligrams (mg) for the initial infusion [750 mg for those with renal impairment]"
18,page_18,"18 administered over 30 minutes, 500 mg for the second infusion [375 mg] administered over 30 minutes) were shown to be non-inferior to 10–14 continuous days of therapy with vancomycin and linezolid, respectively. 12-14 A subsequent clinical tr ial demonstrated that the efficacy and safety of a single dose of dalbav ancin administered over a 30 minute infusion (1500 mg) was non-inferior to the two-dose regimen.16 Dalbavancin can be provided through a peripheral line, and does not ne cessitate central or PICC placement. 1.1.5 New Critical Pathway Critical pathways, also known as critical paths, clinical pa thways, or care paths, are management plans that outline steps, such as the sequence and timing of actions, necessary for a complex process. The definition of th e new critical pathway for this study was developed for the treatment of ABSSSI patients who are admitted to the hospital. The new critical pathway is (1) use of guideline-based patient identif ication criteria, and, for those who meet these criteria, (2) us e of dalbavancin, a long-acting an tibiotic with an abbreviated administration schedule. Guideline-based patient identification criteria will be developed and applied based on criteria for identificati on of ABSSSI and existing OPAT guidelines. 3,11 1.2 Purpose In addition to a lack of clinic al guidelines or critical pathways to inform treatment of ABSSSI patients, many contributing factors are respons ible for continuing to admit ABSSSI patients to receive IV antibiotic therapy, who could otherwise be treated in an outpatient healthcare setting. First, physicians may not have experi ence with or training for use of newer IV antibiotics, including use of long-acting IV antibiotics. Information on use of long-acting IV antibiotics may be limited to clin ical trials, which test agents in highly selected populations under optimized settings with limited “real-world” generaliza bility. Second, physicians may have safety concerns related to adequate pa tient follow-up with the use of long-acting IV antibiotics. Third, there may be barriers to provision of OPAT, including institutional time spent coordinating care and insurance-related barriers. A new study is therefor e required to better understand th e “real-world” e ffectiveness of a new critical pathway that includes use of a long-acting antibiotic for the treatment of ABSSSI. In addition to tangible economic bene fits associated with reducing unnecessary admissions, implementation of a new critical pathway may reduce utilization of healthcare services in the inpatient and outpatient care setting, increase patient satisfaction, improve patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and reduce patient productivity loss/absenteeism. 2 Study objectives 2.1 Primary objective Estimate the difference in infection-related to tal admitted hospital days during initial care (the date of enrollment to 10-14 days) and fo llow-up (30 days after initial care) comparing ABSSSI patients receiving care before implemen tation of the new critical pathway and after implementation."
19,page_19,"19 2.2 Secondary objectives Estimate the difference in the following outcomes during initial care (the date of enrollment to 10-14 days) and follow-up (30 days afte r initial care) comparing ABSSSI patients receiving care before implementation of th e new critical and after implementation:  Total admitted hospital days dur ing initial care and follow-up  Infection-related major surgical interventions that required operating room time during initial care and follow-up (number of expected major surgeries, number of unexpected major surgeries, and to tal number of major surgeries)  Infection-related hospitalizations during initial care and follow-up  Infection-related hospitalizations during initi al care and follow-up that resulted in admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  All cause hospitalizations in the 30 da ys post discharge from the hospital  Infection-related ED visits during initial care and follow-up (number of expected, number of unexpected and number of total ED visits during follow-up)  Infection-related outpatient h ealthcare visits (e.g., physicians ’ office visits, ED visits, infusion center visits, home health visits ) during initial care and follow-up (number of expected visits, number of unexpe cted and total number of visits)  Use of a PICC line or central line to administer antibiotic therapy during initial care and follow-up (number of patients who have a PICC or central line placed)  Infection-related healthcare visits (e.g., hospitalizations, ED visits, other outpatient visits) due to PICC line or cen tral line used to administer antibiotic therapy during initial care and follow-up (num ber of expected visits, unexpected visits and number of total visits)  Response to treatment at end of treatment visit  Serious adverse events (SAEs) during initial care and follow-up  Patient satisfaction with care (subject reported)  Patient work and productivity loss (subject reported)  Patient Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) (subject reported) 3 Study design 3.1 Overview This study will employ a “pre-post” pragmatic design, which will consist of both a pre- period, or an observational ba seline period, and a post-period, or an interventional period (Figure 1). During the pre-period, the site will imp lement the first component of the critical pathway through implementation of guideline-based criteria to identify patients admitted to the hospital, obtain informed consent, and mon itor enrolled subjects. The site will initiate"
20,page_20,"20 treatment for ABSSSI with “u sual care,” defined as site- or physician-specific antibiotic treatment of ABSSSI with coverage for a know n or suspected Gram-positive infection (e.g., vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin) to each study subject who meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria. During the “post” period, for all subjects who provide informed consent and are subsequently enrolled, each participa ting site will additionally implement the second component of the new critical pathway, use of da lbavancin, at the point of care in the hospital or other designated site to each study subject w ho meets all inclusion a nd exclusion criteria. As the study is pragmatic in design, selection criteria will be minimal and optimized for selection of “real-world” patients who are id eal candidates for treatment in the outpatient healthcare setting, but who are currently admitte d to the hospital to receive treatment for ABSSSI. Site training is necessary for both adherence to the pr otocol and implementation of the new critical pathway, described in grea ter detail in Sectio n 7, Study sites and administrative structure. Briefly, the invest igators on the core study team will provide training to other members of the site study t eam, including all particip ating site physicians and other healthcare providers (i.e. nurses, pharmacists, and othe r staff) on protocol adherence and implementation of the new criti cal pathway. Protocol training will occur before enrolling subjects in both the pre- and th e post-period. Before enrolling subjects in the post-period, training on implementa tion of the new critical pathway will occur over a two- to four-week period after the date of the last en rolled subject in the pre-period. In addition, ongoing reminders and orientations will be sche duled by the investigators on the core study team as needed during both the pre- and post-period. For both periods of interest, subject follow-up will begin on the day of study enrollment and end 44 days subsequently. This will reflect th e 10 to 14-day period during which antibiotics are anticipated to be required for care of ABSSSI plus an additional 30 days to ascertain outcomes, such as health resource utilization."
21,page_21,"21 3.1.1 Study duration The duration of the study will not b e predetermi ned, but rather will depend on the number of eligible subjects. Both the pre- and post-periods will run until the minimum number of subjects are enrolled. Refer to Section 6.3, Sample size, for information on the minimum number of subjects. 3.1.2 Rationale of study design The design of this stud y allows for the site to understand baseline treatment patterns for ABSSSI, then after this period, to implement an institution-level inte rvention. Use of this design removes site-level variables as a source of potential confounding and enables comparisons of the new critical pathway to usual care in the same setting(s) and similar subject populations. The study is designed in a “pragmatic” fashion (i.e., minimal inclusi on/exclusion criteria, which will enable an examination of the im pact of the new critical pathway under “real- world” conditions, with good generalizability/app licability to clin ical practice."
22,page_22,"22 3.2 Antibiotic treatment 3.2.1 Pre-period During the pre-period, treatment for ABSSSI is initiated with “usual care,” defined as investigator’s choice of antibiotic therapy (e.g., vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin), to each study subject who meets all study selection cr iteria. It is expected that choice of usual care will be site or physician specific. Dosing of each antibiotic agent should follow recommended guidelines, demonstrated for antibio tic agents in, but no t limited to, Table 1 below. All included subjects require Gram-posit ive antimicrobial coverage for a known or suspected infection caused by susceptible is olates of the following microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus a galactiae, Streptococ cus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (including S. anginosus, S. intermed ius, S. constellatus ) and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin susceptible strains)."
23,page_23,"23 3.2.2 Post-period During the post-period, all enrolled subject s will receive treatmen t for ABSSSI with dalbavancin at each participating site. Dalbavan cin will be administered as a single IV dose of 1500 mg over 30 minutes (1125 mg over 30 minut es if CrCl <30 mL/min, for those not on regularly scheduled dialysis).12 Dalbavancin will be provided to sites by study sponsor. 3.2.3 Rationale of dose/regimen of antibiotic treatment Usual care antibiotic therapy and dalbavanci n will each be administered per relevant guidelines/manufacturer instru ctions (dosing provided in Ta ble 1). Duration of treatment with usual care will be left to the physicia n’s discretion, as recommendations for several agents include a range (e.g., 10–14 days for linezolid).24 3.2.4 Rationale for choice of comparator Usual care will comprise investigator’s choice of care and may therefore vary from subject to subject. This was selected to allow for comparisons of the new critical pathway, which includes use of dalbavancin, with “real world” treatment."
24,page_24,"24 3.3 Subject identification Patients admitted to the hospital with an AB SSSI infection during both the pre- and post- periods will be assessed for inclusion and exclus ion criteria. These criteria will be prepared as an annotated checklist for the study coor dinator and/or study nurses to implement and document using a CRF. Information obtained th rough the annotated checklist coupled with physician assessment will define guideline-based patient identification criteria. 3.3.1 Pre-period During the pre-period, the study c oordinator and/or other study nurses will identify patients who may be eligible for the study. All hospital staff may be reminded (through posters or memorandums) to inform the study coordinato r and/or other study nurses as soon as an ABSSSI patient is admitted. The study coordinator will implement inclusion and exclusion criteria for the new critical pathway by patie nt interview and/or chart review. Inclusion criteria includes clinical judgment that patien t requires coverage for a known or suspected Gram-positive infection. Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria based on study coordinator assessment w ill be enrolled in the study or flagged for further review by core study team physicians, who will make the fi nal enrollment decision. The treating physician will be blinded to pr otocol content and study enrollment decision. Study coordinator will then complete all ad ditional elements of enrollment, including informed consent, and scheduling of follow-up. 3.3.2 Post-period During the post-period, the study coordinator and/or other stu dy nurses will identify patients who may be eligible for the study. As in th e pre-period, physicians or other appropriate healthcare providers may also identify subject s who are eligible for the study. All hospital staff may be reminded (through posters or me morandums) to inform the study coordinator and/or other study nurses as soon as an ABSSSI subject is admitted to the hospital. The study coordinator or treating physicia n will implement the checklist and enroll subjects into the study. Study coordinator will then complete enrollment, including informed consent, and scheduling of follow-up. 3.3.3 Subject follow-up Within both the pre- and post-periods, follow- up for each subject will begin on the day of enrollment (which is anticipated to be the date of treatment initiation) and conclude 44 days thereafter. Follow-up will therefore include the presumed “episode” of antibiotic therapy for ABSSSI (up to 10-14 days) and subsequent 30-day period. 3.3.4 Rationale for subject follow-up Each subject will be followed for a 10-14-day period (i.e. initi al care), which is the longest supported duration of antibiotic therapy for ABSSSI treatment. 15 In order to allow similar opportunity for collection of outcomes in th e pre- and the post-pe riod, the post-period similarly assumes 10-14 days. The addition of 30 days after initial care (i.e. follow-up) was thought to comprehensively assess outcome s during a relevant timeframe after the completion of antibiotic therapy. Therefore, 44 days (initial care and follow-up) for each"
25,page_25,"25 subject encompasses both the maximum treat ment duration and assessment of relevant outcomes in the 30 days following treatment. 3.4 Subject inclusion and exclusion criteria Study subjects will be recr uited among admitted patients with ABSSSI and who require coverage for a known or suspected Gram-positi ve infection. Among all such individuals, attention will be focused on those who meet a ll of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. 3.4.1 Inclusion criteria Eligible study subjects satisfy all of the following inclusion criteria1,10,24  Aged ≥ 18 years  Admitted patients who meet clinical definition for ABSSSI10-11 o Present with the following infection type s: cellulitis/erysipe las, wound infection, or major cutaneous abscess  Known or suspected infecti on caused by susceptible isolat es of the following Gram- positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin -susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (including S. anginosus, S. intermedius, S. constellatus) and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin susceptible strains).  Willing and able to return to the hospital or a designated clinic for scheduled visits, or be in contact with the study coordinator th rough telephone communication, as required by the protocol and the antibiot ic treatment administered 3.4.2 Exclusion criteria Study subjects with any of the fo llowing criteria will be excluded1,12-14  Known or suspected Gram-negative infections including bacteremia, anaerobic infections, or fungemia, even in the presence of Gram-positive infection  Known or suspected infections that are severe, life-threateni ng, or are not included in the ABSSSI FDA guidance, includ ing the following examples:"
26,page_26,"26   Injection drug users presenting with a fever a If the patient is a woman of child-bearing potential, from at least the first dose of study drug until the final visit she must confirm strict abstinence from sexual intercourse with any male or must confirm use of an effective contraceptive method from the following list: A barrier (condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap) with spermicide; Oral or similar contraceptive, which includes, bu t is not limited to: injectable, implanted, or patch hormone therapy, and intrauterine device (IUD); Documented surgical sterili zation at least 4 weeks prior to baseline; Partner vasectomy at least 6 months prior to baseline."
27,page_27,"27  Severe neurological disorder leading to severe immobility or confined to wheelchair or bed (e.g. paraplegia and hemiplegia)  Bilateral lower extrem ity involvement of the suspected infection (to exclude patients with chronic venous stasis)  Unwilling or unable to follow study procedures 3.5 Early study termination A premature discontinuation will occur when a subject who signed the informed consent form (ICF) ceases participation in the st udy, regardless of circumstances, before the completion of all study assessments (i.e., before completing all protocol-stipulated activities). Subjects can be prematurely discontinued from therapy after careful consideration for any one of the following reasons:  Screen failure  Failure to receive complete critical path way by not receiving dalbavancin in the post- period  Withdrawal of consent (a clear reason will be documented)  AE (before or after administration of first dose of antibiotic therapy)  Protocol deviation/viol ation, including lack of protocol compliance  Lost to follow-up (every effort will be made to contact the subject)  Study or site prematurely terminat ed by the sponsor for any reason  If a Gram-negative infection including bacteremia, an anaerobic infection, or fungemia develops during the study, or is subsequently found to have been present at baseline, the subject should be removed from study treatmen t and receive appropriate antibiotic(s) to treat the Gram-negative infection, anaerobic infection, or fungemia.  Other reasons, such as specified administrative reasons or pregnancy All subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study, regardless of cause, should have a final assessment at early te rmination (ET). A final assessment will be defined as either a physical visit or a te lephone call that completes the evaluations scheduled for the Final Visit at the end of study (Day 44 visi t; refer to Section 4.2, Data collection), or an earlier vi sit, depending on the visit schedule and when ET occurs. Subjects who do not complete all scheduled visi ts/procedures will be requested to have an ET Visit. A clear description will be docum ented and source documentation will be kept by the investigator. The reasons for premature di scontinuation from the study will be reflected on the Study Termination page of the CRF. Within these limits, the specific form of contraception employ ed are left to the discretio n of the patient, and/or the principal investigator, and/or the patient’s physician."

34,page_34,"34 4.2 Data collection Information on baseline characteristics, outcomes, and other measures will be collected following subject enrollment in the study and will be based on the medical record and CRFs that will be developed exclus ively for use in this study. Data collection will involve the use of the si te’s electronic data capture (EDC) system through use of CRFs, to which only authorized pe rsonnel will have access. Subject’s data are to be entered into the EDC system by the inve stigator or designee using their assigned EDC user account. After data entry into the EDC system by the investigator or designee, a combination of manual and programmatic edit ch ecks will be used to review the data for completeness, logic, and adherence to study protocol. As a result of these edits checks, data monitoring, and reviews, queries may be electr onically issued to the site and should be answered electronically via the EDC system. 4.2.1 Data collection schedule Table 5 describes expected follow-up. Follow- up visits will be scheduled between 48-72 hours after hospital discharge, 10-14 days after enrollment (end of treatment visit, both periods), and 44 days after enrollment (both periods). 48-72 hours afte r hospital discharge, both pre- and post-period patients will be calle d via telephone. A limited physical visit will be conducted 10-14 days after enrollment. However, for subjects unable to be seen back at the site, a telephone interview will suffice. Re search data will be collected through follow- up visits at between days 10-14 through an in-per son visit (end of treatm ent visit; if patient cannot be seen back at site, telephone call can occur up to 21 days from enrollment) and at 44 days (telephone call can occur up to 51 days from enrollment), through a telephone interview of the subject in both the pre- and post-periods. Additionally, electronic medical chart data will be reviewed at the 10-14 day and 44 day time points from enrollment. Any additional visits to the visit schedule below will be at the discretion of the subject and treating physician."
35,page_35,35
36,page_36,"36 4.2.2 Patient Diary Aid Patients will be provided with a bound, paper diar y to record specific information about their health status on days in which they have an inte raction with a health ca re provider. The diary is intended only as an aid to help patients remember details about health care appointments, medications, and medical tests. Th e diary will not be collected by or returned to study staff. 5 Safety assessments At each visit, subjects are to be queried regarding any adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) that have occurred since the pr evious visit. Subjects will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading question such as , “How do you feel sin ce your last visit?” Study site personnel will record all pertinent information in the subject’s CRF. All AEs will be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the subjec t’s CRF whether or not they are considered causally relate d to the study drug (any antibi otic given for ABSSSI from enrollment, including the pre-period). For every AE, the investigator will:  Provide an assessment of the seriousness of the event (i.e., is it an SAE?), as well as the severity and causal relationship  Document all actions taken w ith regard to the study drug  Detail any other treatment measures taken for the AE  Document the outcome of the AE In addition, subjects will be reminded, as descri bed in the ICF to notify site personnel of any AEs occurring from the time the subject signed the ICF until the final follow-up visit. Any AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol-defined study visit will be followed until the condition returns to pre-study status, has resolved or stabilized, or can be explained as being unrelated to the study drug. If a follow-up visit is d eemed necessary for appropriate safety surveillance, it will take place within 30 days of the final protoc ol-defined study visit. 5.1 Adverse events An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a pa tient or clinical tria l subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal re lationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (i ncluding an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. The definition of an AE includes:  Worsening of a pre-existing condition or underlying disease  Events associated with the discontinuation of the use of a product(s), (e.g., appearance of new symptoms)"
37,page_37,"37 Please note hospital admissions and/or medica l/surgical procedures scheduled prior to consenting, but occurring during the study will not be captured as AEs, but will be listed in the medical history if related to a pre-existing condition. AEs or abnormal test findings will be followed until the event (or it s sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the sponsor/investigator. 5.2 Causality assessment For each AE, the investigator will provide an assessment of causal relationship to the study drug. The causality assessment will be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the subject’s CRF. Causal relationship will be assessed by answering the following question: Is there a reasonable possibility the study drug caused the event? Yes: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and adverse event; i.e.:  There is a reasonable temporal relations hip between the study drug and the event, and/or  The event is unlikely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other study drugs, or other factors, and/or  Positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge exist No: There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and adverse event, i.e.:  There is no reasonable temporal relationshi p between the study drug and the event, or  The subject did not take the study drug, or  The event is likely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other study drugs, or other factors, or  The event is commonly occurr ing in the (study) populati on independent of study drug exposure 5.3 Severity assessment The investigator will provide an assessment of th e severity of each AE by recording a severity rating on the appropriate AE repor ting page of the subject’s CRF. Severity, which is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness, which implies a subject outcome or AE-re quired treatment measure associat ed with a threat to life or functionality. Severity will be asse ssed according to the following scale: Mild: Minor awareness of signs or symptoms that are easily tolerated without specific medical intervention Moderate: Discomfort that interferes with us ual activities and may require minimal intervention"
38,page_38,"38 Severe: Significant signs or symptoms that are inca pacitating with an in ability to work or perform routine activities and/or that require medical intervention 5.4 Serious adverse events An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  Results in death  Is life-threatening (i.e., th e subject was, in the opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe)  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  Is an important medical event that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might je opardize the subject or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse. In general, hospitalization signifies that the pa rticipant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital fo r observation and/or trea tment that would not have been appropriate in the physic ian’s office or outpatient setting. Emergency room visits that do not result in hospitalization should be evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes to determin e whether they qualify as SAEs. 5.5 Medication error Medication error refers to any unintended erro r in the dosing and/or administration of the study drug as per instructions in the prescrib ing information. Medication errors generally fall into 4 categories as follows:  Wrong drug  Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, stre ngth, form, concentration, amount);  Wrong route of administration;  Wrong subject (i.e. not administer ed to the intended subject). Medication Errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study drug."
39,page_39,"39 5.6 Procedure for collection of adverse ev ents and serious adverse events All nonserious AEs and SAEs that occur in a subject from the time he or she signs the ICF until the final follow-up visit will be assessed and recorded on the source documents and CRF, regardless of causal rela tionship to the study drug. 5.7 Procedure for serious ad verse event reporting All SAEs that occur in a subject from the time he or she signs the ICF until the final follow-up visit will be reported to th e sponsor within 24 hours of aw areness of the event using the provided SAE Report Form. The completed SAE Report Form will be sent directly to the sponsor by emailing . In addition to completing the SAE Report Form, each SAE will be entered on the appr opriate page of the CRF. The investigator will assess the causality for each SAE. When death occurs with an SAE, the cause of death will be reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be reported as the outcome for these events. The sponsor will contact the investigator, if nece ssary, to clarify any of the event information. The investigator will provide any follow-up in formation for the event to the sponsor on an updated SAE report form as soon as it becomes available. If the investigator is notified of a SAE that o ccurs post-study period, that he or she wishes to report to the sponsor (e.g., an event suspected to be causally related to the study drug), the event will be reported through the process described above. Where appropriate, if required by local regula tions or procedures, the in vestigator will report these events to the Institutional Review Bo ard (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) and/or national regulatory authority in addition to the sponsor. 5.8 Procedure for medication error reporting Medication errors with or without an associated AE will be recorded as medication errors in the CRF. SAEs associated with medication er rors will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section 5.7. 5.9 Procedures for reporting preg nancies/lactation exposure Occurrences of pregnancy/lactat ion exposure in a subject should be reported within 24 hours. In cases where a pregnancy/lactation exposure occurs with a SAE, the SAE report form should be used to report the SAE and the Pre gnancy Reporting form should be used to report the pregnancy. When a pregnancy occurs without any concu rrent SAE, the Pregnancy Reporting form will be submitted alone. The pregnancy will be followed through to outcome of pregnancy, including spontaneous or volunta ry termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Any pregnancy discovered from the time of consent to follow-up will be reported."
40,page_40,"40 5.10 Potential Hy’s Law cases Every subject that meets poten tial Hy’s law criteria, • ALT or AST >/=3xULN AND • Total Bilirubin >/=2xULN AND • Alkaline Phosphatase <2xULN occurring anytime from the time he or she signs the ICF for the trial until the final follow up visit, investigators will notif y the sponsor immediately when all the above criteria have been met. A potential Hy’s law case will be se nt directly to the sponsor by emailing IR- clinical-SAE@allergan.com on an AE of Special Interest Form along with the SAE Report Form as soon as possible (within 24 hours of learning of the potential Hy’s law). The CRF for potential Hy’s law cases will be completed within seven calendar days. Every effort to determine the cause of the liv er enzyme abnormalities will be made, and close monitoring will be initiated in conjunction with the medical monitor and in accordance with the FDA “Guidance for Industry: Drug Induced Liver In jury- Pre-Marketing Cl inical Evaluation” July 2009. 6 Data analysis Frequency and proportion of subjects deemed eligible and ineligible for study enrollment based on each of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be summarized. The frequency and proportion of subjects who successfully comple te the study, withdraw, were lost-to-follow- up, and who terminated the study early, will also be reporte d. Subject characteristics at baseline will be summarized and described for all enrolled subjects and compared between the pre- and post-periods. Site characteristics will also be described. Descriptive statistics (count, mean, standard deviation, range for quantit ative variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables) will be reported fo r all outcomes. The difference in study outcomes between the pre- and post-period will be as sessed using appropriate statistical methods, accounting for study site, with adequate power . The primary outcome will be tested for simple superiority, and subseque ntly, tested for non-inferiority with a 10% margin between the pre- and post-periods. The primary analysis of differences in LOS is performed using a 2-si ded hypothesis test of the modified intent-to-treat principle such th at all evaluable patient s are included in the analysis. Patients are evaluable if they received at least one dose of antimicrobial therapy for their ABSSSI. Differences in length of st ay are measured by Mann-Whitney U test. The secondary endpoints in this study are inte nded for hypothesis testi ng and are not powered for statistical significance. Di fferences in continuous variable s of secondary endpoints will be measured by Mann-Whitney U test, while di fference in proportions will be analyzed by Fisher’s exact test All analyses will be specified in a detailed statis tical analysis plan (SAP) that will be prepared subsequently and before database lock. Th e SAP will include table and figure shells."
41,page_41,"41 6.1 Cost Cost data will not be collected in the study. As thes e data often vary by site and insurer, representative unit cost estimates for each h ealthcare service/medication identified during the collection of outcome measures will be identi fied. Total costs of care for each study subject will then be estimated by multiply ing utilization of healthcare se rvices collected via the CRF by the corresponding unit costs; mean/median total costs of care during the pre- and post- periods will then be estimated and compared. The approach to the pre-post comparison and unit costs will be defined in the SAP. 6.2 Handling of missing data The SAP will define how missing values and info rmation from subjects lost to follow-up will be handled. Site procedures will be devel oped to minimize the amount of missing data however, as this is a pragmatic trial, missing data is expected. Certain outcomes are based on data availability from sites (e.g. laboratory values will be summarized for subjects who had data collected). The extent of missing values will be examined to assess completeness of data among the study cohort. In addition, the characteristics of part icipants with and without missing data will be examined to assess whether participant characteristics have any relationship to incompleteness. 6.3 Sample size and sample size considerations The sample size was estimated for a two-sided hypothesis test (two-sample equal-variance T-test) with a significance level of 0.05 comp aring total hospital tim e (number of days) between the pre- and post-periods with 80% pow er. Assuming an averag e hospital length of stay of 4.0 days (inclusive of all enrolled s ubjects), with a standard deviation of 3.0 days, and a 2 day reduction in length of stay between the pre- and post-periods, it was estimated that 37 subjects in each arm of the trial (total enrollment of 74) would be required to demonstrate a mean reduction in hospital stay of 2 day. The final enrollment, including adjustments for attrition came to 86 s ubjects (43 patients in each period). However, average length of stay and variance, which is correlated to the primary outcome of total hospital time for th e study population, is largely unknown. The estimated sample size will be targeted, yet a subsequent sample size calculation will be undertaken through an interim analysis. The average length of stay and variance for the site will be determined once an estimated 25 subjects have been en rolled in the pre-period. Based on a revised sample size calculation at the time of the inte rim analysis, any adjustments to targeted sample size will be finalized. 6.4 Data monitoring and quality control Before any subject enters the study, a represen tative of the sponsor will meet with the investigator and core study team to review the procedures to be followed during the study. Functionality training for electronic data cap ture (EDC) provided through REDCap or other suitable data platform will be provided via in-person training or computer to investigators and authorized designees on r ecording the data in the CRFs using the EDC system. All"
42,page_42,"42 subject information and data will be consid ered private health information and kept confidential in compliance with HIPAA (Health Insurance Po rtability and Accountability Act of 1996). After the first subject is enroll ed, the sponsor will pe riodically monitor the progress of the study by teleconference and/or conducting on-site visits. The sponsor may request and review query st atuses, possibly warranting more frequent communication and/or site visits with the i nvestigator and the study site st aff. The investigator will make available to the sponsor source documents (writt en notes and electronic medical records, if used), signed consent forms, and all other study-related documents. The investigator and the study site staff will be responsible for data entry of subject data into the CRFs via the EDC system, resolving data queries genera ted via the EDC system and providing missing or corrected data. The investigator will be responsible for approving all data entry and all changes performed on the data, and endorsing the subject data with in the EDC system. Quality control will be implemented and maintained throughout the conduct of the study. Data collection will involve the use of the ED C system provided by the site, to which only authorized personnel will have access. Subject’s data will be entere d into the EDC system by the investigator or designee using their assigned EDC user account as specified in Section 4.2 Data collection. 7 Study site and study administrative structure 7.1 Core study team The core study team will cons ist of primary investigators a nd sponsor representatives. The primary investigators on the core study team w ill be responsible for tr aining of the site study teams, responsible for adherence to the protocol , monitoring and reporting as consistent with regulation and law, and coordinating and partic ipating in training sessions for the site study teams. The site investigators on the core study team is responsible for coordinating training of the site study teams for both protoc ol adherence and implementation and operationalization of the new critical pathwa y, including site-speci fic considerations. Training will occur before enrollment in the pre- and post-periods for adherence to the protocol. Training will additionally occur fo r implementation of the new critical pathway during the 2-4 weeks after the last subject is enrolled during the pre- period of the study. 7.2 Site study team The site study team at each site will consist of the primary site investigators and study administrators, including hosp ital staff (including physicians , nurses, and/or pharmacists), who will be responsible for adhe ring to the protocol for both the pre- and post-periods. The site study team will be further supported by the core st udy team. The site study team will be responsible for participating in training sessions and/or enga gement in communication from site investigators on the core study team, in regards to st udy background/rationale, site procedures to identify and enroll subjects w ho are eligible for the study during the pre- and post-periods, data collection, and follow-up of subjects. Specifically, for the post-period, training on the implementation of the new critical pathway is vital. Training will include site procedures, such as how to obtain study dr ug during the post-period from the hospital pharmacy and the location to administer study drug. This will ensu re adherence to the protocol and that operationalization of the study is consistent dur ing both study periods."
43,page_43,"43 8 Ethical considerations 8.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance and protectio n of human subjects To ensure safety of participating subjects, this study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the rules and regulations of each institutional review board (IRB), informed consent regulations, and standard operating pr ocedures (SOP) of the sponsor, and the site. This study will adhere to all applicable local regulatory re quirements and be governed according to local laws and regulations. The following rules, regulations, and practices will be adhered to: Good Clinical Practice (GCP ) guidelines, International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines, Declarati on of Helsinki, and the Belmont Report. 8.2 Subject confidentiality All necessary measures will take place to ensure subject confidentiality. Only site study team members will know the identity of participati ng subjects, however no identifying information will be collected on any study-related documents. Any data provi ded to the sponsor will be provided by using the unique subject ID. The sponsor will not have access to any subject identification log. Any data reported or publishe d will be presented as aggregated data, and no individual data will be reported to re duce any risk of subject identification. 8.3 Informed consent procedures Patients, after being given an explanation of the study, will give voluntary and written informed consent and HIPAA (Health Insura nce Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) authorization (in compliance with 21 CFR, Parts 50 and 312) or other appropriate documentation, according to local regulatory re quirements, before participating in any study-related procedures. Informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to the beginning of any study- specific activities, and will include consent to collection of clinical, economic and humanistic outcomes. This may involve gathering data through chart review or directly eliciting information from subjects. Informed consent during the post-period, or interventional period, will involve consent to treatment through a new critical pathway and cons ent to collection of clinical, economic and humanistic outcomes. Each eligible subj ect will have the opportunity to read and review the approved informed c onsent form (ICF) and have the opportunity to ask questions to the participating Study Inves tigator, Study Coordinator, or other study team member. Signed copies of the ICF and the HIP AA or other locally applicable form will be given to the subject, and both documents will be placed in th e investigator’s study files. The participating subject may w ithdraw participation and/or informed consent at any time throughout the conduct of the study. Withdrawing pa rticipation will relie ve the subject from any future data collection time points; withdraw ing consent will relieve the subject from any future data collection time points and rem ove any historic stud y data collection. 8.4 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB The responsibilities of investigat ors include creation of and main tenance of a core study team (Please refer to Section 7 for more informati on), adhering to protocol requirements, including"
44,page_44,"44 educational requirements for implementation of the intervention in the post-period, and ultimately, are the institutional leads to support protocol implementation. The study team will be responsible for timely reporting, where appropriate, to the institutional IRB. The investigators must demonstrate reasonable efforts to obtain qualified patients for the study. The responsibilities of the IRB in clude adhering to institutional requirements, performing an objective review of the accep tability of the study protocol and analysis plan (i.e. research) in terms of institutional requirements, commitments, regulations, applicable law, and professional conduct and practice, provide continued monitori ng and review of research, review of key events (proto col amendments, protocol deviations, adverse events, or non- compliance), review of any requ ired progress reports, and to report any required information to appropriate authoritie s and/or organizations. 8.5 Publication All data generated in this study are the propert y of the sponsor. An integrated clinical and statistical analysis report will be prep ared at the completion of the study. Publication of the results by the investigator wi ll be subject to mutual agreement between the investigator and the sponsor and will follow the sponsor’s SOP on publications. 9 Protocol deviations and violations A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures that is under the investigator’s responsibility and oversight (as defined by regulations) without prior written IRB approva l or favorable opinion of an appropriate amendment and that does not have a major impa ct on the subject’s rights, safety, or well- being, or on the integrity and au thenticity of the study data. Deviations may include, but are not limited to, departure from inclusion/exclus ion criteria, dosing, duration of treatment, failure to perform the required assessments at specified time points, sc heduling of visits not in accordance with specifications, or subject sa fety. Deviating from the protocol is permitted only if absolutely necessary for the safety or clinical management of the subjects and will immediately be reported to the sponsor. Protoc ol deviations will be re ported to the sponsor either verbally or electronically within 5 working days from the day of discovery. A protocol violation is a form of protocol deviation that has a major impact on the subject’s rights, safety, or well-being, or on the integrity and authentic ity of the study data. Protocol violations will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours, if possible. The IRB will be notified within the time period dictated by the IRB associated with this study. 9.1 Protocol amendments Any amendment to this protocol will be prov ided to the investigator in writing by the sponsor. No protocol amendment will be implemented (with the exceptions noted below) before it has been approved by the IRB and th e signature page, signed by the investigator, has been received by the sponsor. If the protocol is amended to eliminate or reduce the risk to subjects, the amendment will be implem ented before IRB review and approval. However, the IRB will be informed in writing of such an amendment, and approval will be obtained within reasonable time limits."

48,page_48,"48 11 Appendices 11.1 Measurement of lesion characteristics Measurements are to be taken while the infected area is in a nondependent position, e.g., if infection was on the leg, the subject was lying down, not sitting or standing. All types of infections are to be measured as measurement of erythema upon enrollment and any subsequent physical follow-up visits. Maximal dimensions of erythema, both width and length, are to be recorded in centimeters. Investigators should attempt to find the infection edge that best distinguished erythema from non- erythematous skin. Erythema is to be measured in the dimension of maximal length. The maximal width is to be measured perpendicular to the axis of the maximal length. The maximal width measurement does not have to be in the center if the area of erythema is irregular. The length of the infection is to be multiplied by perpendicular width of wound."
