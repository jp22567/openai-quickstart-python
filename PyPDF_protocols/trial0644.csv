SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: A double blind (sponsor open) pla cebo -controlled , stratified, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of repeat doses of GSK3772847 in participants with moderate t o severe asthma with allergic fungal airway disease (AFAD) . Short Title: Repeat dose study of GSK3772847 in participants with moderate to severe asthma with allergic fungal airway disease (AFAD) . Rationale: GSK3772847 (formerl y CNTO 7160, which was in -licensed from Janssen) is a human immunoglobulin G2 sigma isoty pe (IgG2 ) antibody that binds Domain 1 of the cell - surface interleukin -33 receptor (IL -33R). Inhibition of IL -33 signalling via blockade of the IL -33 receptor (Suppressor of tumorigenicit y 2 [ST2] , also known as Interleukin -1 receptor like -1 [IL -1RL1]) presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma as an add-on to standard of care. Agents targeting this mechanism could be expected to have effects on both ty pe 2 (T2) -driven and non -T2-driven disease. Allergic fungal airway disease (AFAD) is defined as Immunoglobulin E ( IgE) sensitisation to thermotolerant filamentous fungi particularl y Aspergillus fumigatus . Clinical data suggest increased IL -33 levels in bronchoalveolar ( BAL )fluid and endob ronchial biops y at baseline disease of children with severe asthma with fungal sensitisation and in l ung tissue samples from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [I n-house unpublished data]. Recent data reported an association between IgEsensitisation to colonising thermotolerant filamentous fungi and the presence of lung damage as demonstrated by high-resolution computed tomograph y (HRCT )scanning in moderate to severe asthma. This study aims to evaluate the effects of GSK3772847 in mode rate to severe asthma participants with AFAD on top of standard of care. Objectives and Endpoints : Objectives Endpoints Primary To evaluate the efficacy of 3 doses of GSK3772847 (administered every 4 weeks) compared with placebo in moderate to severe asthma participants with allergic fungal airway disease ( AFAD )who are currently on S tandard of Care (SoC)Change from baseline (Week 0) in blood eosinophils over time Change from baseline (Week 0) in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) over time Secondar y To evaluate the serum pharmacokinetics (PK) of 3 doses of GSK3772847 (administered every 4 weeks) in moderate to severe asthma participants with AFAD Serum concentrations of GSK3772847 To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of GSK3772847 in moderate to severe asthma participants with AFAD Serum levels of free and total soluble ST2"

INTRODUCTION GSK3772847 (formerl y CNTO 7160, which was in -licensed from Janssen) is a human immunoglobulin G2 sigma isoty pe (IgG2 )antibody that binds Domain 1 of the cell - surface interleukin -33 receptor ( IL-33R). Inhibition of IL -33 signalling via blockade of the IL -33 receptor (Suppressor of tumorigenicit y 2 [ST2], also known as interleukin -1 receptor like -1 [IL-1RL1 ]) presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma as an add-on to standard of care. Agents targeting this mechanism could be expected to have effects on both type 2 ( T2)-driven and non -T2-driven disease. At the t ime of writing this protocol, a two -part, single and multiple ascending dose first time in human study has completed dosing (GlaxoSmithKline D ocument Number 2017N344518_00 ). The safet y information from this stud y is included in the investigator brochure. Another study , a Phase IIa, multicentre , randomised, placebo -controlled, double -blind, stratified, parallel group study in moderately severe asthmatics started in September 2017 and aims to complete in late 2018 . The present stud y is a Phase IIa study to provide supplemental efficacy , safety and tolerability , pharmacokinetic ( PK)and pharmacody namic ( PD)profiles of GSK3772847 in patients with moderate to severe asthma with allergic fungal airway disease (AFAD). 3.1. Stud y Rationale This study aims to evaluate the effects of GSK3772847 in moderate to severe asthma participants with AFAD on top of standard of care. Evidence suggests that in order to observe the maximum benefit of targeting the IL-33 signalling pathway with GSK3772847, participants would need to be in a state of pulmonary cellular damage. Clinical data suggest increased IL -33 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL )fluid and endobronchial biops y at baseline disease of children with severe asthma with fun gal sensitisation [Castanhinha ,2015] . Also, lung tissue samples from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis indicate a markedly increased IL-33 expression [I n- house unpublished data]. Recent data reported an association between immunoglobulin E (IgE)sensitisation to colonising thermotolerant filamentous fungi and the presence of graded lung damage as demonstrated by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT ) scanning (such as bronchiectasis, bronc hial wall thickness, air trapping, etc.) in moderate to severe asthma [Woolnough ,2016] .Therefore, the target population is moderate to severe asthmatics who have allergic fungal airway disease (defined as IgE se nsitisation to thermotolerant filamentous fungi particularl y Aspergillus fumigatus , including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [ABPA ]) [Rick , 2016] .Moderate to severe asthmatics are defined as asthmatics who are well controlled with Step 3 or 4 treatment, respectivel y, based on Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA,2017 ]Guidelines . 3.2. Background Asthma is a serious public health problem affecting about 300 million individuals worldwide. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airway s, defined by a"
17,page_17,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 18history of respiratory symptoms of variable length and intensity together with variable airflow limitation. These sy mptoms are often triggered by allergen or irritant exposure, exercise or viral respiratory infections [GINA, 2017 ]. When uncontrolled, asthma can place severe limitations on daily life, and is sometimes fatal. Severe asthma represents approximately 5-10% of the asthma population a nd is associated with a greater frequency of asthma exacerbations, decreased health -related quality of life and greater sy mptom burden [Chung , 2014 ], [Aburuz , 2007, Moore , 2007 ). Fungal exposure has been associated with asthma severit y[O'Driscoll , 2005 ]. Moderate to severe asthmatics who are sensitised to Aspergillus fumigatus have impaired lung functi on, as demonstrated by reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV 1), more severe airway obstruction, and the requirement for higher doses of corticosteroids [Denning , 2006] [Menzies ,2011]. Aspergillus fumigatus (thermotolerant filamentous fungi) are able to colonise the airway s and cause lung damage [Moss , 2014 ]. Susceptible hosts such as moderate to severe asthmatics with reduced muc ocilliary clearance functions are unable to efficiently clear their respiratory epithelium of inhaled fungal spores. This leads to increased contact of fungal spores with the immune system, thereb y facilitating fungal growth and mucosal colonisation [Tracy , 2016] . The resulting immune response in susceptible hosts is a deviation towards a Th2 -driven immune response with increased production of Th2 cy tokines ,in part driven by IL-33 that is derived from the airway epith elium. GSK3772847 binds to the extracellular domain of IL -33R and neutralizes IL -33-mediated IL-33R signalling . The IL-33R gene codes for both a soluble form (sST2) and a membrane -bound “long” form (ST2L or IL -33R). Soluble ST2 exists in the serum and is elevated in severe asthmatics during an exacerbation [Smithgall , 2008, Oshikawa ,2001] . IL-33R is expressed on a variet y of immune and non -immune cells. IL -33 has been shown to be released after endothelial or epithelial cell damage during trauma, physicochemical / microbarometric stress or infection [Arshad , 2016] . The IL -33R pathway causes downstream production of Ty pe 2 cy tokines and c ontributes to Th2 - mediated pathologies and allergic responses [Yagami , 2010, Smithgall ,2008] , but has also been shown to promote Th1 -and Th17 -mediated responses [Arshad , 2016 , Smithgall , 2008 ]. Inhibition of IL -33 signalling may result in down regulation of immune cell responses and therefore presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma on top of standard of care [Arshad ,2016] . In a 3 -month good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology study , GSK3772847 was administered to cy nomolgus monkey s as a weekl y 15-minute intravenous ( IV)infusion (20 or 100 mg /kg) and was found to be well -tolerated at both doses. A Phase I randomised , double -blind, placebo -controlled, IVsingle ascending dose stud y in healthy participants and multiple ascending dose study in participants with asthma and participants with atopi c dermatitis (Study CNTO7160ASH1001) has completed dosing. The final clinical stud y report is still pending. There are no efficacy data available to date."

Risk A ssessment Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Investigational Prod uct (IP) GSK3772847 Cardiovascular (CV) There is evidence to suggest that the IL -33/ST2 pathway may be protective in the cardiovascular system. Components of the IL -33/ST2 pathway are expressed in a number of cellular components of the heart and blood ves sels in rodents and human patients. Increased circulating levels of soluble ST2 are markers of a poor prognosis in patients with hemodynamic stress (e.g. hemodynamic - hypertrophy, chamber dilation, fibrosis; ischemic - apoptosis and infarct volume). The effec t was abolished in rodents with genetic knockout of ST2. Atherosclerotic plaque development was significantly reduced in ApoE -/-mice given exogenous IL -33 while plaques were larger in mice treated with soluble ST2 (which binds and blocks IL -33).Non-clinical : No GSK3772847 -related changes noted in (non- GLP) IV and subcutaneous ( SC)4 week monkey study at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week, or in the GLP 3 month IV repeat dose toxicity study at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week) or SC administration. However ,it should be noted that the animals in toxicity studies are healthy and, therefore, are unlikely to detect the pot ential target related CV liability. Clinical : In Janssen study CNTO 7160ASH1001, several episodes of sinus tachycardia on telemetry were reported in a 20 -year-old male healthy volunteer, between 1 and 9 hours post -dose (10 mg/kg), accompanied on one occas ion by mild vertigo and malaise (no chest pain). Troponin I, N - terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were normal pre dose and Day 5, also normal ECG and vital signs including temperature. The event was considered by the investigator to be likely related to investigational product . No specific cause was identified. Data on this event was reviewed by GSK (Internal Cardiac Safety Panel and C hief Medical Officer ), Exclude participants with existing clinically significant organic heart disease (e.g. Coronary artery disease [CAD], ACC/AHA Stage C/D, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III/IV heart failure) and abnormal, clinically significant findings from 12 -lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and 24 -hour Holter monitoring (Section 6.2and Section 6.3). CV events will be monitored (including ECG and Holter monitoring) as specifie d in SoA (Section 2). All cardiac -related adverse events ( AEs)will be reviewed by an internal safety review committee (iSRC , see Appen dix 3 ). Protocol - defined stopping cri teria are specified in Section 8.1."

During 12 ho urs post -dose telemetry monitoring in Part 1 of Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001, 6 out of 60 completed subjects were assessed to have abnormal findings by the investigator. The abnormalities were considered clinically significant and recorded as treatment em ergent adverse events. In Part 2 of the Janssen study CNTO 7160ASH1001, there were fourreports of non - sustained ventricular tachycardia. Of these reports, one participant received placebo and two received GSK3772847 at 3 mg/kg and one received GSK377284 7 at 10 mg/kg. The events were non -symptomatic, and a monomorphic pattern (i.e., not Torsades de pointes), which is a pattern thought not to be indicative of increased risk for sudden ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. Heart rate (HR) analysis did n ot identify any safety concern (no pattern of increased HR suggestive of an increase in sympathetic tone). All 4 participants had normal results from exercise test and echocardiogram. Dosing was continued as planned, and the dose escalated to 10 mg/kg."

IL -33 was shown to activate neutrophils in BALB/c m ice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture thus preventing polymicrobial sepsis. Similarly, IL -33 is thought to stimulate neutrophil recruitment from the bone marrow to the periphery in response to fungal infection. Mice infected with flu virus and admin istered an IL -33 inhibitor exhibited a lower number of clusters of differentiated CD90+ and cluster of differentiated CD25+ inate lymphoid cells with consequent impaired lung function compared to phosphate buffered saline treated controls. IL -33 has also b een shown to be produced in the helminth infected cecum of parasite infected mice and is shown to be important in expulsion of the parasite. Preclinical: No GSK3772847 -related changes in clinical signs, white blood cell count or no microscopic changes (in flammatory cell infiltrates) in any tissues indicative of infection observed in monkey 4 week IV/SC or IV 3 month toxicity at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week. Clinical: Safety data from Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001 Single Ascending Dose has shown the most freque nt AEs reported as infections, including nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, gastroenteritis and upper respiratory tract infection.

Benefit A ssessment Efficacy of GSK3772847 has not y et been demonstrated and there are no existent data from molecules with the same or similar mode of action . Taking part in this study may or may not improve a participant’s health, and may or may not directl y benefit a parti cipant. This study will provide additional safety and efficacy information on GSK3772847. Whilst the in vivo models of T2 asthma support a role for IL -33 pathway in eosinophilic asthma disease, it is clear that IL -33 play s a significant role in other t ypes of immune responses and cell ty pes including amplification of Th1 and Th17 responses in combination with other cy tokines [Arshad , 2016 ; Smithgall , 2008 ]. Agents targeting th is mechanism could be expected to have effects on both ty pe 2 (T2) -driven and non -T2- driven disease.

Medical ass essments are planned during the stud y to evaluate participants’ health status. The assessments include physical examination, vital signs , ECG, Holter monitoring, and clinical laboratory evaluation including liver chemistry and blood chemistry panel at a nu mber of clinic visits. Participants’ health status will also be evaluated by ACQ -5 and AQLQ during the study .

The aim will be to retain participants in the study post withdrawal of study medication to follow -up for safet y. 3.3.3. Overall Benefit :Risk Conclusion Taking into account measures to minimize the risk to the participants participating in the study , the balance of anticipated benefits and apparent risks associated with GSK3772847 continues to be acceptable. There is an opportunity to determine if there is a new drug that can be developed for patients with severe asthma who may benefit from the broad spectrum effects h ypothesiz ed for GSK3772847."

Each participant will be involved in the study for approximately 28 weeks. At specified visits, each participant will undergo the following proce dures: Sputum inductions at baseline (Visit 2)and end of treatment period (Visit 7). The sputum inductions may each be repeated once: for baseline at Visit 3 and for end of treatment period at an extra visit after Visit 7; 24 h Holter monitoring at Visits 2 and 3 only . During treatment period study visits, the participant will: Have blood drawn, for PD and/or PK assessments; Undergo FeNO measurement and spirometry ; Have vital signs measured; and Complete 2 Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires. For parti cipants who discontinue I P earl y, but have not withdrawn consent to participate in the study , an earl y withdrawal (EW) visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of blinded study treatment. These participants should continue in the study and compl ete all assessments at the remaining protocol -defined visits until their EW visit, and complete the follow -up visit assessments. 5.2.

Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will use a randomised, multi -centre, double blind (sponsor open) , placebo - controlled, parallel -group design. This is a well -established design to evaluate the efficacy , safet y, PK and PD profile of an investigational medicinal product . Use of a pla cebo arm is considered justified as all patients will be continuing on standard of care treatments and will also allow the absolute effect of GSK3772847 to be assessed. The study will be sponsor open to allow selected sponsor study team members to be unblinded in order to perform interim anal ysis of in -stream data. The dosing duration of 8 weeks is supported b y pre -clinical study data. Dosing frequency of GSK3772847 every 4 weeks with endpoints assessments scheduled 4 weeks post final dose were determined by the available target engagement pharmacody namic findings. Participants will be followed up for an additional 12 weeks before a final safet y evaluation. This follow up period will ensure that sufficient PK samples are collected to characterise the phar macokinetics, pharmacody namics, and anti -drug antibody responses in this patient population. 5.5. Dose Justification The dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg IV at Week 0 then Weeks 4 and 8 was selected based on the observed evidence of target suppression following singl e doses in healthy participants (CNTO7160ASH1001 ). In summary , administration of a single 10 mg/kg dose led to significant (>95%) suppression of serum free sST2 and sustained elevations of total sST2 up to at least 28 day s after dosing. Therefore, the sele cted regimen should deliver significant target suppression throughout the treatment period, including at trough, and allow determination of the impact of targeting this pathway on the primary endpoint (measured over 0 -12 weeks). Simulations of exposure wer e generated using a preliminary Michaelis Menten (MM) population PK model using the single dose data from 0.03 -10 mg/kg up to 28 day s. Safety margins were estimated by comparing the mean clinical exposures (predicted or observed) against the mean observati ons in the 3 -month GL P toxicology study in cynomolgus monkey s (T-2013 -007). Area under the curve (AUC) margins were calculated b y comparing the predicted clinical exposures from 0 -28 weeks (end of study ) to the observed exposure from 0 -92 day s (13 weeks) w hen the main stud y animals were removed from stud y. Predicted exposures throughout the study and follow up period are significantl y lower than those observed in stud y T-2013 -007 as shown in Figure 2. The anticipat ed exposure margins of the dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg IV at Week 0 then Weeks 4, and 8 over the 3 -month GL P toxicology study in cy nomolgus monkey s (T- 2013 -007) are summarised in Figure 2."

Clearance was estimated at 2.38 mL/kg/day , therefore ,mean predicted AUC( ) at steady state is 4202 µg.day /mL. The mean AUC(day 85-92) at the no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL )(100 mg/kg, IV, weekly ) in cy nomolgus monkey s was 27408 µg.day /mL (T -2013 -007).

Medical Devices Other medical devices (not manufactured b y or for GSK )provided for use in this study are 24h Holter monitor . Instructions for the 24h Holter monitor use are provided in the Holter monitor manual . 7.1.2. Rescue medication A rescue inhaler for as needed use throughout the study will be dispensed starting at Visit 2.At the Investigator’s dis cretion, more than one rescue inhalers may be dispensed at an y one time. Short acting -2 agonist (SABA) will be sourced from local commercial stock. The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. The investiga tor should attempt to match the participant’s current medication or provide a suitable alternative. The use of rescue medications is allowable at any time during the study following randomisation. The date of rescue medication administration must be record ed on the rescue medication worksheet/diary card. 7.2. Dose Modification There are no dose modifications planned for this protocol. 7.3. Method of Treatment A ssignment Participants will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomisation schedule. The randomisation code will be generated by GSK using a validated computerised s ystem. Participants will be randomised using an interactive web response system (IWRS). The study will use central -based randomisation to allocate treatments. Once a randomisat ion number is assigned to a participant ,it cannot be reassigned to an y other participant in the study . Following the 2 -week Run -in period and satisfaction of all eligibility criteria, participants will be randomised 1:1 to one of the following double -blind(sponsor open) treatments for the duration of the Treatment Period: GSK3772847 (10 mg/kg) administered intravenously Placebo administered intravenousl y The duration of the Treatment Period for each participant is 1 2weeks. Study treatment will be dispen sed at the study visits summarized in the SoA (Section 2). Returned stud y treatment should not be re -dispensed to the participants. Each Investigator will be provided with sufficient supplies to conduct the tri al. Additional treatment kits will be supplied as needed to the sites. Details of how to use the I WRS system to randomis e participants and manage study treatment supplies (including dispensing) is provided in the IWRSmanual and the SRM."
44,page_44,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 457.4. Blinding This will be a double blind (sponsor open) stud yand the following will apply : All study staff involved in clinical assessments (which includes the investigator, sub-investigators, other site staff), and the participant will be blinded to the treatment allocated to individual participants. Selected sponsor study team members (and delegates if programming activities are outsourced) will be unblinded to perform the interim analy sis. This may include the study statistician, study programmer (and delegates) and study pharmacokineticist; however, only the statistician and programmer (and delegates) will have access to individual participant level data. Access to unblinded data will be kept to the minimum set of individuals required to implement any interim analy ses, but m ay include GSK management/review committees if alterations to the study conduct are required. Details of who were unblinded to what data and when will be included in the clinical study report. The I WRS will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. I n case of an emergency , the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s treatment assignment is warranted. Participant safet y must alway s be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the invest igator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact GSK prior to unblinding a participant’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the participant. If a participant’s treatment assi gnment is unblinded GSK must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and Case Report Form (CRF), as applicable. In the event of unblinding b y the inv estigator or treating phy sician the Medical monitor/GSK team should be contacted to determine whether subject withdrawal is required. Should a participant’s treatment assignment be unblinded and the Medical monitor/GSK team determine that the participant m ust be withdrawn from study treatment, the participant must be followed -up as per protocol until the completion of the early withdrawal (EW) assessments (see SoA in Section 2). A participant whose treatment assi gnment is inadvertently unblinded (either to investigative staff or the participant themselves) will be permitted to remain in the study , although the accidental unblinding will be recorded as a protocol deviation and hence the participant will be subject to review as to their inclusion in analyses. Participants will be randomised in a [1:1] ratio to receive study treatment. Investigators will remain blinded to each participant’s assigned study treatment throughout the course of the study . In order to main tain this blind, an otherwise uninvolved 3rd party (such as an unblinded pharmacist or other appropriatel y licensed and authorised personnel) will be responsible for the reconstitution and dispensation of all study treatment and will endeavour to ensure th at there are no differences in time taken to dispense following randomisation."

GSK’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance staff may unblind the treatment assignment for an y participant w ith an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regu latory agencies, a cop y of the report, identify ing the participant’s treatment assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy . 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability 7.5.1. Accountability 1.The investigator or d esignee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the stud y treatment. 2.Only participants enrolled in the study may rece ive study treatment and only authori sed site staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentall y controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage condit ions with access limited to the investigator and authori sed site staff. 3.The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for stud y treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 4.Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the Study Reference Manual. 7.5.2. Preparation, Storage and Handling GSK3772847 is provided as a white t o yellow, uniform ly ophilized cake in a 5ml clear glass vial with 20mm closure sealed b y red metal and y ellow overseal. Each vial contains 100 mg of a ly ophilised GSK3772847. When reconstituted with 2.0 mL of water for injection , the final concentration of GSK3772847 is 50 mg/mL . Excipients include: sucrose, sodium phosphate buffer, and pol ysorbate 20 at a pH of 7.3. Vials contain no preservatives and thus are for single use. Vials must be stored 2 –8C, protected from light. Protection from light during preparation and administration is not required. Full details on specific 2 to 8C storage temperature conditions, preparation and administration including requirements for filtration are provided in the unblinded site staff reference manual or study refer ence manual . Commercially available sterile normal saline will be used for dilution of study agent and will also serve as placebo for this study .

Discontinuation of Study Treatment Participants that permanently stop study treatment are encouraged to remain in the study . Participants have the right to discontinue study treatment before the end of the study . A participant may also be asked to discontinue study treatment at the Investigator’s discretion. Participants who withdraw from stud y treatment prematurel y (for an y reason) should, where possible, continue to be followed -up until the completion of the Safety Follow -up assessments: For participants who discontinue I P earl y, but have not withdrawn consent to participate in the stud y, an EW visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of blinded study treatment. These participants should continue in the study and complete all assessments at the remaining protocol -defined visits until their EW visit. Participants should continue regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator. The follow -up visi ts will then be performed 12 weeks after the EW visit for safety assessments. Participants who discontinue I P earl y and withdraw consent to participate in the study shou ld complete as many assessments planned for the EW visit as possible. If this is not possible, the I nvestigator must encourage the participant to participate in as much of the study as they are willing (or able) to. A participant may be withdrawn from st udy treatment at any time. A reason for premature discontinuation of study treatment (e.g., AE, protocol deviation, Investigator discretion, consent withdrawn etc.) must be captured in the eCRF. A participant must be withdrawn from study treatment if any of the following stopping criteria are met at an y time during the stud y: 1.Liver Chemistry : Meets any of the protocol -defined liver chemistry stopping criteria. 2.QT interval corrected for heart rate ( QTc): Meets any of the protocol - defined stopping criteria. 3.Pregnancy : Positive pregnancy test. 4.A clinically significant asthma exacerbation (requiring hospitalisation). 5.Abnormal Holter of Mobitz II AVB, complete AVB, sustained or non - sustained ventricular tachy cardia (VT), paroxy smal supraventricular tachycardia (P SVT), new onset atrial fibrillation/flutter will be a withdrawal/stopping criterion. These findings on ECG (baseline [V2] ,V3) or findings of m yocardial ischemia will also result in withdrawal/stopping. 6.Hypersensitivity or anaphy lactic reaction"
50,page_50,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 518.1.1. Liver Chemi stry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology . Discontinuation of study treatment for abnormal liver tests should be considered by the investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm or if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the participant. Phase II Liver Chemistry Stopping and Increased Monitoring Algorithm Liver Safet y Requi red Actions and Follow up Assessments Section can be found in Appendix 7 . 8.1.2. QTc Stopping Criteria The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett’s formula (QTcB), Fridericia’s formula (QTcF), an d/or another method, machine -read or manually over -read. The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the pa rticipant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB, then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s el igibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being"
51,page_51,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 52collected for data analysis . Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of t riplicate ECG s obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period. A participant who meets the bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from study treatment: QTc >500 msec OR Uncorrected QT >600 msec Chan ge from baseline of QTc >60 msec Note: The baseline is defined as visit 3 pre -dose. For participants with underly ing bundle branch block, follow the discontinuation criteria listed below: Baseline QTc with Bundle Branch Block <450 msec, Discontinuation Q Tc with Bundle Branch Block >500 msec Baseline QTc with Bundle Branch Block <450 -480 msec, Discontinuation QTc with Bundle Branch Block 530 msec. See the SoA (Section 2) for data to be collected at the time of EW visit and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.1.3. Rechallenge 8.1.3.1. Study Treatment Restart or Rechallenge Study treatment restart or rechallenge after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met by any participant in this study isnot allowed. Additionally , if h ypersensitivity or anaph ylactic reaction occurs, infusion should be discontinued and study restart is not allowed. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or ma y be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data co llected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Refer to the SoA (Section 2)for data to be collected at the time of early withdrawal (EW) and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed."

Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or sh e repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the particip ant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participan t is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equi valent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up."

STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 2). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the spo nsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA (Section 2), is essential and required for study conduct. The preferred order of assessments at each visit is: ACQ -5, AQLQ , medical review and vital signs, ECG, FeNO, spirometry , blood draws and treatment administration by infusion. The preferred post-dose order of assessments is: vital signs, ECG , andblood draws. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA (Section 2). 9.1. Efficacy Assessments The timings of all efficacy assessments are specified in the SoA (Section 2). 9.1.1. Blood Eosinophils Blood samples for haematology , specificall y for blood eosinophil cell count as an efficacy endpoint , will be taken at the specified time poin ts indicated in the SoA (Section 2). The differential cell counts will be blinded from V3 onwards. 9.1.2. Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) FeNO will be measured using a handheld electronic device. Measurements w ill be obtained in accordance with the American Thoracic Socity (ATS )/European Respiratory Society (ERS)Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline Measurement of Exhaled L ower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide Ame rican Thoracic Society ; European Respiratory Society [ATS/ERS , 2005] . All sites will use standardised equipment provided by a central vendor. For each observation, at least 2 measurements will be obtained to establish reproducibility (up to 8 measurements can be performed). FeNO measurements will be interpreted in accordance with the Official ATS Clinical Practice Guideline: Interpretation of Exhaled Nitric Oxide Levels (FeNO) for Clinical Applications [Dweik , 2011] . FeNO observations must be completed before FEV 1assessments."
54,page_54,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 55Participants should not use their rescue medication for at least 6 hours before each FeNO assessment, unless essential for clinical need. Participants shoul d also withhold L ABAs , ICSs and OCSs for 1 dosing interval (i.e. 12 or 24 hours based on the prescribed dosing interval of the product) before each FeNO assessment. Further details will be provided in the SRM and third part y vendor manual. 9.1.3. Questionnair es The questionnaires should be completed before any procedures are performed on the participant to avoid influencing the participant’s response. To avoid biasing responses, the participant should not be told the results of diagnostic tests prior to compl eting the questionnaires and it is recommended that the questionnaires be administered at the same time of day during each visit (as applicable). Adequate time must be allowed to complete all items on the questionnaires; the questionnaires must be review ed for completeness and, if necessary , the participant must be encouraged to complete an y missing assessments or items. Instructions for completing the questionnaires can be found in the SRM. 9.1.3.1. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -5) The ACQ -5 is a five -item qu estionnaire that is as a measure of a participant’s asthma control [Juniper , 2005 ]. The questions are self -completed by the participant, recalling over the previous 7 day s, and enquire about the frequency and/or se verity of sy mptoms (nocturnal awakening, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze). The response options for all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. The questions are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of the 5 questions and therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severel y uncontrolled). The ACQ -5 questionnaire shall be completed at the visits indicated in the SoA (Section 2). 9.1.3.2. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) The AQLQ is a disease -specific, self -administere d quality of life questionnaire recalling over the previous 14 days. I t was developed to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the quality of life of asthma sufferers [Juniper , 1993; Juniper , 2005 ]. The AQLQ contains 32 itemsin four domains: activity limitation (11 items), sy mptoms (12 items), emotional function (fi ve items), and environmental stimuli (four items). I n addition, the 32 items of the questionnaire are also averaged to produce one overall quality of life score. The response format consists of a seven -point scale where a value of 1 indicates ‘total impair ment’ and 7 indicates ‘no impairment’. The AQLQ questionnaire shall be completed at the visits indicated in the SoA (Section 2)."
55,page_55,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 569.1.4. Spirometry Spirometry assessments will be performed from screening through the f inal visit as indicated in the SoA (Section 2). The following parameters will be assessed: Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) Forced vital capacit y (FVC) At least three acceptable spirometry manoeuvr es (from a maximum of 8 attempts) should be achieved for each spirometry assessment, in accordance with ATS/ERS standards [Miller , 2005] . At each visit, spirometry assessments must be performed at the same time of day (1 hour) as the assessment performed at Baseline ( Visit 3). Participants should withhold use of short -acting bronchodilators for 6 hours and LABA s, ICSs and OCSs for 12 hours prior to each clinic visit, if possible. Participants who take medications that contain once dail y bronchodilators and once daily maintenance therap y medication should withhold use for 24 hours prior to each clinic visit. Further details will be provided in the SRM and third part y vendor manual. 9.2. Adverse Events The definitions o f an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 . The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for follow ing up AE sthat are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAE swill be collected from Visit 3 until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). At Visits 1 and 2 SAE information will be collected onl y for an y SAEs considered as related to study participation. All AE swill be collected from Visit 3 until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). Medical occurrences that begin before the sta rt of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF not the AE section. All SAE swill be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 4 . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she"
56,page_56,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 57considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 . 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurrence . 9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor h as a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safe ty reporting to the regulatory authority , Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulator y requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 4 andall deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific CV and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death."
57,page_57,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 58The CV eCRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA )terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 9.2.6. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until the follow -up visit . If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GS Kwithin 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and sho uld follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total doses described above which results in clinical signs and sy mptoms. These should be recorded by the Investigator on the AE/SAE eCRF pages . The dose of GSK3772847 considered to be an overdose has not been defined. There are no known antidotes and GSK does not recommend a specific treatment in the event of a suspected overdose. The Investigator will use clinical judgement in treating the sy mptoms of a suspected overdose. In the event of an overdose, the inv estigator should: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately . 2.Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities for 16 weeks after the last dose . 3.Obtain a serum sample for PK anal ysis within 7days from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case -by-case basis). 4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by theinvestigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 9.4. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 2)."

Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the Skin, Cardiovascular , Respiratory , Gastrointestinal and Neurological s ystems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded. Investigators should pa y special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs should be performed at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2) prior to conducting ECG and spirometry . Blood pressure (s ystolic and diastolic) , body temperature and pulse rate will be measured in the supine position after approximately 5 minutes rest. Body temperature will be collected in the participant’s source documents only for site use . A single set of values for blood pressure and pulse rate will be collected and recorded in the source documentation and eCRF. 9.4.3. Electrocardiograms All sites will use standardised ECG equipment provided by a centralised external vendor. A single 12 -lead ECG and rhy thm str ip will be recorded after measurement of vital signs and before other clinical tests such as blood draws and pulmonary function tests. Recordings will be made at the time -points defined in the SoA (Section 2). All ECG measurements will be made with the participant in a supine position having rested in this position for approximately 5 minutes before each reading. Participants should be reminded to avoid caffeine or caffeinated drinks for at least 8 hours before e ach 12 -lead ECG assessment. Also, decongestants are disallowed for at least 24 hours and antihistamines for at least 48 hours before each 12 -lead ECG assessment. For participants who meet the QTc, protocol defined stopping criteria, triplicate ECGs (over a brief period of time) should be performed (Section 8.1.2). The Investigator, a designated sub -Investigator or other appropriatel y trained site personnel will be responsible for performing each 12 -lead ECG. The Investigator must provide his/her dated signature on the original paper tracing, attesting to the authenticit y of the ECG machine interpretation. All ECGs will be electronically transmitted to an independent cardiologist and evaluated. The independent ca rdiologist, blinded to treatment assignment, will be responsible for providing measurements of heart rate, QT intervals and an interpretation of all ECGs collected in this study . A hard cop y of these results will be sent to the I nvestigator. The Investigat or must provide his/her dated signature on the confirmed report, attesting to his/her review of the independent cardiologist’s assessment. Details of the cardiac monitoring procedures will be provided b y the centrali sed cardiology service provider. 9.4.4. Contin uous ambulatory ECG (Holter) Continuous ECG monitoring (Holter) assessments have been added to the protocol to allow for a quantitative assessment of abnormal rhythm events. Holter monitors will be"

The device should be connected and electrodes attached to the participant as per the vendor’s instructions. 9.4.5. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Appendix 2for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA (Section 2) for the timing and frequency . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record an y clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the stud y in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than e xpected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or within 5days after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to n ormal or baseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified a nd the sponsor notified. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA (Section 2). If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the eCRF. 9.4.6. Diary assessments Participants will be issued with a diary card at visit 2 . Participants should complete their daily diary pages during the study duration to record the use of rescue ( SABA ) medication, AEs and concomitant medication usage. 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Whole blood samples of approximately 3 mL will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of GSK3772847as specified in the SoA (Section 2). The timing of PK samples may be altered and/or PK samples may be obtained at additional time points to ensure thorough PK monitoring. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded. Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of GSK3772847. Samples collected for analyses of serum concentration may also be used to evaluate safet y or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study . Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided in the SRM."

Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the SoA (Section 2). The timing of the collections may be adjusted on the basis of emerging PK or PD data from this study or other new information in order to ensure optimal evaluation of the biomarker endpoints. 9.7. Genetics Information regarding genetic/ pharmacogenetic ( PGx)research is included in Appendix 6. The I EC/IRB and, where required, the applicable regulatory agency must approve the PGx and genetic assessments before these can be conducted at the site. The approval(s) must be in writing and will clearl y specify approval of the PGx and genetic assessments (i.e., approval of Appendix 6). In some cases, approval of the PGx and genetic assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest of the study . If so, then the written approval will clearly indicate approval of the PGx and genetic assessments is being deferred and the study, except for PGx and genetic assessments, can be initiated. When PGx and genetic assessments will not be approved, then the approval for the rest of the study will clearl y indicate this and therefore, PGx and genetic assessments will not be conducted. 9.8. Biomarkers 9.8.1. Exploratory Biomarkers Blood (ser um) and induced sputum samples will be collected duri ng this study and may be used for the purposes of measuring asthma biomarkers or endot ypes of asthma, as well as response to GSK3772847. Biomarkers will include, but not be limited to, serum total IgE, fungal specific IgE ( Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicilliu m chrysogenum (notatum) )as well as sputum cell counts (e.g. percentage eosinophils) and sputum levels of IL -33, IL - 13, IL -4, IL -5 and TNF -. Samples may also be used to identify factors that may influence the development of asthma and/or medically related conditions. Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the SoA (Section 2).Details of the sputum collection and processing methodology will be provided in the SRM. Participants should not use t heir rescue medication for at least 6 hours before each sputum sampling visit , unless essential for clinical need.

STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS The prim ary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of treatment with GSK3772847 compared with placebo on blood eosinophils and FeNO levels in moderate to severe asthmatic participants with AFAD currently on SoC. There are no formal hypothesis tests a ssociated with this objective and no formal significance tests. The information acquired from this study will be used to quantify the effects that GSK3772847 has on the selected efficacy endpoints, as measured b y change in the co - primary endpoints; change from baseline in blood eosinophils and change from baseline in FeNO over time. 10.1. Sample Size Determination To account for a 10% withdrawal rate, approximately 46 participants will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to active arm or placebo arm, to ensure approximate ly 40 will be evaluable in total. The sample size is based on feasibility and no formal sample size calculation has been performed. As described below, change from baseline in blood eosinophils and change from baseline in FeNO will be log -transformed. Estimates of the variability for the ratio to baseline in blood eosinophils and the ratio to baseline in FeNO were obtained from [Anderson , 2012] and from studies in Mepolizumab in participants with severe asthma. The half widths of the 95% confidence interval of the point estimate of the treatment ratio of active to placebo for the ratio to baseline in blood eosinophils and FeNO have been calculated and are display ed in Table 4and Table 5."

64,page_64,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 65To evaluate stud y success criter ia, data from a bivariate normal distribution will be simulated under different treatment effect assumptions for different sample sizes. The samples from the posterior probability distribution from the MCMC approximation will be divided into different regi ons exploring different treatment cut -off values. Further, the multivariate case will also be explored involving AQLQ or ACQ -5. The prior for the treatment difference for FeNO and eosinophils waselicited at a prior elicitation exercise with internal exper ts at GSK. This prior for the treatment difference includes the experts’ uncertaint y about the size of the mean treatment effect. 10.2. Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description Enrolled All participants who sign the ICF RandomisedAll participants who were randomi sed. A participant who is recorded as a screen or run -in failure and also randomised will be considered to be randomis ed in error provided they have not performed any study assess ments. Modified Intent -to-treatAll randomis ed participants who take at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants will be analysed according to the treatment they actually received SafetyThis population will be the same as the Modified Intent -to-treat population. PKAll randomis ed participants who received at least one dose of study medication, and for whom at least one pharmacokinetic sample was obtained, analysed and was measurable."

Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary The co -primary endpoints are blood eosinophils and FeNO. Blood eosinophils and FeNO will be log -transformed prior to analysis. Change from baseline in log transformed blood eosinophils will be analysed using a mixed model repeated measures analysis (MMRM) , where baseline is defined as Week 0 . The model will include fixed effects of treatment group, which strata the participant was in (i.e. whether the participa nt was taking antifungals or not), log -transformed baseline blood eosinophils, time as a categorical variable and a treatment by time interaction . Participant will be fitted as a random effect, and time as a repeated effect. A similar analysis will be don e for change from baseline in log -transformed FeNO, except log - transformed baseline FeNO will be used (rather than log -transformed baseline blood eosinophils). The estimated treatment ratios together with 95% CIs (back -transformed from the differences on the log -scale) will be presented at the end of weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 for each of FeNO and blood eosinophils. To calculate the probability of success, accounting for the correlation between endpoints, the joint posterior probability that the true ratios fo r both endpoints simultaneously lie to the left hand side of unity will be estimated. This will be obtained at week 12. Secondary Change from baseline in ACQ -5 absolute score and AQLQ at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 will be separately analysed using a MMRM for each endpoint , where baseline is defined as Week 0 . The model for ACQ -5 will include fixed effects of treatment group, which strata the participant was in (i.e. whether the participant was taking antifungals or not), baseline ACQ -5, time as a categorical va riable and a treatment by time interaction. Participant will be fitted as a random effect and time as a repeated effect. A similar analysis will be done for Change from baseline in AQLQ total and domain scores at Weeks 4, 8 and 12, except baseline AQLQ (to tal or domain score) will be used instead of ACQ -5. The estimated treatment differences together with the 95% CIs will be presented at the end of weeks 4, 8 and 12 for each of ACQ -5 and AQLQ. Change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator FEV1 will be listed and summarised. Analyses of responders to ACQ -5 and AQLQ will be described in the Reporting Analysis Plan ( RAP). Further analysis on the secondary endpoints will be described in the RAP. Exploratory Will be described in the reporting and analysis pla n"

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (h aematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underly ing disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of th e condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or t he clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses shou ld be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinica l sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments w hich are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of"
81,page_81,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 82the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur ( social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met ( e.g., hospitali sation for signs/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation In general, hospitalisation signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergenc y ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalisation are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfils any other serious cr iteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “ hospitalisation ” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not consider ed an AE. d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significanc e such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea , influenza, and accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birt h defect"
82,page_82,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 83f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospital isation but may jeopardi se the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or m alignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitali sation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording  When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF. It is notacceptable for the investigat or to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/SAE eCRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are"
83,page_83,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 84requested b y GSK . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK . The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. W henever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the fo llowing categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilised for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is de fined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality  The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment an d each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical jud gment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product I nformation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of cau sality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK . However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event be fore the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK ."

Follow -up of AE and SAE  The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies durin g participation in the study or during a recogni sed follow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. The inve stigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool  The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours ,then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section ). The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. The i nvestigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the relationship of each SAE to I P/study participation (causalit y) within 72 hours of SAE entry into the eCRF. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receiv es updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to the SAE coordinator b y telephone. Contacts for SAE report ing can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page ."
85,page_85,"2017N331706_03 CONFIDENTIA L 207972 86SAE Reporting to GSK via Paper CRF  Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the SAE co ordinator . In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace t he need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. Contacts for SAE reporting can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page.."

A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) le vel in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Females on HRT and whose menopaus al status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before stu dy enrolment .

The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.) NOTES: a. Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contracep tive methods for participants inclinical studies. b.

Participants with severe asthma for whom it is felt oral corticosteroids are warranted are not elig ible for this study. Section 6.2 Table 2; Section 7.7.1Updated Section 7.7.1 to support the use of anti -fungal medication. Removed anti - fungal medication from the list of prohibited medications in Table 2. The study is being stratified on the use of a nti-fungal medication and therefore treatment with anti -fungal medication is permitted during the treatment period if used in a consistent dosage and frequency from screening and throughout the treatment period. Section 3.1 Study Rationale Clarified that the study population may include participants who have asthma with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The target population for this study is moderate to severe asthmatics who have allergic fungal airway disease (AFAD). AFAD is determined by positive IgE sensitisation to thermotolerant filamentous fungi particularly Aspergillus fumigatus. Therefore, this definition would include participants who have asthma and ABPA as ABPA is loosely defined by the following features: eosinophilia, fleeting lung shadows, high total IgE, and raised A fumigatus – specific IgE.
