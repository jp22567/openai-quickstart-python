SYNOPSIS TITLE: An Open Label Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of PRX -102 in Patients with Fabry Disease Currently Treated with REPLAGAL® (Agalsidase alfa) INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT: Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX -102), a chemically modified human alpha galactosidase- A INDICATION: PRX -102 is indicated for long -term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (alpha galactosidase deficiency) PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT: 3 INVESTIGATIONAL SITES/LOCATIONS: Multicenter OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRX -102 in patients with Fabry disease currently treated with agalsidase alfa STUDY DESIGN: This is an open label switch over study to assess the safety and efficacy of PRX -102. Patients treated with agalsidase alfa for at least 2 years and on a stable dose (>80% labelled dose/kg) for at least 6 months. Patients will be screened and evaluated over 3 months while continuing on agalsidase alfa. Following the screening period, the patient will be enrolled and switched from their agalsidase alfa treatment to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of PRX -102 1 mg/kg every two weeks for 12 months. No more than 25% of treated patients will be female. At the time of enrolment, premedication, if used for the agalsidase alfa infusions before enrolment, will be continued through the first infusion with PRX -102 and then will be gradually tapered at the investigator’s discretion during the first 2 months. The first infusions of PRX -102 will be administered under controlled conditions at the investigation site. The patient can receive their PRX -102 infusions at a home care setup once the investigator and Sponsor Medical Director agree that it is safe to do so. NUMBER OF SUBJECTS (PLANNED): 22 DIAGNOSIS AND MAIN CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION: Inclusion criteria: Eligible patients must fulfill the following inclusion criteria: 1. Age: 18-60 years 2.

INTRODUCTION Fabry disease is a progressive lysosomal storage disease that is seriously debilitating and ultimately life-threatening. It is caused by X-linked deficiency of the enzyme alpha galactosidase- A (alpha -GAL -A), and affects both males and females. The disease is characterized by subnormal or absent activity of alpha -GAL -A. Clinical onset of the disease typically occurs during childhood or adolescence (Schaefer et al. 2009) and will progress to end- stage renal disease, cardiac complications and cerebrovascular problems in the fourth or fifth decade of life (Wilcox et al. 2008). Although Fabry disease is a X-linked disorder, females are also affected and develop manifestations of the disease due to lack of cross -correction between cells with normal alpha -GAL -A activity (mutated X chromosome is inactivated) and cells with enzyme deficiency (non-mutated X chromosome is inactivated). The clinical abnormalities in females are more variable, and of later onset compared to males (Schiffmann 2009a). Fabry disease is regarded as a rare disease and it is estimated that 1 in 40,000 males has the disease, whereas the estimated prevalence in the general population is 1 in 117,000 (Meikle et al. 1999). Alpha -GAL -A is a lysosomal enzyme which primarily catalyses the hydrolysis of the glycolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) to galactose and lactosylceramide. Fabry disease is characterized by massive storage of Gb3, predominantly in cells of the vascular system, cardiomyocytes, neuronal cells and kidney podocytes. Progressive accumulation of Gb3, and related lipids, leads to impaired tissue and organ function. The ultimate consequence of glycolipid deposition in the vasculature and other tissues is end-organ failure, particularly the kidney, but also heart and cerebrovascular system (Schiffmann 2009a). In addition, involvement of the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems result in episodes of pain and impaired peripheral sensat ion. Vascular changes in the skin also result in angiokeratomas (Hoffmann et al. 2009). The mechanism by which alpha -GAL -A deficiency and glycolipid accumulation cause such a wide variety of complications is not well understood. Based on the pathology of Fabry disease, the ongoing accumulation of alpha -D-galactosyl moieties, particularly of Gb3, appears to be a chronic toxicity state (Schiffmann 2009a). A recent study by Aerts et al. reported that globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3), a Gb3 metabolite, is dramatically increased in the plasma of male Fabry patients, and plasma and tissues of Fabry mice, and may have an important role in the pathogenesis of Fabry disease (Aerts et al. 2008). Increased levels of lysoGb3 occur also in symptomatic Fabry females (Van Breemen et al. 2011). As Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder, the prevalence of the mutation is predicted to be two times higher in women than in men. There is considerable variation in phenotype in heterozygous females. However, despite the X-linked nature of the disease, heterozygous and therefore tissue -mosaic females can be as severely affected by Fabry disease as hemizygous males, experiencing progressive, multi- organ involvement, reduced quality of life and reduced life expectancy. Case- finding studies have reported mutations that are known to be associated with Fabry disease in 0.3–2.4% of women who had unexplained stroke, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or renal failure requiring haemodialysis. A recent study by Hughes et al, that compared men and women with Fabry disease, using data from FOS—the Fabry Outcome Survey, showed no significant differences between men and women for most clinical features"
12,page_12,"13 of 63 Protocol Number PB-102-F30 Version 3.0 EudraCT 2016 -01318 -11 Protalix Ltd. 06 Jun 2017 evaluated. Overall, both sexes responded to enzyme replacement treatment in a similar way (Hughes et al. 2011). Most men and some women with Fabry disease exhibit deterioration of renal function (Schiffmann et al., 2009b; Wanner et al., 2010; Ortiz et al., 2008), and many eventually develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Ortiz et al., 2010; Mignani et al., 2010). Although progression to ESRD is much less common in women, the median age at which patients reached ESRD (38 years) was the same in both genders (Ortiz et al., 2010; Mignani et al., 2010). Studies of untreated patients with Fabry disease have identified proteinuria as a major risk factor for renal disease progression (Schiffmann et al., 2009b; Wanner et al., 2010). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), by exogenous administration of purified recombinant enzyme, is nowadays among the most successfully employed drug treatments for lysosomal storage disorders. The first disorder for which this treatment modality has proven to be effective is type 1 Gaucher disease (Barton et al. 1991; Hollak et al. 1995). This success has paved the way for the development of ERT for other lysosomal storage disorders, including Fabry disease. Recombinant human alpha -GAL -A has the ability to restore enzyme function in patients, and currently two ERTs using this enzyme are commercially available; agalsidase alpha (Replagal), that was approved in Europe, and agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme), that was approved both in Europe and in the United States. Both recombinant enzymes are comparable in their properties and differ only slightly in glycan composition (Blom et al. 2003). They are produced using different protein expression systems and are administered at different doses. Fabrazyme is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and is administered by IV infusion every 2 weeks at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Replagal is produced in a human cell line (stably expressed in human foreskin fibroblast) (Schiffmann et al. 2000), and is administrated by IV infusion every 2 weeks at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Both products have shown their efficacy in clinical studies with regard to clearance of Gb3 from plasma, kidney cells (such as capillary endothelial cells, glomerular endothelial cells, noncapillary endothelial cells and noncapillary smooth muscle cells), and capillary endothelial cells of the cardiac and skin (Eng & Guffon et al. 2001; Germain et al. 2007; Schaefer et al. 2009). In addition, ERT with both products leads to improvement in quality of life, reduction or stabilization of cardiac mass, preservation of renal function, and slowing down the decline of glomerular function (Wilcox et al. 2004; Schiffmann et al. 2006; Germain et al. 2007; Schiffmann 2009b). Although these findings are encouraging, the clinical effects of the current treatment of Fabry patients are not as robust as anticipated and show only limited clinical improvement (Schaefer et al. 2009; Lidove et al. 2010; El Dib et al. 2011). In clinical studies, agalsidase beta provided long-term stabilization of renal function in patients with mild renal involvement (serum creatinine <2.2 mg/dL) (Germain et al., 2007) and delayed time to renal, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with more advanced Fabry disease (Banikazemi et al., 2007). Agalsidase beta treatment did not stabilize renal function in patients with severe renal involvement (i.e., proteinuria > 1 g/24 h or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m2) at the time treatment was started (Germain et al., 2007: Banikazemi et al., 2007). Schiffmann (2007) showed that increasing the frequency of dosing with agalsidase alfa from every other week to weekly in a subgroup of patients with Fabry disease whose eGFR continued to decline at rapid rate while being treated every other week significantly slowed the rate of decline in eGFR. Nine (82%) of 11 patients demonstrated"
13,page_13,"14 of 63 Protocol Number PB-102-F30 Version 3.0 EudraCT 2016 -01318 -11 Protalix Ltd. 06 Jun 2017 either a positive eGFR slope (n = 3, 27%) or a slowing in their rate of decline (i.e., less negative eGFR slope; n = 6, 55%) after switching to weekly administration of agalsidase alfa. One of the major factors responsible for the limited efficacy of current treatment is the presence of irreversible organ damage. Another factor that may contribute to this is the characteristics of the current ERTs (such as short circulatory half-life and dose regimens) which seem to be insufficient in preventing the chronic toxic effect of Gb3. One way to improve enzyme bioavailability maybe to extend circulation residence and tissue half-life. A third factor, which may influence the treatment outcome, is the induction of antibodies towards the recombinant proteins (Hollak et al. 2009). Emergence of antibodies with in vivo neutralizing capacities is frequently encountered in treated Fabry disease patients, resulting in inhibition of enzyme activity and adversely affecting Gb3 clearance (Hollak et al. 2009). In early clinical studies, 25 to 88% (Schiffmann et al. 2006; Eng & Banikazemi et al. 2001; Eng & Guffon et al. 2001) of male patients developed these IgG antibodies within the first 6 months of treatment. Regarding treatment outcome, it was shown that antibodies against alpha -GAL -A interfere with the clearance of Gb3 from plasma, urine (Linthorst et al. 2004; Vedder et al. 2008), and from the tissue (Benichou et al. 2009). The cross -reactivity of alpha -GAL -A antibodies suggests that it is unlikely that switching from one recombinant protein to the other may prevent the immune response and related effects (Linthorst et al. 2004; Hollak et al. 2009). Currently, administration of a higher dose of the recombinant enzyme is an effective way to overcome the negative effect of the neutralizing antibodies by providing excess enzyme (Vedder et al. 2008; Hollak et al. 2009). However, this approach is not considered a long-term solution. Protalix has developed PRX -102, a chemically modified recombinant human alpha -GAL -A expressed in plant cell culture. As a result of this modification, PRX -102 exhibits more stabilized homo dimer with active enzyme over longer period, extended circulation residence time and enhanced bioavailability of the enzyme relative to the commercial drug. Therefore, PRX -102 provides continuous presence of enzyme over the 2 week dosing interval. Studies have shown that human alpha -GAL -A is a non-covalently bound homodimeric glycoprotein (Garman et al. 2004) and that the dimerization is important for the enzymatic activity and stability of the enzyme (Bishop et al. 1988). The chemical modification of PRX -102 utilises the reagent bis-NHS -PEG and renders PEGylated protein subunits the majority of which are crosslinked into homodimers thus, reinforce the homodimeric structure, which is crucial for the enzymatic activity of this enzyme. In addition, the PEGylation modification may have an additive value through increasing drug retention time in blood and bioavailability (Veronese et al. 2005; Veronese et al. 2008). Preliminary non-clinical data shows that this modification improves PRX -102 stability in vitro under lysosomal and plasma conditions, and extends circulation residence and bioavailability in vivo, probably due to stabilization of its quaternary structure. Therefore, the modifications in PRX -102 have the potential to improve the efficacy of ERT. PRX -102 has been studied in Fabry disease patients in a Phase 1/2 study PB-102-F01 for 12 weeks and continued in extension studies for long-term treatment. The extension studies are ongoing. The results of the study are summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure. At the time of database freeze on 31Jul2015, six (6) patients in the 0.2 mg/kg treatment group completed 12"

The interim efficacy analysis results demonstrated that all patients exhibited stable cardiac and renal function with favorable trends after receiving six months of PRX -102. Gb3 inclusions in kidney peritubular capillaries were substantially reduced after 6 months of treatment with both 0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg doses. A mean reduction was observed in the total score of the Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) for the severity of Fabry disease in general, neurological, cardiovascular and renal systems; a stable or favorable trend was observed in the severity and frequency of abdominal pain, and frequency of diarrhea in Gastrointestinal Symptoms Assessment (GSA); and the reduction in pain severity score and pain interference score with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scale indicates an improvement in general activity, walking, working, sleeping, enjoyment of life and other people. PRX -102 has enhanced pharmacokinetic properties including a half-life (T½) of approximately 70 hours, and AUC of approximately 400,000 ng/mL*hour for the 1.0 mg/kg dose after one day of treatment (Day 1), which are believed to be the result of the covalent cross -linking to make PRX -102 enzyme a more stable homo- dimer. This extended exposure of the target organs to enzyme may be important for improving efficacy similar to what Schiffmann et al., (2007) showed with weekly compared to every other week agalsidase alfa. The most commonly experienced AEs in PRX -102 were fatigue in 6 patients, and nausea and vomiting each in 5 patients. The most commonly experienced AEs that were considered possibly related to the treatment were nausea in 3 patients, chest discomfort and fatigue each in 2 patients. Two patients each experienced an SAE. One patient experienced a Grade 3 hypersensitivity related serious adverse event of bronchospasm. The second patient experienced renal hematoma following kidney biopsy and was not considered related to the treatment. Currently, the safety results of the one completed and two ongoing studies showed that PRX -102 is well tolerated with a favorable safety profile, the majority of adverse events being mild and moderate in severity and a low rate of treatment induced antibody formation. In view of the data it is concluded that dosing of PRX -102 at 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks offers an appropriate treatment regimen for attenuating disease progression. 5. STUDY OBJECTIVES 5.1 Primary Objective The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of PRX -102 in patients with Fabry disease currently treated with agalsidase alfa."

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan – Description This is an open label switch over study to assess the safety and efficacy of PRX -102. Patients treated with agalsidase alfa for at least 2 years and on a stable dose (>80% labelled dose/kg/) for at least 6 months. Patients will enter the study for 3 month Screening period for baseline data generation. Eligible patients will be switched from their agalsidase alfa treatment to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of PRX -102 1 mg/kg every two weeks for 12 months. No more than 25% of treated patients will be female. At the time of enrolment, premedication, if used for the agalsidase alfa infusions before study entry, will be continued during the Screening period and to the first infusion with PRX -102 treatment and then gradually tapered at the investigator’s discretion during the first 2 months. The first infusions of PRX -102 will be administered under controlled conditions at the investigation site. The patient can receive their PRX -102 infusions at a home care setup once the investigator and Sponsor Medical Director agree that it is safe to do so. 6.2 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Group(s) This is a Phase 3, open- label, switchover study to assess the safety and efficacy of PRX -102 (pegunigalsidase alfa) in patients with Fabry disease who have been treated with agalsidase alfa (Replagal®) ERT. The dose of pegunigalsidase alfa is 1 mg/kg and switching from agalsidase alfa is an appropriate study design in this rare disease population. PRX -102 and agalsidase alfa are different products and immunogenicity and hypersensitivity may be different between the products. Premedication to prevent adverse reactions during infusion is administered in some patients receiving agalsidase alfa. Because the requirements for premedication may be different between the two products, premedication will be tapered off, as tolerated, over the initial 2 months of infusions under careful observation after switching to PRX -102. Premedication to prevent infusion reactions can be maintained or re-introduced as required. 6.3 Selection of Study Population 6.3.1 Inclusion Criteria The subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria: 1. Age: 18-60 years 2. A documented diagnosis of Fabry disease"

The drug will not be used without Protalix’s approval in writing. The pharmacist investigational drug accountability record includes the identification of the person to whom the drug is dispensed, the quantity and the date of dispensing and any returned or unused drug, as well as full record of CTM storage temperature. This record is in addition to any drug accountability information recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF). These records will be readily available for inspection by a monitor and/or Protalix audits and are open to regulatory authority inspection at any time. The investigator is responsible for maintaining accountability for the receipt, dispensing, and return of all study medication. 7.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy Medications having the potential to interfere with the evaluation of efficacy are excluded throughout the trial. The following medications are strictly prohibited during the study treatment period: • Fabrazyme® (agalsidase -beta) • Replagal ® (agalsidase alfa) • Any other investigational or approved drug for treating Fabry disease The use of premedication to prevent infusion reactions associated with agalsidase alfa initiated before entry to the study and recorded in the eCRF will be continued, but subjects will be titrated down over the course of the two months after switching to PRX -102 The rate of down titration/removal of the premed ication will be at the investigator’s discretion and recurrence of infusion reactions. Re-institution of premedication to manage infusion reactions will be allowed (see also Appendix 3 and 8). Angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) at a stable dose for 4 weeks prior to entry into the study are allowed, but once a subject is randomized in the study, initiation of ACEI or ARB therapy is prohibited unless the subject develops proteinuria and the Protalix Medical Director approves. ACEI or ARB therapy may not be initiated for the treatment of hypertension in the absence of proteinuria."

EFFICACY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 8.1 Safety Variable(s) • Safety will be assessed by the frequency, severity, and duration of treatment -emergent AEs (see Section 8.3, Adverse Events), including clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, ECG changes from baseline, physical examination findings and assessment of the injection site after administration of the study drug • Anti-Drug (i.e., PRX -102) IgG antibodies will be assessed before dosing with PRX -102 at baseline (Visit 1). Anti-PRX IgG antibodies will be assessed every month for the first 6 months and every 3 month until the end of study through the last infusion. If a patient continues treatment in an extension study, the anti-drug antibodies will be assessed as part of that study. For patients who end treatment with PRX -102, anti-PRX -102 antibodies will be assessed 1 and 3 months after last infusion • Anti-Drug IgE antibodies will be assessed in events of hypersensitivity reaction following Sponsor request • Ability to taper off infusion premedication at the start of the study • Requirement for use of premedication overall to manage infusion reactions 8.1.1 Clinical Laboratory • Hematology: total white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. • Coagulation profile: prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) • Biochemistry: sodium, potassium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, Cystatin c, calcium, phosphate (inorganic), uric acid, total protein, albumin, bilirubin (total), alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma -glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase • Vitamin D • Urinalysis: dipstick for presence of blood, glucose, ketones, and protein 8.2 Efficacy Variables • Mean annualised change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR CKD -EPI) (See Appendix 6) • Left Ventricular Mass Index (g/m2) preferably by MRI (echocardiogram can be used as an alternative) (See Appendix 4) • Plasma Lyso -Gb3 • Plasma Gb3 • Urine Lyso -Gb3 • Protein/Creatinine ratio spot urine test • Frequency of pain medication use • Exercise tolerance (Stress Test) • Short Form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (See Appendix 7) • Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) (See Appendix 5)"

An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not considered related to the study medication. AEs will be collected from the start of treatment until 30 days following the final visit dose. Any events occurring prior to treatment will be recorded on the medical history page with the event name and onset date and end date if not continuing. Pre-existing, known clinically significant conditions observed at screening should be recorded as medical history. This definition also includes accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or dose) other than planned titration, reasons for admission to a hospital, or reasons for surgical procedures (unless for minor elective surgery for a pre-existing condition). It also includes adverse events commonly observed and adverse events anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the study medication. Any laboratory abnormality assessed as clinically significant by the Investigator must be recorded as an adverse event. A treatment emergent adverse event is any adverse event occurring after start of study medication and within the time of residual drug effect, or a pre-treatment adverse event or pre- existing medical condition that worsens in intensity after start of study medication and within the time of residual drug effect . Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate sign(s) and symptom(s) are recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record. Note that death is not an event, but the cause of death is. An exception is the event of sudden death of unknown cause. Note that hospitalization is not an event; however, the reason for hospitalization is. Procedures are not events; the reasons for conducting the procedures are. In general, only the reason for conducting the procedure will be captured as an adverse event. However, if deemed necessary by the Investigator, a procedure can be captured along with the reason for conducting the procedure. An overdose or medication error is not an adverse event unless it is temporally associated with an unfavourable or unintended sign or symptom. Each AE is to be classified by the investigator as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that occurs at any dose: • Results in death • Is life-threatening (i.e., an immediate risk of death)"
22,page_22,"23 of 63 Protocol Number PB-102-F30 Version 3.0 EudraCT 2016 -01318 -11 Protalix Ltd. 06 Jun 2017 • Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is associated with a congeni tal anomaly/birth defect • Is an important medical event An adverse event caused by an overdose or medication error is considered serious if a criterion listed in the definition above is fulfilled. Important adverse events that may not result in death, may not be life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject’s safety or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Serious adverse events also include any other event that the investigator or sponsor judges to be serious or which is defined as serious by the regulatory agency. The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events spontaneously reported by the trial subject using concise medical terminology. In addition, each trial subject will be questioned about adverse events. The question asked will be “Since you began taking the study medication, have you had any health problems?” 8.3.2 Procedures for Assessing, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Throughout the duration of the study, the Investigator will closely monitor each subject for evidence of drug intolerance and for the development of clinical or laboratory evidence of adverse events. All adverse events (expected or unexpected) which occur during the course of the study, whether observed by the Investigator or by the subject, and whether or not thought to be drug -related, will be reported and followed until resolution or until they become stable. The description of the adverse event will include description of event, start date, stop date, intensity, if it was serious, relationship to test drug, change in test drug dosage, if the subject died, and if treatment was required. Events will be coded to one of the following intensity categories below: Severity Definition Mild Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity Moderate Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing) Severe Event causes inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable)"
23,page_23,"24 of 63 Protocol Number PB-102-F30 Version 3.0 EudraCT 2016 -01318 -11 Protalix Ltd. 06 Jun 2017 Events will be coded into one of the following causality categories as defined below: Category Definition Unrelated Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes, and does not meet criteria listed under possible or probable. Unlikely Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration. May have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by environmental factors or other therapies administered. Possible Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration, but may have been also produced by the subject’s clinical state, environmental factors or other therapies administered. Probable Clear -cut temporal association with administration with improvement on cessation of investigational medicinal product or reduction in dose. Reappears upon rechallenge. Follows a known pattern of response to the investigational medicinal product. Adverse events with the causality assessed as unrelated or unlikely are categorized as not related to study medication. Adverse events with the causality assessed as possible or probable are categorized as related to study medication and are called adverse drug reactions. All SAEs must be reported immediately (no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) by entering the information about the event in the eCRF forms. The Sponsor’s Medical Director and Safety Monitor will be notified of the event by the eCRF system. In the case that the eCRF system is not available, the Investigator must contact Medical Director (972- 54-2228472) or Safety Monitor (1-212-681-2100) to notify the Sponsor of the event. 8.3.3 Acute Kidney Injury Episodes of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) will be considered adverse events. AKI will be defined by a 1.5 fold or greater increase in serum creatinine from the immediately previous laboratory value and assessment by the investigator. The Protalix Medical Director will work with the investigator to ensure that such changes in renal function are thoroughly evaluated."

STATISTICAL METHODS PLANNED AND SAMPLE SIZE 10.1 Determination of Sample Size The sample size of 22 patients is adequate to evaluate the safety of switching from agalsidase alfa to PRX -102 in this orphan disease in which patient recruitment in clinical trials is difficult. 10.2 Subject Populations The safety population will be all subjects receiving at least one partial dose of PRX -102. The efficacy population will be all subjects with at least one endpoint evaluation after the first PRX - 102 infusion. 10.3 Subject Disposition The number and percentage of subjects who were enrolled, treated, completed, and withdrawn, as well as the reason(s) for withdrawal will be summarized. 10.4 Safety Analysis Safety will be assessed by evaluation of adverse events and clinical laboratory results. 10.4.1 Adverse Events Adverse events will be coded to system organ class and preferred term using MedDRA version 15.0 or higher. All adverse events occurring after the initiation of the study treatment (treatment emergent adverse events) will be reported, including events present at baseline that worsened during the study. Adverse events will be summarized with respect to incidence of adverse events (the number of subjects reporting at least one episode of a specific adverse event), incidence of adverse events by severity within body system, incidence of adverse events by attribution within body system, and incidence of adverse events causing withdrawal and incidence of serious adverse events. Regarding severity and attribution summaries, the most extreme outcome (highest severity and closest to study drug related) will be used for those subjects who experience the same adverse event on more than one occasion. Written narratives will be provided for all serious, unexpected or other significant adverse events that are judged to be of special interest because of their clinical importance. 10.4.2 Clinical Laboratory Summary statistics of all central and local laboratory test results (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) will be presented for each visit. The change from baseline (Visit 1) to each post- treatment visit will also be presented."

QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 11.1 Source Data and Records Source data are all the information in original records and certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observations, laboratory reports, data sheets provided by the sponsor or other activities in the study, which are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), IRB review(s) and regulatory inspection(s), with direct access to all the required source records. All study records will be retained for a period of time as defined by the regulatory authority for the country in which the investigation is conducted. Generally, this means at least 2 years following the date on which the drug is approved by the regulatory authority for marketing for the purposes that were the subject of the investigation. In other situations (e.g., where the investigation is not in support of or as part of an application for a research or marketing permit), a period of 2 years following the date on which the entire clinical program is completed, terminated or discontinued or the investigational application under which the investigation is being conducted is terminated or withdrawn by the regulatory authorities. In the event the Investigator retires, relocates or for any other reason withdraws from the responsibility for maintaining records for the period of time required, custody of the records may be transferred to any other person who will accept responsibility for the records. Notice of such a transfer must be given in writing to the Sponsor. The Investigator must contact the Sponsor prior to disposal of any records related to this study. 11.2 Reporting of Results The Case Report Form (CRF) is an integral part of the study and subsequent reports. The CRF must be used to capture all study data recorded in the patient’s medical record. The CRF must be kept current to reflect patient status during the course of the study. Only a patient screening and randomization number and patient initials will be used to identify the patient. The monitor is responsible for performing on-site monitoring at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; verify adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research; and ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data entered in the CRF. SPONSOR or CRO will monitor completed Case Report Forms (CRFs). A case report form will be provided for each screened patient. All protocol -required information collected during the study must be entered by the Investigator, or designated representative, in the Target e*CRF , an Internet -based electronic data collection system. All details of the CRF completion and correction will be explained to the investigator."

All modifications to the data in the eCRF are tracked by an electronic audit trail (date and identity of the person making the change are instantaneously recorded). Target e*CRF  is 21CFR Part 11 compliant. If the Investigator authorizes other persons to make entries in the CRF, the names, positions, and signatures of these persons must be supplied to the sponsor. The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure. Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the final examination. By design, an explanation must be provided for all missing data, altered data, and/or out of range data. The completed case report form must be reviewed and signed by the Investigator named in the study protocol or by a designated sub investigator. Final monitored and audited eCRFs will be provided by the Sponsor to the sites at the end of the study in the format of a PDF file. 11.3 Confidentiality of Subject Data The investigator will ensure that the confidentiality of the subjects' data will be preserved. In the CRF or any other documents submitted to the sponsor, the subjects will not be identified by their names, but by an identification system, which consists of their initials and number in the study. The investigator will maintain documents not meant for submission to the sponsor, e.g., the confidential subject identification code and the signed informed consent forms, in strict confidence."

Subjects presenting symptoms and signs of severe hypersensitivity will be evaluated according to the CTCAE Drug Toxicity criteria and there may be a discontinuation of treatment according to the protocol. 3. Subjects may present signs and symptoms that will respond to reducing the infusion rate and may not appear at the next infusion. 4. Tolerability and the subject specific infusion rate will be assessed and decided by the Investigator according to vital signs and clinical status of the subject. Definitions to be applied regarding tolerability of infusions are as follows: Good tolerability Partial tolerability Poor tolerability Infusion was performed without signs and symptoms (such as burning, pruritus, flushing, discomfort, or change in vital signs). Signs and symptoms appeared during the infusion and resolved after slowing infusion rate or at the end of the infusion. Signs and symptoms meeting the definitions of CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 toxicity responding to reduction of infusion rate or responding to treatment (example, antihistamine for urticaria).

A set of ECG gated cine and delayed contrast enhanced MRI sequences (SSFP resp. Inversion recovery Gradient echo) will be acquired. A Gadolinium based contrast agent will be used during image acquisition of the delayed contrast enhanced scan. The sequences will be defined based on the equipment and ability to provide sufficient image quality and contrast for myocardium and fibrosis detection and quantification in Fabry’s disease patients. 14.4.3 MRI evaluation parameters The following MRI parameters will be evaluated during this trial: • Number and location of left ventricular segments with fibrosis • Percentage and mass of cardiac fibrosis (in grams) • Left ventricular myocardial mass (in grams) 14.4.4 Sites and image data management All image management activities will be centralized and conducted by an independent imaging Contract Research Organization (imaging CRO) with operational capabilities in Europe and the United States in compliance with all regulatory requirements. An overview of the main activities performed by the imaging CRO is provided in the next sections. 14.4.4.1 Standardization of image acquisition, initial site qualification The image acquisition procedure will be standardized by the imaging CRO among all participating sites. The same image acquisition and management procedure will be used by all sites. This procedure will be defined by the imaging CRO and approved by the Sponsor. The sites will be trained and qualified by the imaging CRO prior to start of patient enrolment. Each site will provide test MRI scan(s) during the initial site qualification phase. The source of the test scan(s) will be (in order of preference) a patient volunteer, a healthy volunteer, or the screening image from the first patient tested at the site. No contrast agent will be used for the test scans except when the first image from the first patient is used. All images will be anonymized by the sites (in order to remove any patient -related nominative information) and provided in digital format (DICOM). Only digital images will be centrally processed by the imaging CRO. 14.4.4.2 Subject Sedation Subjects may require sedation in order to obtain the high quality images required. Sites may use standard sedation protocols approved by the institution."

If any quality -related issue is detected by the imaging CRO, specific queries will be sent to the sites to implement appropriate corrective (including potential repeat scans if needed) and preventive actions. 14.4.5 Image processing and centralized analysis 14.4.5.1 Cardiac MRI assessment Analysis of the cine short -axis and delayed contrast enhanced images of the left ventricle will be performed with dedicated MRI quantification software. Myocardial contours will be detected semi -automatically and manually edited and quality controlled by an expert technician at the imaging CRO. The left ventricular contours will be submitted for final approval to an independent and blinded reader. Based on approved contours, the left ventricular mass and % and mass of the fibrotic area are calculated automatically by the software algorithm. 14.4.5.2 Centralized and Blinded Image Review by Independent Readers The MRI data will be centrally evaluated in a fully blinded manner by an independent reader. The reading sessions will be organized at the imaging CRO site. The same image evaluation procedure will be used for all patients’ MRI scans in this trial. Expertise of independent readers, training sessions The reader will be a Cardiologist with a significant experience in cardiac MRI. The reader will be trained prior to start of centralized image review sessions. He/she will be provided with a Read Rules document and will be given a training on the use of the software. Test cases representing non-study Fabry patients (as described in Section 14.4.4.1) will be used for the training. Main consensus issues (contour detection in apical and basal LV slices, trabeculae and papillary muscles, threshold for delayed enhanced areas, etc.) will be discussed with the reader and documented."

National Kidney Foundation Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease Stages of Chronic kidney disease (National Kidney Foundation 2002): • Stage 1- Kidney damage with normal or elevated GFR (≥ 90) • Stage 2- Kidney damage with mild reduction in GFR (60-89) • Stage 3- Kidney damage with moderate reduction in GFR (30-59) • Stage 4- Kidney damage with severe reduction in GFR (15-29) • Stage 5- Kidney failure (<15 or dialysis) 14.6.1 Estimation of GFR: Estimates of GFR are the best overall indices of the level of kidney function. The level of GFR should be estimated from prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine concentration and some or all of the following variables: age, gender, race, and body size. Among adults, the CKD- EPI equation provides a clinically useful estimate of GFR (Levey et al., 2009). This equation provides estimate of GFR standardized for body surface area. 14.6.2 CKD -EPI Equation: The CKD- EPI equation performed better than the MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study) equation, especially at higher GFR, with less bias and greater accuracy. When looking at NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data, the median estimated GFR was 94.5 mL/min per 1.73 m2 vs. 85.0 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and the prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 11.5% versus 13.1%. The CKD- EPI equation, expressed as a single equation, is: GFR = 141 * min(Scr/κ,1)α * max(Scr/κ,1)-1.209 * 0.993Age * 1.018 [if female] * 1.159 [if black/African american] Where Scr is serum creatinine (mg/dL), κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is –0.329 for females and –0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and max indicates the maximum of Scr/κ or 1."
