Summary of Study Design: Study H8H -MC-LAIJ is a prospecti ve, multic enter, randomized, double -blind, modified -parallel, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study of adul tpatients suffering fro m migraine with or wi thout aura. Treatment Arms and Duration: One treatm ent group will receive lasmiditan 200 mg for 4 attacks, 1 trea tment group will receive lasmiditan 100 mg for 4 attacks ,and a control group will receive placebo for 3 attacks and lasmiditan 50 mg for 1 attack. The control group will consist of 2 treatment sequence groups (1:1) where 1 group will receive lasmiditan for attack 3 and the other group will receive lasmiditan f or attack 4. For rescue (pain freedo m not achi eved) or recurrence (pain freedo m achieved but then pain recurs) ,patients may take their own unexcluded medi cationsbeginning at least 2 hours postdose ; patients MUST NOT take triptan, ergot, opioid, or barbit urate m edicat ions wi thin 24 hours of taking study drug (that i s, 24 hours before or after) . To avoi d different ial drop out whi ch coul d com promise the validit y of the study , pati ents shoul d not be informed about the treatment groups; instead, patients shou ld be informed that no patient will receive placebo for all attacks. Number of Patients : Approximately 2100 patientswill be screened to achieve approximately 1600 patients rando mized , approximately 1150 patientswith data for first attack, and approximately 800 patients wi th data for consistency assessment . An additional 200 pati ents m ay be randomized if there is an insufficient number of patients with complete data for consistency assessment. Statistical Analysis: Efficacy analyses will be c onducted on the intent-to-treat ( ITT)population . This set includes all rando mized patients who use at least 1 dose of study drug for an ITT -evaluable attack , defined as a treated attack of at least mild pain severit ywith any postdose pain severit y asses sments at or before 2 hours postdose . The primary efficacy analysis will co mpare the proportion of patients with 2-hour pain freedo m during the first attack in the lasmiditan 200 -mg group with placebo and co mpare the proporti ons of pat ients with 2-hour pain freedo m during the first attack in the lasmiditan 100 -mg group with placebo."

Study Rationale Pivotal trials of acute treatm ents for migraine should address both the efficacy in single migraine attacks and the consistency of thetherapeuti c response over m ultiple attacks . In 2 Phase 3 single migraine attack studies, lasmiditan demonstrated statistically significant superi orityversus placebo in the proporti on of patients who were headache pain-free at 2 hours postdose as well as the proporti on of patients who were free of their migraine -associ ated mostbothersome symptom s (MBS) at 2 hours postdose . This global, m ulticenter, pl acebo -controlled, double -blind study willassess the efficacy, consistency of response, and safet y of lasmidi tan in acute treatm ent of 4migraine attacks with or without aura. The primary hypotheses of the study arethat lasmiditan is superior to placebo as measured by the proportion of participants who ha ve pain freedo m at 2 hours post dose during the first attack, and that l asmidi tan shows consistency of effect as defined by pain free dom at 2 hours inat least 2 out of 3 att acks. 3.2. Background Migraine is a commo n neurological disorder and was ranked by the World Healt h Organizat ion (WHO) in their 2010 Global Burden of Disease survey as 1of 7 most debili tating condi tions, and as the third most comm on disease in the wor ld among both males and females (Steiner et al. 2013). Migraine prevalence was est imated to be 11.6% (Woldeamanuel and Cowan, 2017). Regional crude migraine prevalence was 16.4% in Central and South America ,11.4% in Europe, 10.4% in Africa, 10.1% in Asia, and 9.7% in North America. Although the introduction of triptans improved the acute treatment of migraine ,somepatients still lack adequate treatment. A recent analysis o fthe American Migraine Prevalence and Prevent ion study concluded that 40% of patients wit h episodi c migraine have significant unmet needs; the most frequent complaints were headache -related disa bility (19%) and di ssatisfaction with current medicat ions (15%) ( Buse et al. 2012). Treatment of patients wi th migraine and known cardi ovascular ( CV)disease or CV risk factors is particularly challenging because the incidence o f myocardial infarct ion, stroke, claudicat ion, diabetes, hypertensio n, and hypercho lesterolemia are all higher in individuals wit h migraine compared with the general popul ation (Bigal et al . 2010 ; Adelborg et al. 2018 ). While tri ptans are often used as first -line therapy, not all patients with migraine respond to or tolerate triptans. In addit ion, concerns about CVsafet y are believed to limit the prescript ion of tri ptans in som e patients wi th migraine in the United States (Dodick et al. 2004). Hence, there is a significant unmet need for novel migraine therapies wit h a di stinct m echanism of act ion from that of triptans . Other therapies including nonsteroidal ant i-inflammatory drugs, opi oids, and barbiturates are not specifically targeted to treat migraine and have limitat ions. Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs have limited effect iveness and so me side effects includ inglabeled warning sconcerning"
18,page_18,"H8H-MC-LAIJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 18 LY573144CV risk. Opi oids and barbiturates also have limited efficacy and carry well known risks including overuse, dependency , and adverse effects . For these reasons, there is substant ial unmet medical need f or new m edicati onsfor acute treatment of migraine (Lipton et al . 2013; Tfelt - Hansen & Diener 2012). Lasmiditan is a high -affini ty, centrally -penetrant , highly select ive 5 -hydroxy tryptamine (5 -HT [serotonin]) 1F receptor agonist without si gnificant pharmacological activit y at 5 -HT1B or 5 - HT1D receptors . It has a chemical structure and pharmaco logic profile that i s dist inct from the triptans, the current standard of care for acute migraine treatment, which were developed for their vasoconstri ctor properti es (Hum phrey et al . 1990 ;Goadsby 2009; Mit sikostas and Tfelt - Hansen 2012). Evidence suggests that l asmidi tan exerts i ts therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine by decreasing neuropeptide release and inhibit ing pain pathways including the trigeminal nerve (Labast ida-Ramírez et al. 2017) without causing vas oconstri ction in human coronary arteri es(Ramadan et al. 2003). Two Phase 3multic enter ,double -blind ,placebo -controlled lasmidi tan stud ies,including LAH J with 100- mg and 200 -mg dose arms and LAHK with 50-mg, 100 -mg,and 200 -mg dose arms to treat a single migraine attack have been co mpleted (Lilly 2018 [IB]). The primary endpoint in each study was the proporti on of patients who were headache pain-free at 2 hours postdose (defined as mild, moderate, or severe headache pain reduced to none) . Inboth studies, this endpo int was si gnificant for all doses of lasmiditan versus placebo . The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were free of their migraine -associated MBS at 2 hours postdose (defined as the associated symptom p resent and i dentified as MBS prior to dosing and then absent at 2 hours). In both studies, this endpoint was significant for all doses o f lasmiditan versus placebo. Study LAHL (an open-label, 12-month s afety study o f lasmidi tan (100 m g and 200 m g) in the acute treatment o f migraine)is a Phase 3, prospective, rando mized study in adults wit h migraine . Patients who com pleted ei therStudy LAHJ or Study LAHK were given the opportunit y to enroll in Study LAHL, which is designed to assess the safet y and tol erabilit y oflong-term intermittent use of lasmiditan 100 mg and lasmiditan 200 mg for the acute treatment of migraine. Study LAHL was init iated on 13 November 2015 and is currently ong oing. Lasmiditan is generally well tolerated . In the Phase 3 studies, a treatm ent-emergent adverse event ( TEAE )was defined as an event that first occurred or worsened in severi ty after baseline and wit hin 48 hours of a first or second dose (if applicable) of study drug. The most common TEAEs reported in Study LAHJ/301 and Study LAHK/302 weredizziness ,paresthesia , somno lence, fatigue,and nausea . Amajo rity of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severit y andself-limit ingin nature . Trials to assess the consistency o f response are recommended by the Internat ional Headache Society (IHS 20 12) and by the European Medicines Agency ( EMA 2007). Also, in studies of patients wi th migraine, consistency of response is one of the most important attributes of migraine medications (Lipton et al . 2005)."

Benefit/Risk Assessment Lasmidi tan has been shown to be effect ive for the treatm ent of acute migraine wit h or wi thout aura in adults. In Phase 3 trials, lasmiditan showed statistically significant superior ityover placebo on the primary endpoints including pain freedom and M BSfreedo m at 2 hours a fter taking study drug. Lasmiditan was generally well tolerated with the most comm on TEAEs including dizziness, paresthesia, somno lence, fat igue, and nausea. Generally, t hese TEAEs were mild or moderate in severit y and self-limit ing. All doses of lasmid itan were associated with driving impairment in a study of healthy volunteers on a computer -based driving simulator. Patients shoul d restrict thei r driving, operation of heavy machinery , or other similar act ivities after taking study drug as described in the informed consent form (ICF) . Based on the statist ically significant and clinically relevant effects of lasmiditan for treatment of acute migraine in adults with ident ified safet y issues only including generally mild -to-moderate and transi ent tol erabil ity issues, the posit ive benefit to risk profile of lasmiditan supports the conduct of this study to further evaluate and understand the efficacy, consistency , and safet y of lasmiditan across 4migraine attacks. More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) and reasonably ant icipated adverse events (AEs) of lasmidi tan are to be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB) ."

Overall Design Study H8H-MC-LAIJ is a prospecti ve, multic enter, randomized, double -blind, modified parallel, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study ofadult patients suffering fro m migraine with or wi thout aura. Patients will have a history of migraine for at least 1year, 3to8 migraine attacks per month, and disabling migraine as defined by a Migraine Disabilit y Assessment Test ( MIDAS )score ≥11. The treatm ent group sequences are summari zed in Table LAIJ. 5.1and will include 1treatment group that receives lasmiditan 200 mg for 4attacks, 1treatm ent group that receives lasmiditan 100 m g for 4attacks ,and a control group that receives placebo fo r 3attacks and lasmiditan 50mg for 1attack. The control group will consist of 2treatment sequence groups (1:1) where 1 group will receive lasmiditan for attack 3and the other group will receive lasmiditan for attack 4 . Patients will be asked to tre at 4migraine attack swith study drug on an outpatient basis. Patients will be provided with doses for treatm entof all 4 attacks . Each patient’s study parti cipat ion will consist of a screening visit (Visit 1) followed by a randomizat ion visit (Visi t 2)3-to-30 days after screening , a Treatm ent Peri od of up to 16weeks including phone visit s and 1site visi t, and an end-of-study visit (EoS)at least 7days aftertreating the lastmigraine attack (or at 4 months ±2 weeks after Visi t 2).

Patient s will be asked about any concomi tant m edicati on use as well as any CV events in the last 6 months and/or related resource utilizatio n such as visits to cardio logists, procedu res, hospi talizati ons, new treatm ents or treatm ent adj ustm ents for CV disease. A Columbia -Suicide Severit y Rating Scale ( C-SSRS )will be com pleted. Patient s will receive so me initial introducti on to the electroni c diary ( eDiary )and the site will assess whether the pati ent is willing and able to use the eDiaryto record data during their migraine attacks . See Table LAIJ .2.1for a com plete list o f assessments performed at Visit 1. For pati ents not m eeting study requi rements at the screening visit or found to not qualify based on laboratory assessments, there will be no addit ional site visi ts. 5.1.2. Randomization (Visit2) At Visit 2, p atients will be rando mly assigned treatment as described in Section 5.1, will have additional assessments (see Table LAIJ .2.1), will be dispensed study drug , and will begin the Treatment Period . If available and where local regulat ions and ethical review boards (ERBs) allow, patients will also watch a training video designed to address patient expectations with regard to participat ion in a placebo -controlled trial and the difference between medica l treatm ent and research. The patientwill receive detailed instruction on the use of the eDiaryand on dosing theirmigraine attacks with study drug. 5.1.3. Treatment Period During the treatment period, patients will part icipate i n phone visits after attack 1 orat 1 month (whichever comes first) and at 3 months of study participat ion, and asite visi t at 2 m onths of study participati on. Patients com pleting their 4migraine attacks sooner than these time points will mo ve direct ly to their EoS visit. For each of 4attack s, pati ents will be instructed to treat their migraine within 4 hours of onset provi ding that the headache severit y is at least m oderate or severe at the time , is not improving , and no other migraine treatment has been taken . Patient s will record thei r response to study drug over the next 48 hours using theeDiaryset up to remind the patient to comple te assessments at specific post dose time points: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24,and 48 hours . There must be at least a 48 -hour gap after taking study drug for the treated attack ,before treating the next migraine wit h study drug. For migraine attacks which do not meet the criteria above or when the pati ent is unable to treat with study drug and com plete all study procedures during a particular migraine, they may use their usual migraine m edicati on for that migraine and then treat the next appropriate migraine with study drug. In summary , patient s are requested to treat 4consecut ive appropriate migraine attack s with study drug, but this is not required if it is not possible . As described in detail in Section 7.2.1 ,patients requiring medicat ion for rescue or for migraine recurrence may take thei r own unexcluded medicatio n. Study governance considerations are described in detail in Appendix 3 ."
26,page_26,"H8H-MC-LAIJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 26 LY5731445.2. Number of Patients Approximately 2100 patientswill be screened to achieve approximately 1600 patients rando mized , approximately 1150 patientswith data for first attack , and approximately 800 patients wi thdata for consistency assessment . An additional 200 pat ients may be randomized if there is an insufficient number of patients with complete data for consistency assessment. 5.3. End of Study Definition End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure for the last visit for the last patient . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design The patient populat ion for this study will cl osely align to the study popul ation stu died in the lasmiditan Phase 3 program to date. A modified parallel design was chosen after consideration of mult iple design options. The modified parallel design was previously used successfully to assess the consistency of telcagepant over 4 attacks (Ho et al . 2010) . This design was chosen over a parallel placebo -controlled design because o f reduced risk of unblinding leading to differential drop -out rates . A frequent ly used approach , term edrando m-insertio n-of-placebo, is for each patient toreceive placebo for 1 of their attacks. However, relat ive to this approach, the modified parallel approach in this study has beneficial features, including the opportunit y to study the consistency of response to 2 doses of lasmiditan (100 mg and 200 mg) with a relatively simple study design. Finally , while random -insert ion-of-placebo provi des the consistency of treatm ent, i t does not provi de an opportunit yfor comparing the consistency of effect in pa tients treated with drug versus placebo . The efficacy of lasmiditan 100 mg and 200 mg will be assessed during the first attack by comparing the resul ts in those groups with the results wit h placebo in th e control group . The number of attacks is 4and the durati on of the treatm ent phase of the study is up to 16weeks. Patients wi th 3to8 migraine attacks per month will be recruited to increase the probabilit y that patients will achieve 1or more evaluable migraine attacks per month as recommended in the IHS guideline ( IHS Clinical Trials Subco mmittee 2012 ) . Inclusion of the control group The inclusio n of the control group provides the opportunit y to com pare the efficacy and consistency of response to lasmiditan 100 mg and 200 mg to placebo , improved maintenance o f blinding since patients in the control group will receive lasmiditan 50 mgfor 1attack, more patient acceptabilit y since they will not receive placebo for all attacks, and the op portunity to assess the efficacy of lasmiditan 50 mg during 1 attack.Placebo effect in acute trea tment of migraine varies from 6% to 47%, highlighting the importance of co mpar ing act ive study drug to placebo . Because rescue medication is permitted after 2 hours, the use of placebo in the design is ethically appropri ate(Lipton et al . 2005) ."
27,page_27,"H8H-MC-LAIJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 27 LY5731445.5. Justification for Dose Two single -attack Phase 3 studies of lasmiditan have been co mpleted, and these studies show dose-dependent efficacy of lasmiditan versus placebo to increase freedo m from both pain and MBS with lasmidi tan. All doses (50 m g, 100 m g, and 200 m g)showed stati stically significant superi ority versus pl acebo on pain freedom, MBS freedo m, and pain relief versus placebo. In general, the eff icacy of lasmidi tan was dose dependent ,with lasmiditan 50 mg showing the least efficacy and lasmidi tan 200 m g showing the m ost efficacy . Saf etyanalysis showed TEAEs were increased with lasmiditan compared to pl acebo , incl uding dizziness, paresthesia, so mnolence, fatigue, nausea, and lethargy. In general, these TEAEs were observed to increase in a dose - dependent manner (ie, they were l owest wi th lasmidi tan 50 m g and highest wi th lasmidi tan 200mg). These TEAEs were usually mild tomoderate i n severi ty andself-limit ing. Because of the relatively greater efficacy of lasmiditan 100mg and 200 mg, the main study arms will be lasmiditan 100 mg, lasmiditan 200 mg, and control. To further understand the effects of lasmiditan 50 mg, the control group will receive lasmiditan 50 mg for 1attack."

Method of Treatment Assignment Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be randomized to double -blind treatment at Visit 2. Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a computer -generated random sequence using an interactive web -response system (IWRS) . Patients will be rando mized 1:1:1 to the lasmidi tan 200 -mg, l asmidi tan 100 -mg,and control groups . The IWRS will be used to assign double -blind inv estigational product to each pati ent. At Visit 2 , patients will be provided with sufficient study drug to treat 4migraine attack s.

Patients should not take anymedicat ions unt il 2 hours after taking adose of study drug and com pleting the 2 -hour assessments. After that, they may take unexcluded alternat ive medicat ions for rescue or recurrence. The invest igator should advise patients of appropriate medicat ions to be taken for rescue or recurrence, and inform patients that triptans, ergots, opio ids, and barbiturates MUST NOT be taken wit hin 24 hours ofstudy drug administration (that is, 24 hours before or after) . The use of rescue or recurrence medicat ion shoul d be recorded in the patient’s paper journal. 7.3. Blinding This is a double -blind study . To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment a ssignments before the study is complete. Emergency unblinding for AEs willbe perform ed through the IWR S. Thi s opti on may be used ONLY if the patient’swell-being requires knowledge of thepatient ’s treatment assignment. All unblinding event sare recorded and reported by the IWRS . If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the patient must be discont inued fro m the study . In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study , the investigator m ust obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly clinical research physician (CRP) for the patientto continue in the study . In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment is warranted for medical management of the event. The patient’s safet y must always be the first consideration in maki ng such a determinat ion. If a patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, it is the responsibilit y of the investi gator to prom ptly docum ent the decisio n and rationale and notify Lilly as soon as possible.

Upon review o f eligibilit y at Visit 2,study drug to treat all 4 attacks will be provided. Informat ion on date and time of each dose will be recorded by patient in the eDiary . Patients will return all unused st udy drug to the si te at the end of study visit. The site will document which tablets are returned. Apatientwill be considered significant ly nonco mpliant if he or she is judged by the invest igator to have intentionally or repeatedly taken m ore than the prescribed amount of medicat ion. 7.7. Concomitant Therapy Concomitant medicat ions (including devices )for migraine or pain prior to study enrollment and concomitant medicat ion used to treat other medical condit ions pri or to study enro llment will be recorded dur ing Screening/Visit 1. Any changes in dosage or new medicat ions added as a result of intercurrent illness during the patient’s time on study must be recorded in the CRFs. Use of the following medicat ions is prohibited for the duration of a patient ’s participat ion in the study from Screening/Visit 1 through EoS: any invest igational treatment other than lasmiditan if a pat ient requi res the init iation of migraine prophylaxis (conco mitant medicat ion to reduce the frequency of migraine episodes) or a change in ongoing migraine prophylaxis after the Screening/Visit 1 they shoul d be withdrawn from the study 7.8.

Primary Efficacy Assessments Patient Diary Patients will be introduced to the eDiaryat Visi t 1 and trained on the use of the eDiaryat Vi sit 2. Efficac y data for each attack will be collected in theeDiary. Patients will record the date and time at which their migraine headache starts and when it first becomes moderate or severe. They will also record the date and time of taking study drug. Patients will be asked to assess their headache severit y at specified time points : 0 (pre dose), 0.5, 1,2 ,4, 6, 24,and 48 hours post dose using the IHS 4- point headache severit y rating scale (0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 =moderate pain, and 3 = severe pain) (see Appendix 7 ). 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments Patient Diary Secondary efficacy data will also be co llected in theeDiary. At the time points 0 (pre dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24,and 48 hours, patients willassess the presence or absence (yes or no) of accompanying symptoms: photophobia, phonophobia ,nausea ,and vomiting. At time 0 (pre dose) patients will select fro m the acco mpanying symptoms present (from nausea, phonophobia ,or photophobia only) which one is the m ost bothersom e to them (see Appendix 7 ). Patients will also be asked to record the time at which headache relief became meaningful to them and the time at whi ch they become headache p ain-free. At 2 and 24 hours after dos ingwith study drug, patients will be asked to record their global impressio n of change (PGIC ) using a 7 - point scale (very much better, m uch better, a litt le better, no change, a litt le worse, much worse, and very much worse) (see Appendix 7 ). Patients shoul d record d etails of AEs,concomitant medicat ion use , and any other rel evant inform ationin the patient’s paper journal and these will be reviewed at the next visit."

The use of rescue or recurrence medicatio n shoul d be recorded in the patient ’s paper journal . Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQoLQ) : The 24-h ourMigraine Qualit y of Life Quest ionnaire (24 -hrMQoLQ) has been specifically developed to measure the HRQoL of patients wi th migraine within a 24 -hourperiod after having taken migraine medicat ion. The 24-hour MQoLQ is a 15 -item, self - administered questionnaire . The i tems cover 5 domains (work functioning , soci alfunct ioning, energy and vitality, feelings and concerns, and migraine symptoms) (Hartmaier et al .1995; Santanello et al . 1995, 1997) . Each domain consists of 3 questions answered on a 7 -point scale where 1 indicates maximum impairment and 7 indicat ing no impairment . A domain score is calculated by summing the responses to the 3questions and the dom ain score ranges from 3 to 21. The questionnaire will be administered 24 hours after dosing wit hstudy drug during each migraine . MIDAS : The MIDAS is a pat ient-rated scale which was des igned to quantify headache- related disabili ty over a 3 -month peri od. This instrum ent consists of 5 items that reflect the number of days reported as missed, or with reduced productivit y at work or hom e and soci al events. Each question is answered as the number of days during the past 3 months of assessment, ranging from 0 to 90, wi th the total score being the summatio n of the 5 numeric responses. A higher value is indicat ive of more disabilit y (Stewart et al . 1999 , 2001). This instrument is considered reliable and valid, and is correlated with clinical judgment regarding the need for medical care (Stewart et al. 1999 ,2001). For clinical interpretabilit y, 4 categori cal grades were developed based on the total score : Grade I (0 to 5) is for litt le or no disabilit y, Grade II (6 to 10) is for mild di sabili ty, Grade III (11 to 20) i s for moderate di sabili ty, and Grade IV (21+) is for severe disabili ty. The severe disabilit y category has subsequent ly been subdivided into Grade IV -A (severe [21 to 40]) and Grade IV -B (very severe [41 to 270]) because a high proportion of patients wi th chroni c migraine are in Grade IV (Blumenfeld et al. 2011) . Two addit ional questions (A and B) collect informat ion on the frequency o f headac hes and the intensit y of the headache pain . These are not scored in the MIDAS Questionnaire but are included to provide clinically relevant informat ion that m ay aid in treatment and management decisio ns. The MIDAS will be captured at screening as part of the inclusio n criteriaand again at EoS with the recall period adjusted to capture disabilit y since the patient enrolled in the study (depending on how quickly the pat ient completes the 4migraine attacks, this could be fro m approximately 1 to 4 months ). mTOQ -6: The mTOQ is a validated, self -administered questionnaire that assesses the efficacy of current acute migraine treatment (Lipton et al . 2009) and is d emonstrated to m easure an autonom ous outcom e domain related to ,but di stinct from ,functioning an d HRQoL over a 4 - week peri od (Li pton et al . 2009).

This study will use the 6-item versio n (mTOQ -6) at baseline/first visit with Likerttyperesponse opti onsof Never ( 0 points ); Rarely (0 points ); Less than half the time (1 points ); and Half the time or more (2 points ). A total score from 0 to 8 is calculated by summing the points from 4of the i tems ( 2-hour pain freedom, sustained 24 -hour pain relief, co mfortable to m ake plans, and perceived control) which define categories of acute treatment response : very poor (0), poor (1-5), moderate (6-7), and maximum (8) treatm ent efficacy (Lipton et al . 2015 ). This quest ionnaire wil l be administered at Visit 2. EQ-5D- 5L: 5-Dimensio ns 5-Levels (EQ-5D- 5L) questionnaire is a widely used, generic questionnaire that assesses healt h status (The EuroQol Group 1990 ;Herdman et al. 2011). This is a patient -rated scale. The questionnaire c onsists of 2 parts. The first part assesses 5dimensio ns (mobilit y, self-care, usual act ivities, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on) that have 5 possible levels of response ( no probl ems, slight probl ems, m oderate problems, severe probl ems, extrem e problems). This part of the EQ -5D can be used to generate a health state index score, which is used to compute qualit y-adjusted life years for utilizat ion in healt h economic analyses. The healt h state index score is cal culated based on the responses to the 5dimensio ns, providing a single value on a scale from less than 0 (where 0is a healt h state equivalent to death; negat ive values are valued as worse than death ) to 1 (perfect healt h), with higher scores indicat ing better healt h utilit y. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analog scale on which the pati ent rates their perceived healt h state from 0 ( the worst heal th you can imagine ) to 100 ( the best healt h you can imagine ). The EQ -5D- 5L wil l be captured at Visit 2and at 0 and 24 hours postdose during each migraine . Disability: Disabilit y will be measured by determining the l evel of interference wi th norm al activit ies wit h 4 response options including not at all; mild interference, marked i nterference; and need co mplete bed rest. This will be evaluated at 0, 0.5, 1, 2 ,4, 6, and 24 h ours postdose during each migraine . Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC ): Patient global impression of change will be measured at 2 and 24 hours postdose with a 7-point scale ranging from very much better to very much worse during each migraine . Treatment Satisfaction : Treatment satisfaction will be evaluated at the EoS visit by determining the patient’s level of satisfact ion (ranging fro m extremely dissatisfied to extremely satisfied ); thei r willingness to take this treatment again (ranging fro m strongly disagree to strongly agree )and if they would they recommend this treatm ent to another patient (ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree ). 9.1.3. Appropriateness of Assessments The assessments collected during this study are standard and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant. The study has 2primary endpoints. Pain freedo m at 2hours postdose is a recommended primary endpoint to assess efficacy of a migraine treatment . Based on regul atory guidance for consistency studi es, the other primary endpoint is consistency of effect."
43,page_43,"H8H-MC-LAIJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 43 LY573144The other assessments are also consistent with regulatory guidance and are commo nly used in studi es of medicat ions for acute treatment of migraine. 9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patientswho have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. Such events should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of patientsduring the study. Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused the patientto discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patientshoul d be f ollowed unt il the even t resol ves or until the event stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluat ion. The frequency of fo llow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the di screti on of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of t he clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient ’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease un der treatm ent in the study . In addit ion, site personnel will record any change in the condi tion(s) and any new condi tions as AEs . Investi gators shoul d record the following via eCRF for each AE : time of onset, time of terminat ion, severit y, and their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure andinvestigational product. The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomitant treatment or pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause and effect relat ionship between the investigat ional product, study device and/or study procedure and the AE . The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient ’s investigational product is di scontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF , clarifying if possible, the circumstances leading to any dosagemodifications, or discontinuations o f treatm ent. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es:"

Examples of such m edical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at hom e, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development o f drug dependency or drug abuse All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the e CRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the sponsor begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE o ccurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the sponsor as per SAE reporting requirements and t imelines (see Sect ion 9.2)if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via initiation o f the SAE eCRF .Once the SAE eCRF form is init iated, an email is automati cally tri ggered to the Sponsor’s global pat ient safety depart ment. Investigators can contact the sponsor via telephone at any time using the qualified medical personnel or Lilly affiliate medical contact details which are provided in the site study file.If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notificat ionvia co mpletion of the SAE eCRF . If the eCRF is unavailable (for example, for system maintenance ) for a peri od of time that would compro mise the sites ’abilit y to report an event within 24 -hrs o f awareness, a paper versio n of the form should be downloaded from the Invest igatorSpace portal, completed by the invest igator, and submitted via fax to the S ponsor ’s global patient safet y department. This form includes a fax cover page that is pre -popul ated wi th the appropri ate fax number. Serious adverse events submitted via the paper method are entered into the eCRF once the database is available. The 24- hour notification requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and all follow -up SAE informat ion.Patients with a serious hepat ic AEshoul d have addi tional data collected using the eCRF . Pregnancy ( during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligate d to actively seek AEs or SAEs in patientsonce they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patientdisposit ion CRF has been completed).

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adver se react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory requirements in parti cipat ing countries requi re the reporting of SUSARs. Lilly has procedures that will be followed for the ident ificat ion,recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent wi th global regul ations and the associated detailed guidances. 9.2.2. Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study parti cipants, m onitor qu ality, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product so that the situation can be assessed. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose Refer to the IB. 9.4. Safety The safet y assessments are described below. 9.4.1. Electrocardiograms For each patient,a single 12 -lead di gitalECG willbe co llected according to the Schedule o f Activities (Secti on 2)as a baseline . There will be no central reading of ECGs. Patients m ust be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collect ion and remain supine but awake during ECG collect ion. Invest igators may repeat an ECG collect ion as medi cally needed. Any clinically significant findings fro m ECGs that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatm ent shoul d be reported to Lilly or its de signee as an AE via e CRF. 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs will include body temperature, bl ood pressure, and pulse. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured in the sitting posit ion prior to bl ood draws , according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 2) and fo llowing the study -specific reco mmendat ions included intheManual of Operati ons for the study ."

Other Tests Columbia Suicide -Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS): A scale that captures the occurrence, severit y ,and frequency of suicide -related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period (Posner et al. 2011) . The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the type of informat ion needed to determine if a suicide -related thought or behavior occurred. The C -SSRS is administered by an appropri ately trained healthcare professio nal with at least 1 y ear of pat ient care/clinical experience according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2). Thetool was developed by the National Inst itute of Mental Health ( NIMH )trial group (T reatm ent of Adolescent Suicide Attempters Study ) for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algorithm o f Suicide Assessment ( C-CASA )categori zation of suicidal events . Two versions of the C- SSRS will be used: The screening version will be ad minis tered at Screening/Visit 1 The “since last visit” versio n will be administered at Visit 2 and Visit 4 (at 2months) and at V6 (EoS) For thisstudy , the C -SSRS i s adapted for the assessment of the ideat ion and behavior categories only.The Intensit y of Ideation and Lethalit y of Behavi or secti ons are rem oved. The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur pri or to the collect ion of the C -SSRS. If a suicide-related event is discovered during the C -SSRS but was not captured during the nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form. If an adverse event i s seri ous or leads to di scont inuat ion, thi s is an exception where the SAE and/or AE leading to discontinuat ion shoul d be included on the AE form and the process for reportin g SAEs shoul d be followed. Assessment of driving accidents/violations: In order to further evaluate the impact of lasmiditan on driving, an assessment of driving accidents/vio lationswill be conducted by site personnel according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2)."

Safety Monitoring Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate methods. 9.4.5.1. Hepatic Safety Monitoring If a study patient experiences elevated ALT ≥3X ULN, AST ≥3X ULN, ALP ≥2X ULN, or elevated TBL ≥2X ULN, liver testing ( Appendix 4 ) should be repeat ed within 3 to5 days including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin , gamma- glutamyl transferase, and creatine kinase to confirm the abnormalit y and to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. If the abnorm ality persists or worsens, clinical and labor atory monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by the investigator and in consultat ion with the study medical m onitor. Moni toring of ALT, AST, TBL , and ALP should continue unt il levels norm alize or return to approximate baseline levels. Hepatic Safety Data Collect ion Addit ional safet y data should be co llected if 1 or more of the f ollowing condit ions occur: elevation of serum ALT to ≥5X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests elevation of serum AST to ≥5X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests elevated serum TBL to ≥ 2X ULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndro me) elevation of serum ALPto ≥2X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests patient discont inued fro m treatm ent due to a hepatic event or abnormalit y of liver tests hepatic event considered to be a SAE 9.5.

Patients are also sp ecifically asked about the number of healthcare events that are rel ated to migraine attacks. The baseline visit will include t he same quest ions but with the past 6 months as the recall period. A quest ion on em ployment status will also be solicited accord ing to the Schedule of Act ivities, given the correlat ion and potential confounding with healt h outcome measure s."

Sample Size Determination Approximately 2100 pat ients will be screened to achieve approximately 1600 randomized, approximately 1150 wi th data for fi rst attack, and approximately 800 wi th complete data for consistency assessment. An addit ional 200 pat ients may be rando mized if ther e is an insufficient number of patients with co mplete data for consistency assessment. Eligible pat ients will be randomized in blinded fashio n in a 1:1:1 ratio to lasmidi tan 200 m g, lasmidi tan 100 m g,or control . The control group will consist of 2 trea tment sequence groups where all patients receive placebo for 3 attacks and are randomized 1:1 where 1group will receive lasmiditan 50 mg for attack 3 and the other group will receive lasmiditan 50 mg for attack 4. Using a 1-sided, 2-sample com parison of p roporti ons at a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, a sam ple size of 380 patients per treatment arm for the first attack provides >90% power to detect a difference in headache pain- free response at 2 hours for assumed true rates of 29% for l asmidi tan 100 m g and 19% fo r placebo for the first attack. The power is expected to be higher for the comparison of lasmidi tan 200 m g to pl acebo given the larger effect of lasmiditan 200 mg versus lasmiditan 100 m g observed in previous studies. For the consistency primary endpoint s, assuming 0.3 and 0.2 correlat ion coefficient samong multiple attacks for lasmiditan and placebo respectively, and assuming a consistent response rate at each attack for lasmiditan and placebo, a sample size of 260 patients per treatment arm provi des >90 % power for 2 -hour headache pain-free consistency for the 200 -mg dose arm and nearly90% power for consistency in the 100 -mg dose arm. 10.2. Populations for Analyses For purposes of analysis, the populat ions are defined below. For efficacy analyses, patients a re evaluated by attack and by the group to which they are randomized. For safet y analyses, p atients will be analyzed according to the treatment group they actually received ,which will generally be the sam e as randomized treatment unless there is an error ."

Primary Analyses The firstprimary object ive of this study is to assess the efficacy o f lasmiditan 200mg and lasmiditan 100 mg on migraine headache pain freedom . The primary measurement is the proporti on of patients having pain free dom (defined as mild, moderate, or severe headac he pain beco ming none) at 2 hours post dose during the first attack. This analysis will be performed on the ITT populat ion. The second primary objective of thi s study is to assess the consistency of efficacy o f lasmiditan 200 m g and lasmidi tan 100 m g on mi graine headache pain freedo m. The primary measurement is the proporti on of patients having pain free dom (defined as mild, moderate, or severe headache pain beco ming none) at 2 hours postdose in at least 2 out of 3 attacks. This analysis will be perform edusing the ITT consistency popul ation. The primary object ive for the study is met if the resul t from at least 1of the 4hypothesis tests specified above ( lasmidi tan 200 mg or 100 mg compared with placebo on migraine headache pain freedo m, lasmidi tan 200 mg or 100 mg compared with placebo on consi stency of efficacy) is statistically significant . Logist icregressio nwith categori cal term s for treatment and geographi c regi on will be used to statist ically evaluate the proportions of pat ients achieving migraine headache pain freedo min first attack for lasmidi tan treatm ent groups versus placebo and also in the consistency analyses comparing lasmidi tan treatm ent groups versus placebo . In order to control for overall type I error, the primary analyses wil l be tested using a multiple comparisons procedure that preserves overall t ype I error at 1 -sided alpha level o f 0.025.

Safety Analyses 10.3.4.1. Treatment -Emergent Adverse E vents Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as the reported AEs that first occurred or worsened during the postbaseline phase co mpared with the baseline phase. For each TEAE, the reported severit y level o f the event (mild, moderate, or severe) will be d etermined by pat ient or physician opinio n. The Medical Dict ionary for Regul atory Activities (MedDRA) Lowest Level Term (LLT) will be used in the treatm ent-emergent com putati on. Foreach patient and TEAE, the maximum severit y for the MedDRA level being di splayed (preferred term, High Level Term , or system organ cl ass [SOC ]) is the m aximum postbaseline severit y observed from allassociated LLTs mapping to that MedDRA level. An AE wi th time ofonset wi thin 48 hours after a dose of study drug, or an event th at worsens in intensit y within 48 hours aftera dose of study drug will be considered a TEAE . An AE that occurs in the interval after 48 hours of dosing unt il EoS/Visit 6will not be considered a TEAE. For events that are sex -specific, the denominator and co mputation of the percentage will include only patients from the specific sex. Frequency counts and percentages will be presented for subjects with TE AEs within each SOC and preferred t erm, separated by treatment arm . Both subjects ever experiencing anevent as well as total events will be presented. Descript ive statist ics will also be calculated for each treatm ent arm forAE relat ionship and AE severi ty. If mu ltiple intensit ies are reported for a given TEAE for a subject, the most severe intensit y will be counted . Analyses will be perform ed by treatment groups across all at tacks and for each attack. For the con trol arm, placebo and lasmiditan 50 mg will be evaluated separately.

Headache has at least two of the following four characterist ics: 1. unilateral location 2. pul sating qualit y 3. moderate or severe pain intensit y 4. aggravation by or causing avo idance of routine physical act ivity (e.g. walking or climbing stairs) D. D uring headache at least one of the fo llowing: 1. nausea and/or vomit ing 2. photophobia and phonophobia E. Not better accounted for by another ICHD - 3diagnosis 1.2 Migraine with aura Previously used terms: Classic or cl assical migraine; ophthalmic, hemiparaesthet ic, hemiplegic or aphasic migraine; migraine ac compagnée; complicated migraine Descript ion: Recurrent attacks, last ing minutes, of unilateralfully reversible visual, sensory or other central nervous sy stem symptom s that usually devel op gradu ally and are usually fo llowed by headache and associated migraine symptoms . Diagnostic cri teria: A. At least two attacks fulfilling criteria B and C"

At l east three of the following six characterist ics: 1. at l east one aura symptom spreads gradually over ≥5 minutes 2. two or m ore aura symptom s occur in successio n 3. each individual aura symptom lasts 5–60 minutes 4. at l east one aura symptom is unilateral 5. at l east one aura symptom is positive 6. the aura is acco mpanied, or followed wit hin 60 minutes, by headache D. Not better accounted for by another ICHD -3 diagnosis 1.2.1 Migraine with typical aura Descript ion : Migraine wi th aura, in which aura consists of visual and/or sensory and/or speech/language symptoms, but no motor weakness, and is characterized by gradual development, duration of each symptom no longer than 1hour, a mix of posit ive and negative featur es and complete reversibilit y Diagnostic cri teria: A.

71,page_71,"H8H-MC-LAIJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 71 LY573144B. Headache, with or without migraine characteristics, accompanies or fo llows the aura within 60 minutes. 1.2.1.2 Typical aura without headache Descript ion: Migraine wi th typical aura in which aura is neither accompanied nor followed by headache of any sort. Diagnostic cri teria: A. Attacks fulfilling criteria for 1.2.1 Migraine with typical aura and criterion B below B. No headache acco mpanies or fo llows the aura wi thin 60 min utes. 1.3 Chronic migraine Descript ion: Headache occurring on ≥15 or m ore days/m onth for m ore than three m onths, which, on at least eight day s/month, has the features of migraine headache. Diagnostic cri teria: A. Headache (migraine -like or tensio n-type-like) on 15 days/m onth for >3 months, and fulfilling criteria B and C B. Occurring in a pat ient who has had at least five attacks fulfilling criteria B –D for 1.1 Migraine wi thout aura and/or criteria B and C for 1.2 Migraine wit h aura C. On ≥8 days/m onth for >3 months, fulfilling any of the following: 1. cri teria C and D for 1.1 Migraine wit hout aura 2. cri teria B and C for 1.2 Migraine wit h aura 3. believed by the pat ient to be migraine at onset and relieved by a triptan or ergot derivat ive D. Not better accounted for by another ICHD -3 diagnosis The reason for singling out 1.3 Chronic migraine from types of episodi c migraine is that it is impossible to dist inguish the individual episodes of headache in pat ients with such frequent or continuous headaches. In fact, the characterist ics of the headache may change not only fro m day to day but even within the same day . Such patients are extremely difficult to keep medicat ion -free in order to observe the natural history of the headache. In this si tuation, attacks with and those wi thout aura are both counted, as are both migraine -like and tensio n-type-like headaches (but not secondary headaches) ."
