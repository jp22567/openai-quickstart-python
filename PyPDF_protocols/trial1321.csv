Compound: Brigatinib (AP26113) Title of Protocol: A Single -Arm, Multicenter, Phase 2 Study of Brigatinib in Japanese Patients With ALK -Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) IND No.: Not applicable EudraCT No.: Not applicable Study Number: Brigatinib -2001 Phase: 2 Study Design: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, phase 2, open -label study with safety evaluation lead -in, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of brigatinib in Japanese patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -positive advanced NSCLC. The study consists of the safety eva luation lead -in part and the expansion part. The safety evaluation lead -in part allows patients with any line of prior ALK inhibitor which includes treatment -naïve patients; however, ALK inhibitor -naïve patients may be enrolled after the confirmation of first 3 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluable patients to have no more than 1 DLT during Cycle 1 by investigator's judgement. The expansion part consists of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naïve expansion c ohort and the refractory expansion part . The refractory expansion part includ es the main cohort and a subcohort based on prior ALK inhibitor treatment. The TKI-naïve expansion cohort includ es the patients who have not received any prior TKI including ALK inhibitor. In this cohort, the efficacy will b e evaluated, and a total of 32 patients will be enrolled. The main cohort of the refractory e xpansion part includes patients who had previously received alectinib (as their only ALK inhibitor) or both crizotinib and alectinib (regardless the sequence of those 2 ALK inhibitors). The main cohort of the refractory expansion part will be used for the primary analys is of efficacy, and a total of 47 patients will be enrolled in the main cohort of the r efractory expansion part . Patients with all other sequences of up to 2 prior ALK inhibitor(s) may be included in the subcohort of the refractory expansion part. Such other ALK inhibitors include 1) crizotinib only, 2) ceritinib only, 3) lorlatinib only, 4) both crizotinib and ceritinib, 5) both alectinib and ceritinib, 6) both crizotinib and lorlatinib, 7) both alectinib and lorlatinib, and 8) both ceritinib and lorlatini b. Up to 20 patients will be enrolled in the subcohort of the refractory expansion part . In this study, brigatinib will be administered at 90 mg once daily (QD) for the first 7 days and then 180 mg QD (90 mg QD→180 mg QD). In the safety evaluation lead -in part, patients will be monitored for intensive pharmacokinetics (PK), and the tolerability of 90 mg QD→180 mg QD dosing will be confirmed. If the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD dosing regimen is considered tolerable, additional patients enrolled in the expansion part will be treated with the same dosing schedule (90 mg QD→180 mg QD). Patients will be treated until they experience objective progressive disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, as assessed by the investigator, i ntolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation for any other reason. Treatment of patients with brigatinib may be continued at the tolerated dose level, despite investigator -assessed PD by RECIST version 1.1, if the patient otherwise has ev idence of ongoing clinical benefit. In this case, discussions and agreements between the investigator and the sponsor ’s project clinician (or designee ) are required. Safety Evaluation Lead -in Part Nine DLT –evaluable patients will be enrolled in the safety evaluation lead -in part. The patients in the safety evaluation lead -in part will be hospitalized during Cycle 1 in general (hospitalization on Days 1 -10 and Days 22 -23 is mandatory), and their condition will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability. Serial blood samples will be collected for the intensive PK profile. The patients in the safety evaluation lead -in part will receive brigatinib 90 mg QD→180 mg QD. A cycle of therapy comprises 28 days of treatment. If a patient is NOT considered DLT eval uable for any reason , the patient will be replaced. Tolerability of the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD schedule will be determined on the basis of the DLTs observed in Cycle 1. If a DLT is observed in fewer than 3 of the 9 DLT -evaluable patients in the safety evaluation lead -in part, the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD regimen will be used for the patients enrolled in the expansion part. Opening of the expansion part will be determined on the basis of the total safety data available at that time, available PK results, and with Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"
12,page_12,"Brigatinib Study No. Brigatinib -2001 Page 12 of 118 Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 0 4 22 July 2020 recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). Regarding the safety data, all AEs observed in the safety evaluation lead -in part, including those observed in DLT non -evaluable patients, will be evaluated in concert with DLTs when making the decision on opening of the expansion part. Expansion Part (Refractory Expansion Part and TKI -Naïve Expansion Cohort) For the TKI -naïve expansion cohort and the refractory expansion part, patients may be managed on an outpatient basis, and the number of study sites will be increased up to approximately 40. Patients in the refractory expansion part and the TKI-naïve expansion cohort will undergo less -intensive PK blood sampling than patients in the safety evaluation lead -in part. On an outpatient basis, patients will visit the hospital on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, and then on Day 1 of each cycle after Cycle 2. Tumor assessment will be performed every 2 cycles from Cycle 3 Day 1 through Cycle 15 Day 1, then every 3 cycles thereafter until the l ast dose of study drug. For patients who discontinue study treatment in the absence of PD, additional tumor assessment should continue at the same time points as the study treatment until PD or the start of another systemic anticancer therapy. Primary Objective: To evaluate effic acy of brigatinib in Japanese patients with ALK -positive advanced NSCLC.  The objective response rate (ORR) will be evaluated in the refractory patients .  The p rogression -free survival ( PFS) rate at 12 months in Kaplan -Meier plots (12 months PFS rate) will be evaluated in the TKI -naïve patients . Secondary Objectives:  To confirm the clinical dose in Japanese patients.  To characterize the efficacy of brigatinib as shown by following parameters . For all enrolled patients (including TKI-naïve patients): duration of response (DOR), PFS, disease control rate (DCR), time to response, and overall survival (OS). For the TKI -naïve patients : ORR  To characterize the intracranial efficacy of brigatinib, as evidenced by intracranial objective response rate (iORR) and duration of intracranial response (iDOR), and intracranial PFS (iPFS) in patients with intracranial disease at baseline, from the refractory expansion part and the TKI-naïve expansion cohort.  To assess patient -reported outcomes (PROs) of health -related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptoms of lung cancer with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) -C30 (version 3.0), its lung cancer module QLQ -LC13, and the 5 -level version of the EuroQol 5 -dimensional questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L).  To characterize the PK of brigatinib in Japanese patients. Safety Objective: The safety objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of brigatinib. Subject Population: Patients with ALK -positive advanced NSCLC. Safety evaluation lead -in part: patients with any line of prior ALK inhibitor treatment including treatment naïve. Expansion part:  Patients who have progress ed on prior treatment with 1 or 2 ALK inhibitors (refractory expansion part) or,  Patients who have not received ALK inhibitors ( TKI-naïve expansion cohort) Number of Subjects: Approximately 110 patients: Safety evaluation lead -in part: approximately 9 patients Expansion part: Number of Sites: Estimated total: approximately 40 sites in Japan Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

Treatment of patients with brigatinib may be continued at the tolerated dose level, despite investigator -assessed PD by RECIST version 1.1, if the patient otherwise has evidence of ongoing clinical benefit. In this case, discussions and agreements between the investigator and the sponsor ’s project clinician (or designee) are required. Period of Evaluation: For the safety evaluation lead- in part and the refractory expansion part, t he follow -up period will be for 24 months after the last patient was enrolled, or when all patients have complet ed the study treatment, whichever comes later. However, in case a marketing approval of brigatinib for both first -line and second -line settings is obtained in Japan before the study completion noted above, this study will be come a post-marketing clinical s tudy after the marketing approval and will be continued until all the patients who are continuing study treatment with brigatinib have access to the commercial supply. For the TKI -naïve expansion cohort, after a marketing approval of brigatinib for both fi rst-line and second -line settings is obtained in Japan, this study will become a post -marketing clinical study and will be continu ed until the last patient have access to the commercial supply. Main Criteria for Inclusion: 1. Male or female Japanese patients aged ≥20 years on the day of consent. 2. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study -related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time with out prejudice to future medical care. 3.

Safety and PK analysis Safety will be analyzed in the population of patients who have received at least 1 dose of brigatinib. The PK population will include patients with sufficient dosing and PK data to reliably estimate PK parameters as determined by the clinical pharmacologist. The PK population will be used for all PK analyses . Sample Size Justification: In the safety evaluation lead -in part, 9 DLT -evaluable patients will be enrolled for intensive safety and PK monitoring. This num ber of patients was derived from the following considerations: The meaningful intensive PK charac terization needs to be conducted with more than 6 patients. It is assumed that 9 patients may be reasonable to secure the number of patients needed for intensive PK characterization, even with the potential dropouts, and to evaluate the tolerability of the study drug. Also, 9 DLT -evaluable patients is enough to evaluate tolerability before expanding the dose cohort to larger a population using a conventional 3+3 design. The sample size in the main cohort of the refractory expansion part was determined to allow confirmation that the true ORR (expected response rate) is greater than the threshold response rate of 15% for patients previously treated with alectinib alone and those treated with both alectinib and crizotinib. The rationale for the 15% response rate for the alectinib (with or without crizotinib) pretreated population is based on the consideration that compared with crizotinib, patients who have failed alectinib are less likely to respond to subsequent therapy because of alectinib ’s greater potency and better coverage of ALK mutations compared with crizotinib. A sample size of 47 patients in the post -alectinib population of the refractory expansion part with the stopping rule mentioned in in the Statistical Considerations section will allow the study to have more than 90% power to rule out a threshold response rate when the true ORR is expected or higher than 3 5% with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, according to the H1 -minimax design (Englert and Ki eser, 2012). The number of patients in the subcohort of the refractory expansion part (ie, patients previously treated with crizotinib only, ceritinib only, lorlatinib only, both crizotinib and ceritinib, both alectinib and ceritinib, both crizotinib and lorlatinib, both alectinib and lorlatinib, and both ceritinib and lorlatinib) will be limited to 20. The sample size in the TKI-naïve expansion cohort was determined to allow confirmation that the true 12 months PFS rate (expected response rate) is greater than the threshold of 42.6% (estimated PFS rate at 12 months in Kaplan -Meier plots observed in ALTA -1L c rizotinib arm) for TKI -naïve patients. A sample size of 32 patients in the TKI-naïve expansion cohort will allow the study to have approximately 80% power to rule out the threshold rate (42.6%) when the true 12 months PFS rate is expected or higher than 66.5% (estimated PFS rate at 12 months in Kaplan -Meier plots observed in ALTA -1L brigatinib arm) with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.05, considering 10% patients will discontinu e the study follo w-up before the 12 months milestone due to reasons other than disease progression assessed by IRC or death, and 8 months enrollment period.

Globally, lung cancer accounted for 1.6 million cases and 1.4 million deaths in 2008 [2]. It is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US), in the European Union (EU), and in Japan. In Japan, lung cancer is ranked as the third most frequent cancer; approximately 113,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2012 and approximately 71,500 deaths in that year [ 3]. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase encoded on chromosome 2 and is primarily inv olved in developmental processes and expressed at low levels in adults [ 4]. The first genetic rearrangement of ALK seen in non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involved a fusion between the EML4 gene and the ALK tyrosine kinase domain (KD). EML4- ALK has the capacity to transform fibroblasts grown in culture and as subcutaneous xenografts to induce tumor formation [5]. Since then, a number of additional ALK fusion partners have been described in NSCLC that are believed to result in aberrant signaling and oncogenic transformation [ 6,7]. ALK rearrangements are more common among patients with adenocarcinoma histology, patients who have never smoked, and patients who have wild- type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and v- Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcom a viral oncogene homologue (KRAS) [4]. Estimates of the frequency of ALK rearrangement in the overall population of NSCLC patients range from 2% to 7% [ 8,9], which represent, based on proportionality of total populations in the US, EU, and Japan, approximately 7000 to 25,000 ALK+ NSCLC patients in the US, 11,000 to 39,000 patients in the EU, and 1900 to 6700 patients in Japan in 2016. In Japan, crizotinib, alectinib, ceritinib , and l orlatinib are approved for treatment of ALK -positive NSCLC as of September 2018. 4.1.2 Brigatinib Brigatinib (AP26113) is a novel, orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) discovered and developed by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ARIAD; Cambridge, Massachusetts), a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Primary targets are activated, mutant forms of ALK and c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), which play important roles in NSCLC and other cancers. A series of in vitro and in vivo studies has been performed to characterize the pharmacodynamic profile of brigatinib. These studies have demonstrated that brigatinib potently inhibits the in vitro activity of all tested secondary mutations in the ALK KD that confer resistance to crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib. No ALK mutations have been identified in in vitro mutagenesis assays that confer resistance to brigatinib at clinically achievable c oncentrations. Brigatinib also potently inhibits ROS1 and demonstrates activity against insulin- like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF -1R) and certain mutant variants of EGFR.

Crizotinib, al ectinib, and ceritinib are the oral ALK inhibitors approved in Japan for treatment of patients with metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC. Despite the high initial activity of ALK inhibitors, resistance inevitably develops in most patien ts. Analysis of tumor specimens collected at the time of acquired resi stance to the ALK inhi bitors has implicated multiple resistance mechanisms, including mutations in the ALK KD, increases in copy number of the rearranged ALK gene, and activation of ALK-independent bypass signaling pathways. Brigatinib is a novel, synthetic, orally active ALK TKI that is being developed to address the limitations of currently approved ALK inhib itors by maximizing selective inhibition of ALK-positive NSCLC cells through optimal binding to the ALK KD. Brigatinib received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Ad ministration (FDA) on 28 April 2017 with an indication for the treatment of patients with ALK positive metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. In Japan, crizotinib, alectinib, ceritinib, and lorlatinib are approved for treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC as of September 2018. In the Japanese Guideline [10], alectinib and cr izotinib are recommended as first-line treatment, and both alectinib and ceritinib are recommended as second-line ALK inhibito r treatments after crizotinib failu re, as of September 2017. However, after becoming refractory to alectin ib in both first- and second-lin e treatment, and refractory to ceritinib in second-line treatme nt, no molecular target ing agent is recommende d, and the treatment is limited to “1 st line treatment for non-s quamous cell carcinoma”. The current study is planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of brigatinib in Japanese patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC that has progr essed after prior ALK inhibitor therapy. In Japan, after the release of the J-ALEX study resu lts [11] and an amendment to the guideline, the first-line treatment of ALK+ positive patients shifted from crizotinib to alectinib rapidly. Crizotinib is still recommended in the guideli ne, and there are several patients who receive CCI Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subjnic fusionc fusi nib are thb are ALKLK--posp bly devey dev d resistaresi ing mutaing mu ation of tion o orally acrally a oved ALKved AL ls througs throu y the US he U atment otmen nt to crizto cr otinib, aotinib, of Septof Se ended anded ndd--line Aline fter becoter bec ceritiniceritin is limiss of Use bject to the applicable Terms"

On the basis of Japanese clinical practice, and to achieve a homogeneous population to assess the efficacy of brigatinib in patients who have progressed on ale ctinib, the main cohort in this study for efficacy evaluation is defined as patients who have progressed after treatment with alectinib (with or without previous treatment with crizotinib). Taking the current medical practice in Japan into consideration, there are treatment sequences available other than the above (such as the inclusion of ceritinib); therefore, patients will also be enrolled in a subcohort to accumulate clinical data for a preliminary assessment of efficacy in these populations. The patien ts in the subcohort will not be included in the main efficacy analysis but will be included in a secondary analysis of efficacy and primary safety assessments. Although treatment for ALK+ NSCLC can be highly effective by implementing the ALK -TKI, most patients with ALK+ NSCLC treated with first -line treatment will eventually relapse. Brain metastasis to the central nervous system occurs in almost half of patients, which can have a negative impact on quality of life of the patients . Patients with ALK+ NSCLC after first- line failure are available for other ALK -TKI. However disease progression has been appeared in re-treating patients as a second -line treatment within 1 year. Several secondary mutat ions of ALK kinase domain that ar e associated with clinical tolerance to crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib have been identified, and those mutations lead to treatment failure of ALK- TKI. For treatment of 1L, there is a need for a more potent ALK inhibitor that extends the PFS and that has adequate CNS penetration with robust intracranial responses compared with existing treatment. Although crizotinib is an effective treatment for ALK+ NSCLC, almost half of ALK+ NSCLC patients in the pivotal trials that supported its accelerated approval fai led to achieve a response. PFS was relatively short in the 2 randomized phase 3 trials, with a median duration of 7.7 to 10.9 months. Chemotherapy is also used although it is not specifically approved for use in ALK+ NSCLC patients, with median PFS duration of 7.0 months with first line platinum doublet chemotherapy. Building on the strong efficacy results observed in the post- crizotinib setting, newer ALK inhibitors have recently been examined in previously untreated ALK+ NSCLC, resulting in FDA approval of alectinib [ 12,13] as first-line treatments in this population, and shifting the standard of care. For alectinib , clinically meaningful improvements in PFS were noted in the first-line setting when compared with crizotinib in the global, head- to-head ALEX study, with a median PFS (by IRC) of 25.7 months versus 10.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.53) [ 13,14 ] consistent results were also observed in a similar study (J- ALEX) in previously untreated Japanese patients [ 11]. In addition, alectinib was better tolerated than crizotinib, with an improved safety profile. Nonetheless, th ere are risks with alectinib, including severe hepatic and renal toxicity, as well as other class effects (ie, interstitial lung disease [ILD] and bradycardia). Alectinib is also approved as first line treatment in Japan for ALK+ NSCLC. New therapies are needed to improve response rates, provide greater durability of response, and to overcome potential mechanisms of resistance to ALK -targeted therapy, including the emergence of secondary resistance mutations in ALK and progression in the CNS. Such a new therapeutic option could result in significant prognostic improvement in ALK+ NSCLC patients. Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

In order to evaluate efficacy and safety of brigatinib in Japanese patients with ALK+ NSCLC who are naïve to ALK- TKI thera py, an expansion cohort in patients naïve to ALK- TKI treatment was added to the ongoing B rigatinib -2001. 4.2.1 Rationale for Dose In this study, brigatinib will be administered as an oral single agent at 180 mg QD with a 7 -day lead-in at 90 mg QD (90 mg QD→180 m g QD). This dose/schedule is the same used in the ALTA study, and is the approved dosage in the US. The ALTA study showed that the benefit -risk profile of the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD regimen was improved over that of 90 mg QD. In a Western clinical pharmacology study (AP26113-13- 102), Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects had comparable systemic exposure of brigatinib with a single dose of 90 mg, 120 mg, or 180 mg, supporting extrapolation of the Western safety and efficacy experience to define the recommended phase 2 dose of brigatinib in Japanese patients for evaluation in this study. The safety and tolerability of the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD regimen will be confirmed in patients enrolled at a limited number of study sites before expanding to all sites in this stu dy. The safety evaluation lead- in part is incorporated to confirm the safety and tolerability of this dose regimen. Patients will be enrolled in this safety evaluation lead -in part until 9 dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) -evaluable patients are accrued. Patien ts will be hospitalized during Cycle 1 ( Days 1 -10 and Days 22-23), and their condition will be closely monitored for safety and assessment of DLTs. Serial blood samples will be also collected for intensive PK evaluation in these patients. For patients in the TKI-naïve expansion cohort, the overseas study ALTA -1L in patients untreated with TKIs including ALK inhibitors demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the primary endpoint PFS assessed by the BIRC in the brigatinib group ( 90 mg QD→180 mg QD) compared to the crizotinib group ( 250 mg BID) as well as obvious improvements in the following secondary endpoints: DOR, iORR and iPFS. ORR assessed by the BIRC was numerically better in the brigatinib group than in the crizotinib group. The subgroup analysis in Asians also demonstrated consistently clear benefits in the brigatinib group relative to the crizotinib group. The efficacy of brigatinib 90 mg QD→180 mg QD in TKI -naïve Japanese patients is expected to be comparable to that seen in S tudy ALTA -1L.

The study consists of the safety evaluation lead-in part and the expansion part. The safety evaluation lead- in part allows patients with any line of prior ALK inhibitor which includes treatment-naïve patients; however, ALK inhibitor- naïve patients may be enroll ed after the confirmation of first 3 DLT evaluable patients to have no more than 1 DLT during Cycle 1 by investigator's judgement. The expansion part consists of the TKI -naïve expansion cohort and the refractory expansion part, and the refractory expansion part includes the main cohor t and a subcohort based on prior ALK inhibitor treatment. The TKI -naïve expansion cohort includes the patients who have not received any prior TKI including ALK inhibitor. In this cohort, the efficacy will be evaluated, and total of 32 patients will be enr olled. The main cohort of the refractory expansion part includes patients who had previously received alectinib (as their only ALK inhibitor) or both alectinib and crizotinib (regardless the sequence of those 2 ALK inhibitors). The main cohort of the r efractory expansion part will be used for the primary analysis of efficacy, and a total of 47 patients will be enrolled in the main cohort of the refractory e xpansion part . Patients with all other sequences of up to 2 prior ALK inhibitor(s) may be included in the subcohort of the refractory expansion part. Such other ALK inhibitors include 1) crizotinib only, 2) ceritinib only, 3) lorlatinib only, 4) both crizotinib and ceritinib, 5) both alectinib and ceritinib, 6) both crizotinib and lorlatinib, 7) both alectinib and lorlatinib, and 8) both ceritinib and lorlatinib. Up to 20 patients will be enrolled in the subcohort of the refractory e xpansion part . In this study, brigatinib will be administered at 90 mg QD for the first 7 days and then 180 mg QD (90 mg QD→180 mg QD). In the safety evaluation lead -in part, patient s will be monitored for intensive PK, and the tolerability of 90 mg QD→180 mg QD dosing will be confirmed. If the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD dosing regimen is considered tolerable, additional patients enrolled in the expansion part will be treated with the same do sing schedule (90 mg QD→180 mg QD). For t he TKI -naïve expansion cohort, 32 patients will be enrolled and12 month PFS rate will be evaluated as the primary endpoint. The primary analy sis will be performed at around 10 months after the enrollment of the last subject in TKI -naïve expansion cohort. The sample size an d evaluation timing may be adjust ed based on results of second interim analysis of ALTA -1L study, and actual enrollment period of the TKI -naïve expansion cohort. For the main cohort of the refractory expansion part , there are 2 stages: the first 29 patients in the main cohort are included in Stage 1, and further patients will be continuously enrolled into Stage 2. An interim analysis for futility and efficacy will be performed in the Stage 1 population when the first 29 post-alectinib patients have had the opportunity to complete at least 3 postbaseline scans (ie, after the Cycle 7 Day 1 disease assessment). Enrollment will not be suspended during evaluation of those 29 patients. Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

A patient is considered to be enrolled in the study when the first dose of brigatinib is administered. Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 [ 15]. Response evaluation per RECIST version 1.1 will be done by both the investigator and an IRC. The primary analys is will performed on the results from the IRC. Patients will be treated until they experience objective progressive disease (PD) per RECIST version 1.1, as assessed by the investigator, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation for any other reason. Treatment of patients with brigatinib may be continued at the tolerated dose level, despite investigator-assessed PD by RECIST version 1.1, if the patient otherwise has evidence of ongoing clinical benefit.

The patients in the safety evaluation lead -in part will receive brigatinib 90 mg QD→180 mg QD. A cycle of therapy comprises 28 days of treatment. If a patient is NOT considered DLT evaluabl e for any reason, the patient will be replaced . DLTs are defined in Section 8.2. Tolerability of the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD schedule will be determined on the basis of the DLTs observed in Cycle 1. If a DLT is observed in fewer than 3 of the 9 DLT- evaluable patients in the safety evaluation lead -in part, the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD regimen will be used for the patients enrolled in the expansion part. Further details on the dose expansion rules are described in Section 8.3. Expansion Part ( Refractory Expansion Part and TKI -Naïve Expansion Cohort) Patients in the refractory expansion part and the TKI-naïve expansion cohort may be managed on an outpatient basis, and the number of study sites will be increased up to approximately 40. Patients in the refractory expansion part and the TKI-naïve expansion cohort will undergo less-intensive PK blood sampling than patients in the safety evaluation lead- in part. On an outpatient basis , patients will visit the hospital on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, and then on Day 1 of each cycle after C ycle 2. Tumor assessment will be performed every 2 cycles from Cycle 3 Day 1 through Cycle 15 Day 1, then every 3 cycles thereafter until the last dose of study drug. For patients who discontinue study treatment in the absence of PD, additional tumor assessment should continue at the same time points as the study treatment until PD or the start of another systemic anticancer therapy. 6.2 Number of Patients Approximately 110 patients ( approximately 9 patients in the safety evaluation lead -in part, 32 patients in the TKI-naïve expansion cohort, 47 patients in the main cohort of the refractory expansion part and up to 20 in the subcohort of the refractory e xpansion part ) will be enrolled in this study at approximately 40 study sites in Japan.

A cycle of therapy will comprise 28 days of treatment. Patient s will take the prescribed dose with water (recommended approximately 240 mL). Brigatinib can be administered with or without food. Patients who forget to take their scheduled dose of brigatinib should be instructed not to make up the missed dose. A missed dose is defined as a dose not taken within 12 hours of the intended scheduled administration. Missed doses should be recorded in an appropriate source record (eg, clinic chart), patient diary card, and study drug administration electronic case report form (eCRF). 8.2 Definitions of DLT Toxicity will be e valuated according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03, effective 14 June 2010 [ 15]. DLT evaluation applies only to the first 9 DLT- evaluable patients in the safety evaluation lead -in part. DLTs will be defined as any of the following events occurring within the first 28 days of treatment (end of Cycle 1) that are considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to therapy with brigatinib (note that adverse events [AEs] for which the relationship to study drug cannot be ruled out should be considered possibly related to study drug): • Nonhematologic toxicities include any nonhematologic toxicity Grade ≥3 with the following exceptions : – Self-limiting or medically controllable toxicities (ie, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and electrolyte disturbances) lasting ≤3 days. – Isolate d asymptomatic Grade ≥3 laboratory abnormalities that resolve to Grade ≤1 or baseline in ≤7 days. • Hematologic toxicities: – Febrile neutropenia not related to underlying disease (ANC <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of >38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for more than 1 hour). – Prolonged (>7 days) Grade 4 neutropenia ( if granulocyte -colony stimulating factor [G-CSF] is used, the event will be considered as DLT irrespective of the duration). – Neutropenic infection: Grade ≥3 neutropenia with Grade ≥3 i nfection. – Thrombocytopenia Grade ≥3 with bleeding, Grade ≥3 requiring platelet transfusion, or Grade 4 lasting >7 days. – Anemia Grade ≥3 requiring blood transfusion.

Note: In case of G rade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis in the first 7 days, before escalation to 180 mg QD: 1) If the event does not resolve within 14 days (ie, the patient miss es 14 or more doses of brigatinib), th en the events will be considered as a DLT. 2) If the event resolves within 14 days and the administration of brigatinib can be resumed before 14 missed doses, then the patient will be considered DLT nonevaluable in condition that the patient does not have any other events qualifying as DLTs later. In case that the event resolves within 14 days but the patient does not resume brigatinib based on investigator's judgmen t or patient’s request, those patients will also be considered DLT nonevaluable. (See Table 8.b for detail of dose modification based on ILD/pneumonitis.) Although the above toxicities may occur at any point during treatment, these toxicities are considere d DLTs only if they occur during Cycle 1 of treatment, in which case, they will influence decisions regarding opening the expansion part. Patients will be monitored through all cycles of therapy for treatment -related toxicities. DLT -evaluable patients must complete at least 75% (ie, 3,307.5 mg of 4,410 mg in 28 days of Cycle 1) of their planned cumulative doses, unless missed doses are due to related AEs. DLT -nonevaluable patients in the safety evaluation part of the study will be replaced. The timing of adding patients for DLT evaluation may be decided with advice from the chairperson of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), if needed . 8.3 Patient Expansion A fter the Safety Evaluation Lead -in Part If a DLT is observed in fewer than 3 patients in the 9 DLT -evaluable patients of the safety evaluation lead-in part, the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD regimen will be used in the patients enrolled in the expansion part. Opening of the expansion part will be determined on the basis of the total safety data available at that time, available PK results, and with recommendation from the IDMC. Regarding the safety data, all AEs observed in the safety evaluation lead -in part, including those observed in DLT non- evaluable patients, will be evaluated in concert with DLTs whe n making the decision on opening of the expansion part. If a DLT is observed in 3 or more patients of the 9 DLT -evaluable patients, the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD dose regimen will NOT be considered tolerable. If 3 DLT cases are confirmed before completion of enrolling 9 DLT- evaluable cases, the enrollment of subsequent patients may be halted. If the dose of 90 mg QD→180 mg QD is NOT considered tolerable, the dose for subsequent patients will be selected on the basis of the toxicity observed and available PK data in the 9 DLT -evaluable patients. This will require a protocol amendment and possibly changes to the inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or modification of the dose regimen.

Hormonal contraception is not allowed. • Use of any other investigational drug or device. • Extensive surgery requiring in- patient care (patients may have an interruption in therapy for 14 days should emergency surgery be required). If a patient’s clinical condition requires treatment with one of the prohibited classes of medications specified above, the clinical details of the situation should be discussed with the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee) as so on as possible to determine whether it is safe for the patient to continue treatment with brigatinib. On the basis of the metabolism of brigatinib being primarily via CYP3A and the results of clinical drug- drug interaction (DDI) studies in healthy subjects , the following should be followed: • Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors (see Appendix F ). Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib and should be avoided. • Avoid the concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers with brigatinib (see Appendix F ). 8.6 Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures Palliative therapy and supportive care are permitted during the study for management of symptoms and underlying medical conditions that may develop during the study. Once a patient has begun treatment, a condition may arise that requires the initiation of a new concomitant medication or therapy. Patients with CNS lesions requiring local radiotherapy such as SRS or WBRT are allowed to continue study drug after appropriate interruption, as determined by the investigator with sponsor agreement; however, for analysis purposes, these patients will be considered to have PD. 8.7 Precautions and Restrictions It is not known what effects brigatinib has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or fetus; therefore, female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner.

Female patients must meet 1 of the following: • Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR • Surgically sterile, OR • If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 highly effective non -hormonal method (eg, intrauterine device [IUD]) with a condom, which is an effective barrier method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing of the informed consent form (ICF) through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, OR • Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient, from the time of signing the informed consent through 4 months after that last dose of study drug. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.) Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to 1 of the following: • Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 month after the last dose of study drug, OR • Agree to prac tice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient, during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after that last dose of study drug.

Female and male condoms should not be used together.) 8.8 Management of Clinical Events 8.8.1 ILD/Pneumonitis During early clinical development of brigatinib, moderate and severe pulmonary AEs (eg, dyspnea, hypoxia, cough, pneumonia, and pneumonitis) were observed early after initiation of the drug in a subset of patients. To better characterize early pulmonary AE s observed with brigatinib treatment, a strategy for systematic analysis of these events according to a case definition for EOPE was developed. In Study AP26113-11-101, pulmonary events occurring within the first 7 days of treatment with brigatinib, consis tent in some cases with pneumonitis, were observed shortly after treatment initiation in 2% of patients who had received brigatinib at a starting dose of 90 mg QD (including patients who escalated to 180 mg QD after 7 days). No such events were observed in the 7 days after escalation to 180 mg QD. In Study AP26113-13-201, of 219 treated patients, 4 cases were determined to meet the criteria for definite EOPE, and 10 cases met the criteria for possible EOPE. In total, 6.4% of patients had an event that was a t least possibly an EOPE. All EOPEs occurred at a dose of 90 mg QD, regardless of dose group (ie, within the first 7 days of treatment in Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

No EOPEs were identified after escalation to 180 mg QD in the 90 mg QD→180 mg QD d ose group. Pulmonary symptoms have been observed after a single dose of brigatinib in some patients. The pulmonary symptoms are associated in more severe cases with hypoxia and chest CT findings of ground glass opacities consistent with pneumonitis. These events have been managed with treatment interruption and medical management as clinically indicated (eg, steroids, antibiotics). Most events resolved with interruption or discontinuation of brigatinib. Two fatal pulmonary events (hypoxia and pneumonia) and 1 fatal pulmonary event (pneumonia) starting within the first 7 days of treatment were observed in Studies AP26113-11- 101 and AP26113-13- 201, respectively. Upon resumption of dosing, some patients had events recur, and others did not have recurrence with continued dosing. As such, investigators and patients must be aware that pneumonitis- like events may present as early as 24 to 48 hours after initial dosing. Later -onset pneumonitis has also occurred in the brigatinib development program. Pulmonary events occurring after initiation of brigatinib treatment including, but not limited to, dyspnea, hypoxia, dry cough, chest tightness, and presumptive lung infection (pneumonia) should be monitored and reported. To reiterate, some events occur after a single dose of brigatinib, and physicians should be aware of this possibility and discuss it with patients. Newly developed or worsening of pulmonary symptoms in the first week of study drug administration, specifically with hypoxia and ground glass opacity on radiographic imaging indicative of ILD or pneumonitis, could suggest a relationship to brigatinib. Other etiologies, including pulmonary embolism and infectious pneumonia, should be ruled out if possible. If no evidence of other etiology is identified, a causal relationship to brigatinib should be considered. The management of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms after initiation of brigatinib treatment should include drug interruption; monitoring of oxygen saturation and biomarkers (Serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 [ KL-6] and surfactant protein -D [SP -D]); thoracentesis, bronchoscopy, open lung biopsy, chest x-ray, or CT; and appropriate work up for infectious or other etiology, with high-dose corticosteroids, supplemental oxygen therapy, and empiric antibiotics as indicated. After drug interruption and workup of symptoms, dose modification should be accomplished according to the recommendations in Table 8.b. 8.8.2 Hypert ension Blood pressure should be monitored and recorded at each visit. Hypertension detected by at least 2 blood pressure measurements should be graded according to NCI CTCAE, version 4.03, which defines hypertension as a disorder characterized by a pathological i ncrease in blood pressure: a repeated elevation in the blood pressure exceeding 140 mmHg for systolic and exceeding 90 mmHg for diastolic. For patients who either develop hypertension or experience worsening hypertension during treatment with study drug, a t the discretion of the investigator, aggressive antihypertensive medication should be initiated or optimized to achieve target blood pressure Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

If Grade 3 or Grade 4 hypertension develops, dose interr uption and reduction is recommended according to Table 8.b. 8.8.3 Bradycardia Heart rate should be monitored and recorded at each visit. Brigatinib should be avoided in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia (eg, beta -blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine, and digoxin) to the extent possible. For symptomatic bradycardia, dose interruption and reduction is recommended according to Table 8.b. 8.8.4 Nausea and Emesis Nausea should be treated with standard -of-care antiemetics. Prophylactic antiemetics may be used. 8.8.5 Visual Disturbance In patients with new onset or worsening severe (Grade ≥ 3) visual disturbance, ophthalmological evaluation is recommended. Visual disturbance should be managed as described in Table 8.b. 8.8.6 Diarrhea For Grade 1 diarrhea, symptomatic care such as loperamide may be given, or no intervention may be undertaken, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment. For Grade 2 diarrhea, administer loperamide until the patient is symptom-free for 12 hours. No dose modifi cation is necessary unless the patient does not tolerate brigatinib or the symptom recurs. For Grade ≥3 despite loperamide, treatment should be interrupted or permanently discontinued according to Table 8.b. Secondary prophylaxis in patients who have experienced diarrhea with brigatinib treatment is allowed. Other medications and supportive care may be added according to the institution’s standard of care. 8.9 Blinding and Unblinding This is an open -label study. 8.10 Description of Investigational Agents Brigatinib drug product is supplied as film-coated tablets containing 30, 90 , or 180 mg of brigatinib active pharmaceutical ingredient.

If advertisements become part of the recruitment strategy, they will be reviewed by the institutional review board (IRB). 9.3 Treatment Group Assignments After written informed consent has been obtained, the patient will be assigned a pat ient identification code. Patient eligibility will be confirmed by the sponsor ’s project clinician (or designee) before enrollment by the investigator into the study. Reenrollment of the same patient will not be permitted. If a patient is discontinued from the study, that patient identification code will not be reused. The first 9 patients will be enrolled in the safety evaluation lead -in part. Enrollment will be interrupted after the ninth potentially DLT -evaluable patient is enrolled until the DLTs are assessed. After the decision to open the expansion part, pati ent enrollment will be resumed. Patients in the expansion part will be assigned to the refractory expansion cohort (including the main cohort or the subcohort) or TKI -naïve expansion cohort at enro llment on the basis of prior ALK inhibitor treatment. 9.4 Study Procedures Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits over the following study periods: screening, treatment, EOT, and follow -up. This protocol generally presents scheduled timelines for study procedures by abbreviated references to cycle (C) and day (D) relative to the date of the first dose of study treatment (defined as C1D1). The ICF may be signed more than 21 days before C1D1. Screening assessments must be performed within 14 days before C1D1, with the exception of tumor imaging assessment, for which the allowable window is 21 days before C1D1. However, whenever feasible, baseline imaging should be performed as close as possible to C1D1. Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"
58,page_58,"Brigatinib Study No. Brigatinib -2001 Page 58 of 118 Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 0 4 22 July 2020 Vital signs should be repeated on C1D1 before the fir st dose, regardless of the time from screening. Physical examination, ECOG performance status assessments, hematology, chemistry, insulin, testosterone (male patients only), and pregnancy test assessments do not need to be repeated on C1D1 if they were performed for screening within 7 days before C1D1 and, in the opinion of the investigator, there is no reason to believe they have substantially changed. If screening laboratory assessments need to be repeated on C1D1, they should be obtained before starting treatment. In the safety evaluation l ead-in part, patients will be hospitalized during Cycle 1 in general. If a patient wishes to return home temporarily and the investigator confirms that the patient’s symptoms are stable on the basis of the available data, then the patient may return home temporarily except on Days 1 through 10 and Days 22 and 23, provided this does not interfere with the study assessments. The investigator must document the confirmation record for stabilization of the patien t’s symptoms per the available data in an appropriate source record (eg, medical records) before the patient’s temporary leave. Refer to the Schedule of Events ( Appendix A ) for the timing of assessments. Refer to Table B for Cycle 1 of the safety evaluation lead- in part; for all other cycles of the safety evaluation lead -in part, refer to Table A . The timing of PK assessments is specified in Table C (safety evaluation lead-in part) and Table D (expansion part). Additional details are provided as necessary in the sections that follow. 9.4.1 Informed Consent Each patient must provide written informed consent before any study- required procedures are conducted, unless those procedures are performed as part of the patient’s standard care. 9.4.2 Patient Demographics Demographic information will be obtained at screening and will consist of the date of birth, sex, race, and smoking history. 9.4.3 Medical History Medical/Surgical History A complete medical history will be taken at screening. Information to be documented includes relevant past illnesses, including other cancers, ongoing medical conditions, and surgical procedures (not related to the primary diagnosis). Diagnosis and Cancer History The initial cancer diagnosis and the current cancer stage at the time of screening, along with tumor histology, and all sites of primary and metastatic disease, should be recorded. Prior Cancer Therapy Prior cancer therapy history will be taken at screening and will include cancer -related surgical procedures, radiation, and systemic therapies. Surgical procedures include curative, palliative, and diagnostic procedures (eg, biopsy). Radiation will include both definitive and palliative treatment.

Experimental or investigational therapy history must also be recorded. ALK Mutation Status Regarding current and past ALK mutation history, any previously identified mutations and the dates of identification must be recorded at screening. This includes ALK rearrangements by FISH, ALK abnormalities by other methods including immunohistochemistry, and ALK point mutations. Patients entering the study either must have a history of a positive result from the Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit, the Nichirei Histofine RALK iAEP Kit, the Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay or DNA/RNA sequencing ( except for the patients in TKI-naïve expansion cohort), or must submit tissue samples for analysis using a local regulatory authority- approved test. Specifications for handling and processing of tissue for this test are described in Section 9.4.17.1 and in the Study Manual. 9.4.4 Physical Examination A complete physical examination must be performed at screening, the extent of which should be consistent with medical history and the patient’s underlying disease. Subsequent physical examinations as described in the Schedu le of Events may be directed to relevant findings. Of note, because of adverse reactions reported during treatment with brigatinib, investigators are cautioned to monitor patients for signs of vision dysfunction. For new or worsening severe vision disorders, an ophthalmological evaluation should be performed. If new or worsening of vision disorder is suspected, investigators should consult and ophthalmologist, and ophthalmological evaluation should be performed as needed. The EOT physical examination should be a complete physical examination. 9.4.5 Height and Weight Height and weight will be measured during screening only (within 14 days before C1D1). 9.4.6 Vital Signs Vital signs include temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, SpO 2, and blood pressure (when patient is seated). Vital signs should be repeated on C1D1, before the first dose, regardless of the time from screening. Vital signs will also be assessed per the Schedule of Events throughout the study. 9.4.7 ECOG Performance Status The patient’s performance status must be assessed using the ECOG performance scale during screening.

See Section 8.8.1 for the management of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms. 9.4.9 Pregnancy Test The pregnancy test must be a human chorionic gonadotropin test, and either urine or serum can be used. A serum pregnancy test must be performed within 7 days before the first dose of study drug in women of childbearing potential at screening. Women of childbearing potential will be defined as sexually mature females who meet the following criteria: • Those who have not undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, and • Those who have not had natural menopause for 12 consecutive months or longer. Note that a loss of menopausal periods following chemotherapy may not rule out childbearing potential. The results from these t ests must be available and negative before the first dose of study drug is administered. If C1D1 serum pregnancy results will not be available before dosing, a urine pregnancy test may be performed. Women of childbearing potential at study start must also complete the pregnancy test at the EOT visit. Pregnancy test is to be done by the local laboratory. Results or status from this test will be recorded on eCRFs. 9.4.10 Concomitant Medications and Procedures Concomitant medications for all ongoing medical history c onditions or AEs, and prophylactic treatments and supplements must be recorded in the eCRF from the date the informed consent is signed until at least 30 days after the last dose of brigatinib or initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapies (whichever comes first ). 9.4.11 AEs Monitoring of AEs, serious and nonserious, will be conducted throughout the study as specified in the Schedule of Events. Refer to Section 10.0 for details regarding definitions, documentation, and reporting of pretreatment events, AEs, and serious adverse events ( SAEs ). 9.4.12 Study Enrollment A patient is considered to be enrolled in the study when the first dose of brigatinib has been administered.

The C1D1 ECG should be performed before the first dose of brigatinib. Additional ECGs may be performed at the investigator’s discretion to ensure patient safety. In particular, ECG monitoring should be performed during the study if a patient has been prescribed medication that can prolong the QT interval or medication that can potentially alter the QT interval (other than medications explicitly prohibited). The uncorrected QT interval and the QT interval corrected by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) will be record ed on eCRFs. For consistency, the Fridericia correction (QTcF=QT interval/(RR) 1/3 interval) method must be used for all calculations of heart rate –corrected QT (calculated) (QTc) intervals. When the timing of a PK, biomarker, or safety laboratory blood sam ple collection coincides with the timing of ECG measurements, the ECG will be completed before the blood sample collection , if possible. In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat an ECG to rule out improper lead placement contributing to the ECG abnormality. ECGs should be reviewed by the investigator or delegate before the patient leaves the clinic on visit days. 9.4.14 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed locally. Handling and shipment of clinical laboratory samples will be outlined i n the Study Manual. Serum insulin, testosterone (male patients only), KL -6, and SP -D are to be performed by a central laboratory, including labs obtained at unscheduled visits, whenever possible. All central laboratory results will be provided to the investigator. Laboratory tests to establish eligibility must be done within 14 days before C1D1 ( Appendix A ). 9.4.14.1 Hematology and Chemistry Blood samples for analysis of parameters shown in Table 9.a will be obtained as specified in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix A ). C1D1 hematology and chemistry blood draws should be performed before the first dose of brigatinib. All scheduled chemistry blood draws should be performed in a fasting state.

All evaluations of KL -6 and SP- D, including for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms, must be performed centrally. See Section 8.8.1 for the management of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms. 9.4.15 Hepatitis Testing Hepatitis testing will be performed and interpreted locally during the screening period. HBsAg should be checked for hepatitis B virus (HBV), and if negative, patients can be enrolled. For patients who are HBsAb and/or HBcAb positive, HBV DNA will also be assessed at screening. Hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb) should be checked for HCV. Patients who test positive for HCVAb will also be tested for HCV RNA at screening. Note that patients who have negative HBsAg but are known to be HBcAb and/or HBsAb positive may be enrolled but must have an undetectable HBV viral load. Patients who have a positive HCVAb can be enrolled but must have an undetectable HCV viral load. Patients who are HBsAg negative but HBsAb and/or HBcAb positive, and/or HCVAb positive with a negative viral load at screening, will be monitored by assessment of viral load (DNA titers for HBV, RNA titers for HCV) every 3 months. 9.4.16 Disease Assessment At screening, disease assessment must incl ude imaging of the chest, abdomen (covering adrenal glands) and pelvis , using appropriate radiological procedures (CT scans or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] with contrast, unless contrast media is contraindicated). Contrast- enhanced MRI of the brain (such as gadolinium) is required at screening for all patients. If contrast for MRI is contraindicated, use CT with contrast. All radiographic images (eg, CT scan, MRI) performed during the study will be submitted to the IRC. Details regarding the collection and transmission of images can be found in the Study Manual. Patients must have at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST version 1.1. Previously irradiated lesions may not be used for target lesions, unless there is unambiguous radiological progression afte r radiotherapy. Brain lesions may be used as target lesions provided they are ≥10 mm and have not been 1) previously treated with WBRT within 3 months, or 2) previously treated by SRS or surgical resection. Disease assessment by CT or MRI scans will be performed for all patients at screening, every 2 cycles (8 weeks) from C3D1 (± 7 days) through C15D1, and every 3 cycles ( 12 weeks ) thereafter until EOT. Imaging of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and brain will occur at each assessment for all patients (with or without brain metastasis at screening in the expansion cohort) . More -frequent imaging is recommended at any time, if clinically indicated; confirmation of CR or PR can be performed at least 4 weeks after initial response. Imaging assessment will also be performed at the EOT visit if more than 4 weeks have passed since the last imaging assessment. The same imaging modality at the same institution should be used at each assessment, if possible. SD can be evaluated at least 8 weeks after initia tion of study drug administration (considering the allowance of the e valuation, Day 50 since C1D1 as the earliest).

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug. An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline. 10.1.3 SAE Defi nition SAE means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death. • Is life -threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caus ed death if it were more severe). • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization (see clarification in the paragraph in Section 10.2 on planned hospitalizations). • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.) • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defe ct. • Is a medically important event. This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, on the basis of appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

In this study, intensity for each AE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined using the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03, effective date 14 Ju ne 2010 [15]. Clarifica tion should be made between an SAE and an AE that is considered seve re in intensity (Grade 3 or Grade 4) because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the ev ent itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above and is us ually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or ab ility to function. A severe AE (Grade 3 or Grade 4) does not necessarily need to be considered seri ous. For example, a wh ite blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000/mm3 is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensity) serv es as a guide for defining re gulatory report ing obligations. 10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or in response to an open question from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other di agnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (s ee Section 10.3 for the pe riod of observation). Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory asse ssments or other clinical finding is c onsidered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indi cating a common underlying pathology should be noted as a single comprehensive event. Regardless of causality, SAEs and serious pretreatme nt events (as defined in Section 10.1) must be reported (see Section 10.3 for the period of observation) by the inve stigator to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance department or designee (contact information provided below). This should be done by faxing the SAE Form within 24 hours after becoming aware of the event. The SAE Form, created specifically by Takeda, wi ll be provided to each clinical study site. A sample of the SAE Form may be found in the Study Manual. Fo llow-up information on the SAE or serious pretreatment event may be request ed by Takeda.

Severity (toxicity grade) for each AE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined using the NCI CTCAE, ve rsion 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 [ 15]. Relationship of the event to study drug administration (ie, its causality) will be determined by the investigator responding yes (related) or no (unrelated) to this question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with the study drug? If ILD (rega rdless of causality and grade) occurs from the first of study drug through 30 days after administration of the last dose of study drug, or initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy (whichever comes first), it should be recorded as an SAE. The SAE Form should be completed and reported as described above. Images used for evaluating the clinical course of ILD (eg, chest CT, chest x -ray) should be submitted to the sponsor promptly. The sponsor may request additional images as needed. Refer the Study Manua l for instructions for submitting images. 10.3 Monitoring of AEs and Period of Observation AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be monitored throughout the study as follows: • AEs will be reported from the signing of informed consent through 30 days after admin istration of the last dose of study drug or initiation of the subsequent anti cancer therapies (whichever comes first ) and recorded in the eCRFs. • SAEs – Serious pretreatment events will be reported to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance department or designee from the time of the signing of the ICF up to first dose of study drug, and will also be recorded in the eCRF. – Related and unrelated treatment -emergent SAEs will be reported to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance department or designee from the first dose of study drug through 30 days after administration of the last dose of study drug or initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy (whichever comes first) and recorded in the eCRF. After this period, only related SAEs must be reported to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance department or designee. – SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es). 10.4 Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform the investigator immediately and permanently discontinue study drug.

The rationale for the 15% response rate for the alectinib (with or without crizotinib) pretreated population is based on the consideration that compared with crizotinib, patients who have failed alectinib are less likely to respond to subsequent therapy because of alectinib’s greater potency and better coverage of ALK mutations compared with crizotinib. A sample size of 47 patients in the post -alectinib population of the refractory expansion part with the stopping rule mentioned in Section 13.2 will allow the study to have more than 90% power to rule out a threshold response rate when the true ORR is expected or higher than 35% with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, according to the H1-minimax design in Englert [ 16]. The number of patients in the subcohort of the refractory expansion part (ie, patients previously treated with crizotinib only, ceritinib only, lorlatinib only, both crizotinib and ceritinib, both alectinib and ceritinib, both crizotinib and lorlatinib, both alectinib and lorlatinib, or both ceritinib and lorlatinib) will be limited to 20.

The sample size in the TKI-naïve expansion cohort was determined to allow confirmation that the true 12 months PFS rate (expected response rate) is greater than the threshold of 42.6% (estimated PFS rate at 12 months in Kaplan -Meier plots observed in ALTA -1L Crizotinib arm) for TKI -naïve patients. A sample size of 32 patients in the TKI -naïve expansion cohort will allow the study to have approximately 80% power to rule out the threshold rate (42.6%) when the true 12 months PFS rate is expected or higher than 66.5% (estimated PFS rate at 12 months in Kaplan- Meier plots observed in ALTA -1L B rigatinib arm) with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.05, considering 10% patients will discontinue the study follow-up before the 12 months milestone due to reasons other than disease progression assessed by IRC or death, and 8 months enrollment period.

All aspects of the study and its documentation will be subject to review by the sponsor or designee, including the Investigator’s Binder, study medication, subject medical records, informed consent documentation, and review of eCRFs and associated source documents. It is important that the investigator and other study personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that sufficie nt time is devoted to the process. 14.2 Protocol Deviations The investigator can deviate and change from the protocol for any medically unavoidable reason, for example, to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects, without a prior written agreement with the sponsor or a prior approval from IRB. In the event of a deviation or change, the principal investigator should notify the sponsor and the head of the site of the deviation or change as well as its reason in a written form, and then retain a copy of the written form. When necessary, the principal investigator may consult and agree with the sponsor on a protocol amendment. If the protocol amendment is appropriate, the amendment proposal should be submitted to the head of the site as soon as possible and an approval from IRB should be obtained. The investigator should document all protocol deviations. Significant deviations should be recorded on the eCRFs and then confirmed by the sponsor or its designee. Significant deviations include, but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or misconduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study assessment. 14.3 Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections The study site also may be subject to quality assurance audits by the sponsor or designees. In this circumstance, the sponsor-designated auditor will contact the site in advance to arrange an auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilities where laboratory samples are collected, where the medication is stored and prepared, and any other facility used during the study. In addition, there is the possibility that this study may be inspected by regulatory agencies, including those of foreign governments (eg, the US FDA, the United Kingdom Medicines and He althcare products Regulatory Agency [MHRA] , the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan [PMDA] ). If the study site is contacted for an inspection by a regulatory body, the sponsor should be notified immediately. The investigator and the head of the study site guarantee access for quality assurance auditors to all study documents as described in Section 14.1.

Each investigator will conduct the study according to applicable local or regional regulatory requirements and align his or her conduct in accordance with the “Responsibilities of the Investigator” that are listed in Appendix B . The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing requirements for informed consent and investigator responsibilities. 15.1 IRB Approva l IRBs must be constituted according to the applicable local requirements of each participating region. The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names and titles of members who make up the respective IRB. If any member of the IRB has direct participation in this study, written notification regarding his or her abstinence from voting must also be obtained. The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submission to the respective IRB for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure, a copy of the ICF, and, if applicable, subject recruitment materials and/or adve rtisements and other documents required by all applicable laws and regulations, must be submitted to a central or local IRB for approval. The IRB’s written approval of the protocol and subject informed consent must be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before commencement of the study (ie, before signing a contract for the clinical study ). The IRB approval must refer to the study by exact protocol title, number, and version date; identify versions of other documents (eg, ICF) reviewed; and state the approval date. The sponsor will notify site once the sponsor has confirmed the adequacy of site regulatory documentation. Until the site receives notification, no protocol activities including assignment of patients may occur. Study s ites must adhe re to all requirements stipulated by their respective IRB. This may include notification to the IRB regarding protocol amendments, updates to the ICF, recruitment materials intended for viewing by subjects, local safety reporting requirements, reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the study at intervals specified by the respective IRB, and submission of the investigator’s final status report to IRB. All IRB approvals and relevant documentation for these items must be provided to the sponsor or its designee. Subject incentives should not exert undue influence for participation. Payments to subjects must be approved by the IRB and sponsor. 15.2 Subject Information, Informed Consent, and Subject Authorization Written consent documents will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. The ICF describes the planned and permitte d uses, transfers, and disclosures of the subject’s personal and personal health information for purposes of conducting the study. The ICF further explains the nature of the study, its objectives, and potential risks and benefits, as well as the date that informed consent is given. The ICF will detail the requirements of Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

The principal investigator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB approval of the ICF. The ICF must be approved by both the IRB and the sponsor before use. The ICF must be written in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective subject. It is the responsibility of the investigator to explain the detailed elements of the ICF to the subject. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and in the manner deemed appropriate by the IRB. The subject must be given ample opportunity to (1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the subject determines he or she will participate in the study, then the ICF must be signed and dated by the subject, at the time of consent and before the subject entering into the study. The subject should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black ballpoint ink. The investigator must also sign and date the ICF at the time of consent and before subject entering into the study. Once signed, the original ICF will be stored in the investigator’s site file. The investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subject’s medical record. Copies of the signed ICF shall be given to the subject. All revis ed ICFs must be reviewed and signed by relevant subjects in the same manner as the original informed consent. The date the revised consent was obtained should be recorded in the subject’s medical record, and the subject should receive a copy of the revised ICF. 15.3 Subject Confidentiality The sponsor and designees affirm and uphold the principle of the subject’s right to protection against invasion of privacy. Throughout this study, a subject’s source data will only be linked to the sponsor’s clinical study database or documentation via a unique identification number. As permitted by all applicable laws and regulations, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date of birth may be used to verify the subject and accuracy of the subject’s unique identification number. To comply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify compliance with this protocol, the sponsor requires the investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, representatives from any regulatory authority (eg, the US FDA, MHRA, PMDA), the sponsor’s designated auditors, and the appropriate IRBs to review the subject’s original medical records (source data or documents), including, but not limited to, laboratory test result reports, ECG reports, admission and discharge summaries for hospit al admissions occurring during a subject’s study participation, and autopsy reports. Access to a subject’s original medical records requires the specific authorization of the subject as part of the informed consent process (see Section 15.2). Copies of any subject source documents that are provided to the sponsor must have certain personally identifiable information removed (ie, subject name, address, and other identifier fields not collected on the subject’s eCRF).
