Rationale: Mirikizumab ( LY3074828 ) is a monoclonal, anti -interl eukin -23 (anti -IL-23) ant ibody being developed for the treatment of immune -mediated diseases where the IL -23 pathway is thought to have a significant pathogenic role. The neutra lizing activit y of mirikizumab is directed against the p19 subunit of the IL -23 m olecule and does not bind to IL-12. Study I6T-MC-AMAK (AMAK) is a confirmatory study testing mirikizumab as a treatm ent for plaque psori asis and is intended to support regist ration of this indication. This Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the superi ority of mirikizuma bversus placebo, as measured by improvement in disease severit y and key patient-reported outcomes, and will contribute to the evaluat ion of the safet y of mirikizumab . Objective(s)/Endpoints: Objectives Endpoints Primary a,b To assess whether mirikizumab inductio n dosing is superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with respect to high levels of clinical responseAt Week 16: Proportio n of patients with an sPGA (0,1) with at least a 2 -point improvement from baseline Proportio n of patients achieving a 90% improvement in PASI from baseline (PASI 90) Major Secondary a,b To assess whether mirikizumab inductio n dosing is superior to placebo with respect to an early, clinically meaningful responseAt Week 4: Proportio n of patients achieving a 75% impro vement in PASI (PASI 75) To assess whether the mirikizumab induction dosing is superior to placebo with respect to clinically meaningful response and the highest levels of clinical responseAt Week 16: Proportio n of patients achieving PASI 75 Proportio n of patients achieving a 100% improvement in PASI (PASI 100) To assess whether mirikizumab inductio n dosing is superior to placebo with respect to body surface area (BSA) affected by psoriasisAt Week 16: Proportio n of patients with ≤1% of BSA with psoria sis involvement"

A “high level” of clinical response is a PASI 90 response, which represents at least a 90% decrease (improvement) from baseline in PASI score, or sPGA (0,1) response, which represents an “almost clear” response. The “highest level” of clinical response is a PASI 100 or sPGA (0) response, which represent scomplete resolution of psori asis. Summary of Study Design: Study AMAK is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , parallel -group, m ulti-periodstudy . The study design incl udes 2 treatm entperiods (Induction and Maintenance with Randomized Withdrawal ), which together last for up to 52 weeks, followed by a 12-week Post-Treatm ent Follow -Upperiod.The study popul ation consists of patients aged 18years or older at the time of sc reening who have chronic plaque psoriasis based on a"

Treatment Arms and Duration: Patients will be randomized 4:1 to receive double -blind (“blinded”) subcutaneous (SC) administration of 250 m g mirikizumab or matching placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Randomization will be stratified based on previous exposure to bio logic therapy (yes/no) , body weight (<100 kg or 100 kg), and geographic region (North America orOther). Patients who were responders ( PASI 90) in the Induction Period and who continu ein the blinded Maintenance Period will be mo nitored for maintenance of response or remissio n, as well as relapse and disease rebound following treatm ent wit hdrawal, and response to retreatment following relapse . Resp onders to miri kizumab treatm ent in the blinded Induct ion Period will be re-randomized 1:1:1 to 250 mg mirikizumab every 8 weeks (Q8W) , 125 mg mirikizumab Q8W , or placebo Q8W, with treatm ents beginning at Week 16.

The total duration of participation in this study may be up to 68 weeks as detailed below. Screening Period: Up to 4 weeks. Treatment Period: Approximately 52 weeks. Post-Treatment Follow- up Period: Approximately 12 weeks after the l ast vi sit for pati ents who discont inue treatment prior to the Week 52 assessment ,or who are unable or not willing to participate in the long-term extensio n study (I6T-MC-AMAH [AMAH] ). Approximate Number of Plan ned Patients: Screened: 650 Randomized: 500 Com pleted: 400 Statistical Analysis: Approximately 500 patientswill be rando mized at a 4:1 ratio in the blinded Induct ion Peri od to receive 250 m g mirikizumab or placebo SC at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Stratified block rando mizat ionwill be performed wi th the fo llowing stratificat ion factors: previous exposure to biologic therapy (yes/no), body weight (<100 kg or 100 kg), and geographic regio n(North America or Other) .Assuming that PASI 90 responses at Week 16 are 70% for the mirikizumab arm and 3% for the placebo arm , the planned samples size (mirikizumab , 400 patients; placebo , 100patients ) has a power of >95% for a test of superi ority of mirikizumab compared to placebo with respect to PASI 90 at Week16.Similarly, assuming the sPGA (0,1)responses at W eek16 are 70% for the mirikizum abarm and 5% for the placebo arm , the planned samples size has a"
13,page_13,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 13 LY3074828power of >95% for a test of superiorit y of mirikizumab compared to placebo with respect to the sPGA (0,1) endpoint .Eli Lilly and Co mpany ( Lilly )predi cts that 70% of the mirikizumab -treated patients will be re -rando mized in the Maintenance Period at Week 16 (Visit 7) at a 1:1 :1 ratio to 250 mg mirikizumab Q8W, 125 m g mirikizumab Q8W , or placebo using body weight at baseline (<100 kg or 100 kg ) as a stratificat ion factor. Thus, approximately 93patients will be included in each Maintenance Period treatment group. The estimated sample size will provide a power of>95% to test superiorit y of 250 m gmirikizumab Q8W against pl acebo, and also power of >95 % to test superiorit y of 125mg mirikizumab Q8W against placebo with respect to PASI 90 at Week 52. For assessments of the primary endpo intsand other categorical efficacy and healt h outcom es endpo ints, the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test along with Non-Responder Imputati on(NRI) will be used to compare the treatment gro ups. The CMH stratification factors will be the same as those used in the stratified randomizat ion scheme . The CMH chi -square p-value will be provided. In addit ion, the abso lute treatment difference in proportions will be provi ded al ong wi th the 95% 2-sided confidence interval est imate. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and healt h outco me variables wit h mu ltiple post-baseline measurements will be made using mixed -effects model for repeated m easures (MMRM). When MMRM is used, the model will include treatment, baseline value, visit, and the interaction of treatment -by-visit,and the variables used for stratified rando mizat ion in induct ion/maintenance will be used as covari ates. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables wit h a single post -baseline t imepoint will be made using analysis of covari ance (ANCOVA) with the following covari ates in the model :treatm ent group, baseline value ,and variables used for stratified rando mizat ion in induct ion/maintenance . Fisher's exact test will be used for categorical safety data ,including adverse events ,unless otherwi se specified. Continuous safet y data incl uding vital sign and laboratory values will be analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment and baseline value in the model ,unless otherwise specified. Also, laboratory analy tes will be presented as mean changes fro m baseline and as incidence of shift between normal and abnormal states . The prespecified graphical mult iple testing approach (Bretz et al. 2011) will be implemented to control the overall Ty pe I error rate at 2 -sided alpha of 0.05, f or the hypotheses for the primary and major secondary endpoints. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) consisting of members external to Lilly will be established for interim safet y monitoring across all Phase 3 trials in pat ients with psoriasis .A DMC charter will govern the role and responsibilit ies of DMC -related activit ies."

22,page_22,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 22 LY30748283.Introduction 3.1. Study Rationale Mirikizumab ( LY3074828 )is a monoclonal, anti -interl eukin -23 (anti -IL-23) ant ibody being developed for the treatment of immune -mediated diseases where the IL -23 pathway is thought to have a significant pathogenic role. The neutralizing activit y of mirikizumab is directed against the p19 subunit of the IL -23 m olecule and does not bind to IL-12. Study I6T-MC-AMAK (AMAK) is a confirmatory study testing mirikizumab as a treatm ent for plaque psori asis and is intended to support registration of this indication. This Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the superi ority of mirikizumab versus placebo during the Induction Period (16 weeks) , as measured by improvement in disease severi ty andkey patient-reported outcomes . This study period is followed by a rando mized Ma intenance Dosing Peri od to Week 52 to evaluate the maintenance of response or remissio nas well as relapse and rebound fo llowing treatm ent wi thdrawal , and response to retreatment following relapse. The data will contribute to the evaluation of the safet y of mirikizumab . 3.2. Background The worl dwide prevalence of psori asis is nearly 3% (IFPA 201 7), wi th rates varying across ethnic groups , ages, gender, and geographic regions (Parisi et al . 2013). Histologically, psoriasis is characteri zed by inflammatory infiltrate and hyperproliferat ive keratinocytes, which retain intact nuclei (parakeratosis), elongat ion of rete ri dges, and hyperconvo luted vasculature in the papillary dermis. The infiltrate consists of prominent T cells, dendrit ic cells, and neutrophils in the dermis. The dysregulation o f the immune system, especially the activat ion of pathogenic Tcells, has been well demo nstrated to play an important role in psoriasis development. A typical organ -specific , T-cell-driven inflammatory disease, psori asis had been considered a Thelper (Th) 1- type skin disease for decades ,until a new Th populat ion, Th17, was identified (Lew et al . 2004; Steinman 2007; Weaver et al. 2007). Substantial clinical and basic research observat ions now suggest that the IL -23/Th17 axis is essential in the pathogenesis of psoriasis (Di Cesare et al. 2009). IL-23, a member of the IL -12 family o f cytokines, i s a heterodimeric protein comprised of 2 sub units; the p40 subunit, which it shares with IL -12, and the p19 subunit, believed to be specific to IL -23. IL-23 is produced by antigen-present ing cells, such as dendrit ic cells and macrophages, and plays an important role in maintenance and amplificat ionof Th17 cells (Lee et al. 2004; Piskin et al. 2004). In addit ion, Th17 cells and their downstream effector m olecules, including IL- 17A, IL -17F, IL -21, IL -22, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha, are found at increased levels in human psoriatic skin les ions and ci rculat ion (Boniface et al. 2007; Lowes et al. 2008; Caruso et al. 2009; Kagami et al. 2010) . A number of IL- 23 targeting mo lecules are being investigated for the treatment of immune -mediated diseases. The first bio logic to demonstrate clinical benefit through IL -23 inhibit ionin such dise ases was ustekinumab, which is a monoclonal ant ibody approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA ; Stelara®package insert 201 7)andthe European Medicines Agency (EMA ; Stelara Summary of Product Characteri stics 2017 )for the treatm ent of psoriasis, psoriatic arthrit is, and Crohn’s disease ,and is being evaluat ed in a Phase 3"
23,page_23,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 23 LY3074828trial for the treatm ent of ulcerat ive colit is (NCT02407236). Ustekinumab binds the p40 subunit commo n toIL-12 and IL -23; therefore, it targets both cy tokines rather than IL -23 specifically . Blockade of the IL -12 pathway may prevent Th1 cell -induced interferon blockade o f Th17 cell development, thus potentially limit ing the clinical activit y of p40- targeting antibodies. Experimental studies suggest that blocking the IL- 23/Th17/IL- 17 immune axis alo ne is sufficient to treat autoimmune inflamma tion (Montel eone et al . 2009 ). One such therapy that specifically target sthe p19 subunit of IL-23, guselkumab , has been approved for the treatment of moderate - to-severe plaque psoria sisby the United States FDA (Tremfya package insert 2017 )and the EMA (Tremfya Summary of Product Characteristics 2017) . Other similar agents , including mirikizumab in Studi esI6T-MC-AMAA (AMAA) and I6T -MC-AMAF (AMAF ),have demonstrated clinical act ivity in plaque psoriasis (Krueger et al. 2015 ; Papp et al. 2015 , 2017 ; Reich et al. 2017 b). 3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment Psori asis remains an important public healt h challenge. Therefore, there is a cont inuing need to develop treatment options with mechanisms of act ion that differ fro m exist ing therapies. Clinical data wi th mirikizumab (Studi es AMAA and AMAF ), as well as clinical data with ustekinumab, risankizumab , tildrakizumab, and guselkumab ,support the hypothesis that IL -23 pl ays a significant rol e in the pathogenesis of psoria sis, and these com pounds appear to have a favorable benefit/ risk profile in pat ients with psori asis. To assess the nonclinical toxicit y of mirikizumab and establish a margin of safet y(MOS) for clinical studies, 4 -week and 6 -month general toxicity studi es in norm al cyno molgus m onkeys were conducted for the evaluat ion of immunotoxicit y, toxicokinet ics, safet y pharmaco logy (as part of the 4- week study ), and fertilit y (as part of the 6 -month stu dy).The weekly administration ofmirikizumab to cyno molgus monkeys resulted in no adverse mirikizumab -related findings at doses of 0 mg/kg (vehicle), 1 and 30 mg/kg ( subcutaneous [ SC]), or 100 mg/kg ( intravenous [IV]) for 4 weeks, or 0, 10, and 100 mg/kg (SC) for 6 m onths. Based on the lack of any toxicit y at exposures exceeding the highest clinical exposure and lack of any tissue cross -reactivit y, the nonclinical safet y profile of mirikizumab supports clinical devel opment . Plasma exposure in monkeys at the no-observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL )in the 4-week and 6 -month studi es provi ded 52 -and 22 -fold MOS , respectively , relative to the predicted human exposure at the highest proposed clinical dose and frequency of 250 mgadministered SC every 4week s. After 16 weeks of treatment in Study AMAF, Psoriasis Area and Severit y Index (PASI ) 90 responses in a ll mirikizumab treatment arms were significant ly higher than placebo, with the highest responses in the 100 -mg and 300 -mg dosing groups. Overall frequencies of adverse events (AEs) were similar for mirikizumab -and placebo -treated pati ents (Reich et al . 2017b) . The dose sand regimens planned for Study AMAK were selected based on analyses of pharmacokinet ic (PK), safet y, and efficacy data f rom Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies , literature inform ation for other anti-IL-23 antibodi es, and nonclinical safet y data. In addit ion, blinded trial-level safet y reviews will be conducted at periodic intervals throughout the stud y. Interim safet y analyses willbe conducted by an external Data Moni toring Committee (DMC) to review unblinded safet y data. These monitoring and risk -mitigation actions, along with regular review"
24,page_24,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 24 LY3074828of AEs and l aboratory data, will assist in the evaluation and management of potential risks associ ated wi th mirikizuma badministration. Given the published literature supporting positive clinical act ivity following blocking IL -23 in autoimmune/inflammatory diseases including psoriasis, the favorable safet y and PK profile of mirikizumab , and the ini tial clinical activi ty observed for mirikizumab in patients with psori asis, the potenti al benefi ts of participat ing in Study AMAK are expected to outweigh the potential risks. More informat ion about the kno wn and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) and reasonably ant icipated AEs of mirikizumab are to be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB)."

The patient will sign the informed consent form (ICF) p rior to any study assessments, examinat ions, or procedures being performed. Screening procedures will be perform ed according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Electroni c diary collecti on will begin at screening, approximately ≤28 days pri or to Visit 2 (baseline). All inclusio n and exclusion criteria are provi ded in Sect ions 6.1and 6.2, respectively . 5.1.2. Baseline and Double -Blind Induction Period (Week 0 to Week 16): At Visit 2 ( Week 0; baseline), patients who meet the study eligibilit y criteria will be rando mized 4:1to receive 250 m g mirikizumab or matching placebo (SC) , respectively, atWeeks 0 , 4, 8, and 12. Rando mizat ion will be stratified ,based on previous exposure to biologic therapy (yes/no) , body weight (<100 kg or 100 kg ), and geographic region (North America or Other ). Patients who discont inue the study for any reason during this period will stop treatment and continue to the early terminati on visit (ET V) and then complete the 12- week Post-Treatment Follow-up Peri od. 5.1.3. Double -Blind Mainte nance Period (Week 16 to Week 52 [ 36 W eeks]): All patients who complete the Induction Period m ay continue in the Maintenance Period. The Maintenance Dosing Peri od will be adouble -blind treatment period with rando mized withdrawal . The first inject ion of study drug for this period will be at Week 16, wi th the last inject ion at Week 48. At Week 16 (Vi sit 7), pati ents who enter the Maintenance Period will be classified as a responder ( PASI 90) or non -responder ( <PASI 90). Patients who are responders at Week 16 will be mo nitored for maintenance of response or remissio n, as well as relapse and disease rebound following treatm ent wi thdrawal, and response to retreatment fo llowing rel apse. Remission is defined as the achievement of PASI 100. Relapse is defined as the loss, at any"

That i s, a pati ent will have relapsed during the Maintenance Period if their PASI score increases to at or above the midpo int between their baseline and Week 16 PASI score. Rebound is defined as having one or more of the following: worsening of psori asisseverit y over baseline static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA )score, worsening of psori asisseverit y over baseline PASI score by 125%, or change in psoriasis phenoty pe (for exam ple, f rom plaque to pustular) after randomizat ion to placebo at Week 16 . Patients will be treated as fo llows: Patients who were responders to mirikizumab in the blinded Induct ion Peri od (responder defin it ion is PASI 90 at Week 16 )will be re-randomized 1:1:1 to 250mg mirikizumab every 8 weeks ( Q8W ), 125 mg mirikizumab Q8W , or pl acebo Q8W ,according to their rando mized treatment assignment at Week 16 (see Figure AMAK .1). Stratification for the re-randomizat ion will be based on body weight at baseline (<100 kg or 100 kg). oPatients who rel apse during the blinded Maintenance Period (see relapse criterion defined above ) will remain on, or will be switched to , 250 mgmirikizumab for the remainder of the study and will be monitored for r ecapture of efficacy response. These pat ients will begin retreatment with mirikizumabat the visit at whi ch relapse i s ident ified and will receive another mirikizum ab treatm ent at the next visit 4weeks later. Subsequent mirikizumab treatments will be given at Q8W intervals. Patients who received placebo in the blinded Induction Period who are responders at Week 16 ( Visit 7) will continue to receive placebo during the Maintenance Period until relapse; these pati ents will begin treatm ent wi th 250 m g mirikizumab at the visit at which relapse i s ident ified and will receive another mirikizumab treatment at the nex t visi t 4weeks later. Subsequent mirikizumab treatments will be given at Q8W intervals. Patients who were not responders to mirikizumab in the blinded Induct ion Peri od will receive 250 m g mirikizumab Q8W . oContinued blinded treatment for nonresponders is provided so that partial or slow responders may remain in the study beyond Week 16, thus maintaining the study blind while patients continu eto receive potentially beneficial lo nger-term treatm ent wi th mirikizumab . Patients who received placebo in the b linded Induction Period who are non -responders at Week 16 (Visit 7) will receive 250mgmirikizumab every 4 weeks ( Q4 W)for Weeks 16 through 32 and mirikizumab treatm ents Q8W thereafter . All patients will receive inj ections (mi rikizumab or pl acebo ,as appropriate) Q4W at Weeks 16 through 48 (V isits 7 through 15) in order to maintain study blind across the study treatm ent groups."

Prima ry Efficacy A ssessments The primary efficacy endpoints are the p roporti on of patients wi th an sPGA (0,1) with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16 and the p roporti on of patients achieving a 90% improvement in PASI from baseline (PASI 90) at Week 16. Static Physicia n’s Global Assessment 9.1.1.1. The sPGA is the physician’s glo bal assessment of the pat ient’s psori asislesio ns at a given t ime point (EMA 2004). Plaques are assessed for induration, erythema, and scaling ,and an overall rating of psori asisseveri ty is given using the anchors of clear (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5) . Psoriasis Area a nd Severity Index 9.1.1.2. The PASI is an accepted primary efficacy measurement for this phase of development of psori asis treatm ents (EMA 2004). The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body -surface involvement in 4 anatomical regio ns (head, trunk, arms, an d legs) and the severit y of scaling, redness, and plaque indurat ion/infiltrat ion (thickness) in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no psoriasis to 72 f or the m ost severe disease (Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978). The PASI has been the most fr equent ly used endpoint and measure of psoriasis severit y in clinical trials (EMA 2004; Menter et al. 2008). A clinically meaningful response is a PASI 75, which represents at least a 75% decrease (improvement) from the baseline PASI score. Higher levels of clearance (PASI 90), as well as complete resolut ion of psori asis (PASI 100), have beco me additional endpoints because of the increasing recognit ion of the associat ion of higher clearance with greater heal th-related quali ty of life(HRQoL) (Puig2015). 9.1.2. Second ary Efficacy A ssessments Secondary efficacy assessments will include the following: StaticPhysician’s Global Assessment 9.1.2.1. Both sPGA (0) and sPGA (0,1) will be assessed at various time po ints up to Week 52. For assessment descri ption, see Secti on 9.1.1.1 ."
53,page_53,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 53 LY3074828Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 9.1.2.2. PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100will be assessed at various time points up to Week 52 . PASI 75, 90, and 100are the percentage improvements in PASI ( 75%, 90%, and 100%, respectively). For assessment descri ption, see Section 9.1.1.2 . Body Surface Area 9.1.2.3. Percent BSA will be evaluated as the percent invo lvement of psoriasis on each patient’s BSA on a continuous scale fro m 0% (no invo lvement) to 100% (full invo lvement), where 1% corresponds to the size of the patient’s hand (including the palm, fingers , and thumb) (Nati onal Psori asis Foundat ion 2016). Nail Psoriasis Severity Index 9.1.2.4. TheNail Psori asis Severit y Index (NAPSI) is used t o eval uate the severit y of fingernail bed psori asisand fingernail matrix psori asisby area of invo lvement in the fingernail unit. In this study , only fingernail invo lvement will be assessed. The fingernail is divided wit h imaginary horizontal and l ongitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed psori asis (0 to 4) and fingernail matrix psori asis (0 to 4) depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fingernail bed and fingernail matrix psori asis in each quadrant. The NAPSI score of a fingernail is the sum of scores in fingernail bed and fingernail matr ix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each fingernail is evaluated, and the sum of all the fingernails is the total NAPSI score (range, 0 to 80). Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index 9.1.2.5. The Psori asis Scalp Severit y Index(PSSI) m easures the affected scalp area and the severit y of clinical symptoms. The PSSI is a composite score derived fro m the sum of scores for ery thema, induration, and desquamat ion multiplied by a score for the exten t of scalp area invo lved (range , 0to 72) . Higher scores indicate worse severit y (Thaçi et al. 2015). Palmoplantar Psoriasis Severity Index 9.1.2.6. The Palmoplantar Psori asis Severi ty Index (PPASI )is a co mposite score derived from the sum o f scores for ery thema, indurat ion, and desquamat ion multiplied by a score for the extent of palm and so le area invo lvement (range, 0 to 72). Health Outcomes Assessments 9.1.2.7. The following pati ent-reported questionnaires will be administered according to the Schedule of Activities(Secti on 2) in countries where the questionnaires have been translated into the native language o f the regio n and linguist ically validated. These assessments shoul dbe co mpleted before administration o f invest igational product ; before the patient’s clinical examinat ion;before the patientreceives any te stsor resul ts; and before the patient’s health, heal th data, or emotions are discussed. 9.1.2.7.1. Dermatology Life Quality Index The Derm atology Life Qualit y Index ( DLQI )is a validated, dermatology -specific, patient-reported measure that evaluates a patient’s HRQoL. This questionnaire has 10 items that are grouped in to6 domains, namely symptoms and feelings, daily activit ies, l eisure, work and school , personal relationships, and treatm ent. The recall period of this scale is over the “last"
54,page_54,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 54 LY3074828week” Response categori es include “not at all,” “a litt le,” “a lot,” and “very much,” with corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and unanswered (“not relevant”) responses scored as “0.” T he totalscore ranges from 0 to 30 (l ess to m ore impairment) (Finlay and Khan 1994 ; Basra et al. 2008 ). A DLQI total score of 0 to 1 is considered as having no effect on a patient’s HRQoL, and a 5 -point change from baseline is considered as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresho ld (Khilji et al. 2002 ; Hongbo et al. 2005 ). 9.1.2.7.2. European Q uality of Life –5 Dimension s–5 Level s–Psoriasis The European Qualit y of Life –5 dimensi ons– 5 levels (EQ–5D–5L ) questi onnai re is a widely used, generic quest ionnaire t hat assesses healt h status ( EuroQol Group 1990 ; Herdm an et al . 2011). The questionnaire consists of 2 parts. The first part assesses 5 dimensio ns (m obility, self-care, usual act ivities, pain/disco mfort and anxiety /depressi on) that have 5 possible levels o f response ( no probl ems, slight probl ems, m oderate probl ems, severe problems, extreme problems . This part of the EQ–5D–5L can be used to generate a healt h state index .The healt h state index score is calculated b ased on the responses to the 5 dimensio ns, providing a single value on a scale fro m less than 0 (where zero is a healt h state equivalent to death; negat ive values are valued as worse than dead ) to 1 (perfect healt h), with higher scores indicat ing better he alth utilit y.The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analog scale on which the patient rates their perceived health state from 0 ( the worst health you can imagine ) to 100 ( the best health y ou can imagine ). The study will use the EQ–5D–5L– Psori asis ( EQ–5D–5L–PSO) , which is a versio n of the EQ–5D–5L with two additional items related to psoriasis: skin irritation and self -confidence (Swinburn et al. 2013). 9.1.2.7.3. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Psoriasis The Work Productivit y and Activity Impairment-Psori asis(WPAI -PSO) Questi onnaire is a patient-reported instrument developed to measure the impact on work productivit y and regul ar activit ies attri butable to a specific healt h probl em(psori asis). It contains 6 items that measure: 1) em ployment status, 2) hours missed from work due to the psoriasis, 3) hours missed from work for other reasons, 4) hours actually worked, 5) degree of healt h affected -productivit y while working, and 6) degree of health affected -productivit y in regular unpaid activit ies. Four scores are cal culated fro m the responses to these 6 items: absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivit y loss, and act ivity impairment. Scores are calculated as impairment percentag es (Reilly et al. 1993), wi th higher numbers indicat ing greater impairment and less productivit y, that is, worse outcom es. 9.1.2.7.4. Psoriasis S ymptom s Scale The Psoriasis Symptoms Scale (PSS) is a patient -administered assessment of 4symptom s (itch, pain, stinging, and burning); 3 signs (redness, scaling, and cracking); and 1item on di scomfort related to symptom s/signs. Respondents are asked to answer the questions base d on thei r psori asis symptom s. The overall severit y for each in dividual symptom /sign fro m the patient’s psori asis is indicated by select ing the number from a numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10 that best describes the worst level of each symptom/sign in the past 24 hours, where 0=no symptom/sign and 10 =worst imagina ble symptom /sign ."
55,page_55,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 55 LY3074828The symptom severit y scores, ranging fro m 0 to 10, are the values of the selected numbers indicated by the pat ient on the instrument’s horizontal scale. Each of the 8 individual items will receive a score of 0 to 10 and will be reported as item scores for itch, pain, stinging, burning, redness, scaling, cracking, and disco mfort. In additi on, a symptom sscore ranging fro m 0 (no symptoms) to 40 (worst imaginable symptoms) ,and a si gns score of 0 (no signs) to 30 (worst imaginable signs) wi ll be reported . 9.1.2.7.5. Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short -Form Health Survey The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short -Form Health Survey (SF 36) is a patient -reported, generic, HRQoL instrument originally published in 1992 ,with some item wordings and response options revised in 2000 (Ware and Sherbourne 1992; Ware 2000). It consists of 36 questions measuring 8 health do mains: physical funct ioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical probl ems, rol e limi tations due to em otional problems, general health percept ions, m ental health, social function, and vitalit y.The patient’s responses are solicited using Likert scales that vary in length, with 3 –6 response options per item. The SF -36 can be scored into the 8 health domains named above and two overall summary scores: physical co mponent summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. The domain and summary scores range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate better le vels of funct ion and/or better healt h. The SF -36 version 2 (acute versio n) will be used, whic h utilizes the recall period of “ the past week ” (Ware 2000). 9.1.2.7.6. 16 -Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Sym ptomatology -Self Report TheQIDS -SR16 is a self-administered, 16-item instrum ent intended to assess the existence and severit y of symptom s of depressio nas listed in the American Psychiatric Associat ion’s Diagnostic and Stati stical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM -V)(American Psychiatri c Associ ation 2013). A patient is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they have f elt for the past 7 days. There is a 4 -point scale for each item ranging fro m 0to3. The 16 i tems corresponding to 9 depression domains are summed to give a single score ranging from 0 to 27 , with higher scores denoting greater symptom severit y. The dom ains assessed by the instrument include: (1) sad mood, (2) concentration, (3) self -criticism, (4) suicidal ideati on, (5) interest, (6) energy/fat igue, (7) sleep disturbance (init ial, middle, and late inso mnia or hyperso mnia), (8) decrease/increase in appetite/weight, and (9) psy chomotor agitation/retardati on. This instrument willalso be used for AE monitoring (see Section 9.2.2 ). 9.1.2.7.7. Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication The Treatm ent Sati sfact ion Quest ionnaire for Medicat ion (TSQM )is a self -administered 9 -item measure to evaluate patient treatment satisfact ion with medicati on in the dom ains of effectiveness (3 items) , convenience (3 items), and global satisfact ion(3 items) .The recall period is the l ast 2 -3 weeks or sinc e the m edicat ion was l ast tak en.Item formats include both a 1-to 7-point and a 1-to 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction (Bharmal et al. 2009)."

Patient’s Global A ssessment of Psoriasis The Pati ent’s Gl obal Assessment of Psori asis(PatGA ) is a pati ent-reported , single -item scale on which patients are asked to rank, by select inga number on a 0 to5 NRS, the severit y of their psoriasis “today ,” from 0 (cl ear/no psoriasis )to 5 (severe). 9.1.3. Appropriateness of Assessments The clinical safet y parameters in this stud y are standard elements of clinical health assessment and Phase 3drug development. The disease activit y and heal th outcom emeasurements are used both in clinical pract ice and psori asisclinical tri als. Psoriasis is associated with numerous skin - based symptom s and HRQ oLimpairment, whi ch justifies the use of the psoriasis symptom severit y,as well as dermatologic and generic HRQ oL assessments used in this study (EMA 2004; Kimball et al. 2005) . 9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patientswho have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any even t that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of patientsduring the study. Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused thepatientto discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patientshoul d be f ollowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency o f follow-up evaluat ions of the A E is left to the di scret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via e CRF the occurr ence and nature of each patient ’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study . In addit ion, site personnel will record any change in the condi tion(s) and any new condi tions as AEs . Investi gators shoul d record thei r assessment of the potenti al relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure orinvest igational product via eCRF. The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being relat ed to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomi tant treatm ent or pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause and effect relat ionship between the investigat ional product, study devi ce,and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment."
57,page_57,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 57 LY3074828Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient ’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF , clarifying if possible, the circumstances leading to any dosagemodifications, or discontinuations of treatm ent. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es: Death Initial or prolonged inpat ient hospi talizat ion Alife-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying) Persistent or si gnificant disabilit y/incapacit y Congeni tal anom aly/bi rth defect Important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitali zation,but may jeopardi ze the pati ent or may requi re intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatm ent in an emergency room or at home, b lood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. When a condit ion related to the prefilled syringe snecessitates medical or surgical intervent ion to preclude either perm anent impairment of a body function or perm anent dam age to a body structure, the seri ous outcom e of “requi red intervent ion” will be assigned. All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the e CRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the Sponsor begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the Sponsor as per SAE reporting requirements and t imelines (see Sect ion 9.2)if it is con sidered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a Sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This 24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and all fo llow-up SAE inform ation.Patients with a serious hepat ic AEshoul d have addi tional data collected using the eCRF . Pregnancy ( during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements ,any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus."
58,page_58,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 58 LY3074828Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in patients once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patientdisposit ion CRF has been completed). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipat ion, the invest igator must promptly notify Lilly. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 9.2.1.1. Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB a nd that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the associ ated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory requirements in parti cipating countries requi re the reporting of SUSAR s. Lilly has procedures that will be followed for the ident ificat ion,recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regul ations and the associated detailed guidances. 9.2.2. Adverse Event Monitoring with a Systematic Questionnaire The C -SSRS captures the occurrence, severit y, and f requency of suicidal ideat ion and/or behavior during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questi ons to solicit the ty pe of inform ation needed to determine if suicidal ideation and/or behavior occurred. The C -SSRS i s administered by an appropri ately trained health care professio nal with at least 1 year of pat ient care/clinical experience. The tool was developed by the National Inst itute of Mental Healt h trial group for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algori thm of Suicide Assessment categori zation of suicidal events. For this study, the scale has been adapted (with permission fro m the scale authors) to include only the porti on of the scale that captures the occurrence of the 11 preferred ideat ion and behavior categories. The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur pri or to the collect ion of the C -SSRS. If a suicide-related event is discovered during the C -SSRS but was not captured during the nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form. If an event is serious or leads to discontinuat ion, thi s is an except ion where the SAE and/or AE leading to discont inuat ion should be included on the AE form a nd the process for reporting SAEs should be fo llowed. Suicide-related events (behavior and/or ideat ions) will be assessed and evaluated at every visit with the administrati on of the C -SSRS and the Self -Harm Supplement Form. The Self -Harm Suppl ement Form is a single quest ion to enter the number of suicidal behavior events, possible suicide behavi ors, or nonsui cidal self -injuri ous behavi ors. If the number of behavioral events is greater than zero, it will lead to the complet ion of the Self-Harm Follow- Up Form. The Self-Harm Follow-Up Form is a seri es of quest ions that provides a more detailed descript ion of the behavior cases. The QIDS -SR16 instrument (for descript ion, see Section 9.1.2.7.6 )will be used to collect patient-reported data on signs and symptoms related to depressi on."

Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are AEs which the Sponsor specifies as being of special interest based on standard drug registration topics, safet y findings from previous studies in devel opment program , potenti al risks associ ated wi th biologic immunom odulators as noted in product labels and published literature, and comorbidit ies and risk factors prevalent in the studi ed popul ations. The AESIs for this study are defined in the statist icalanalysis plan (SAP) , and may include ,but not be limited to the following : Infections, including o pportunist ic infect ions Hypersensit ivity events ,including anaphylaxis Inject ion site events Cerebro -cardi ovascular events Malignancies Depressio n, or suici dal ideation or behavior s Hepati c AEs. For some AESIs, sites shoul dprovi de addi tional information regarding the event, as instructed on the eCRF. Infections, Including Opportunistic Infections Drugs that modulate the immune system may increase t he risk of infect ion, including serious or opportunist ic infect ions. Infections will be categorized by Lilly as opportunist ic according to Opportunistic Infections and Biologic Therapies in Immune -Mediated Inflammatory Diseases: Consensus Recommendations for Infection Reporting during Clinical Trials and Postmarketing Surveillance by Wint hrop et al .

In people aged 5 y ears and over, IGRA is the preferred screening test for LTBI. In countries where the PPD is available and is preferred (in the judgment of the investigator) as an alternat ive screening test for LTBI, that test may be used instead of an I GRA. Patients wi th docum entati on of a negat ive IGRA or PPD within 3 m onths before init ial screening may not need to repeat TB testing at screening, based on the judgment of the invest igator. Source documentation must include the original laboratory report (for IGRA) or a record of the size in millimeters of the indurat ion response (for PPD). A PPD recorded as negative wit hout docum enting the size of indurat ion in millimeters ,will not be acceptable and will require a retest. Monitoring: After init ial screening, tuberculosis testing will only be requi red based on clinical assessment of TB ri sk (symptom s/signs/known or suspected TB exposure), and according to local regulat ions and/or local standard of care. Such clinical assessments should be conducted peri odically, at least every 4 months. Interpretation of Screening Tests for LTBI The QuantiFERON -TB Gol d assay will be reported as negat ive, indeterminate ,or posit ive. The T-SPOT .TBassay will be reported as negative, borderline ,or posit ive. A posi tive PPD is indicated with a skin test response 5mm of indurat ion,docum ented between approximately 48 and72 hours after test applicat ion (regardl ess of BCG vaccinat ion history ). Patients who do not return within 48 to 72 hours of test administration will be required to have the test repeated and then interpreted within this time frame. Patients wi th a diagnosis of LTBI, based on a positive IGRA test resul t or a posi tive PPD response 5 mm of induration and no evidence of active TB ,may be rescreened once afterthey meet the fo llowing requi rements: Have receiv edat least 4 weeks of appropriate ongoing prophylact ic therapy for LTBI as per local standard of c are, and Have no evidence of treatment hepatotoxicit y (ALT and AST l evels must remain ≤2xULN) upon retesti ng of serum ALT and AST levels before rando mizat ion. Such patients must continue and co mplete appropriate LTBI therapy during the course of the study to rem ain eligible and must con tinue to m eet all other inclusi on and exclusio n criteria for participat ion. Re-Testing and Confirmatory Testing One retest i s allowed for patients with an “indeterminate” Quant iFERON -TB Gol d assay or “borderline” T -SPOT .TBassay. Patients with 2 indeterminate Quant iFERON -TB Gol d assays or 2borderline T -SPOT .TBassays will be excluded."

If the confirmatory test i s posi tive, the pati ent will be excluded from the study unless they com plete at l east 4 weeks of appropriate therapy for LTBI, based o n nat ional or internat ional guidelines (as defined above), have no evidence of hepatotoxicit y (ALT and AST levels must remain ≤2xULN) upon retesting of serum ALT and AST levels after at least 4 weeks of LTBI treatm ent. Such pati ents m ust continue and com plete appropri ate full course of LTBI therapy during the course of the study to rem ain eligible to participate. If the confirmatory test i s negat ive, these results will be discussed wit h the medical mo nitor in order to determine eligibilit y for the study . Diagnosis of LTBI During Study Patients di agnosed wi th LTBI during the study will temporarily discontinue the invest igational product and will be offered treatment by the referring physician. These patients can be considered for resumpt ion of invest igational product after complet ing the first 4 weeks of appropriate treatment and no evidence of treatment hepatotoxicit y, as described above. These patients m ust continue and complete a full course of treatment for LTBI in order to continue on investigational product . Prior Treatment for LTBI or TB Patients who have a documented history of com pleting an appropriate TB prophylaxis or treatm ent regimen (consistent wi th Worl d Heal th Organizat ion and/or Uni ted States Centers for Disease Control at the time of treatment) ,wit h no history of re-exposure since their treatments were com pleted and no evidence of act ive TB , are eligible to participate in the st udy; these patients shoul d not undergo TB testing unless advised to do so based on local guidelines. Active TB Patients di agnosed wi th active TB at screening will be excluded. Patients di agnosed wi th active TB during the study will be discont inued and shoul d be referred for appropri ate treatm ent. Chest Radiography 9.4.5.3. Posterior-anterior (PA) chest x -ray (CXR) will be obtained at screening (Visit 1) unless, in the opinio n of the invest igator or based on local standard of care, both PA a nd lateral view sare indicated. A CXR does not have to be performed if the pat ient has had a CXR that is sufficient for TB evaluat ion according to local standard of care within 3 mo nths of screening , and the CXR film(s) or a radi ology report i s available t o the invest igator for review."

Sample Size Determination Approximately 500 patients will be rando mized at a 4:1 rati oin the blind edInduct ion Period to receive 250 m g mirikizumab or placeboSCat Weeks 0 , 4, 8, and 12. Stratified block rando mizat ionwill be performed wi th the fo llowing stratificat ion factors: previous exposure to biologic therapy (yes/no), body weight (<100 kg or 100 kg), and geographic regio n(North America or Other) . There are mult iple primary endpoints in this study : sPGA (0,1)and PASI 90 at Week 16. The assumed sPGA (0,1)responses are 70% for the mirikizumab arm and 5% for the pl acebo arm . The assumed PASI 90 responses are 70% for the mirikizumab arm and 3% for the pl acebo arm . These assumpt ions are based upon the resul ts of the mirikizumab Phase 2 Study AMAF (Reich et al. 2017b )and review o f histori cal clinical studies in psoriasis ( Langley et al . 2014; Gordon e t al. 2016; Blauvelt et al. 2017; Papp et al. 2017; Reich et al. 2017 a). With a total sample size of 500 patient s, randomizing 400patients to the mirikizumab arm and 100patients to the placebo arm , this study has power of >95% for testing superi ority of mirikizumab to placebo based on a 2- sided chi -square test with alpha of 5% on sPGA(0,1) . It also provi des a power of >95% for testing superi ority of mirikizumab to placebo on PASI 90 based on a 2 -sided chi -square test wi th alpha of 5%. In order to accoun t for m ultiple testing for the comparisons of 2mirikizumab groups against the placebo group in the Maintenance Period, a 2-sided chi-square test at the 0.0 25level is assumed. Assuming 70% of the mirikizumab patients are re -rando mized in the Maintenanc e Period at Week 16(Visit 7) at a 1:1 :1 ratio to 250 m g mirikizum abQ8W, 125 m g mirikizumab Q 8W or placebo , approximately 93 patients will be included in each treatment group. Stratified block rando mizat ionwill be performed wi th thestratification factor of body weight at baseline (<100 kg or 100 kg ). This sample size will provide >95% power to test the difference in the proporti on of patients maintaining PASI 90 from Week 16(Visit 7)after re-randomization at the start of the Maintenance Dosing Period to Week 52 (Visit 16) between each mirikizumab dosing interval and placebo, assuming the proportions of patients maintaining PASI 90 are 80% for 250mg mirikizumab Q8 W, 70% f or 125 m g mirikizumab Q8W , and 10% for placebo."

Populations for Analyses For purposes of analysis, the following populat ions are defined: Population Description Induction ITT All randomized patient s, even if the patient does not take the assigned treatment, does not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise does not follow the protocol. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned . Unless otherwise noted, efficacy and health outcomes analy ses for the Induction Period will be conducted on this population. Induction Safety All randomized patient swho received a t least 1 dose of the study treatment. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned. Safety analyses for the Induction Period will be conducted on t his populatio n. Re-randomized Maintenance ITT AllITTpatient swho received at least 1 induction dose of the study treatment and have been re -randomized at Week 16. Efficacy andhealth outcomes analy ses for the Maintenance Period will be conducted on this population. Re-randomized Maintenance SafetyAllITTpatient swho received at least 1 induction dose of the study treatment , have been re -randomized at Week 16 ,and have received at least 1 maintenance dose. Safety analy ses for the Maintenance Period will be conducted on this populatio n. Abbr eviation: ITT = intent -to-treat. Addit ional analysis populat ions will be described in the SAP as deemed appropriate . 10.3. Statistical Analyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this study will be the responsibil ity of Lilly o r its desi gnee. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report (CSR) . Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. Efficacy analysis for induct ion outcom es will be conducted on the Induction intent -to-treat (ITT) popul ation,while efficacy analysis for the maintenance outcomes will be conduction on the re - rando mized maintenance population as defined in Section 10.2.The induction and maintenance safet y analysis will be performed on the induct ion safet y and re-rando mized maintenance safety popul ations,respect ively. Addit ional safet y and efficacy analysis o f the pati ents who are not re- rando mized for the maintenance portion of the study will be defined in the SAP. Continuous data will be summarized in terms of the mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, maximum, median, and number of observat ions. Categorical data will be summarized as frequ ency counts and percentages. Unless otherwise specified, all hypothesis tests will be 2-sided wi th alpha of 0.05. Mult iple testing will be controlled as described in Section 10.3.1.2 ."
71,page_71,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 71 LY3074828Unless otherwise specified, b aseline for efficacy and heal th outcom es endpo ints during both the Induct ion and Maintenance Periodswill be defined as the l ast available value before the init ial rando mizat ionduring the Induction Period, which in mo st cases will be the measure recorded at Week 0 (Visit 2). Detailed definit ions of baseline for safet y-related analyses will be described in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, the statist ical analysis models for the Induction Period will adjust for the covariates: previous exposure to bio logic therapy (yes/no), body weight (<100 kg or 100kg), a nd geographic regio n (North America or Other) . Similarly, unless otherwise specified, the statist ical analysis models for th e Maintenance Period will adjust for the covariate body weight (<100 kg or 100 kg) . For assessments of the primary endpo intsand other categorical efficacy and healt h outcom es endpo ints, the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test will be used to compare the treatm ent groups wi th the stratification factors ment ioned above . The CMH chi -square p- value will be provided. In addit ion, the abso lute treatm ent difference in prop ortions will be provided along wi th the 95% 2-sided confidence interval estimate. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health outcome variables with multiple post-baseline measurements will be made using mixed -effects model for repeated m easure s (MMRM) . When MMRM is used, the model includes treatment, baseline value, visit, the interact ion of treatment -by-visit as fixed factors , and the induct ion/maintenance covariates ment ioned above . The covari ance structure to model the within -patienterror s will be unstructured. If the unstructured covariance matrix results in a lack of convergence, the heterogeneous Toeplitz covariance structure, fo llowed by the heterogeneous autoregressive covari ance structure will be used. The Kenward -Roger m ethod will be used to estimate the deno minator degrees of freedo m. Type III tests for the least squares means will be used for the statist ical comparison; the 95% confidence interval will also be reported. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health out come variables with a single post-baseline time point will be made using analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA )with the following in the model : treatm ent group, baseline value ,and Induct ionPeriod/M aintenance Periodcovariates ment ioned above . Type III tests for least-square ( LS)means will be used for statist ical comparison between treatment groups. The LS mean difference, standard error, p - value, and 95% confidence interval , unless otherwise specified, will also be reported. Missing data imputation method for ANCOVA model will be specified in the SAP. Fisher's exact test will be used for categorical safety data including AE s,unless otherwise specified . Continuous safet y data i ncluding vital sign and l aboratory values will be analyzed using ANCOVA with tr eatment and baseline value in the model ,unless otherwi se specified . Also, laboratory analy tes will be presented as mean changes from baseline and as incidence of shift between normal and abnormal states . Missing Data Imputation 10.3.1.1. The following m ethods for imputation of missing data will be used:"
72,page_72,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 72 LY3074828Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) for Binary Clinical Response: Patients will be considered non -responders for the NRI analysis if they do not meet the clinical response criteria or have missing clinical response data at the analysis t ime point. Randomized subjects wi thout at l east 1 postbaseline observat ion will also be defined as non-responders for the NRI analysis. Mixed -Effects Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM): It will be the primary analysis method for longitudinal continuous m easurements. It assumes missing at random and the bias caused by missing data can be attenuated by modelling rando m effects using the within-patient error correlat ion structure. Addit ional missing data imputation methodologies, for exam ple, modified baseline observat ion carried forward (m BOCF) ,may be considered as sensit ivity analyses and will be detailed in the SAP. By using mBOCF, f or pati ents di scontinuing study treatm entdue to an AE, the baseline observat ion will be carri ed forward to the corresponding primary endpoint for evaluat ion. For patients di scontinuing invest igational product for any other reason, the last nonmissing postbaseline observat ion before discont inuat ion will be carried forward to the corresponding primary endpoint for eval uation. Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 10.3.1.2. The prespecified graphical mult iple testing approach (Bretz et al. 2011) will be implemented to control the overall Ty pe I error rate at 2 -sided alpha of 0.05, f or the hypotheses for the primary and major secondary endpoints. The graphical approach is a closed testing procedure ; hence ,it strongly control s the family -wise error rate across all endp oints (Alosh et al. 2014) . The Week 16 endpo ints of sPGA (0,1) and PASI 90 represent a primary endpo int family . The graphical test ing scheme will sequent ially test sPGA (0,1) first, fo llowed by PASI 90 before proceeding t o test the major secondary endpoints. Details o f the specific graphical test ing scheme (including testing order, interrelat ionships, Ty peI error all ocati on for the major secondary endpoints , and the associated propagation) will be pre -specified in the SAPs pri or to the first unblind ed analysis . 10.3.2. Treatment Group Comparability Patient D isposition 10.3.2.1. A detailed description o f patient di sposi tion will be provi ded at the end of the study . Patient disposit ion will be summarized for each treatment period. Reasons for discont inuat ion fromthe study will be summarized. Patient C haracteristics 10.3.2.2. Patientcharacterist ics and baseline clinical measures will be summarized for each treatment period. Baseline characterist ics will include gender, age, age category , wei ght, ra ce, geographic region, baseline disease severit y, durati on of disease, pri or exposure to biologic therapy , previ ous nonbio logic systemic therapy , and previ ous bi ologic therapy . Baseline clinical measurements will include sPGA score, PASI score, BSA, PSSI, PSS symptom and sign score s, PatGA, DLQI total score, SF -36 (PCS), and SF -36 (MCS)."

74,page_74,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 74 LY307482810.3.4. Safety Analyses Safety assessments will include AEs,SAEs, AESIs, laboratory analy tes, vitalsigns, QIDS-SR16 , and C -SSRS. The Induct ion Period safet y analyses will compare mirikizumab to placebo using the methods described in Section 10.3.1 . The Maintenance Period safet y analyses will sum marize safet y measures by treatment. Adverse events will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by system organ class, preferred term, severit y, and rel ationship to investigat ional product. A treatm ent-emergent adverse event ( TEAE )is defined as an event that first occurred or worsened in severit y after baseline. For each event classificat ion term , the number of patient s experi encing a TEAE wi th that cl assificat ion term will be tabulated. Treatment -related TEAEs are defined as events that are indicated by the invest igator on the eCRF to be related to treatment. If a patientreports the occurrence of a particular event more than once, the most severe of those events will be included in the summary tables of TEAEs, and the most severe of the m ost rel ated of those events will be included in the summary tables of treatm ent-related events. For events that are gender specific, the deno minator and computation of the percentage will only include patientsfrom the given gender . Adverse events of special interest are defined in Section 9.2.3 and the analysis plan will be described in the Program Safety Analysis Plan and SAP. 10.3.5. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses The PK of mirikizumab will be characterized using visualizat ion/graphical evaluat ions and mixed -effect (population PK) modeling approaches. Various structural and error models will be evaluated. Intrinsic factors (such as age, body weight, gender, immunogenicit y) and extrinsic factors (such as co -medications) will be invest igated to assess their influence on model param eters. Model evaluat ion will i nclude a visual predict ive check. Estimates of PK model param eters and covariate effects and corresponding 90% confidence intervals will be reported. Analyses of exposure -response relat ionships will be conducted using both exploratory visualization/ graphi calapproaches and model -based approaches. Exploratory visualization/ graphical analysis approaches for categorical clinical endpoints ( for example , PASI 90, sPGA [0 ,1]) may consist of graphs showing the percentage of patients who achieve the clinical endp oint at different percentiles ( for example , quartiles) of exposure of mirikizumab at Weeks 16 and 52. Measures of exposure may include populat ion PK est imated average concentrations (C avg), or estimated or observed trough concentrations at the time o f theclinical endpo int.Model -based analyses of the binary clinical endpoints will ut ilize populat ion exposure -response logist ic regressio n models, where maximum effect (E max) or other model structures may be used to relate exposure to the probabilit y of achi eving the endpo int. These models may be used to eval uate patientfactors that may impact the relat ionship between exposure and the probabilit y of achieving the endpoint. Longi tudinal exposure -response models"

Interim Analyses One DMC consist ing of members external to Lilly will be established for interim safet y monitoring across all Phase 3 trials in pat ients with psori asis. This committee will consist of a minimum o f 3 members ,including a physician wit h expertise in dermatology anda stati stician. No m ember of the DMC may have contact with study sites. AStatistical Analysis Center (SAC ) will prepare and provide unblinded safet y data to the DMC. The SAC members may be Lilly employees or from third-party organi zations designated by Lilly. However, they will be external to the study team and will have no contact wi th sites and no privileges to influence change in the ongoing study .Access to the unblinded safet y data will be limited to the DMC and the SAC or their designees . The study team will not have access to the unblinded data. Only the DMC is authori zed to eval uate unblin ded data. The purpose of the DMC is to advise Lilly regarding continuing patient safet y; however, the DMC m ay request key efficacy data to put safet y observat ions into context and to confirm a reasonable benefit/risk profile for ongoing pat ients in the study . Hence, there will be no alpha adjust ment for these interim assessments . Study sites will receive informat ion about interim assessments ONLY if they ne ed to know for the safet y of their pati ents. This commit tee will make recommendat ions as to whether it is scient ifically and ethically appropri ate to continue enrollment, discont inue a treatment group, or discontinue the study .Details outlining the roles and responsibilit ies of the DMC will be finalized in theDMC charter and an associ ated DMC analysis plan prior to the first unblinded assessment . In addit ion to the DMC interim assessments for safety , a limited number of Lilly emplo yees or their designees notin direct contact w ith the clinical sites willbe provided access to the data from this study once all rando mized patients either complete the assessments for primary endpo ints at Week 16 (Visit 7) or discont inue from the study . The purpose of provi ding this access to a small group is to init iate work related to regulatory submissi on upon com pletion of the study . The study will not be terminated prem aturely on the basis of eitherefficacy or futilit y following th e Week 16 interim analys is. Although this is an interim analysis wit h respect to the entire study , it is the only and final analysis for the primary endpoint. Therefore ,no alpha adjustm ent for this interim analysis is planned . In addit ion, a limited number of pre -identified internal Lilly perso nnel that are not in contact with clinical sites m ay gain access to unblinded PK data, as specified in the unblinding plan, prior to final database lock, in order to init iate the final population PK model development processes. Unblinding details will be provi dedin the unblinding plan."

The new protocol is indicated by amendment (a) and will be used to conduct the study in place of any preceding versio n of the protocol. The primary changes in this amendment are: The m ajor secondary endpoint of DLQI (0,1) response at Week 16 has been revised per FDA feedback. Previously, DLQI (0,1) response was to be assessed in pat ients with baseline DLQI >1. Now, DLQI (0,1) response will include a 5- point reduction and be assessed in pat ients with baseline DLQI 5. Stricter di scont inuat ion language for cl inically significant sy stemic hypersensit ivity events has been applied throughout the protocol.

Two effect ive methods of contraception (such as male or female condoms with spermicide, diaphragms with spermicide or cervical sponges) will be used. Thepatientmay choose to use a double - barrier m ethod of contraception. Barri er protecti on methods without concomi tant use of a spermicide are not a reliable o r acceptable method. Thus, each barrier method must include use of a spermicide. It should be noted that the use of male and female condoms as a double -barrier method i s not considered acceptable due to the high failure rate when these methods are combin ed. ii. Of note, one of the two methods of contraception may be a highly effect ive (less than 1% failure rate) method of contraception (such as combinat ion oral contraceptives, implanted contraceptives or intrauterine devices). When local guidelines concerning highly effect ive or effect ive methods of birth control differ fro m the above, the local guidelines must be fo llowed.

Management of Hypersensitivity Events, Including Injection Site Events All biological agents carry the risk of systemic allergic/hypersensit ivity events. Clinical manifes tations of these events m ay include, but are not limit ed to the following: Skin rash Pruri tus (i tching)"
113,page_113,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 113 LY3074828Urticaria (hives) Angioedema (for example, swelling of the lips and/or tongue) Anaphylactic events. Sometimes, these events can be life threatening. Proteins may also cause redness, i tching , swelling, or pain locally at the inject ion site. Therefore ,all pat ients should be closely mo nitored for signs or symptoms that could result from such events, educated on the signs or symptoms of these types of events , and instructed to contact the study site immediately if any of the symptom s are experienced fo llowing an inject ion. If a patient experiences an acute hypersensit ivity event after an inject ion of invest igational product , he or she shoul dbe managed appropri ately and given instructions to receive relevant supportive care . Addit ionally , for an event j udged by the invest igator to be a potential systemic hypersensit ivity event, blood samples will be collected for PK, immunogenicit y, and ex ploratory hypersensit ivity analyses at, or as close as possible to: 1.the onset of the event 2.the resol ution of the event, and 3.30 (±3) day s following the event. Exploratory hypersensit ivity samples may , as appropri ate for the clinical presentation, be analyze d for try ptase (a m arker of basophil/mast cell act ivation), have a co mplement panel performed (asses immune complex formation), and have a cy tokine panel performed. a blood sam ple shoul d be drawn to test for anti -drug antibodies (ADAs; sS eealso Secti on9.4.4). Patients who develop clinically significant sy stemic hypersensit ivity events following administration of invest igational product , who do not respond to symptomat ic med ication or whose event results in clinical sequelae (for exam ple, hospi talizati on),shoul d be discont inued from the study and not receive further doses of investigational product, with or without prem edicat ion (see Secti on 8.2). Section 8.2. Discontinuation from the Study In addit ion, patients who meet any one of the follo wing criteria should be discontinued fro m the invest igational product , enter the Post -Treatment Follow-Up Peri od, and di scontinue from the study : Clinically significant sy stemic hypersensit ivity event following administration of invest igational product that does not respond to symptom atic medicat ion or resul ts in clinical sequelae ."

Physical Examination Physical examinat ion will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Activit ies (Secti on2). One co mplete physical examinat ion (excluding pelvic or rectal examinat ions),which includes heart, l ungs, peripheral lymph nodes, and abdo men,and visual examinat ion of all skin areas (including genitalia and breast areas) ,will be performed at screening .All physical examinat ions throughout the study shoul d include a symptom -directed evaluat ion,as well as examinat ion of heart, l ungs, peripheral lymph nodes, and abdo men,and visual examinat ion of all skin areas (including genitalia and breast areas). Section 9.4.5.2. Tuberculosis Screening Initial Screening: Screening for active or latent TB (LTBI) will include a history , physical examinat ion (Secti on9.4.5.1 ), chest x -ray (Secti on 9.4.5.3 ), and , except as noted below under “Prior Treatment for LTBI or TB,” testing by an interferon -release assay (IGRA; Quant iFERON ®-TB Gold or T -SPOT.TB ®) or a purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test. In people aged 5 y ears and over, IGRA is the preferred screening test for LTBI. In countries where the PPD is available and is preferred (in the judgment of the investigator) as an alternat ive screening test for LTBI, that test may be used instead of an IGRA. Patients wi th docum entati on of a negat ive IGRA or PPD within 3 months before init ial screening may not need to repeat TB testing at screening, based on the judgment of the invest igator. Source documentation must include the original laboratory report (for IGRA) or a record of the size in millim eters of the indurat ion response (for PPD). A PPD recorded as negative wit hout docum enting the size of indurat ion in millimeters, will not be acceptable and will require a retest. Monitoring: After init ial screening, tuberculosis testing will only be requ ired based on clinical assessment of TB ri sk (symptom s/signs/known or suspected TB exposure), and according to local regulat ions and/or local standard of care. Such clinical assessments should be conducted periodically, at least every 4 months."
117,page_117,"I6T-MC-AMAK(a) Clinical Protocol Page 117 LY3074828Interpreta tion of Screening Tests for LTBI The QuantiFERON -TB Gol d assay will be reported as negat ive, indeterminate, or posit ive.

A posi tive PPD is indicated with a skin test response 5mmof indurat ion, docum ented between approximately 48 and 72 hours after test applicat ion (regardl ess of BCG vaccinat ion history ). Patients who do not return within 48 to 72 hours of test administration will be required to have the test repeated and then in terpreted wi thin this time frame. Patients wi th a diagnosis of LTBI, based on a positive IGRA test result or a posit ive PPD response 5 mm of induration and no evidence of active TB, may be rescreened once if after they meet the fo llowing requi rements: Have received at least 4 weeks of appropriate ongoing prophylact ic therapy for LTBI as per local standard of care, and Have no evidence of treatment hepatotoxicit y (ALT and AST l evels must remain ≤2xULN) upon retesti ng of serum ALT and AST levels before r ando mizat ion.) Such patients must continue and co mplete appropriate LTBI therapy during the course of the study to rem ain eligible and must con tinue to m eet all other inclusi on and exclusio n criteria for participat ion. Follow -up TB testing with IGRA or PP D, tailored in accordance with a person’s risk (for example, hospital care worker, residence in a high risk location), may be performed according to local guidelines. Prior Treatment for LTBI or TB Patients who have a documented history of com pleting an ap propri ate TB prophylaxis or treatm ent regimen (consistent wi th Worl d Heal th Organizat ion and/or United States Centers for Disease Control at the time of treatment) , with no history of re-exposure since their treatments were com pleted and no evidence of act ive TB, are eligible to participate in the study ; these patients shoul d not undergo TB testing unless advised to do so based on local guidelines. Section 9.4.5.5. Hepatitis C Screening Patients who test posi tive for HCV antibody and have a posi tive con firmatory HCV RNA test at screening will be excluded. Patients wi th a previ ous diagnosi s of hepat itis C who have been treated with ant iviral therapy and achieved a sustained anti-virologic response may be eligible for inclusio n in the study , provi ded they have no detectable RNA on the screening HCV RNA test for this protocol. A sustained viro logic response is defined as an undetectable HCV RNA level, 12 weeks after completion of a full, documented course of an approved antiviral therapy for HCV. Patients who have spontaneously cleared HCV infection, defined as (i) a positive HCV antibody test and (ii) a negat iveHCV RNA test, with no history of anti-HCV treatm ent, m ay be eligible"
