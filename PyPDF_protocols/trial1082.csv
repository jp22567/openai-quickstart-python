Primary endpoints !Change in body weight (%) from baseline to week 56 !Proportion of subjects losing at least 5% of baseline body weight at week 56 Secondary objectives To establish the effects of liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. placebo, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, on relevant efficacy endpoints in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2DM treated with basal insulin and up to 2 OADs (metformin, glitazone, SGLT-2 inhibitor or sulphonylurea) To establish the safety and tolerability of liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. placebo, as an adjunct to a reduced- calorie diet and increased physical activity, in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2DM treated with basal insulin and up to 2 OADs (metformin, glitazone, SGLT-2 inhibitor or sulphonylurea) Key secondary endpoints !Proportion of subjects losing more than 10% of baseline body weight at week 56 Change from baseline to week 56 in: !Waist circumference !Systolic blood pressure !HbA 1c !Fasting plasma glucose !Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite for Clinical Trial Version (IWQoL-Lite for CT), physical functioning score !IWQoL-Lite for CT, mental/emotional functioning scoreCONFIDENTIAL"

Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 manner to receive either liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo, as an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity delivered as part of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program (in this document referred to as Intensive Behaviour Therapy [IBT]). Subjects treated with sulphonylurea will be stratified between the two arms. It is recommended that the dose of basal insulin is reduced by 15-20 % for all subjects with HbA 1c ≤ 8 % (at the investigator’s discretion) at randomisation, followed by weekly adjustment of insulin dose with the aim to achieve same pre-breakfast meal target plasma glucose as well as similar glycaemic control in the two treatment arms. Insulin dose should not be reduced for subjects with HbA1c > 8% to avoid unacceptable deterioration in glycaemic control. Trial population The planned number of subjects to be randomised is 400. Key inclusion criteria 1. Informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities. Trial-related activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the trial, including activities to determine suitability for the trial 2. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 3. Treatment with up to 2 OADs (metformin, glitazone, SGLT-2 inhibitor or sulphonylurea), 4. Stable treatment with basal insulin according to its label (no requirement of minimum or maximum dose) for at least 90 days prior to screening, as judged by the investigator 5. HbA 1c6.0-10.0% (both inclusive) 6. BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 7. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of signing informed consent Key exclusion criteria 1. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes 2. Known hypoglycaemic unawareness as indicated by the investigator according to Clarke’s questionnaire question 8 (see Section 8.2.3 ) 3. Recurrent severe hypoglycaemic episodes within the last year as judged by the investigator 4. Unable or unwilling to perform self-monitoring of plasma glucose according to the protocol and to keep a diabetes diary 5. Treatment with any hypoglycaemic medications other than OADs and basal insulin within the past 90 days prior to screeningCONFIDENTIAL"

In this document, the term investigator refers to the individual responsible for the overall conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. 3.1 Background information Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with oral antidiabetic medications (OADs) eventually require insulin to manage the progressive deterioration in glycaemic control3. However, weight gain commonly occurs with escalating insulin therapy, reducing patient satisfaction and treatment adherence 4. The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide is approved for the treatment of T2DM (1.2 mg and 1.8 mg) Victoza® and weight management (3.0 mg) Saxenda®. Through activation of the GLP-1 receptor, it stimulates insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and reduces appetite and energy intake. Results from the SCALE™ Diabetes trial demonstrated that liraglutide 3.0 mg, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, is effective for weight loss in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2DM treated with 0-3 OADs (metformin, glitazone, sulphonylurea), and associated with improved glycaemic control, reduction in the use of hypoglycaemic medications, and risk of hypoglycaemia comparable to what is seen with lower doses of liraglutide 5. 3.2 Rationale for the trial Previous results suggest that liraglutide 3.0 mg, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity might also be beneficial for patients with overweight or obesity and T2DM treated with basal insulin. Through its mechanisms of action, it is presumed to facilitate adherence to behaviour change, and by reducing body weight, improve physical functioning, such that increased physical activity is easier in those who cannot exercise initially6. Moreover, the anticipated lower insulin requirement with liraglutide vs. placebo is expected to further amplify weight loss and reduce exercise-related hypoglycaemia, both of which are barriers to effective and sustainable weight management. There is currently no data to support use of liraglutide 3.0 mg, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, for weight management in patients with T2DM treated with insulin 7-9. However, the combination of basal insulin and liraglutide 1.8 mg is approved for maintaining glycaemic control in patients with T2DM10, 11. For an assessment of benefits and risks of the trial, see Section 18.1CONFIDENTIAL"

Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 manner to receive either liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo, as an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity delivered as part of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program (in this document referred to as IBT) (see Figure 5–1 and Section 5.3.3 ). Subjects treated with sulphonylurea will be stratified between the two arms. It is recommended that the dose of basal insulin is reduced for all subjects by 15-20 % for subjects with HbA 1c≤ 8 % (at the investigator’s discretion) at randomisation, followed by weekly adjustment of insulin dose with the aim to achieve same pre-breakfast meal target plasma glucose as described in Section 5.3.2.2 , as well as similar glycaemic control in the two treatment arms. Insulin dose should not be reduced for subjects with HbA 1c> 8% at randomisation to avoid unacceptable deterioration in glycaemic control. Figure 5–1 Trial design Adjustment of insulin dose may be initiated one week after randomisation; however, in the first five weeks after randomisation, the basal insulin dose should not exceed the pre-trial dose and bolus insulin should not be initiated, unless deemed necessary by investigator to control unacceptable hyperglycaemia (see Section 5.3.2.2 ).

Subjects discontinuing randomised treatment prematurely are encouraged to stay in the trial and continue IBT, in alignment with current clinical recommendations12and to minimise missing data. However, if a discontinued subject do not wish to attend the IBT visits, the investigator should stillencourage the subject to come back for V24. Weekly dose escalation of the trial drug (see Section 5.3.1 ) is included in accordance with the Saxenda®prescribing information7-9. Based on the weight loss time course in SCALE Diabetes™ (subjects on 0-3 OADs), a trial duration of 56 weeks is considered sufficient to measure the majority of the weight loss curve13. A 30 day follow-up period for safety is included after the 56 weeks treatment period, in accordance with FDA guidance 14. In accordance with clinical guidelines12, 15 16, 17IBT consisting of frequent structured counselling, reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity is an integrated part of the trial design. Reduction of insulin dose at randomisation is recommended to avoid unnecessary hypoglycaemia associated with the trial’s interventions: 1. the lifestyle intervention which, through weight loss, will improve insulin sensitivity and consequently insulin requirements and/or 2. initiation of liraglutide 3.0 mg (Saxenda®), which has direct glucose-lowering effects. Conversely, insulin dose will be adjusted weekly starting one week after randomisation to avoid unnecessary hyperglycaemia associated with the initial reduction of insulin dose. This will primarily affect subjects in the placebo group, where lifestyle changes and weight loss are the main sources of improved glycaemic control. The dose of sulphonylurea may be reduced by 50% at investigator’s discretion in patients using this OAD since hypoglycaemic ev ents are more frequent when combining liraglutide with sulphonylurea than with other OADs. Furthermore, subjects treated with sulphonylurea will be stratified between the two arms. Weekly adjustment will also increase the likelihood of achieving similar glycaemic control in the two treatment arms. This is important since improvement/deterioration of glycaemic control directly impact insulin requirements and indirectly, through changes in insulin dose, body weight changes. For information on dose adjustment algorithm, see Section 5.3.2.2 .CONFIDENTIAL"

Dose escalation of trial product will take place during the first 4 weeks after randomisation (see Table 5–1 ). Table 5–1 Dose escalation and treatment period IMPDose Duration Liraglutide/placebo 0.6 mg 1 week Liraglutide/placebo 1.2 mg 1 week Liraglutide/placebo 1.8 mg 1 week Liraglutide/placebo 2.4 mg 1 week Liraglutide/placebo 3.0 mg 52 weeks Follow up period 0 mg 4 weeks If the subject does not tolerate an increased dose during the dose escalation window, the investigator can delay the dose escalation by maintaining the subject at the current dosage step for one additional week. Such a delay is allowed only once during dose escalation (i.e. maximum allowed time for complete dose escalation to 3.0 mg is 5 weeks). After reaching the maintenance dose (3.0 mg), the dose and dosing frequency should not be changed. If a single dose is missed, the once-daily regimen should be resumed as prescribed at the next scheduled dose. If more than 3 consecutive days have elapsed since the last dose, subject should re- initiate dose escalation, (e.g. restart the dosing at 0.6 mg and follow the dose escalation schedule again). This is done to reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with re- initiation of treatment. NB: Additional or increased dose should not be taken to make up for missed doses. Trial product can be taken at any time of day, irrespective of timing of meals. Trial product can be injected s.c. in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment. NB: Trial product must not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. If a subject cannot tolerate the 3.0 mg dose, or if any of the other treatment discontinuation criteria are met, then treatment with trial product must be discontinued. For treatment discontinuation reasons, please refer to Section 6.5. In case this happens, it is acceptable to restart trial product (at the discretion of investigator and according to the local clinical practice); the dose must be escalated according to the algorithm above, and date of restart and rationale must be documented in the CRF.CONFIDENTIAL"

Subjects treated with dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors are excluded from participating in the trial since DPP-IV inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists should not be combined. To mitigate sulphonylurea induced hypoglycaemia, subjects treated with sulphonylurea may be at randomisation be asked to reduce the sulphonylurea dose by 50% at investigator’s discretion. The type and dose of other OADs must be kept constant throughout the trial, unless unacceptable hypoglycaemia occurs and cannot be managed by reduction of the basal insulin dose. In case the type of OAD becomes unavailable during the course of the trial, it is allowed per the discretion of the investigator to shift to an alternative treatment within the same class. 5.3.2.2 Treatment with insulin throughout the trial Any approved and marketed basal insulin (NPH insulin or insulin analogue) is allowed, at any dose, if used according to its prescribing information at screening. Once-daily or twice-daily dosing is allowed, according to dosing schedule at baseline. To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with liraglutide 3.0 mg and lifestyle intervention, it is recommended that the dose of basal insulin is reduced by 15-20 % for subjects with HbA 1c≤8 % (at investigator’s discretion) at randomisation. Furthermore, the basal dose should not exceed the pre-trial insulin dose in the first five weeks of liraglutide escalation, unless deemed necessary by investigator to treat unacceptable hyperglycaemia. During the trial, subjects will be required to perform self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) on 3 consecutive days, each week prior to basal insulin adjustment and enter the values into the subject diabetes diary. In the weeks where no site visits are planned, subjects will adjust their insulin dose themselves, according to the algorithm described below ( Table 5–2 , Table 5–3 , and Table 5–4 ). These algorithms are provided to the subject in the diary and is part of the diabetes diary training. In the weeks where phone- or face-to-face contact is conducted, investigator will review previous self-adjustments, and perform adjustment for the current week. The insulin dose adjustments recorded in the diabetes diary, must be entered in the electronic case report form (eCRF).CONFIDENTIAL"

To this end, reaching similar levels of glycaemic control is important, regardless of background medication. Therefore, trial subjects are encouraged, as appropriate, to adjust insulin doses according to the below algorithm – with dose increase based on the mean of the three pre-breakfast SMPGs measured, and dose decrease based on at least one of the three pre- breakfast plasma glucose values equal to or below 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Subject using once daily basal insulin will measure SMPG before breakfast and adjust their dose based on the 3 SMPGs measured on three consecutive days prior to dose adjustment. It is recommended to adjust the basal insulin dose once weekly at the investigator’s discretion.

These are the steps to take in situations where maximum fasting glycaemic control has been achieved and overall glycaemic control is still sub-optimal, and the investigator judges that bolus insulin is a necessary safety precaution. Once bolus insulin is initiated, subjects will start measuring 4 SMPGs – pre-breakfast, pre-lunch, pre-dinner and at bedtime, on three consecutive days a week, prior to dose adjustment. It is recommended to adjust the bolus insulin dose once weekly at the investigator’s discretion.

The content of the IBT is based on an abbreviated version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)18 19employing the 5A counselling framework (Ask, Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist)20, 21. IBT will be delivered by a registered dietician or similarly qualified healthcare professional according to local standard. The individual performing the IBT is called interventionist in this protocol. Interventionists will be trained in obesity and its behavioural management, prior to beginning the trial and will be provided on-going assistance and share better practice in how to perform IBT during the trial. Subjects will attend a total of 23 counselling sessions during the 56 weeks period. The structure and content of each IBT session is specified in an IBT guide , consisting of an interventionist part and a subject hand out. Generally each IBT session will begin with the subject being weighed and informed of the weight change. Then the subject and interventionist will review the subject’s completion of food and physical activity records (see Section 8.6.2 ) and the interventionist will assist with solving individual problems. In addition to the above, each IBT session will cover a specific topic, for example, advice on diet or physical activity as well as lifestyle modification (e.g., challenging negative thoughts, obtaining social support). Most of the topics will be accompanied by a homework assignment from the IBT guide to be completed before the next session with the interventionist. IBT sessions that cannot be completed on-site (because of illness, travel, etc.), may be completed by phone. However, this will be allowed only in exceptional cases. Calorie targets Caloric deficit and diet composition are aligned with clinical evidence-based guidelines for management of overweight and obesity in adults16. Daily caloric target throughout the trial for subjects should be based on body weight at randomisation: !Subjects weighing less than 200 lb (~90 kg) will be prescribed a diet of 1200 kcal/day !Subjects weighing between 200 lb and 300 lb (~135 kg) will be prescribed a diet calculated as:                     (    )=         ℎ  (  )∗6 (    /  )or                      (    )=         ℎ  (  )∗13.23 (    /  ) !Subjects weighing more than 300 lb will be prescribed 1800 kcal/dayCONFIDENTIAL"

If a subject ach ieves a body mass index (BMI)≤ 22 kg/m2, the recommended energy intake will be re-calculated with no caloric deficit for the remainder of the trial. The diet will consist of conventional foods with approximately 15-20% kcal from protein, 20-35% from fat, and the remainder from carbohydrate. Carbohydrate intake should be monitored by the interventionist. Carbohydrate intake from vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes and dairy products should be advised22. Subjects will be instructed to record their food and calorie intake daily (see Section 8.6.2 ). Physical activity targets All subjects will initially be prescribed 100 minutes physical activity per week (e.g., walking or similar aerobic activity). Subjects should be physically active in bouts of >10 minutes in duration with moderate intensity (such as brisk walking), and the physical activity should be spread equally across 4-5 days each week. Physical activity should progress gradually by 25 minutes every 4 weeks until 250 minutes/week, consistent with targets required for maintenance of lost weight22. Subjects will be instructed to record their physical activity daily, see Section 8.6.1 .18, 20. 5.4 Treatment after discontinuation of trial product When discontinuing trial products, the subject may be switched to a suitable marketed product at the discretion of the investigator. After premature discontinuation of trial product (temporary/permanent), the subject should still remain in the trial and follow the IBT sessions and site visits if possible, see Section 8.1. In this case, the investigator must note down the current treatment in the medical record and eCRF. If the subject has re-started the trial product, the investigator must note down details in the medical record and eCRF, see Section 5.3.1 . 5.5 Rationale for treatment Subjects are treated for a period of 56 weeks in order to be able to evaluate the full effect of treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg on the primary and secondary endpoints. The comparator in the trial is placebo in order to evaluate the absolute safety and efficacy of liraglutide 3.0 mg. Combining frequent behavioural counselling, highly structured hypo-caloric diets and increased physical activity is an effective tool for achieving and maintaining weight loss. It has been shown to be more effective than less intensive lifestyle modification programs for inducing weight loss23, and CONFIDENTIAL"

Subjects should stay in the trial regardless of adherence to randomised treatment, adherence to visit schedule or missing assessments. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial or withdraw consent are considered as withdrawn from the trial (see Section 6.6). The subject may be prematurely discontinued from trial product at the discretion of the investigator due to a safety concern.

Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial of an approved or non-approved investigational medicinal product See Section 8.1for procedures to be performed for subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely. It is allowed for subjects meeting the premature discontinuation criteria or who have wished to discontinue prematurely to be restarted on the trial product should the suspicion not be confirmed or if the condition has been resolved at the investigator’s discretion. Trial product may be restarted for subjects meeting discontinuation criteria 8 should the gallbladder be removed. 6.6 Withdrawal from trial The subject may withdraw consent at will at any time. The subject’s request to withdraw from the trial must always be respected. See Section 8.1for procedures to be performed for subjects withdrawing consent. The trial drug cannot be re-initiated if the consent has been withdrawn. For Mexico: Should the subject, his/her family members, parents, or legal representative decide to withdraw the consent for participation in the trial, the subject will be entitled to receive appropriate, free of charge medical care and/or trial drug during the follow up period of the protocol when it will be established with certainty that no untoward medical consequences of the subject´s participation in the research occurred. 6.7 Subject replacement Subjects who discontinue trial product prematurely will not be replaced. 6.8 Rationale for trial population Subjects with overweight or obesity and T2DM treated with any basal insulin (with or without up to 2 OADs) were selected for this trial, in alignment with the trial objective. While previously shown to be efficacious and generally well-tolerated in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2DM treated with 0-3 OADs, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, liraglutide 3.0 mg has not previously been studied in subjects with overweight or obesity with T2DM treated with basal insulin. Due to insulin resistance, these patients are often difficult to treat and require high insulin doses to maintain glycaemic control. Escalating insulin dose results in weight gain and reduced patient satisfaction and treatment adherence4. By contrast, weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and reduces the use of concomitant diabetes medication (including insulin) and related cost25, but may be difficult to achieve by lifestyle intervention alone26. To reflect clinical practice, all types of basal insulin products are allowed, at any dose and dosing regimen. Likewise, OAD commonly used by subjects treated with basal insulin will be allowed as CONFIDENTIAL"

Subjects are included after treatment with basal insulin for at least 90 days in order to reach effective dose. Subjects treated with DPP-IV inhibitors are excluded from participating in the trial since DPP-IV inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists should not be combined. Improvement in glycaemic control is not the main focus of this trial (design aimed at achieving similar glycaemic control in both treatment arms), but in recognition of the anticipated glucose- lowering associated with treatment, approximately 1.3% from baseline in the SCALE diabetes trial13, a minimum entry HbA 1cof 6% is required. Likewise, a maximum entry HbA 1cwill allow for inclusion of patients at high unmet need for weight loss, improvement in glycaemic control and insulin dose reduction. The anticipated lower insulin dose requirement with liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. placebo is expected to further amplify weight loss whilst also reducing freque ncy of hypoglycaemia, both of which reduce exercise-related hypoglycaemia27, 28. These are normally considered barriers to effective and sustainable weight management in patients with insulin-treated T2DM.CONFIDENTIAL"

End of trial is defined as last subject last visit (LSLV). Recruitment The screening and randomisation rate will be followed closely via the interactive web response system (IWRS) in order to estimate when to stop screening. All investigators will be notified immediately when the recruitment period ends, after which no further subjects may be screened and the IWRS will be closed for further screening. All subjects screened during the recruitment period and found eligible for randomisation can be randomised within the timelines specified in the flow chart, see Section 2. Trial registration Information of the trial will be disclosed at clinicaltrials.gov and novonordisk-trials.com. According to the Novo Nordisk Code of Conduct for Clinical Trial Disclosure29, it will also be disclosed according to other applicable requirements such as those of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) 30, the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act31, European Commission Requirements32, 33and other relevant recommendations or regulations. If a subject requests to be included in the trial via the Novo Nordisk e-mail contact at these web sites, Novo Nordisk may disclose the investigator’s contact details to the subject.

These are also included in the flow chart, see Section 2. Informed consent must be obtained before any trial-related activity; see Section 18.2. The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. Only subjects who have signed the informed consent form should be included on the logs. The subject screening log and subject enrolment log may be combined in one log. At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address(es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to return the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. Each subject will be assigned a unique 6-digit subject number which will remain the same throughout the trial. Fasting requirements The subjects should be fasting when attending some visits, please see flow chart (Section 2). Fasting is defined as at least 8 hours without food and drink intake, except water and other prescribed medication. Trial product and other glucose lowering agents should be withheld on the day of the visit until blood sampling have been performed. If the subject attends a fasting visit in a non-fasting state the blood sampling should be re-scheduled within the visit window. Screening failures For screening failures, the screening failure form in the electronic case report form (eCRF) must be completed with the reason for not continuing in the trial. Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed by the investigator into the eCRF. Follow-up on SAEs must be carried out according to Section 12. A screening failure session must be made in the IWRS. The case book must be signed. Re-screening is NOT allowed if the subject has failed one of the inclusion, exclusion, or randomisation criteria, this includes re-sampling if the subject has failed one of the inclusion or exclusion criteria related to laboratory parameters.CONFIDENTIAL"

If a subject meets a discontinuation criterion, the trial product must be immediately discontinued and the date should be noted in the medical records and eCRF. Discontinuation can be either temporary or permanent. The last paragraph of Section 6.5outlines which discontinuation can be considered temporary. The investigator must also note down the date in the medical record and eCRF once there is resolution and the subject has re-started the trial product. The subject may also wish to discontinue trial product temporarily or permanently, irrespective meeting any criteria. Discontinuation of treatment with trial product, whether temporary or permanent, must not prompt the investigator to withdraw the subject from the trial. Instead, the subject should maintain adherence to trial visits and procedures to the extent possible. In cases where the subject is not willing to attend all scheduled visits after discontinuation of trial product, efforts must be made to collect as much of the scheduled data as possible. Especially important is collection of the data points (primarily) at visit 24 (week 56). Statistical considerations emphasizing the importance can be found in Section 17. Premature trial product discontinuation should be registered in the eCRF and in IWRS. The trial product can be interrupted by performing a ‘treatment status’ session in IWRS, to indicate subject should no longer receive trial product. The primary reason for discontinuation of trial product must be specified when recording the treatment discontinuation in the eCRF. If the discontinuation of trial product is judged permanent or of a longer period, drug accountability until discontinuation must be performed in IWRS. If the subject has previously discontinued trial product, it is possible, at the discretion of the investigator and at the wish of the subject, to re-initiate treatment with trial product. This will only apply if it can be confirmed that the subject has not withdrawn consent, does not fulfil any of the criteria, leading to permanent discontinuation or if a criterion leading to temporary discontinuation has been resolved. A ’treatment status’ session is performed in the IWRS, to indicate that the subject should again receive trial product. See Section 10for registration in IWRS. This should be further noted in the medical records and eCRF. Withdrawal from trial A subject who wishes to withdraw their consent must be withdrawn from the trial. If a subject wants to withdraw consent, the investigator must aim to undertake procedures similar to those for end-of-treatment visit, as soon as possible. If the subject agrees, the follow-up visit must be performed at least 30 days after discontinuation of trial product.CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator must perform a ‘treatment status’ session in IWRS and discontinue trial product for this subject. The case book must be signed. Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing consent, the investigator must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject’s rights. Where the reasons are obtained, the primary reason for withdrawing consent must be specified in the end-of-trial form in the eCRF. Lost to follow-up If a subject loses contact with the study staff or does not come for visit 24 or visit 25, attempts must be made to locate the subject and obtain relevant safety information. A subject cannot be deemed lost to follow-up until at least substantial contacts with family/relatives/family physician have been attempted. Subject information maybe retrieved from other health care professionals, medical records or publicly available records. A subject will only be considered lost to follow-up in case vital status cannot be determined at the time of visit 25 for that subject. 8.2 Subject-related information/assessments 8.2.1 Demography Demography will be recorded at screening and consists of: !Date of birth (according to local regulation) !Sex !Ethnicity (according to local regulation) !Race (according to local regulation) 8.2.2 Diabetes history and diabetes complications Diabetes history and diabetes complications will be recorded at screening and consists of: !Date of diagnosis of T2DM !Information regarding diabetes complications including date of onset in case of: oDiabetic retinopathy oDiabetic neuropathy oDiabetic nephropathy oMacroangiopathy (including peripheral vascular disease) Diabetes history and diabetes complications, must be recorded on the designated form.CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator must ask the subject in the following way: “To what extent can you tell by your symptoms that your blood glucose is low?” The subject can answer never, rarely, sometimes, often or always. Subjects answering ‘never, rarely or sometimes’ are considered as having reduced awareness of hypoglycaemia. 8.2.4 Concomitant illness and medical history A concomitant illness is any illness that is present at the start of the trial (i.e. at the screening visit) or found as a result of a screening procedure or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product. The disease under investigation (T2DM) should not be entered as it is captured under diabetes history and diabetes complications. Medical history is a medical event that the subject has experienced in the past. Only relevant and significant medical history as judged by the investigator should be recorded. Findings of specific medical history described below should only be entered on the specific forms. The information collected for concomitant illness and medical history should include diagnosis, date of onset and date of resolution or continuation, as applicable. Any change to a concomitant illness should be recorded during the trial. This also includes changes to diabetes history and diabetes complications. Any clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness must be reported as an AE. It must be possible to verify the subject’s medical history in source documents, such as subject’s medical record. If a subject is not from the investigator’s own practice; the investigator must make reasonable effort to obtain a copy of subject’s medical record from relevant party (e.g., primary physician). The investigator must document any attempt to obtain external medical information by noting the date(s) when information was requested and who has been contacted.

The value must be used to evaluate eligibility of the subject in relation to exclusion criterion. The method for measuring systolic and diastolic blood pressure needs to follow the standard clinical practice at site, but as a minimum, the following guideline must be adhered to: Avoid caffeine, smoking and exercise at least 30 minutes prior to measuring the blood pressure. Blood pressure should be measured in a sitting position, with the legs uncrossed, the back and arms supported. The subject should be sitting for five minutes before the measurement is taken. The same arm and an appropriate cuff size should be used for blood pressure measurements at all visits. 8.3.7 Self-measured plasma glucose At visit 1, subjects will be provided with a blood glucose (BG) meter including auxiliaries as well as instructions for use. Only the BG meter provided by Novo Nordisk should be used for the measurements required in the protocol. The subjects will be instructed in how to use the device and the instruction should be repeated at regular intervals as needed. The BG meters use test strips calibrated to plasma values. Therefore, all measurements performed with capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma-equivalent glucose values, which will be shown on the display. Subjects should be instructed in how to record the results of the SMPG values in the diabetes diaries. The record of each SMPG value should include date, time and value. This data should not be entered into the eCRF. The SMPGs should be measured to ensure data for insulin adjustment (see Section 5.3.2.2 ) and to record 7-point SMPG profile (see Section 8.3.8 ). In addition, SMPG values are also measured for collecting and reporting hypoglycaemic episodes (see Section 8.4.4 ). The subject may measure additional values at the discretion of the investigator. 8.3.8 7-point SMPG profile Subjects will be instructed to perform a 7-point SMPG profile prior to randomisation and at selected visits as specified in the flow chart (see Section 2). The 7-point profile should be recorded the day before the site visit. The SMPGs should be measured and recorded in the diary at the time points listed in Table 8–1 . The record of each SMPG must include date, actual time point and the plasma glucose value. Data must be transcribed into the eCRF during or following the site visit. If a discrepancy is later detected, the values in the eCRF must be corrected.CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator should review the subject’s insulin dose as specified in Section 8.1. Results of the subject’s SMPG measurements should be noted in the diabetes diary and total daily injected dose of basal/bolus insulin prior to each contact will be transcribed into the eCRF and based on these, dose adjustment guidance will be provided. All adjustments of insulin dose level will be captured in the eCRF. From visit 2 and until follow-up, the investigator should record the subject’s total daily injected dose of insulin (basal/bolus) prior to each visit in the eCRF. 8.3.10 Clinical outcome assessments Clinical outcome assessments (COA) are used to collect clinical data for all subjects enrolled in the trial at the visits specified in Section 2. The questionnaires are linguistically validated to the fluent language of all subjects participating. The questionnaires must be completed by the subject and should preferably be completed after conclusion of all fasting-related activities, but before any other visit-related activities. Subjects should be given the opportunity to complete the questionnaires by themselves without interruption. Each of the questionnaires takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.CONFIDENTIAL"

Alongside this trial in another project, Novo Nordisk is adapting the IWQoL-Lite for CT by conducting additional concept elicitation with patients, cognitive interviewing, consultation with expert clinicians, translatability assessment, and psychometric validation. Development and validation process is aligned with the FDA PRO guidance (2009) 36. Short Form 36 v2.0 acute Short Form 36 v2.0 acute (SF-36) is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. SF-36 measures the subject’s overall Health Related Quality of Life on 8 domains: physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health37. In addition, SF-36 is included to validate the outcome of IWQoL-Lite for CT and WRSSquestionnaires. Patients’ global impression of change The patients’ global impression of change (PGI-C) assesses subjects’ impressions of change during the clinical trial. It is used to establish the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) as part of the psychometric properties of the WRSS questionnaire. Patients’ global impression of status The patients’ global impression of status (PGI-S) assesses subjects’ impressions of status at the time in the clinical trial. It is used to establish the MCID as part of the psychometric properties of the WRSS questionnaire. Weight related sign and symptom measure The WRSS measures the presence and bothersome associated with weight related signs and symptoms. It is a tool to assess the multifaceted aspects of obesity on symptom experience in subjects with obesity. In this trial, Novo Nordisk is validating the WRSS.

Upon onset of a hypoglycaemic episode the subject is recommended to measure plasma glucose every 15 minutes until the SMPG value is >3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved in accordance with current guidelines34. A SMPG value ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or hypoglycaemic symptoms must trigger a hypoglycaemic episode form to be completed by the subject. Repeated SMPG measurements and/or symptoms, occurring within a period of 60 minutes after onset on a hypoglycaemic episode, will by default be considered as one hypoglycaemic episode until a succeeding SMPG value is >3.9mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved and should be reported on one hypoglycaemic episode form.

If a subject is found to be non-compliant, the investigator will remind the subject of the importance of following the instructions given including taking the trial products as prescribed. Compliance with trial product: At each visit the investigator should ask the subject whether the subject has continuously been using the trial product since last visit. If the subject has stopped using trial product, the investigator should fill in the date for the last dose in the eCRF. If the subject has had a pause using trial product longer than one week since last visit, but has started using trial product again, the investigator should fill in the dates corresponding to the last day on trial product and the first day on trial product in the eCRF. 8.8 Additional safety assessments 8.8.1 Suspicion of acute pancreatitis If pancreatitis is suspected, trial product must promptly be discontinued (no ‘treatment status’ session should be made in IWRS, before diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed) and appropriate management should be initiated. Appropriate additional examinations must be performed, including local measurement of amylase and lipase. The event must be reported as an AE requiring additional data collection (see Section 8.4.3.2 and Section 12). The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features: !Abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back) !Serum lipase activity (and/or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal !Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging (CT/MRI). Abdominal pain Most patients with acute pancreatitis experience abdominal pain that is located generally in the epigastrium and radiates to the back. The onset of the pain may be swift reaching maximum intensity within 30 minutes; it is frequently unbearable and characteristically persists for more than 24 hours without relief. The pain is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination usually reveals severe upper abdominal tenderness at times associated with guarding. CONFIDENTIAL"

The serum lipase may remain elevated slightly longer than amylase. The level of the serum amylase and/or lipase does not correlate with the severity of acute pancreatitis. In general, serum lipase is thought to be more sensitive and specific than serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. If acute pancreatitis is confirmed, the subject must be permanently discontinued from the trial product. Appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated. Furthermore, the subject should be encouraged to remain in the trial (see Section 8.1). If acute pancreatitis is ruled out, trial product should be re-initiated at the investigator’s discretion. 8.8.2 Suspicion of acute gallstone disease In case of suspicion of acute gallstone disease or cholelithiasis, the trial product must promptly be discontinued (no ‘treatment status’ session should be made in IWRS before a diagnosis of acute gallstone disease is confirmed). Appropriate treatment and careful monitoring should be initiated. Furthermore, the subject should remain in the trial (see Section 8.1) The event must be reported as an AE requiring additional data collection (see Section 8.4.3.2 and Section 12). If acute gallstone disease is confirmed, the trial product must be permanently discontinued. However, trial product can be restarted at the investigator´s discretion if cholelithiasis is ruled out or the gallbladder has been removed. Appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated. Furthermore, the subject should be encouraged to remain in the trial (see Section 8.1). 8.8.3 Neoplasm In case of neoplasm, please consider if the trial drug should be discontinued (no ‘treatment status’ session should be made in IWRS before a diagnosis is confirmed). The event must be reported as an AE requiring additional data collection (see Section 8.4.3.2 and Section 12). Appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated. Furthermore, the subject should be encouraged to remain in the trial (see Section 8.1).

Thereafter, repeat testing (at central laboratory) of ALT, AST, ALP, INR and total bilirubin should be done regularly until the abnormalities return to normal or baseline state. Additional clinical information such as related symptoms, risk factors and contributing conditions (e.g. viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, hepatobiliary or pancreatic disorders) should be gathered to seek a possible cause of the observed laboratory test abnormalities. Although the trial product is discontinued, no ‘treatment status’ session should be made in IWRS and the subject should remain in the trial. In case of suspicion of DILI, the trial product must promptly be discontinued (no ‘treatment status’ session should be made in IWRS before a diagnosis is confirmed). The event must be reported as an AE requiring additional data collection (see Section 8.4.3.2 and Section 12). If DILI is confirmed, the subject should permanently discontinue the trial product. Appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated. Furthermore, the subject should be encouraged to remain in the trial (see Section 8.1). Trial product can be re-initiated at the investigator´s discretion if diagnosis of DILI is not supported. 8.8.5 Depression, suicidal ideation/behaviour In case of depression or suicidal ideation/behaviour, please consider if the trial drug should be discontinued (no ‘treatment status’ session should be made in IWRS before a diagnosis is confirmed). The event must be reported as an AE requiring additional data collection (see Section 8.4.3.2 and Section 12). Appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated as per local clinical practice.

The IWRS will allocate trial product to the subject at randomisation and each dispensing visit. The correct dispensing unit number(s) (DUN[s]) must be dispensed to the subject. The investigator or delegated person is responsible for ensuring that: !Drug accountability is performed using the IWRS drug accountability module !Subjects are instructed to return all used, partly used and unused trial product including empty packaging material at each dispensing visit and at end-of-treatment visit Returned trial product (used/partly used and/or unused), expired or damaged trial product can be stored at room temperature and must be stored separately from non-allocated trial product. Non-allocated trial products including expired or damaged products must be accounted as unused at the latest at closure of the trial site. Dispensed trial product must be accounted for at pen level; either recorded as used/partly used, unused or lost. Distributed and returned pens are subject to be sent for destruction, thus may not be re-allocated to new subjects. Destruction of trial products can be performed on an on-going basis and will be done according to local procedures after accountability is finalised and reconciled by the monitor. Destruction of products must be documented in the IWRS. 9.5 Auxiliary supplies Auxiliary supplies comprise supplies other than trial products. The following auxiliary supplies will be provided by Novo Nordisk in accordance with the TMM: !Needles for pre-filled pen (maximum length to be used is 8 mm) !Directions for use for pre-filled pen !Blood glucose (BG) meter !BG auxiliaries including test strips, lancets, instructions and control solution.

Access to the IWRS must be restricted to and controlled by authorised persons. IWRS is used for: !Screening !Screening failure !Randomisation !Medication arrival !Dispensing !Treatment status !Code break !Drug accountability !Data change IWRS user manuals will be provided to each trial site. Premature treatment discontinuation and re-initiation If the investigator or the subject has decided to discontinue treatment, but the subject has not withdrawn consent, it is possible to re-initiate treatment, if no discontinuation criteria are met (see Section 8.1). The subject will remain in the same treatment arm, and a new dose escalation period will be started, if the subject resumes treatment. The investigator must make a note and record dates of any discontinuation and re-initiation dates in the medical records and eCRF. To register discontinuation of trial product (temporary or permanent), a ’treatment status’ session is performed in the IWRS, to indicate subject should no longer receive trial product. Similarly, if the treatment should later be re-initiated, a ’treatment status’ session is performed in the IWRS, to indicate subject should again receive trial product. Withdrawal In the case subject has withdrawn consent, a ‘treatment status’ session must be performed in IWRS, to indicate that subject should no longer receive trial product. If possible after confirmation by the monitor, the subject will be registered as ‘withdrawal’, to ensure that subject is not allowed to re- initiate trial product. If the subject is temporarily lost to follow up during the trial, the IWRS session should not be completed until the scheduled Visit 24 at week 56 to confirm the final status.CONFIDENTIAL"

The eligible subjects will be randomised centrally 1:1 to either liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo. In addition, the subjects will be stratified between the two arms. 11.1 Breaking of blinded codes The IWRS will notify Novo Nordisk (monitor and the Global Safety department) immediately after the code is broken. The code for a particular subject may be broken in a medical emergency if knowing the actual treatment would influence the treatment of the subject. Whenever a code is broken, the person breaking the code must print the Code Break Confirmation Notification generated by the IWRS, record the reason, and sign and date the document. When the code is broken, the treatment allocation will be accessible to the investigator and the Novo Nordisk Global Safety department. If IWRS is not accessible at the time of code break, the IWRS helpdesk should be contacted. Contact details are listed in Attachment I .

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. An AE includes: !A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. !A CLAE: a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e., an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example, change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. The following should not be reported as AEs: !Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product (pre-existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). !Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. !Non-serious hypoglycaemia is an AE, but is reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form instead of an AE form 8.4.4 The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: !Severity –Mild – no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Moderate – marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Severe – considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities; unacceptable. !Causality Relationship between an AE and the relevant trial product (s): –Probable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. –Possible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. –Unlikely - The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product.CONFIDENTIAL"

This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. –Recovered/resolved with sequelae - The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets a SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as a SAE. –Not recovered/not resolved - The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. –Fatal - This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as a SAE. –Unknown - This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. 12.1.2 Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: !Death. !A life-threateningaexperience. !In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. !A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. !A congenital anomaly or birth defect. !Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be considered a SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. a.The term “life threatening” in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. b.The term “hospitalisation” is used when a subject: – Is admitted to a hospital or in-patient, irrespective of the duration of physical stay, or – Stays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hours Medical judgement must always be exercised, and when in doubt, the hospital contact should be regarded as a hospitalisation.

Note: Use of wrong DUN is not considered a medication error !Wrong route of administration, such as intramuscular instead of s.c. !Administration of an overdose with the intention to cause harm, misuse or abuse of trial product !Accidental administration of a lower or higher dose than intended. That is a dose lower or higher than 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.0 mg respectively (within 24 hours). However, the administered dose must deviate from the intended dose to an extent where clinical consequences for the trial subject were likely to happen as judged by the investigator, although they did not necessarily occur If the subject discontinues trial product prematurely, this should not be reported as a medication error.

This includes events from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent until the end of the post-treatment follow-up period (30 days). The events must be recorded in the applicable eCRF forms in a timely manner, see timelines below in Figure 12–1 . During each contact with the trial site staff, the subject must be asked about AEs and technical complaints, for example, by asking: “Have you experienced any problems since the last contact?” In addition, the subject should be asked about the mood for example – ‘How has your mood been since the last contact?’ All AEs, observed by the investigator or subject, must be reported by the investigator and evaluated.CONFIDENTIAL"

Novo Nordisk may need to report this adverse event to relevant regulatory authorities. 12.3 Follow-up of adverse events The investigator must record follow-up information by updating the forms in the eCRF. Follow-up information must be reported to Novo Nordisk according to the following: !SAEs: All SAEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovered/resolved”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “fatal”, and until all queries have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved”. Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow-up period and is expected by the investigator to recover. The SAE follow-up information should only include new (e.g., corrections or additional) information and must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s first knowledge of the information. This is also the case for previously non-serious AEs which subsequently become SAEs. !Non-serious AEs: Non-serious AEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved” or “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or until the end of the follow-up period stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved”. Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow-up period and is expected by the investigator to recover. The investigator must ensure that the recording of the worst case severity and seriousness of an event is kept throughout the trial. A worsening of an unresolved AE must be reported as follow up with re-assessment of severity and/or seriousness of the event. Queries or follow-up requests from Novo Nordisk must be responded to within 14 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request, unless otherwise specified in the follow-up request. SAEs after end of trial: If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the investigational medicinal product occurring to a subject after the subject has ended the trial, the investigator should report this SAE within the same timelines as for SAEs during the trial.

This system and support services to the system will be provided by an external supplier. Ensure that all relevant questions are answered, and that no empty data field exists. If a test or an assessment has not been done and will not be available, or if the question is irrelevant (e.g. is not applicable), indicate this according to the data entry instructions. The following will be provided as paper CRFs: !Pregnancy forms The following will be provided as paper CRFs to be used when access to the eCRF is revoked or if the eCRF is unavailable: !AE forms !Safety information forms !Technical complaint forms (also to be used to report complaints that are not subject related. e.g. discovered at trial site before allocation) On the paper CRF forms print legibly, using a ballpoint pen. Ensure that all questions are answered, and that no empty data blocks exist. Ensure that no information is recorded outside the data blocks. If a test/assessment has not been done and will not be available, indicate this by writing “ND” (not done) in the appropriate answer field in the CRF. If the question is irrelevant (e.g. is not applicable) indicate this by writing “NA” (not applicable) in the appropriate answer field. Further guidance can be obtained from the instructions in the CRF. The investigator must ensure that all information is consistent with the source documentation. By electronically signing the case book in the eCRF, the investigator confirms that the information in the eCRF and related forms is complete and correct. 13.1 Corrections to case report forms Corrections to the eCRF data may be made by the investigator or the investigator’s delegated staff. An audit trail will be maintained in the eCRF application containing as a minimum: the old and the new data, identification of the person entering the data, date and time of the entry and reason for the correction.

The first monitoring visit will be performed as soon as possible after FSFV at the trial site and no later than 4 weeks after. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the eCRFs, the trial site's recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site to the protocol and GCP, but will not exceed 12 weeks until LSLV at the trial site. The monitor must be given direct access to all source documents (original documents, data and records). The monitor will ensure that the eCRFs are completed. Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition, the relevant trial site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g., by telephone). All data must be verifiable in source documentation other than the eCRF. For all data recorded, the source document must be defined in a source document agreement at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any time for any data element. The following data will be source data verified for screening failures: !date for obtaining informed consent !reason for screening failure !SAEs (if any) Source data generated by the trial site can be corrected by a person other than the person entering the source data if accepted by local regulations; any correction must be explained, signed and dated by the person making the correction. The original of the completed diaries or assessment tools must not be removed from the trial site. The COAs are completed electronically, thus entries at the site- pads are source data and a copy of the entries should be provided to site. The monitor will ensure that the eCRFs are completed and that paper CRFs are collected. Monitors will review the subject’s medical records and other source data to ensure consistency and/or identify omissions compared to the eCRF. If discrepancies are found, the investigator must be questioned about these. A follow-up letter (paper or electronic) will be sent to the investigator following each monitoring visit. This should address any action to be taken.CONFIDENTIAL"

Superiority will be claimed if the two-sided p-value is less than 5% and the estimated treatment difference/ratio favours liraglutide 3.0 mg.

Definition of primary endpoint: % weight change Change in body weight (%) from baseline to week 56, denoted % weight change, is calculated as body weight at week 56 minus body weight at baseline divided by body weight at baseline and multiplied by 100; therefore % weight change= (body weight at week 56 – body weight at baseline) body weight at baseline ×100. A negative value of % weight change indicates a body weight loss from baseline to week 56. Definition of primary endpoint: 5% responders The proportion of subjects having lost at least 5% of baseline body weight at week 56, denoted 5% responders, is defined as the proportion having % weight change ≤ –5%.

Efficacy estimand In addition, an efficacy estimand ( de jure ) is quantifying the average effect of liraglutide 3.0 mg relative to placebo 56 weeks after randomisation, as adjunct to reduced caloric diet and increased physical activity, if all randomised subjects had adhered to the assigned treatment regimen for the entire planned duration of the trial.

The two primary endpoints and all confirmatory secondary endpoints will be tested in a hierarchical order. The study design is a 1:1 randomisation, stratified by sulphonylurea (yes/no) with 400 subjects in total (200 subjects in each arm). The sample size calculation does not take stratification into account. Please see Table 17–2 for general specifications on sample size and power calculation. Table 17–2 General specifications for sample size and power calculation Endpoint Statistical test Minimum required power (%) % weight change Two-group Satterthwaite unpooled ttest on the mean difference with α=0.05 assuming unequal variances90.0 (marginal) 5% responders Pearson chi-square test for two independent proportions with α=0.0590.0 (marginal) α: two-sided significance level In the following paragraphs treatment differences and standard deviations (SD) are given without units. Body weight measurements from returning discontinuing subjects will be used in the primary analysis. But for the sample size calculations, it is assumed that all subjects who discontinue will not return at week 56 and assume that they have a % weight change like placebo subjects who completed the trial. It is expected that % weight change for liraglutide 3.0 mg subjects who discontinue might be somewhere in between completing placebo subjects and completing liraglutide 3.0 mg subjects. The assumption is thus expected to lead to a conservative effect estimate. A 30% discontinuation is assumed based on findings in trial NN8022-1922. Based on findings from NN8022-1922, a difference in % weight change between liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo of –4 (–6% vs. –2%, SD= 6) is assumed among completing subjects. Adjusting for 30% discontinuation and using a mixture distribution, a difference of –2.8 is expected in the primary analysis. A sample size of 400 subjects (200 in each arm), gives a marginal power of 99.5%. For the primary endpoint 5% responders, the expected proportions were calculated based on the same assumptions as above. Adjusting for 30% discontinuation gives an expected 5% responders proportion of 49% in the liraglutide 3.0 mg arm and 31% in the placebo arm. With 400 subjects, this results in a marginal power of 95.7%.CONFIDENTIAL"

If the value measured at the randomisation visit is missing and the assessment was made at screening, the screening value will be used as the baseline value. 17.3.2.2 Handling of missing values at week 56 Missing values at week 56 will be imputed and the relevant endpoints will be derived from the imputed values. Several approaches for imputation of missing values at week 56 will be applied. First, a description of the primary imputation approach used to address the effectiveness estimand for the primary endpoints is given. This is followed by a description of a number of sensitivity analyses. Primary approach for handling of missing values The primary approach for multiple imputations of missing values of body weight at week 56 (type MT+MD) for both the liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo group is by sampling among all available assessments at week 56 in the placebo group (type AT+AD). This approach is also known as jump to reference and makes the assumption that subjects instantly after discontinuation lose any effect of randomised treatment beyond what can be expected from placebo treatment as adjunct to diet and exercise 43. Body weight measurements at visits between baseline and week 56 are not used for this imputation approach. The multiple imputation approach is done in three steps.CONFIDENTIAL"

This will be done 100 times and results in 100 complete data sets. A more detailed explanation of this step is given below. -Analysis : Step 2 analyses each of the 100 complete data sets, using the statistical model defined in Sections 17.3.1.1 and 17.3.1.2 , and saves the 100 estimation results. -Pooling : Step 3 integrates the 100 estimation results into a final result using Rubin’s formula. The imputation model in step 1, uses placebo subjects from FAS with non-missing body weight measurements at baseline and week 56. The imputation model is a linear regression of body weight (kg) at week 56 on the factors and covariates listed in Table 17–4 (except randomised treatment arm) with no interactions. The estimated posterior distribution for the parameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation model is then used to impute missing week 56 body weight values for both randomised treatment arms. If 100 copies are not sufficient to establish stable results, a higher number will be used. The multiple imputations will be generated using Novo Nordisk trial number 80224272 as seed number. Sensitivity analyses for the analysis of the primary endpoints for the effectiveness estimand The sensitivity analyses will address the robustness of the primary approach for handling of missing values. In particular the sensitivity analyses address how assumptions on how body weight progresses after discontinuation of randomised treatment impact the estimated treatment difference between liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo. The sensitivity analyses include the following. !A multiple imputation approach as described by McEvoy44where missing body weight measurement at week 56 for non-retrieved drop-outs (type MD) are imputed by sampling from values obtained from retrieved drop-outs (type AD) in each randomised treatment arm and according to the timing (monthly) of last available observation (of body weight) on randomised treatment (LAO-OT). Missing body weight measurements at week 56 for subjects on drug treatment (type MT) are imputed by sampling from type AT in the relevant randomised treatment arm. Thus, the imputation model for each randomised treatment arm and timing of LAO-OT is a linear regression of body weight (kg) at week 56 on the factors and covariates listed in Table 17–4 (except randomised treatment arm) with no interactions and including LAO-OT of body weight as covariate. If timing by month is too restrictive, quarters, half-years, or excluding timing will be used. !A weighted ANCOVA (wANCOVA) where returning drug discontinuing subjects (AD) are up-weighted relative to their proportion of all drug discontinuing subjects (AD+MD) to account for the subjects not returning for assessments at week 5644. Similarly, AT subjects CONFIDENTIAL"

The up-weighing is done by randomised treatment arm and the timing of LAO-OT. Subjects who are missing the weight measurement at week 56 (MD+MT) are assigned a weight of 0 (zero). !A single imputation approach as done by Sacks45. Missing weight measurement at week 56 for subjects who drop-out (type MD) are imputed using a weight regain rate of 0.3 kg/month after last available observation (LAO) of body weight. Change from baseline is truncated whenever the extrapolation would lead to a positive weight gain relative to baseline. LAO does not need to be the same as LAO-OT as subjects are allowed to come to scheduled visits after discontinuing randomised treatment. When a subject's LAO represents a gain in weight relative to baseline, no additional gain will be imputed, and the unfavourable gain is carried forward to week 56. Missing weight measurement at week 56 for subjects on treatment (type MT) will be imputed using the LAO. The weight regain imputation will be done for both randomised treatment arms. Additionally, a version where only the liraglutide 3.0 mg arm uses the regain rate while the placebo arm uses LAO (corresponding to a weight regain rate of 0 kg/month) will be performed. !Tipping point analysis. In a similar manner as above for a range of weight regain rates (starting from 0.1 kg/month and in intervals of 0.1 kg/month) for MD in liraglutide 3.0 mg arm will be used to define a tipping point in which superiority of liraglutide 3.0 mg disappears. In this analysis, the placebo arm will be imputed by LAO. Figure 17–1 and Table 17–5 give an overview of the handling of missing values at week 56 assessments. Additional sensitivity analyses Additional analyses will investigate how sensitive the primary statistical models (for primary endpoints) are to the choice of factors and covariates in the model as follows. A model resembling the primary analysis models using the same imputation method (jump to reference) adjusting only for baseline body weight and randomised treatment arm. The imputation model (step 1) will be same as for the primary approach. For the binary primary endpoint, the risk difference (unadjusted for any factors and covariates) and corresponding 95% CI will also be calculated. 17.3.3 Analysis method addressing the efficacy estimand for the primary endpoints The efficacy estimand for % weight change will be assessed using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM).

A pause of less than three consecutive days is not regarded as discontinuation for this analysis. This means that assessments at week 56 for retrieved drop-outs (type AD) will be discarded. The MMRM will be fitted using % weight change and the same factors and covariates (see Table 17–4 ) as for the primary analyses all nested within visit. An unstructured covariance matrix for measurements within the same subject will be employed, assuming that measurements for different subjects are independent. The efficacy estimand for 5% responders will be assessed using the same MMRM. From the MMRM individually predicted values for % weight change at week 56 will be used to classify each subject as 5% responder or not. This classification will then be analysed using a logistic regression model with treatment and sulphonylurea (yes/no) as the only factors. 17.3.4 Subgroup analyses for primary endpoints For the effectiveness estimand, subgroup analyses will be done for the factors listed and categorised as in Table 17–4 . For baseline weight and insulin dose, categories based on quartiles will be used.

Risks and precautions The sections below describe identified and potential risks associated with liraglutide treatment. The identified/potential risks are based on findings in non-clinical and clinical trials with liraglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Neoplasms Subjects with overweight and obesity have an increased risk of certain types of cancer. In the clinical development programme for liraglutide 3.0 mg, the reporting rate of neoplasm events confirmed by external independent event adjudication committee was similar with liraglutide and placebo. Thus, the overall risk of neoplasms and cancer in the weight management trials was low and balanced between treatment groups. Thyroid C-cell tumours Liraglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumours (MTC) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the rearranged during transfection (RET) protooncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumours in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical or nonclinical studies. Data from the intensive monitoring of calcitonin (a marker for MTC) in plasma in the liraglutide clinical development programme, do not support an effect of liraglutide on calcitonin levels in humans. As a precaution subjects with personal or family history of MTC, or MEN2 will not be enrolled in the trial. Calcitonin will be monitored as per flow chart, see Section 2. Subjects with elevated calcitonin ( ≥ 100 ng/L) will be discontinued on liraglutide 3.0 mg and appropriate clinical follow-up will be initiated. Breast and colon tumours Based on a limited number of reports in the clinical development programme for liraglutide 3.0 mg, a numerical imbalance was observed for events of breast neoplasms in females and colorectal adenomas in males. There were too few cases to determine whether these cases were related to liraglutide. In addition, there are insufficient data to determine whether liraglutide has an effect on pre-existing breast neoplasia. Two positively adjudicated cases of malignant colorectal carcinoma were reported in liraglutide-treated subjects and none in placebo-treated subjects. CONFIDENTIAL"

These may include urticaria, rash, pruritus as well as anaphylactic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance if suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction occurs Pancreatitis An association between the use of GLP-1RAs and pancreatitis has been suggested based on case reports received in clinical trials and during the post-marketing experience with liraglutide (in T2DM) and other GLP-1RAs. Few events of pancreatitis have been reported in clinical trials with liraglutide in weight management. After initiation of liraglutide 3.0 mg, subjects must be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (see Section 8.6.5 ). If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide 3.0 mg should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide 3.0 mg should not be restarted. Subjects with a history of pancreatitis are excluded from participation in the trial. Acute gallstone disease Cases of gallstones (cholelithiasis) and inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) were reported more commonly in adult subjects treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg compared to placebo in the clinical development programme for liraglutide 3.0 mg. From literature, it is well-known that obesity carries an increased risk of cholelithiasis and that an association between rapid and/or marked weight loss and the development of cholelithiasis is present46. If cholelithiasis is suspected, treatment should be discontinued and gallbladder examination and appropriate clinical follow-up should be initiated. Hypoglycaemic episodes Overall, the incidence of hypoglycaemia with liraglutide is low. However, a higher incidence and severity was seen in the clinical development programme, when liraglutide was combined with other anti-glycaemic agents. Subjects blood glucose parameters will be monitored prior to starting liraglutide 3.0 mg and during treatment To minimise the risk of hypoglycemia, insulin dose will be reduced by 15-20% for subjects with HbA 1c≤ 8% at randomisation. Adjustment of insulin dose may be initiated one week after randomisation; however, in the first five weeks of the trial, the basal insulin dose should not exceed the pre-trial dose and bolus insulin should not be initiated, unless deemed necessary by investigator to control unacceptable hyperglycaemia. In addition, the dose of sulphonylurea may be reduced by 50% at investigator’s discretion in patients using this OAD since hypoglycaemic events are more frequent when combining liraglutide with sulphonylurea than with other OADs.CONFIDENTIAL"

The long-term clinical effects of the increase in resting heart rate have not been established. There is no indication that the effect on resting heart rate is dose dependent and the increase in heart rate disappears upon treatment discontinuation. When initiating treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg, heart rate should be monitored at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice. Gastrointestinal adverse events The most frequently reported adverse events in subjects treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg were gastrointestinal (nausea and diarrhoea), with onset during the first weeks; these were mostly mild to moderate, and transient. Other gastrointestinal adverse events (GI AEs) included: dyspepsia, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain. Clinical trials have indicated that a low starting dose with gradual dose escalation diminishes GI AEs compared with more aggressive dosing regimens. If subjects do not tolerate an increased dose during dose escalation, dose escalation may be delayed for approximately one additional week. Renal impairment GLP-1 RAs may cause nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea leading to loss of fluids (dehydration). Dehydration may cause renal impairment and acute renal failure. Subjects treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to gastrointestinal side effects and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Benefits In the present trial, subjects will be treated with a regimen anticipated to be better than or equal to the weight management they receive at the time of entry into the trial. Results from the clinical development programme demonstrated that liraglutide 3.0 mg, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, was effective for weight loss in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2DM treated with 0-3 OADs (metformin, glitazone, sulphonylurea). The anticipated lower insulin requirement in the present trial with liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. placebo is expected to further amplify weight loss. Even a modest weight loss may improve glycaemic control and decreases the risk of hypertension and premature cardiovascular death in patients with obesity 47-49. Finally, improvements in patient reported health-related quality of life and physical function have been observed with weight loss. Although subjects will have to spend time on site visits and procedures required by trial participation, it is expected that all subjects (including those subjects randomised to placebo) will benefit from the behavioural counselling and increased physical activity, with close follow-up of their obesity and a careful medical examination. All of which will result in an intensified management of their obesity. CONFIDENTIAL"

These precautions include thorough information regarding the correct administration of the trial products and gradual dose adjustment. It is important to note that the target population for liraglutide 3.0 mg is already at serious risk from obesity and its associated major co-morbidities. The overall efficacy and safety results from the weight management programme, demonstrated that the benefit-risk balance is in favour of liraglutide 3.0 mg, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, within the investigated population of subjects with overweight and obesity. 18.2 Informed consent In seeking and documenting informed consent, the investigator must comply with applicable regulatory requirement(s) and adhere to ICH GCP1and the requirements in the Declaration of Helsinki2. Before any trial-related activity, the investigator must give the subject verbal and written information about the trial and the procedures involved in a form that the subject can read and understand. This includes the use of an impartial witness where required according to local requirements. The subjects must be fully informed of their rights and responsibilities while participating in the trial as well as possible disadvantages of being treated with the trial products. A voluntary, signed and personally dated informed consent must be obtained from the subject before any trial-related activity. The investigator must ensure the subject has ample time to come to a decision whether or not to participate in the trial. The responsibility for seeking informed consent must remain with the investigator, but the investigator may delegate the task to a medically qualified person, in accordance with local requirements. The written informed consent must be signed and personally dated by the person who seeks the informed consent before any trial-related activity. If information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participating in the trial, the investigator must inform the subject in a timely manner, and a revised written subject information must be provided and a new informed consent must be obtained.CONFIDENTIAL"

If data are used, it will always be in accordance with local regulations and IRBs/IECs. 18.4 Information to subjects during trial During the trial, the subjects may receive information that could include a “welcome to the trial letter”, newsletter(s) and a “thank you for your participation letter” after completion of the trial, if locally acceptable. Initiatives for subject retention will be instituted for this trial. These may include retention activities, materials and items, if locally acceptable. The retention items will be relevant for the subjects’ participation in the trial and/or their obesity and will not exceed local fair market value. All written information to subjects and retention initiatives must be sent to IRB/IEC for approval/favourable opinion and to regulatory authorities for approval or notification according to local regulations. 18.5 Premature termination of the trial and/or trial site Novo Nordisk, the IRBs/IECs or a regulatory authority may decide to stop the trial, part of the trial or a trial site at any time, but agreement on procedures to be followed must be obtained. If the trial is suspended or prematurely terminated, the investigator must inform the subjects promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow-up. The investigator and/or Novo Nordisk must also promptly inform the regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs and provide a detailed written explanation. If, after the termination of the trial, the benefit-risk analysis changes, the new evaluation must be provided to the IRBs/IECs in case it has an impact on the planned follow-up of subjects who have participated in the trial. If it has an impact, the actions needed to inform and protect the subjects should be described .CONFIDENTIAL"

Documentation on protocol deviations must be kept in the investigator trial master file and sponsor trial master file. 19.2 Prevention of missing data Considerable effort must be made by the investigator to avoid missing data, including minimising the number of subjects withdrawing from the trial. The importance of subject retention will be addressed by Novo Nordisk in the training and communication with the trial sites. The subjects will be carefully informed about the trial procedures before signing informed consent, so that they are fully aware of the implications of participating in the trial. Measures will be implemented during trial conduct to encourage subjects to complete the trials; these will be described in detail in trial specific retention mitigation plans and may include subject newsletters, appreciation items and various local initiatives. For subjects discontinuing treatment, the investigator should encourage continued attendance for all visits including the IBT visits until the primary outcome measure at 56 weeks. Furthermore, re- initiation of treatment is allowed at the discretion of investigator, as described Section 8.1. Surveillance of subject retention will be performed throughout the trial by Novo Nordisk with focus on reasons for premature discontinuation of trial product or withdrawal of consent to initiate mitigations as needed in collaboration with the trial sites. 19.3 Protocol compliance for Mexico The trial will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, ICH GCP1and applicable regulatory requirements, and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki2.

No confidential information shall be disclosed to others without prior written consent from Novo Nordisk. Such information shall not be used except in the performance of this trial. The information obtained during this trial may be made available to other physicians who are conducting other clinical trials with the trial product, if deemed necessary by Novo Nordisk. Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled, Novo Nordisk may grant access to information obtained during this trial to researchers who require access for research projects studying the same disease and/or trial product studied in this trial. Novo Nordisk may publish on its clinical trials website a redacted CTR for this trial. One investigator will be appointed by Novo Nordisk to review and sign the CTR (signatory investigator) on behalf of all participating investigators.

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with liraglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (greater than 100 ng/L) is likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia; the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of the neoplasia. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !smoking !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various co-morbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells.CONFIDENTIAL"

In case a subject has a calcitonin value ≥ 10 ng/L, the algorithm outlined below should be followed. The algorithm applies for all calcitonin values including screening values. Please report clinically significant abnormal values as an adverse event (see Section 12 in the protocol). 2.1 Calcitonin ≥ 100 ng/L Action: The subject (even if a screen failure) must immediately be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation and the trial product must be discontinued (see protocol section 6.5 premature discontinuation of trial product). The subject can remain in the trial; however, all suspected medications must be discontinued until diagnosis has been established. Background : These values were found in 9 (0.15%) of a population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease.1All of these patients were diagnosed with MTC resulting in a positive predictive value of 100 %. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound !fine needle aspiration of any nodules >1 cm !potentially surgery with neck dissection In case a subject is diagnosed with MTC, it is common clinical practice to explore the family history of MTC or MEN2 and perform a genetic test for RET proto-oncogene mutation. 2.2 Calcitonin ≥ 50 and < 100 ng/L Action: The subject (even if a screen failure) must be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. The subject can remain in the trial and continue on trial product. Background: These values were found in 8 (0.14%) of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1Two of these subjects were diagnosed with MTC and two were diagnosed with C- cell hyperplasia, resulting in a positive predictive value of a C-cell anomaly of 50%. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !if available and there are no contraindication, a pentagastrin stimulation test. Subjects with positive pentagastrin stimulation tests should be considered to undergo surgery CONFIDENTIAL"

Continue sampling of calcitonin according to the protocol. If the subject is a screen failure, or if the value is from the last sample taken in the trial, the subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. Background: Calcitonin values from 20-50 ng/L were found in up to 1% of subjects of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease.1. The predictive value of a C-cell anomaly for this calcitonin level was 8.3%. However, the likelihood of having a medullary carcinoma >1 cm with calcitonin in this range is extremely low. For calcitonin values 10-20 ng/L Costante et al 1identified 216 (3.7%) patients. One patient out of the 216 had a subsequent basal (unstimulated) calcitonin of 33 ng/L, and had C-cell hyperplasia at surgery. Two other studies used a cut-off of CT > 10 ng/L to screen for C-cell disease, but they do not provide sufficient information on patients with basal CT >10 and <20 ng/L to allow conclusions2, 3CONFIDENTIAL"

The FDA has requested that bicarbonate is added as a routine laboratory test in trials where sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are used as background medication, because SGLT2- inhibitors have been associated with a risk for metabolic acidosis. Hence, serum bicarbonate assay has been included to collect additional safety information in alignment with other Novo Nordisk trials where trial product is add-on to an SGLT2 inhibitor. There is no safety risk for those subjects who do not have the bicarbonate assay performed during their treatment. !Inconsistent wording in reporting of insulin dose and transcription of insulin dose to eCRF. !Discrepancy regarding the time period of an eye examination performed prior to randomisation.
