The following chronic pruritic diseases will be studied. Each cohort will be enrolled and analyzed independently : • Cohort 1: Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU) • Cohort 2: Chronic Idiopathic Pruritus (CIP) • Cohort 3: Lichen Planus (LP) • Cohort 4: Lichen Simplex Chronicus (LSC) • Cohort 5: Plaque Psoriasis (PPs) Each cohort will enroll approximately 26 subjects and contain three periods: • Screening Perio d (Day -28 to Day -1, minimum 14 days and maximum 28 days) • Treatment Period (Day 1 [Baseline] to Week 8) • Follow -up Period (After week 8 to Week 18) Allowable window for Week 1 is ±1 day and from Week 2 to Week 18 visits is ± 2 days. In every cohort , a loading dose of KPL -716 at 720 mg SC (or matching placebo) will be followed by maintenance doses of 360 mg SC (or matching placebo) administered every week for 7 additional weekly dose s in order to detect an early signal of efficacy on pruritus once exposures approach an expected steady state. In addition, the impact of KPL -716 on sleep and quality of life will be assessed. Furthermore, the impact of KPL -716 on urticaria in CIU (Cohor t 1) will be investigated . Each cohort will utilize a washout design in which concomitant therapies that could im pact pruritus will be prohibited from a designated timepoint prior to dosing through the En d of Study (EOS) Visit, thus removing the confounding effect of these therapies on the assessme nt of KPL -716 efficacy. Subjects who use a moisturizer cream/emollient will be instructed to use th e same moisturizer cream/emollient at the same frequency throughout the study. Only subjects with CIU (Cohort 1) will be allowed to use H1 antihistamines at approved stable doses from 14 da ys prior to dosing to EOS Visit. The permitted H1 antihistamines for CIU will be outlined in the Pharmacy Manual . Should subjects in any cohort experience an exacerbation of symptoms that is significant enough to warrant intervention, they will be provided with H1 antihistamine s and/or topical corticosteroids (TCS) as rescue medication. The permitted rescue medication s for each cohort will be outlined in the Pharmacy Manual . Accountability for rescue medications will be maintained by the site s. The date, time, and the number of antihistamine tablets will be recorded and the weight of TCS tubes will be measured at dispensation, at every visit, an d upon return. Screening Period: After the Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed, subjects will enter the Screening Period for assessment of eligibility. During the Screening Visit, subject’s medical and surgical history wi ll be reviewed including allergic history. Review of medical history will include the s pecific cohort disease history and history of co -morbidities. Prior and concomitant medications, t herapies and procedures will be recorded . Subjects will be instructed on the required washout for specific excl uded medications."

Clinical laboratory tests and an ECG will be performed. Urine drug screen and pregnancy test (if applicable) will also be performed. To be eligible for study participation, subjects must have moderate to se vere pruritus, defined as WI-NRS ≥ 7 at the Screening Visit and a mean w eekly WI -NRS ≥ 5 for each of the 2 consecutive weeks immediately prior to randomization. A minimum of 85% complia nce with daily WI -NRS recording during the last 14 days of Screening Period prior to randomizatio n is required for eligibility unless approved by the Sponsor. At the Screening Visit , subjects will be asked to rate their pruritus severity (WI -NRS) in the previous 24 hours on a numerical rating scale. Subjects also will be ins tructed to record their daily rating of WI -NRS and two sleep paramete rs, difficulty falling asleep NRS and sleep quality NRS, from the beginning of screening to Day 1. The daily recordings (WI -NRS, difficulty falling asleep NRS, and sleep quality NRS) will continue throughout the study for eligib le subjects that proceed to dosing. Furthermore, s ubjects with CIU will be instructed to also complete on a daily basis the UAS7 questionnaire (on itch and hives severity) from the beginning of scre ening to Day 1. Daily completion of the UAS7 questionnaire will continue throughout the study for eligible CIU subjects that proceed to dosing. Additional assessments at the Screening Visit include those related to pruritus (Pruritus VAS, and 5-D Pruritus), sleep ( Sleep Loss VAS) and quality of life (DLQI and ItchyQoL ). Collection of adverse events and concomitant medications will begin aft er signing the ICF and will continue until the EOS Visit. For a Schedule of Activities, please see Appendix 1 . Treatment Period: The treatment period will last 8 weeks. Pre-dose: Eligibility must be confirmed prior to dosing on Day 1 . Subjects will have the following procedures performed prior to dosing on Day 1: • Review of m edical and surgical history • Review of p rior and concomitant medications • Review of adverse events • Review of compliance with recording of daily WI -NRS • Review of clinical laboratory results from the Screening Visit • Full physical examination • Vital signs and weight • ECG (if more than 30 days since screening E CG) • Subjects will record their Pruritus VAS, Sleep Loss VAS and comple te the 5 -D Pruritus, DLQI and ItchyQoL questionnaires. • Collection of laboratory blood tests • Collection of urine for urinalysis • Pregnancy test (if applicable) • Collection of PK blood samples"

Descr iptive statistics will be presented for all endpoints and will include number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), minimu m and maximum for continuous variables, and frequency and percentage for categorical and ordinal variables. Statistical analyses of efficacy endpoints will be conducted separately for each cohort. Determination of Sample Size : This is a double -blind st udy. Each cohort will be independently analyzed. A total of approximately 26 subjects will be randomized in each cohort. The first 12 subjects wi ll be randomized to the KPL -716 and the placebo arms in a 3:1 randomization ratio. The rest of the 14 subject s will be randomized in a 1:1 randomization ratio. There will be appr oximately 16 subjects and 10 subjects randomized to the KPL -716 arm and the placebo arm respectively. Based on a two- sample t -test for the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in weekly average of WI - NRS at Week 8, assumed mean changes of 4 for the KPL -716 arm and 1.5 for the placebo arm, a total sample size of 26 subjects per cohort will provide about 80% power to dete ct a 2.5 -point mean difference with a standard deviation of 2.8, given a two -sided alpha of 0.2. Given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, the precision attained with the above cohort samples size is acceptable for early signal of efficacy assessments. Safety Analysis Set : All randomized subjects who take at least 1 dose of KPL -716 or plac ebo will be included in the Safety Analysis Set. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set : All randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of KPL -716 or placebo and have at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment in the double -blind Treatment Period will be included in the modified intent -to-treat (mITT) analysis set."

The prevalence of CIU is estimated at up to 1%8, LP at 0.22 to 5%9, LSC up to 12%10 and psoriasis up to 4% in Western Countries11. CIP is estimated t o occur in 11.5 to 41% in the elderly.12 Chronic pruritus leads to lack of sleep, fatigue, diminished productivity, anxiety, depression and overall diminished qual ity of life. Inflammatory cell infiltration and hyperkeratosis are common featur es seen in skin biopsies of patients with chronic pruritus. Histologic examination of skin b iopsies from CIU patients demonstrates lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils, mast cells (also increased in non-lesional skin), and activated macrophages.13 In patients with CIP, lymphocytic infiltrates are seen in the absence of inflammatory skin lesio ns.3 LP lesional biopsies show lysis of basal keratinocytes by CD8+ lymphocytes and IL -31 expression.14, 15 Epidermal hyperplasia, orthokeratosis , and hypergranulosis with lymphocytic perivascular infiltrates are common features of LSC.5 Psoriatic skin biopsies characteristically show perivascular and der mal inflammatory cell infiltration, parakeratosis, suprapapillary thinning, spongiform pus tules, microabscess, and edema of the dermal papillae.16 Chronic pruritus is treated with H1 non -sedating antihistamines as first line therapy. In non - responsive patients, sedati ng antihistamines such as hydroxyzine or doxepin, topical corticosteroid, and leukotriene receptor antagonists and topical calcineurin inhibitors may be tried. In refractory disease, immunomodulatory agents such as cyclos porin and phototherapy are used. Neuroactive medications such as gabapentin, anti -depressants, capsaicin, opio id agonists and antagonists are used in CIP with limited success. 17, 18, 19 Biologic therapy is available for the most severe patients with CIU ( omalizumab ) and psoriasis ( adalimumab , etanercept , and inflixima b,).7, 20 Despite the availability of a large range of medications with variety of mechanisms of action, chronic pruritus remains a signif icant unmet medical need due to poor respon se to treatment or unacceptable side effects. Many patients with CIU, fo r example, remain symptomatic or are unwilling to tolerate or risk t he adverse effects of cyclosporine (renal toxicity) and omalizumab (black box warning for omalizumab: anaphylaxis)."
25,page_25,"Protocol KPL -716- C202 CONFIDENTIAL 28 January 2019 (Version 1.0) Page 26 of 78 The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of KPL -716 in reducing pruritus in patients with chronic pruritic diseases experiencing mo derate to severe pruritus. The secondary objectives are to investigate the impact of KPL -716 on sleep loss and quality of life. Clinical response will be used to understand whether KPL -716 responsiveness is limited to a specific subset of patients with chr onic pruritus. 1.2 Summary of Nonclinical Pharmacology A series of in vitro studies have been conducted with KPL -716 to characterize its binding properties and biologic activity. For details on the in vitro profil es, refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 1.2.1 In Vivo KPL-716 was well tolerated in multi -dose 7 -week and 26 -week primate toxicity studies. In the 7 -week toxicity study, cynomolgus monkeys were dosed once every oth er week with either an intravenous (IV) bolus injection of up to 500 mg/kg KPL -716 or a subcutaneous (SC) injection of 300 mg/kg KPL -716, for a total of 3 doses. The multi -dose, 7 -week, preclinical toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys revealed no specific toxicities, and the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for systemic toxicity were 500 mg/kg for IV administration and 300 mg/kg for SC admini stration. For further details, refer to the IB. In the chronic toxicology study, weekly administration of KPL -716 by IV bolus injection or SC at doses up to 200 mg/kg IV/SC for 26 weeks (27 total doses) was well tolera ted in cynomolgus monkeys. Based on these results under the conditions and du ration of the study provided in the final report, the NOAEL was considered to be 200 mg/kg IV/SC, the highest dose tested. A low level of anti -drug antibody (ADA) response was noted in the toxicity study, which w as not unexpected because KPL -716 is a fully -human antibody. The magnitude of the ADA response was judged to be insufficient to impact toxicokinetic evaluations . 1.3 Study Rationale KPL-716 is a first -in-class, fully -human monoclonal antibody against Oncosta tin M Receptor beta (OSMRβ). OSMRβ is a cell surface receptor that heterodimer izes with IL -31 receptor alpha (IL -31Rα) to mediate signaling of IL -31. It also heterodimerizes with gp130 to mediate signaling of oncostatin (OSM). By targeting a single epit ope , KPL -716 simultaneously inhibits signaling of IL -31 and OSM, two (2) cytokine pathways important in pruritus, inflammation, hyperkeratosis and fibrosis. KPL -716 does not inhibit signaling of OSM down the Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor ( LIFR) pathway, a pathway implicated in hematopoiesis and platelet synthesis.21 KPL-716 via its dual pathway mechanism is predicted to reduce pruritus in ch ronic pruritic diseases and potentially modulate many aspects of disease pathology r elated to inflammation, hyperkeratosis and fibrosis. A clinical effect on pruritus intensi ty is anticipated at therapeutic doses based on the Phase 1b study results (Protocol KPL -716- C001). The targeted nature of the KPL -716 mechanism of action is expected to offer safety advantages compar ed to immunosuppressive therapies as well as systemic and to pical corticosteroids."
26,page_26,"Protocol KPL -716- C202 CONFIDENTIAL 28 January 2019 (Version 1.0) Page 27 of 78 The role of IL -31 in pruritus is well established, as IL -31 receptor inhibition has been shown to decrease pruritus in subjects with atopic dermatitis.22, 23 The published literature suggests that IL -31 plays a role in many chronic pruritic diseases. Serum IL -31 levels are elevated in CIU patients compared to healthy controls and IL -31 levels decrease upon successful treatment of CIU.24 Similarly, serum IL -31 le vels are increased in patients with psoriasis and levels decrease after UVB irradiation with treatment response.25 IL-31 levels are also elevated in patients with LP although pruritus intensity does not appear to corr elate with IL - 31 levels in this disease.15 Despite absence of a primary dermatologic process in CIP, histologic analysis of CIP skin demonstrates lymphocytic and, in many cases, eosinophilic infiltration, accompanied by increased IgE and peripheral blood eosi nophilia pointing to T H2 polarization as a potential source of IL-31.3 Chronic scratching, disruption of epidermal barrier function, staphylococcal colonization and subsequent staphylo coccal enterotoxin B production promote IL -31 production26 and may ultimately contribute to the itch -scratch cycle that underlies many chronic pruritic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and LSC. OSM, the other cytokine pathway inhibited by KPL -716, has been shown to play a role in inflammation, epidermal integrity and fibrosis, three (3) pathways important in many pruritic dermatologic disorders. OSM increases the produc tion of IL -4Rα and IL -13Rα. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 OSM also increases IL -4 production and synergizes with IL -4 and IL -13 to upregulate downstream signaling events such as eotaxin production.27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 Similarly, OSM synergizes with IL -17 and increases CCL2 and IL -6 production.32 OSM impacts epidermal barrier function by modulating genes important in keratinocyte acti vation and differentiation.27, 28 Finally, OSM levels a re increased in fibrotic diseases and OSM over expression in animal models has been shown to result in fibrotic c hanges.30, 34 In a Phase 1b study (KPL-716-C001) , KPL -716 demonstrated OSMR β target engagement and an early signal of efficacy by reducing pruritus in subjects wi th atopic dermatitis. Please see IB. KPL -716 is therefore being investigated in this Phase 2 study for its effica cy in reducing pruritus in patients with a variety of chronic pruritic condit ions (primary endpoint). The reduction in pruritus is anticipated to improve sleep and quali ty of life. Therefore, this study will investigate the impact of KPL -716 on sleep and quality of life (secondary endpoints). This double- blind Phase 2 pilot study will utilize a wash out design and enroll subjects with a physician -documented diagnosis of diseases characterized by chronic pruritus , including at this time CIU, CIP, LP, LSC, or PPs , of at least 6 months duration. The study will enroll subjects with moderate to severe pruritus, defined as WI -NRS ≥ 7 at the Screening Visit and a mean weekly WI -NRS ≥ 5 for the 2 consecutive weeks immediately prior to ran domization. Given the early sta ge of KPL -716 development, subjects will be excluded if they have co - morbidities that would complicate interpretation of safety data such as infections, malignancies, and rheumatologic diseases. Ultimately, the data from this pilot study will help establ ish the range of chronic pruritic diseases responsive to KPL -716, so that future larger studies may then be conducted for further assessment of the impact of KPL -716 on pruritus and other disease manifestations ."

Each cohort is an independent randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled sub -study to investigate the efficacy, safety , tolerability, PK and immunogenicity of KPL -716 administered SC in reducing pruritus in diseases characterized by chronic pruritus. The following chronic pruritic diseases will be studied. • Cohort 1: Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU) • Cohort 2: Chronic Idiopathic Pruritus (CIP) • Cohort 3: Lichen Planus (LP) • Cohort 4: Lichen Simplex Chronicus (LSC) • Cohort 5: Plaque Psoriasis (PPs) Each cohort will be enrolled and analyzed independently. Each cohort will enroll up to 26 subjects and contain three periods: • Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1, minimum 14 days and maximum 28 days) • Treatment Period (Day 1 [Baseline] to Week 8) • Follow -up Period (After week 8 to Week 18) Allowable window for Week 1 is ± 1 day and from Week 2 to Week 18 visits is ±2 days. In every cohort , a loading dose of KPL -716 at 720 mg SC (or matching placebo) will be followed by maintenance doses of 360 mg SC (or matching placebo) administered every week for 7 additional weekly doses in order to detect an early signal of efficacy on pruritus once exposures approach an expected steady state. In addition, the impact of KPL -716 on sleep and quality of life will be assessed. Furthermore, the impact of KPL -716 on urticaria in CIU (Cohort 1) will be investigated . Each cohort will utilize a washout design in which concomitant therapies that could impact pruritus will be prohibited from a designated timepoint prior to do sing through the End of Study (EOS ) Visit, thus removing the confoundi ng effect of these therapies on the assessment of KPL-716 efficacy. Subjects who use a moisturizer cream/emollient will be instructed to use the same moisturizer cream/emollient at the same frequency through out the study . Only subjects with CIU (Cohort 1) will be allowed to use H1 antihistamines at approved stable doses from 14 days prior to dosing to EOS Visit. The permitted H1 antihistamines for CIU will be outlined in the Pharmacy Manual . Should subjects in any cohort experience an exacerbation of sym ptoms that is significant enough to warrant intervention, they will be provided with H1 antihistamines and/or topical corticosteroids ( TCS) as rescue medication. The permitted rescue medications for each cohort will be outlined in the Pharmacy Manual . Accountability for rescue medications will be maintained by the site s. The date, time, and the number of antihistamine tablets will be recorded and the weight of TCS tubes will be measured at dispensation, at every visit, and upon return."

During the Screening Visit, subject’s medical and surgical histor y will be reviewed including allergic history. Re view of medical history will include the specific cohort disease his tory and history of co -morbidities. Prior and concomitant medications, therapies and procedures will be recorded . Subjects will be instructed on the required washout for specific exc luded medications. Vital signs and body weight will be measured, and subjects will undergo a full physical examination. Clinical laboratory tests and an ECG will be performed. Urine drug screen and pregnancy test (if applicable) will also be performed. To be eligible for study participation, subjects must have moderate t o severe pruritus, defined as WI -NRS ≥ 7 at the Screening Visit and a mean weekly WI -NRS ≥ 5 for each of the two consecutive weeks immediately prior to randomization. A minimum of 85 % co mpliance with daily WI -NRS recording during the last 14 days of Screening Period prior to randomiz ation is required for eligibility unless approved by the Sponsor. At the Screening Visit, subjects will be asked to rate their pruritus severity (WI -NRS) in the previous 24 hours on a numerical rating scale. Subjects also will be in structed to record their daily rating of WI -NRS and two sleep parameters, difficulty falling asleep NRS and sleep quality NRS, from the beginning of screening to Day 1. The daily recordings (WI -NRS, difficulty falling asleep NRS, and sleep quality NRS) will continue throughout the study for eligible subjects that proceed to dosing. Furthermore, s ubjects with CIU will also be instructed to complete on a daily basis the UAS7 quest ionnaire (on itch and hives severity) from the beginning of screeni ng to Day 1. Daily completion of the UAS7 questionnaire will continue throughout the s tudy for eligible CIU subjects that proceed to dosing. Additional assessments at the Screening Visit i nclude those related to pruritus (Pruritus VAS, and 5 -D Pruritus), sleep (Sleep Loss VAS), dermatology life quality index (DLQI) and Itchy quality of life ( ItchyQoL). Collection of adverse events and concomitant medications will begin after s igning the ICF and will continue until the EOS Visit. For a Schedule of Activities, please s ee Appendix 1 . 4.1.2 Treatment Period The treatment period will last 8 weeks. 4.1.2.1 Pre-dose Eligibility must be confirmed prior to dosing on Day 1 . Subjects will have the following procedures performed prior to dosing on Day 1: • Review of m edical and surgical history • Review of p rior and concomitant medications"

Comparison of PK parameters across dose levels and routes of administration in healthy volunteers and subjects with atopic dermatitis showed that exposures were similar in the two study populations. In both populations, as dose increased, half -life also increased consistent with a T MDD proﬁle. Furthermore, bioavailability between healthy volunteers and atopic dermatitis subjects at the evaluated dose levels was generally comparable (42% vs. 65%); the numb er of subjects in these analyses were small. Based on the similarities in PK parameters betw een healthy volunteers and atopic dermatitis subjects despite anticipated differences in target expression levels, it is likely that PK parameters in other chronic pruritic conditions (such as CI U, CIP, LP, LSC and PPs) will also follow the sa me patterns. The weekly SC dosing regimen is proposed to ensure subsequent doses ar e administered before a significant decline in blood concentrations has occurred s o as to reach initial KPL - 716 exposure levels similar to those achieved with 7.5 mg/kg IV as a single dose. A loading dose of 720 mg is administered in this Phase 2 pilot study in order to a chieve blood concentrations that are likely to provide clinical benefit sooner in particular given the short treatment duration of this exploratory study. 720 mg was chosen for the loading dose since the peak concentration levels from this dose are anticipated to be less than those achieved by 7.5 mg/kg IV, which showed acceptable safety and tolerability in the si ngle dose study. A loading dose that is twic e maintenance is typical, in particular to minimize risk of dosing errors. Based on PK modeling, the expected C max and C trough from a loading dose of 720 mg SC followed by 7 weekly SC doses at 360 mg , the proposed regimen in this Phase 2 pilot study, are expected to be similar to those anticipated with 12 weekly doses of 360 mg S C, which has shown acceptable safety and tolerability to date in KPL -716- C001 Part 4. The available pre -clinical toxicology data support the selection of the above doses. Th e multi-dose, 7 -week, preclinical toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys reveale d no specific toxicities, and the highest administered dose (500 mg/kg IV) was ide ntified as the NOAEL. In a chronic toxicology study, weekly administration of KPL -716 by IV bolus injection or SC at doses up to 200 mg/kg for 26 weeks (27 total doses) was wel l tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys. Based on these results under the conditions and d uration of the study provided in the study report, the NOAEL was considered to be 200 mg/kg IV /SC, the highest dose tested. The number of doses (total of 8) and the dose level s (720 mg loading dose and 360 mg maintenance dose or 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg in a 72 kg adult, respectively) in this Phase 2a study fall well under the number of doses (total of 27) and the NOAEL (200 mg/kg) in the chronic toxicology study. The available safety data support the selection of above dose levels. I n the first -in-human study (KPL -716- C001), 50 healthy volunteers (Part 3) and 32 subjects with atopic dermatiti s (Part 1) were exposed to single doses of KPL -716 or placebo IV or SC. Th ere were no deaths, SAEs, or discontinuations due to AEs. There were no infusion reactions or injection site reactions. Drug -related or possibly related treatment -emergent AEs were infrequent. In Part 4 of KPL -716- C001 (repeated -single -dose study), subj ects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experiencing moderate to severe pruritus are being randomi zed 1:1 and administered KPL -716 360 mg or placebo SC once weekly for a total of 12 doses. Based on PK modeling, steady state exposures should be achie ved after approximately 5 doses of 360 mg SC. To date, 30 subjects have been randomized in Part 4, 28 have received at least 1 dose"

AEs also include: any worsening (i.e ., any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the st udy drug and abnormal laboratory findings considered by the reporting investiga tor to be clinically signific ant. A TEAE is defined as any event not present before exposure to study drug or a ny event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after e xposure to study drug. The condition of subjects will be monitored from time of signing the IC F through the EOS Visit (Week 18). In addition, subjects will be observed for any signs or symptoms and asked about their condition by open questioning, such as “How have you bee n feeling since you were last asked?”, at every study visit from the Screening Visit through the EOS Visit (Week 18). All non -serious AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on the physical examination, and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be recorded from the Screening Visit (signing the ICF) through the EOS Visit (Week 18). The AE information collected during the period from the Screening Visit until study drug administration on Day 1 is intended onl y for establishing a baseline status for subjects and for recording any screening procedure -related AEs. The nature, time of o nset, duration, and severity of all AEs, both serious and non -serious, will be documented, together with an Investigator’s opinion of the relation ship to study drug administration. Identification and reporting of injection site reactions (ISRs) wi ll be performed in the context of safety surveillance for Adverse Events as outlined above. Instructions on recording and reporting of ISRs will be provided to study sites through the Study Manual. Any changes or additions to the subject’s concomitant medicatio ns will be entered into the e-CRF with appropriate start and stop dates. All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution , until the Investigator and Sponsor agree that follow -up is no longer necessary, or the subject withdraws consent from the study o r is lost to follow up. The causal relationship between an AE and the study drug will be defined a s below: • Not Related: when the AE is definitely caused by the subject’s underlying clinical state, or the study procedure/conditions • Unlikely Related: when the temporal association between the AE and the d rug is such that the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with t he AE"
53,page_53,"Protocol KPL -716- C202 CONFIDENTIAL 28 January 2019 (Version 1.0) Page 54 of 78 • Possibly Related: when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedures/conditions • Related: when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from adminis tration of the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause -effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced The severity of an AE will be recorded as one of the following: • Mild: easily tolerated, does not interfere with normal daily activities, does n ot require intervention • Moderate: causes some interference with daily activities; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated • Severe: medically significant event; daily activities limited or completely halted; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization may be indicate d Adverse Drug Reactions All noxious and unintended responses to an investigational medicina l product (IMP; i.e., where a causal relationship between an IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable p ossibility) related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions. Serious A dverse Events An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • results in death, includes all deaths, even those that appear to be comp letely unrelated to study drug (e.g., car accident where subject is a passenger) • is life -threatenin g. An AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (i.e., does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form). For instance, dr ug- induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening even though drug -induced hepatitis can be fatal • requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hos pitalization. Hospitalization signifies that the subjec t has been admitted to the hospital or short - stay-type unit, or an emergency room stay for longer than 24 hours for obs ervation and/or treatment at a level of care which would not have been appropriate a t the study site s. Hospitalization for elective trea tment of a pre -existing non -worsening condition or, which is not the result of an AE, are not considered an AE. The details of such hospitalizations must be recorded on the medical hi story or physical examination page of the eCRF. Complications occurring during hospitalization are AEs and are SAEs if they cause prolongation of t he current hospitalization or meet other criteria that define SAEs"

D isability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. An AE is incapacitating or disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life funct ions • is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • is an i mportant medical event Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriat e medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or s urgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. All SAEs will be followed until resolution , until the Investigator and the Sponsor agree that follow -up is no longer necessary, or the subject withdraws consent from the study o r is lost to follow up.

Male subjects who have a female partner of childbearing potential mus t agree to use a highly effective and protocol approved contraceptive method (Section 6. 3) for the duration of the study and unti l 16 weeks after last st udy drug administration under this protocol. If a subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, study drug dosing must be discontinued immediately. A female subject must immediately inform the Investigator if she b ecomes pregnant during the study. A male subject must inform the Investigator if his femal e partner becomes pregnant during the study. Pregnancies occurring up to 16 weeks after last study drug administration must be reported to the Investigator. The Investig ator must report all pregnancies to the Sponsor or designee immediately and no later than 24 hours of their first knowledge of the pregnancy. The Investigator should counsel the subject t hat it is unknown what effects study drug might have on a fetus. Monitoring of the subjec t should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Instances of fetal death or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after cessation of the study treatment and consi dered by the Investigator to be possibly re lated to the study treatment, must be reported to the Sponsor as an SAE. Investigator Reporting Responsibilities to IRB Unanticipated problems posing risks to study subjects will be report ed to the IRB/IEC per their institutional policy. Copies of each re port and documentation of IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. Sponsor Reporting Responsibilities to Participating Investigators It is the responsibility of the Sponsor or designee to immediatel y notify all participating Investigators of any AE associated with the use of the study drug that is both serious and unexpected, as well as any finding from tests in laboratory animal s that suggest a significant risk for human subjects. 7.5.2 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory e valuations (including clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology) at the time points specified in Appendix 2. At the Screening Visit and at any time during the study at the discretion of the Inv estigator and in consultation with the Sponsor, if needed, s ubjects will be asked to provide urine samples for a drugs abuse screen ing.

An Investigator will perform a clinical assessment of all clinical labor atory test results. After Screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings shou ld be reported as AEs. 7.5.3 Vital Signs Supine blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) , pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be assessed at every visit from the Screening Visit throu gh the EOS Visit (Week 18) as outlined in Appendix 1. Subjects must be su pine for at least 5 minutes before blood pressure and pulse rate measurements. Vital signs may also be performed at other times if judged to be c linically appropriate by the Investiga tor or if the ongoing review of the safety data suggests a more detailed asses sment of vital signs is required. All measurements will be performed s ingly and may be repeated if outside the relevant clinical reference range. Additional vital sign assessme nts may be performed if clinically indicated, in the opinion of the Investig ator. 7.5.4 12-Lead Electrocardiogram The 12 -lead ECG recording will be performed at the designated time points as outli ned Appendix 1 . Resting 12-lead ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been supine and at rest for at least 5 minutes. Single 12 -lead ECGs will be repeated twice if either of the following criteria app ly: • QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s method (QTcF ) interval >450 ms in men and >470 ms in women • QTcF change from the baseline (pre -dose) is > 60 msec Additional 12 -lead ECGs may be performed at other times if judged to be clinicall y appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detaile d assessment of ECGs is required. The Investigator or designee will perform a clinical assess ment of each 12 -lead ECG. Any new clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study will be recorded as AEs. 7.5.5 Physical Examination A full physical examination or an abbreviated physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified in Appendix 1.

All clinical study data will be presented in subject da ta listings. Descriptive statistics will be presented for all endpoints and will include number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation ( SD), first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and frequency and percentage fo r categorical and ordinal variables. Unless otherwise specified, all tests will be two -tailed using pre -specified levels of significance. Statistical analyses of efficacy endpoints will be con ducted separately for each cohort. Details will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). 8.2 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data Criteria for removal of subjects from therapy or assessments are explai ned in Section 4. 8. To the extent possible, attempts will be made to minimize the amount of mis sing data through measures planned in the study conduct. Details for handling missin g values wil l be specified in the SAP. 8.3 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity No Multiplicity adjustment is planned. 8.4 Determination of Sample Size This is a double- blind study. Each cohort will be independently analyzed. A total of approximately 26 subjects will be rando mized in each cohort. The first 12 subjects will be randomized to the KPL -716 and the placebo arms in a 3:1 randomization ratio. The rest of the 14 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 randomization ratio. There will be approximately 16 subjects and 10 su bjects randomized to the KPL -716 arm and the placebo arm respectively. Based on a two -sample t -test for the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in weekly average of WI -NRS at Week 8, assumed mean changes of 4 for the KPL -716 arm and 1.5 for the placebo arm, a total sample size of 26 subjects per cohort will provide about 80% power to detect a 2.5 -point mean difference with a standard deviation of 2.8, given a two - sided alpha of 0.2. Given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, the precision att ained with the above cohort samples size is acceptable for early signal of efficacy assessments. 8.5 Analysis Populations 8.5.1 Modified Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set All randomized subjects who receive at least one (1) dose of KPL -716 or placebo and ha ve at least one ( 1) post-baseline efficacy assessment in the double- blind Treatment Period will be included in the modified intent -to-treat (mITT) analysis set. Efficacy analyses will be based on the mITT analysis sets. All mITT analyses will be based on e ach subject’s randomized treatment assignment."

Number of subjects requiring dose interruption and treatment discontinuation with corresponding reasons will be summarized as well. 8.7.2 Adverse Events All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) dictionary. Any AEs not present before exposure to study drug o r any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after exposure to st udy drug are considered TEAEs. The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs will be sum marized by MedDRA System Organ Class ( SOC ) and preferred term (PT), by severity, and by relationship to study treatment. The number and percentage of subjects w ith SAEs, and the number and percentage of subjects with AEs leading to treatment discont inuation will also be summarized by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. 8.7.3 Clinical and Laboratory Events and Analyses Continuous laboratory data will be examined for trends using d escriptive statistics of actual values and changes from baseline over time. These data will also be categorized as low, normal or high based on the reference ranges of the central laboratory. S hift tables from baseline to each post baseline time point will be presented. 8.7.4 ECG Analyses For repeated performance of 12 -lead ECG, average values will be taken. Descriptive statistics of actual values and changes from baseline over time will be summari zed by ECG parameter. For ECG overall interpretation of normal and abnormal, shi ft tables from baseline to each post baseline time poin ts and worst post baseline will be presented. 8.7.5 Vital Signs Vital signs will be summarized using descriptive statistics of actual values and changes from baseline over time. 8.7.6 Physical Examination Clinically significant new or worsened physical examination abn ormalities following treatment will be recorded as AEs and will be reflected in the summary of AEs. 8.7.7 Concomitant Medications Concomitant medications will be coded using World Health Organizati on (WHO ) Drug Dictionary.
