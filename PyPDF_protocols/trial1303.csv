A recent analysis showed that FL patients who relapsed within 2 years of R -CHOP therapy (approximately 20% of all patients) had poor prognosis, with a 5-year OS of 50% versus 90% in those who relapsed later ( Casulo et al 2015 ). These data challenge the indolent behavior of FL and emphasize the need for novel therapies. CD19 represents an attractive therapeutic target because it is wide ly expressed on malignant B -cells ,including FL (Freedman 2014 ). Tisagenlecleucel consists of autologous T cells that are genetically modified ex vivo via lentiviral transduction to express a chimeric a ntigen receptor (CAR) consisting of a CD19 antigen recognition domain attached to intracellular signaling domains that mediate T -cell activation. Data from patients with B -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and DLB CL show a potent anti-tumor activity of tisagenlecleucel . In Study A2101J, 14 patients with refractory FL were infused with tisagenlecleucel . Ten (71%) patients achieved CR and maintained it after 28.6 months of follow up ( Schuster et al 2017 ). Primary objective Evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel therapy as measured by complete response rate determined by Independent Review Committee in the full analysis set based on Lugano 2014 classification response criteria ( Cheson et al 2014 ). Secondary objectivesEvaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel as measured by additional efficacy measures, including Overall Response Rate (ORR) , Duration of Response (DOR) ,Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) . Evaluate safety of tisagenlecleucel Characterize the in vivo cellular kinetics (levels, expansion, persistence) of tisagenlecleucel transduced cells into target tissues (blood, bone marrow, andother tissues if available) and CD3+ tisagenlecleucel cells in peripheral blood Characterize the incidence and prevalence of tisagenlecleucel immunogenicity (humoral and cellular) Characterize the impact of pre -existing and treatment induced immunogenicity on cellular kinetics, efficacy and safety Describe the effect of tisagenlecleucel therapy on patient reported outcomes Study design Single arm, multi -center, phase II study to determine the efficacy and safet yof tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with relapsed or refractory FLwith the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre -treatment, Treatment and Follow - up. Efficacy and safety will be evaluated for 2 years post-infusion. Afterwards, patients will continue to be foll owed until 15 years post -infusion as per health authority guidelines in a s eparate study protocol . Population Approximately 113 adult patients with relapsed or refractory FLwill be enrolled to obtain 90 patients treated with tisagenlecleucel. Key inclusion criteria Patients eligible for inclusion in this study have to meet all of the following criteria (for detailed criteria see Section 5.2):"

Efficacy assessmentsRadiologic imaging by PET and CT (or MRI, if CT contraindicated) Bone marrow biopsy or aspirate Tumor biopsy or cytology Key safety assessmentsVital signs Adverse events Laboratory tests Pharmacody namic assessmentsB cell and T cell levels (peripheral blood), Pharmacokinetic assessmentsTisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics by q-PCR and flow cytometry Other assessmentsLeukocyte gene expression profiling Flow cytometry of peripheral blood before leukapheresis Flow cytometry of leukapheresis product Patient reported outcomes (SF-36v2, FACT -Lym , and EQ-5D -3L) Data analy sis The primary endpoint is the complete response rate as determined by independent review committee (IRC) . The complete response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR recorded from tisagenlecleucel infusion until progressive disease or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first. One interim analysis for overwhelming efficacy is planned for the study when approximately 50 patients of the planned 90 (55.6%) have received infusion and have either completed 6 months from study day 1 infusion or discontinued earlier. The primary analysis will be performed when 90 patients have received infusion and completed 6 months from study day 1 infusion or discontinued earlier."

19,page_19,"Novartis Confidential Page 20 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 1 Background 1.1 Overview of disease pathogenesis, epidemiology and current treatment Non-Hodgkin l ymphomas (NHLs) comprise a heterogeneous group of l ymphoid malignancies, including immature l ymphoid neoplasms, mature B -cellneoplasms, mature T -cell and NK -cell neoplasms, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (Swerdlow et al 2008). Mature B -cell lymphomas are further classified into indolent lymphomas, e.g. follicular lymphoma (FL), and aggressive l ymphomas, e.g. diffuse large B- cell l ymphoma (DLBCL). FL is the second most common histologic NHL subtype in the West ern hemisphere ( Ghielmini et al 2013). The estimated number of new cases in the US was 13,960 in 2016 (Teras et al 2016 ). Most patients are diagnosed during the sixth decade of their life but approximately 25% of patients are 40 years of age or younger (Jaglowski et al 2009). The translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) is the genetic hallmark of follicular lymphoma, which results in the constitutive overexpression of B -cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2). FLcells also express surface immunoglobulins, B-cell lymphoma 6 protein (Bcl -6), and B-cell associated antigens such as CD10, CD19, CD20, and CD22. FL is classified histologically into three grades based on the number of centroblasts ( Swerdlow et al 2008 ). Most FL patients have widespread disease at diagnosis, including peripheral and central lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow. Current therapeutic approaches include “watchful waiting”, radiotherap y, radioimmunotherapy , and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies with or without chemotherap y. Follicular ly mphoma frequently relapses and therefore is considered incurable. Patients relapsing within 2 years of therap y with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) ,presenting approximatel y 20% of cases ,have a poor prognosis with a median 5 -year survival of onl y 50% ( Casulo et al 2015 ). The management of relapsed or refractory FL(r/r FL) includes non-cross resistant agents, autologous /allogen eic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and phosphatidy linositol 3 -kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, such as idelalisib and copanlisib. PI 3K play s a critical role in the B-cell receptor pathway and is overexpressed in B-cell malignancies. Both idelalisib and copanlisib are approved for the treatment of FL that relapsed after at least two prior systemic therapies based on single arm, open label, phase 2 studies. In idelalisib -treated FL patients, overall response rate (ORR )was 56%, including 14% with complete response (CR) and 42% with partial response (PR), while median progression free survival (PFS)was 11.0 months (Salles et al 2017 ). In copanlisib-treated FL patients, ORR was 59% (CR 14%, PR 44%), and median PFS was 12.2 months ( FDA 2017 ). Autologous HSCT does not result in significant overall survival benefit in patients with relapsed FL when compared to those treated with salvage chemoimmunotherap y (Epperla et al 2017). Allogeneic HSCT, a potentially curative therapy , is eligible for a very small number of selected patients. Moreover , it leads to high transplant - related mortality of 8-17% at 1 year (Epperla et al 2017 ). Tisagenlecleucel is an adoptive cellular immunotherap y that uses autologous peripheral blood T cells that have been genetically modified ex vivo to target CD19 on the surface of B cells."

However, insertion of vector sequences has the potential to up-regulate, dysregulate, or knockout local gene expression, which theoreticall y may lead to insertional oncogenesis. Malignant cell transformation after vector -mediated insertional mutagenesis has been observed in X -linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCI D-X1), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and Wiskott- Aldrich syndrome (WAS) where first-generation gamma -retroviral vectors harboring long terminal repeats (LTRs) with strong enhancer/promoter sequences were used (Hacein -Bey-Abina et al 2003 , Howe et al 2008, Boztug et al 2010 , Stein et al 2010 , Persons and Baum 2011 ). Lentiviral vectors, a major subset of retroviral vectors, demonstrate distinct integration patterns compared to oncoretroviral vectors, which have been the predominant vector to date for gene transfer studies. The integration pattern of lentiviral vectors tends to be inside active transcription units as opposed to upstream in the locus control region where the insertion would have a great er chance of up-regulating gene expression. In addition, lentiviral vectors have no enhancer activit y in their LTR regions and have lower levels of pol y-A read-through, all factors which may improve gene transfer safet y (Zaiss et al 2002). Thus, lentiviral vectors appear a safer alternative to oncoretroviral vectors, which is supported by animal models ( Montini et al 2006). Importantly , despite a very high transduction efficiency achieved using lentiviral vectors, molecular clonality studies have not indicated any reasons for concern, to date, in published clinical trials ( Schambach et al 2013 ). With the exception of a single study in neonatal mice, lentiviral vectors have not been shown to be oncogenic in nature ( Themis et al 2005 ). A study in tumor prone mice demonstrated that lentiviral vecto r gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells of up to an average of 6 copies per cell was not tumorigenic in contrast to retroviral vectors at an average copy number of 3 per cell (Montini et al 2006). It is notable that Tcell leukemia is not a recognized side effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) lentiviral infection. A long-term retrospective study of >500 patient -years of collective patient samples tested for at least 11 years after infusion from three clinical trials using gamma - retroviral modified T cells did not show evidence of transgene silencing, atypical gamma -retroviral integration patterns, or clonal expansion ( Scholler et al 2012) . A favorable safet y profile was also determined for a conditionally replicating HIV -derived lentivirus that delivered HIV envelope antisense to patient Tcells. Moreover, no evidence for insertional mutagenesis or enrichment of vector copies near proto- oncogenes was observed after 21-36 months (Levine et al 2006) and 28-32 weeks (Wang et al 2009 ). Another group reported no apparent risk of vector related adverse events (AEs) following 263 infusions of autologous, lentiviral transduced T cells with a long ribonucleic acid (RNA) antisense to HIV -1 envelope ( McGarrit y et al 2013 ). More recently ex vivo lentiviral transduced hematopoietic stem cells were used to correct an inherited storage disease in three children and in an inherited WAS in 3 children with follow up for up to 24 months and 20-32 months, respectively . Lentiviral integration studies showed sustained gene marking with polyclonal engraftment of transduced cells with no evidence of aberrant clonal"
21,page_21,"Novartis Confidential Page 22 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 expansion, no evidence of in vivo selection of clones carrying integrations near oncogenes and therefore no evidence of vector- induced genotox icity (Biffi et al 2013 , Aiuti et al 2013 ). 1.2 Introduction to investigational treatment(s) and other study treatment(s) 1.2.1 Overview of tisagenlecleucel A doptive T cell therap y for cancer involves the infusion of native or geneticall y modified mature Tcells that have the capacit y to recognize and eliminate the patient’s malignant cells. In particular, chimeric antigen receptor -based approach involves engineering Tcells with sequences that encode antibody -based antigen recognition moieties linked to signaling domains. Unlike T cell receptors (TCR), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) allow the Tcells to specificall y target and destroy tumor cells in a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) independent manner ( Mellman et al 2011 ). A promising target antigen for B cell malignancies is CD19, a cell-surface protein whose expression is restricted to B cells andtheir precursors (Sadelain et al 2003 , Porter et al 2011), with no expression on hematopoietic stem cells or non-B cell tissues. It is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamil y and a component of a cell surface signal transduction complex that regulates signal transduction through the B cell receptor (Fearon et al 2000). Mice lacking CD19 have decreased number of B cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues, decreased B cell response to oral vaccines and mitogens, and decreased seru m Ig levels ( Fearon et al 2000). First generation CARs contain the TCR activation signal domain consisting of TCRζ. Second generation CARs contain costimulatory signaling domains as well: either CD28 or 4 -1BB. The 3rdgeneration CARs contain further advancements such as double costimulatory modules comprised of CD28, 4-1BB plus TCRζ ( June 2007 , June et al 2009 , Kohn et al 2011 ). Tisagenlecleucel , a second gene ration CAR T cell therap y, is an adoptive cellular immunotherapy thatuses the autologous peripheral blood T cells that have been geneticall y modified ex vivo to target CD19 on the surface of B cells. As shown in Figure 1-1, the CAR approach uses genetically programmed T cells transfected with chimeric receptor genes to combine the effector functions of T cells with the ability of antibodies to recognize predefined surface antigens with high specificit y ina non-MHC restricted manner (Gross et al 1989 , Pinthus et al 2003). These receptors have the ability to recognize intact membrane proteins independ ent of antigen processing. The tumor antigen binding function of CAR is usually accomplished by the inclusion of a single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody , containing the heav y chain variable domain (V H) and light chain variable domain (V L) joined b y a peptide linker of about 15 residues in length ( Mullaney et al 2001)."

Consequently , tisagenlecleucel appears to be a therapeutic alternative for patients with B cell malignancies (including FL) refractory to the current therapies. For further information refer to the [I nvestigator ’sBrochure] . 1.2.2 Non- clinical experience Extensive literature supports the use of engineered T cells for tumor immunotherapy in rodent tumor models (Calogero et al 2000 , Clay et al 2002 , Hombach et al 2002 , Pule et al 2003 , Sadelain 2003 ). Others have used electroporation or retroviral vectors to create CAR Tcells and have shown in vivo safet y and efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells in immunodeficient mouse models (Willemsen et al 2000 , Roessig et al 2002 , Brentjens et al 2003 , Cooper et al 2003, Serrano et al 2006 ). The incorporation of costimulatory signaling modules such as CD28 and 4 -1BB in second generation CARs increases potency of the engineered T cells in pre- clinical studies (Finney et al 1998 , Krause et al 1998 , Eshhar et al 2001 , Maher et al 2002 , Finney et al 2004 , Friedmann- Morvinski et al 2005 , Brentjens et al 2010 ). The pre -clinical data supporting CAR Tcell persistence, expansion and anti-tumor efficacy have been published (Gross and Eshhar 1992 , Milone et al 2009). 1.2.3 Clinical experience There are currentl y 12 ongoing therapeutic studies of tisagenlecleucel therapy (Study B2101J, Study B2205J, Study B2202, Study B2208J, Study B2203J, Study A2201, Study A2101J, Study C2201, Study ZUS01T, Study UPCC -19416 and Study UPCC -39416), three ongoing long term follow up safet y studies (Study A2207J, Study A2208J, and A2205B), and two single patient IND studies (Z2101 I and B2002I).

The persistence of tisagenlecleucel transgene in peripheral blood has been observed for up to 18 months. All responding patients demonstrated expansion of transgene levels. Neither patient characteristics nor prior therapy had any clinically relevant impact on expansion Cellular and humoral immunogenicity had no impact on the cellul ar kinetics or clinical outcome ( Awasthi et al 2017 ). 1.2.3.2 Clinical efficacy Tisagenlecleucel is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients up to 25 years with B- cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or i n second or later relapse (Kymriah FDA 2017) . Tisagenlecleucel is being reviewed by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of adult patients with refractory or relapsed DLBCL who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, and by the EMA for the treatment of pediatric and young adult patients (age 3 to 25 years) with refractory or relapsed B -cell ALL. Efficacy in r/rpediatric and y oung adult ALL Out of the 63 tisagenlecleucel -infused patients, 52 (83%) achieved CR/CR iwithin 3 months after infusion, and all of them were MRD -negative . With a median follow -up of 4.8 months from response, the median duration of CR/CRi was not reached (range: 1.2 to 14.1+ months). Median time to onset of CR/CRi was 29 day s (Kymriah FDA 2017 ). Efficacy in adult r/rNHL In Study C2201 (adult patients with r/r DLBC L), the overall response rate(ORR )was 53% (40% CR ad 14% PR), and 73.5% of the patients were relapse -free at 6 months of follow up. Most CR patients remained in CR at 3 months ( Schuster et al 2017 ). In Stud y A2101J, 14 patients with refractor y FL were infused with tisagenlecleucel . Ten ( 71%) patients achieved CR and maintained it after 28.6 months of follow up (Schuster et al 2017 ). 1.2.3.3 Clinical Safety Section 6.2.6 and Section 6.3.2 outline expected and potential toxicities related to tisagenlecleucel , most of which occur within 8 weeks of infusion.

24,page_24,"Novartis Confidential Page 25 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 Eleven deaths were reported for patients who received KYMRIAH, of which 2 deaths occurred within 30 day s of infusion. Seven were disease -related, three were attributed to infections, and one to intracerebral h emorrhage ( Kymriah FDA 2017). Safety in adult r/r B -NHL Instudy C2201, among the 99 patients assesse d for safet y, there were 58% with CRS (15% Grade 3, 8% Grade 4), 21% with neurological events (8% Grade 3, 4% Grade 4), 34% with infections (1 8% G rade 3 , 2% grade 4), and 1% with tumor ly sis sy ndrome (Grade 3 only). The median time to CRS onset was 3 days(range 1-51 days), median CRS duration was 7 days (range 2-30 days); 15% of patients required tocilizumab and 11% of patients required corticosteroids. There were 16 patients who died after tisagenlecleucel infusion. Three patients died within 30 days of tisagenlecleucel infusion due to DLBCL ; 13 patients died more than 30 days (range from 41 to 236 days) after tisagenlecleucel infusion (12 due to DLBCL disease progression and 1 due to chronic kidney disease not related to tisagenlecleucel ) . Overall, the safety events that occurred in study C2201 were manageable with close monitoring and established treatment algorithm ; the safet y profile has been well characterized (Schuster et al 2017). In a recent published study conducted at the University of Penns ylvania (study A2101J), 36 patients (20 DLBCL, 14 FL, 2 MCL ) were treated with tisagenlecleucel . There was one death (possibly related to tisagenlecleucel ) in a patient with FL who died 234 days after tisagenlecleucel infusion in pathological CR.For further information refer to the [Investigator ’s Brochure] . The recentl y approved CAR T cell therap y for adult r/r DLBCL caused CRS in 94% of patients (13% Grade ≥3) and neurologic toxicities in 87% of patients (31% Grade ≥3) (YESCARTA FDA 2017). Vector- related Safety To date, no vector -related AEs have been seen associated with higher tisagenlecleucel transgene levels of expression or persistence in three pediatric patients with r/r ALL and in 4 adult patients with r/r CLL. Post-infusion monitoring forreplication competent lentivirus (RCL )in trials with UPENN manufactured tisagenlecleucel therapy has shown no Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, Gl ycoprotein (VSV -G) by q-PCR detectable in any of the patient samples at time points up to 2 years following infusion (7 patients from UPCC03712 trial; 16 patients form UPCC04409 trial, 11 patients from CHP959 trial). 2 Rationale 2.1 Stud y rationale and purpose Despite recent progress, FL remains incurable. A recent anal ysis showed that FL patients who relapsed within 2 years of R-CHOP therap y (approximately 20%of all patients) had poor"
25,page_25,"Novartis Confidential Page 26 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 prognosis, with a 5-year OS of 50% versus 90% in those who relapsed later (Casulo et al 2015). These data challenge the indolent behavior of FL and emphasize the need for nove l therapies. CD19 represents an attractive therapeutic target because it is widely expressed on malignant B - cells but not on pluripotent stem cells or non-B cell tissues. CD19 is almost universall y expressed in FL (Freedman 2014). Tisagenlecleucel consists of autologous T cells that are geneticall y modified exvivo via lentiviral transduction to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) consisting of a CD19 antigen recognition domain attached to intrac ellular signaling domains that mediate T -cell activation. Data from patients with B-cell acute lympho blastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocy tic leukemia (CLL) and DLBCL show a potent anti-tumor activity of tisagenlecleucel . InStudy A2101J , 14 patients with refractory FL were infused with a single dose of CTL 019 cells (range 1×108to 5×108CTL019 cells ). Ten (71%) patients achieved CR and maintained it after 28.6 months of follow up ( Schuster et al 2017 ). The mechanism of action of tisagenlecleucel is independent of PI3K signaling. In addition, a cross -resistance with CD20 -targeted therapies such asrituximab is not expected. Anti -CD19 CAR T cell s are also effective in CLL patients who p rogressed on ibrutinib ( Turtle et al 2017 ). 2.2 Rationale for study design This single arm, multi- center, phase II study will determine the efficacy and safet y of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with FL who failed at least 2 prior systemic therapies, including an anti-CD20 antibody (e.g. rituximab) and an alkylating agent. Patients who were treated with other FL-targeting agents (including PI3K inhibitors) and patients who relap sed after autologous HSCT will also be included. The rarit y of r/r FL patients ,poor prognosis, no established standard of treatment, lowresponse rates tocurrently available therapies (see section 1.1), and a high response rate to tisagenlecleucel repor ted recentl yin heavil y pretreated FL patients (Schuster et al 2017 )justif y a single -armstudy design . 2.3 Rationale for dose and regimen selection The recommended dose in this trial is a single infusion of 0.6 – 6.0 x 108CAR -positive viable Tcells, which is based on data from studies in CLL, ALL and NHL. The dose-response, dose - safet y, and dose-cellular kinetics analy ses were performed using the data obtained from r/r DLBCL patients (data cut-off date: 8-March- 2017) in Phase II study (Study C2201) to assess the impact of dose on exposure, response, and selected safety endpoints in order to select safe and efficacious doses for use in the prescribing setting (commercial) and Study E2202. Dose -response an d dose -exposure: Across the dose range studied, dose and exposure were independent. Additionally , responses were observed across the full range of doses from 0.6 to 6.0×108CAR -positive viable T cells. Dose -safet y: The probability of any grade neurolog ic events and time to resolution of cytopenia were not impacted by dose. There was an increase in probabilit y of an y grade and grade 3/4 CRS with increasing dose; however, the probability of grade 3/4 CRS was comparable across the dose range of 5.0 to 6.0×108CAR -positive viable T cells. The model estimates from logistic regression anal ysis showed that the probability of grade 3/4"
26,page_26,"Novartis Confidential Page 27 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 CRS for dose of 5.0×108cells and 6.0×108cells were comparable, i.e., 0.389 and 0.462, respectivel y. In addition, CRS is genera lly manageable in the study with the steps outlined in the CRS algorithm. Based on the totality of the dose-safet y, dose-efficacy , dose-exposure and exposure -response, and considering the positive benefit risk observed across the full range of doses, the f ollowing recommended dose will be utilized for Study E2202: 0.6 - 6.0×108CAR -positive viable T cells. Clinically meaningful responses were seen across this range in patient s with r/r DLBCL in Study C2201 . In a recent lypublished study conducted the the Un iversity of Penns ylvania , 14 DLBCL and 14 FL patients were infused with a median total tisagenlecleucel dose of 5.00 x 108(range: 1.79 x 108–5.00 x 108). The CAR T cell specific toxicities, such as CRS and neurotoxicity were less frequent and less sever e than previously reported for tisagenlecleucel in ALL and CLL (Schuster et al 2017 ). For further information on tisagenlecleucel dosing in preclinical and clinical studies see [Investigator ’sBrochure] . 2.4 Rationale for ly mphodepletion Adoptive immunotherapy strategies may be able to capitalize on homeostatic T cell proliferation (Dummer et al 2002), a finding that naive T cells begin to proli ferate and differentiate into memory -like T cells when total numbers of naive T cells are reduced be low a certain threshold (Goldrath 1999, Surh 2000). Host lymphodepletion may enhance the effectiveness of adoptively transferred T cells (Dummer et al 2002). Homeostatic T cell proliferation can lead to activation of certain immune cell sub sets ( King et al 2004 ), providing a clue to improved anti-tumor responses. T cells can undergo up to seven rounds of cell division after being deprived of contact with antigen presenting cells ( Kaech 2001 , van Stipdonk 2001). Lym phodepletion eliminates regulatory T cells and other competing elements of the immune system that act as “cytokine sinks”, enhancin g the availability of cytokines such as IL -7 and IL - 15 (Klebanoff et al 2005 ). Data indicates that the increased antitumor efficacy of adoptive transfer following host conditioning is more than simply “making room” because the quantitative recovery of adoptively transferred T cells in mice reveals that in vivo proliferation following adoptive transfer is identical in mice with or without previous irradiation ( Palmer et al 2004). Fludarabine with cyclophosphamide has been the most commonly utilized lymphodepleting regimen with CD19 CAR -T cell therapies. It has been demonstrated that addition of fludarabine to cyclophosphamide increases CAR-T cell expa nsion and persistence and improves disease free survival rates in adult patients with r/r B- ALL ( Turtle et al 2016 ). In studies [B2202] and [B2205J] combined data (cut-off dates: 24-Apr- 2017 for Study [B2202]; 01-Feb-2016 for Study [B2205J]), 99 of 104 patients received lymphodepleting chemotherap y. Ninety -seven of these 99 patients received fludarabine and cy clophosphamide. In study [C2201] 92of 99 patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy . Seven ty-three patients received fludarabine and cy clophosphamide, and 19received Bendamustine."

Overall, it is anticipated that the benefits of tisagenlecleucel therapy , including complete and long-lasting remissions when compared to the current standards of care, will outweigh the risks in this study . Appropriate eligibility criteria are included in this protocol. Recommended guidelines for prophy lactic or supportive management of study-drug induced AEs are provided in Section 6.1.4 and Section 6.2.6. The risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by adherence to the eligibility criteria, close clinical monitoring, and adherence to the recommendations for the management of AEs known to be occur with tisagenlecleucel exposure, and guidance for the investigators in the [Investigator ’sBrochure] . Safety risks that have been identified with the use of tisagenlecleucel or are considered potentially associated with tisagenlecleucel are briefly outlined below. 2.7.1 Identified safety risks 2.7.1.1 Cytokine release sy ndrome (CRS) / macrophage activation sy ndrome (MAS) Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an on-target toxicity that is associated with tisagenlecleucel cell expansion, activation and tumor cell killing. It is a result of systemic inflammatory response caused when cytokines are released by activated T cells, including IFNg, IL-6 and TNF. Severe and life -threatening events have been observed in patients treated with tisagenlecleucel . In r/r B-ALL, these appeared to be related to tumor burden, early CRS onset and early fever onset. In DLBCL, the probability of developing grade 3 and 4 CRS was increased with high tisagenlecleucel dose and exposure. In the majority of cases, CRS occurs within the first two weeks post-infusion and shows a wide range of clinical signs and symptoms (Table 2-1). Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is also associated with CRS as manifested by liver function test abnormalities, cy topenias, and coagulopathy . Life-threatening and fatal outcomes associated with CRS and severe concomitant infections have been observed in pediatric and adult patients treated with tisagenlecleucel ."

The pathophy siology for neurotoxicity is not fully understood but thought to be related to generalized T cell mediated inflammation rather than direct toxicity of CAR -T cells on the brain (Tey 2014 ). Some of the neurological events observed may be related to CRS, but whether this results from systemic cytokines crossing the blood brain barrier and engaging cytokine receptors in the brain or from direct cytokine production in the CNS is not clear (Maus et al 2014). There ar e no clear predictors of neurologic toxicity . Manifestations of neurological events may include a multifarious set of symptoms and diagnoses including agitation, altered state of consciousness, aphasia, confusion, delirium, disorientation, encephalopathy , headache, mutism, seizures or tremor. Some of the events are severe and may have a life -threatening outcome. The majority of neurological events were observed within 8 weeks following tisagenlecleucel infusion and were transient, however a delay ed onset (i.e.> 8 weeks) may occur. Notably , the onset of neurological toxicity can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS or in the absence of CRS. Onset of neurological events may be concurrent with high fever during the development and at the time of maximal grade of CRS. The incidence appeared to be greater with higher CRS severity , prior history of CNS leukemia, and history of other prior CNS diseases, and did not appear to be prevented by tocilizumab. Encephalopathy typicall y occurred after peak CRS symptoms and tended to be self -limiting with some exceptions. A few have occurred after CRS and were not associated with high fevers. The causality assessment of neurological events in patients treated with tisagenlecleucel can be confounded as CNS toxicity may be associated with chemotherap y used for lymphodepletion and the presence of comorbid conditions such as CRS, fever and infections. For the management of neurological events see Section 6.2.6.2."
29,page_29,"Novartis Confidential Page 30 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 2.7.1.3 Hypersensitivity including acute infusion r eactions Since tisagenlecleucel is an autologous cellular product, hy persensitivity may occur due to the excipients (such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dextran 40) of the infused solution in which the cells are dispersed. In addition, host immune respons es may result from presentation of CAR transgene expressed immunogenic epitopes including murine sequences in the scFv extracellular binding domain (derived from a murine monoclonal antibody ) or novel epitopes arising at junctions between components of theCAR fusion polypeptide (Park et al 2007; Lamers et al 2006 ; Lamers et al 2007 ; Lamers et al 2011 ). Clinically , hypersensitivity reactions can be classified as 'immediate' or 'delayed' depending on their onset after drug administration (Corominas et al 2014 ; Limsuwan and Demoly 2010). In principle , immediate reactions including acute infusion reactions occur within less than 1 hour after drug administration and may present in a wide range of symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, dyspnea, bronchospasm, tachycardia, hypotension, anaph ylaxis or anaphy lactic shock. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions appear after more than 1 hour and up to sever al days after drug exposure and could include variable cutaneous symptoms such as late-occurring urticaria, maculopapular eruptions, fixed drug eruptions, vasculitis, toxic epidermal necrol ysis, Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome, or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (Averbeck et all 2007; Descotes 2012; Corominas et al 2014 ; Vultaggio et al 2016 ). To date, the majorit y of events observed after tisagenlecleucel infusion were mild or moderate in severity , manageable and recovered. Patients will have ty pically received lymphode pleting chemotherap y that is completed several days prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. Therefore it should be kept in mind that sy mptoms and findings at this time may also be the result of the onset of chemotherapy related toxicities. A therapeutic strate gy for the management of hypersensitivity including acute infusion reactions is provided in Section 6.2.6.3 . 2.7.1.4 Tumor ly sis sy ndrome (TLS) Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potentially life-threatening metabolic disorder that occurs when tumor cells undergo rapid decomposition spontaneously or in response to cytoreductive therap y. It tends to occur particularl y with highl y effective therapies a nd in patients with high tumor burden and cancers with a high potential for cell lysis include high-grade lymphomas, acute leukemias, and other rapidl y proliferating tumors. Metabolic abnormalities characteristic of TLS include abnormally high serum uric acid levels (hyperuricemia) resulting from the breakdown of purine -containing nucleic acids and major electrol yte imbalances such as hy perkalemia, hy perphosphatemia, and hy pocalcemia. Delay ed recognition of the metabolic imbalances caused by the massive release of tumor cell contents may result in clinical complications such as acute kidney injury , seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias ( Mughal et al 2010 ).

A therapeutic strategy for the management of TLS is provided in Section 6.2.6.4. 2.7.1.5 Infections There is an increased risk and severit y of infections in patients with longer and more intense immunosuppression. Patients treated with tisagenlecleucel are at risk of infection for several reasons: Lym phodepleting chemotherapy prior to treatment with tisagenlecleucel may cause severe neutropenia and B -cell depleti on from tisagenlecleucel itself is known to be associated with infections. B-cell depletion is known to be associated with hy pogammaglobulinemia that also contributes to the risk. Patient with prolonged and profound immunosuppression may be at enhanced risk for more frequent and severe opportunistic infections Underl ying bone marrow disease or d ysfunction further increases the risk of infections Serious infections were observed in patients after tisagenlecleucel infusion, some of which were life-threatenin g or fatal. Viral Reactivation Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. Hepatitis cases have been reported in patient s who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, and also in patients who are HBsAg -negative but hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive. HBV reactivation has occurred in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg -negative, anti-HBc-positive and hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] positive). HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previou sly HBsAg -negative and anti-HBc-positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed b y hepatitis, as indicated by anincrease in transaminase levels. In severe cases, increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur. Patients with active or prior hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV confirmed by serology will not be enrolled in the study ; for detailed exclusion criteria see Section 5.2, for serology assessment see Appendix 2 . A therapeutic strategy for the management of infections is provided in Section 6.2.6.5. 2.7.1.6 Febrile neutropenia Febrile neutropenia observed with tisagenlecleucel can be caused due to multiple factors, including underl ying bone marrow disease, prior chemotherapies, radiation treatments or lymphodepleting chemotherap y, reduced response to growth factors (either exogenous or endogenous) in addition to B-cell aplasia that may favor a production of auto-antibodies binding"
31,page_31,"Novartis Confidential Page 32 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 to the neutrophil surface resulting in neutropenia and also disturb the balance between granulopoiesis and ly mphopoiesis in the bone marrow ( Tesfa and Palmblad 2011 ). Febrile neutropenia and associated events such as grade 3 or grade 4 decreased neutrophil counts with elevated temperature were reported in clinical studies with tisagenlecleucel . The use of chemotherapy is known to be associated with the risk of neutropenia and if severe, with febrile neutropenia. The risk of neutropenia depends on various factors such as type and dose of chemotherap y used, age, gender, performance status and baseline hematology lab data. As lymphodepleting therap y is used in all patients with a WBC count >1000 cells/μL , febrile neutropenia is seen in patients treated with tisagenlecleucel regimen. Also, as ly mphodepleting therap y is given close to the infusion of tisagenlecleucel (within two weeks), therefore, overlapping toxicities can be expected. A therapeutic strategy for the management of febrile neutropenia is provided in Section 6.2.6.6. 2.7.1.7 Prolonged depletion of normal B cells and agammaglobulinemia B -cell aplasia is an expected on-target toxicity of a successful CD19 -directed CAR T cell therap y and a useful surrogate reflecting the persistence of CAR T cells and effectiveness of treatment. B-cell aplasia is observed in all responding patients in B-ALL . The AEs observed after tisagenlecleucel infusion were managed well by treatment with immunoglobulins. Loss of B-cells can result in hypo-to agammaglobulinemia, potentially rendering the patients more susceptible to infections, especially with encapsulated organisms; and viral reactivation such as herpes viruses or rarel y in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) ( Section 2.7.1.7.1). Given that a typical T -lymphocy te may have a lifespan of 40 years, tisagenlecleucel may potentially be detectable in a patient for a very prolonged period and prolonged depletion of B- cells may occur, in particular in the subset of patients who continue to demonstrate a tumor response. Long term data are currentl y not ava ilable. 2.7.1.7.1 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a demy elinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with reactivation of prior John Cunningham (JC) virus infection. Patients classic ally present with focal neurologic deficits (e.g., weakness, speech difficulties, unsteady gait and hemiparesis), ophthalmic symptoms (e.g., homony mous hemianopia progressing to cortical blindness), personality changes, and cognitive dysfunction. Imaging (CT or MRI) shows lesions in the white matter, most commonly of the occipitoparietal lobe and without mass effect. A therapeutic strategy for the management of B cell depletion with resulting hypogammaglobulinemia is provided in Section 6.2.6.7. 2.7.1.8 Hematopoietic cy topenias lasting greater than or equal to 28 day s Haematopoietic cytopenias are an on-target effect after tisagenlecleucel infusion and activity of tisagenlecleucel on normal B -cells."
32,page_32,"Novartis Confidential Page 33 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 Patients may exhibit haematopoietic cytopenias for several weeks as a result of exposure to tisagenlecleucel, bridging and lymphodepleting chemotherapies. Prolonged neutropenia has been associated with increased risk of infection. Myeloid growth factors, particularly GM-CSF, are not recommended during the first 3 weeks after tisagenlecleucel infusion or until CRS has resolved. A therapeutic strategy for the management of hematopoietic cy topenias is provided in Section 6.2.6.8. 2.7.2 Potential safety risks Thus far, an association with the potential safet y risks briefl y described below and tisagenlecleucel have not been confirmed. However, these topics are being closely monitored due to their clinical relevance. 2.7.2.1 Cerebral edema Fatal cases of cerebral edema, soon after infusion with rapid evolution, have been reported with CAR -T cell therapies other than tisagenlecleucel; in five patients in the Rocket study evaluating JCAR015 for the treatment of ALL and in one patient in the Z uma-1 study evaluating KTE -19 for the treatment of CLL. The patient in the Zuma -1 study is described as becoming febrile on Day 1 and progressing from grade 3 to grade 4 CRS, refractory to tocilizumab and dexamethasone, by Day 4. Cerebral edema developed on Day 9, was refractory to siltuximab and mannitol, and led to death on Day 11 (Turtle et al 2017 ). To date there have been no such cases reported for tisagenlecleucel. 2.7.2.2 Replication competent lentivirus (RCL) production Replication -competent lentivirus (RCL ) may be generated during tisagenlecleucel manufacturing using a lentiviral vector to encode anti-CD19 CAR or subsequently after introduction of vector transduced viable T cells into the patient. Howe ver, an RCL resulting from manufacturing is highly unlikel y since elements are incorporated in the design of the vector system that minimize vector recombination and generation of RCL . Furthermore, the vector used to transduce the product undergoes sensiti ve assay s for detection of RCL Thus patients will only receive cell products that meet RCL release criteria considered sufficient to confirm the absence of RCL in tisagenlecleucel and the negligible probability of de novo generation of any RCL. No AEs related to generation of RCL were noted post-infusion in the tisagenlecleucel development program. However, generation of an RCL following tisagenlecleucel infusion remains a theoretical possibility . The development of RCL could pose a risk to both the patient s and their close contact(s), and therefore, monitoring for RCL will be conducted during the course of the trial (see [Investigational Product Handling Manual ]for a description of the assay s). Since the probability and characteristics of an RCL are unknow n, no regulatory guideline for the management of RL C positive patients exist to date."
33,page_33,"Novartis Confidential Page 34 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 As per guidance for gene therapy medicinal products, patients exposed to tisagenlecleucel will be monitored for 15 years following last treatment for vectors persistence and RCL within the long-term follow -up study . The Management of this potential risk is addressed in Section 6.2.6.9. 2.7.2.3 New or secondary malignancies (including vector insertion site oligo/monoclonality ) Insertion of lentiviral vector sequences throughout the genome has the potential to dy sregulate local host cell gene expression with a theoretical risk of insertional oncogenesis resulting from disruption of normal function of genes that control cell growt h and potential risk of development of secondary malignancies. Vector -mediated insertional mutagenesis and subsequent malignant cell transformation after gene correction based on autologous HSC gene therapy has been observed in X -linked severe combined im munodeficiency (SCID- X1), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome (WAS), where first-generation gamma -retroviral vectors harboring long terminal repeats (LTRs) with strong enhancer/promoter sequences were used (Hacein -Bey- Abina et al 2003, Howe et al 2008, Botzug et al 2010 , Stein et al 2010, Persons and Baum 2011). In contrast, tisagenlecleucel uses third generation self -inactivating lentiviral vector. Insertional mutagenesis was addressed in two lentivirus insertion site analysis (LISA) studies where 12 batches of manufactured patient product ready for infusion and two batches of product manufactured from healthy donor cells were analy zed. The results indicate that there was no preferential integration near genes of concern, no preferential sites of integration (hot spots), and no preferential outgrowth of cells harboring integration sites of concern. Tisagenlecleucel is based on autologous, fully differentiated T cells and therefore the carcinogenicity risk is consid ered to be low in comparison to genetic modification or repair such as HSC. In a recent review of CAR -T cell therapies, Bonifant et al (2016) as well as Mohanlal et al (2016) discussed that to date no cases of malignant transformation have been reported for genetic modification of T cells and that there currently is no evidence for vector - induced immortalization, clonal expansion, or enrichment for integration sites near genes implicated in growth control or transformation. This is supported by the results of the lentivirus insertion site analy sis (LISA) studies performed during the development of tisagenlecleucel. Theoretically , CAR -positive viable T cells could proliferate without control of normal homeostatic mechanisms. In pre -clinical studies ( Milone et al 2009 ) and clinical experience to date ( Porter et al 2011 , Grupp et al 2013 , Maude et al 2014), CAR -positive viable T cells have only proliferated in response to physiologic signals or upon exposure to CD19 antigen. In the context of tisagenlecleucel therap y, it is expected that the T cells will proliferate in response to signals from the CD19 expressing malignant tumor and normal B cells. This could be either harmful depending on the extent of proliferation or beneficial, since clonal dominance of adoptively transferred T cells has been associated with tumor reduction in adoptive transfer trials ( Dudley 2002, Dudley 2005 ). The management of this potential risk is addressed in Section 6.2.6.10."
34,page_34,"Novartis Confidential Page 35 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 2.7.2.4 Exacerbation of an existing or new incidence of autoimmune disea se The risk of autoimmune reaction with tisagenlecleucel is low since CD19 is not present on most normal tissue other than normal B-cells. New incidence or exacerbation of an autoimmune disorder has not been observed with tisagenlecleucel thus far. However , instances of new or exacerbation of autoimmune disorder were reported in the literature, both for diseases without an obvious underl ying autoimmune cause such as stroke (Kamel and Iadecola 2012) and for ones with a clear autoimmune basis such as multiple sclerosis a nd optic neuritis ( Feldman et al 2015). Both cellular and cytokine driven exacerbations have been observed in patients receiving chemoth erapy; CNS autoimmune disorders (such as optic neuritis) have been reported to be exacerbated b y both mechanisms ( Skaper et al 2014 , Cramer et al 20 15). In addition, the use of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the IL- 6 receptor, can exacerbate demy elinating disease, and therefore it is to be used with precaution in cases of demy elinating disease (Actemra® USPI). Prior chemotherap y and radiat ion also contribute to the risk. No AEs associated with this potential were observed in tisagenlecleucel clinical trials. 2.7.2.5 New incidence of a hematologic disorder There is potential risk of a hematologic disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia or bone marrow failure, given that tisagenlecleucel is a geneticall y modified cell product that may have the potential to affect hematopoietic cell function, as could prior chemotherap y and radiation given for the underl ying malignancy . 2.7.2.6 New incidence or exacerbation of an existing neurological event Neurological events is an identified risk for tisagenlecleucel (see Section 2.7.1.2). Underl ying neurological disorders may become exacerbated by chemothera py, lymphodepletion or subsequent immunosuppression of tisagenlecleucel treatment. There is currentl y no evidence that tisagenlecleucel is associated with exacerbation of an existing neurological event. 2.7.2.7 Graft versus host disease (GVHD) The chance of graft versus host disease (GVHD) occurring in patients is low, but it is a potential risk with tisagenlecleucel therap y in patients with mixed chimerism of host and donor hematopoietic cells due to prior allogeneic HSCT. A study of activated donor lymphocy te infusions (ex vivo activated cells collected from the donor and grown in the same fashion as tisagenlecleucel but without the CAR introduction) did not show high rates of GVHD (2/18 patients with grade 3 GVHD and none with grade 4) (Porter et al 2006). Of 18 ALL patients treated with autologous tisagenlecleucel therap y who had relapsed after prior allogeneic HSCT with residual mixed chimerism, none have developed GVHD after autologous ti sagenlecleucel infusion ( Maude et al 2014 ). Long term data are currentl y limited. For the management of GVHD see Section 6.2.6.11 ."
35,page_35,"Novartis Confidential Page 36 Oncology Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 2.7.3 Other risks 2.7.3.1 Pregna ncy, lactation, and effects on fertility No preclinical reproductive studies have been conducted with tisagenlecleucel to assess whether it can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There is a potential risk that immunologically active maternal tisagenlecleucel positive T cells may cross the placenta. The survival of normal maternal cells in the fetus is usually limited owing to effective rejection by an immunocompetent target. However maternal cells can persist in immunocompetent offsprin g into adult life (maternal microchimerism (MMc)). MMc has been observed in healthy fetus and adults, and was observed in up to 42% of cord blood samples from healthy newborns (Muller et al 2001). The persistence of maternal cells in offspring’s tissues and circulation has been associated with autoimmune disorders. The histocompatibility antigens (HLA) disparit y between mother and fetus has been hypothesized as responsible for the pathogenesis of some auto- immune diseases. Maternal CD19 CAR T cells may be expected to cross the placental barrier and potentiall y exhibit MMc similar to that of normal T cells. The impact on the offspring’s B cells is unknown. The testicular environment is usually immunosuppressive to T cells, leading to control and low numbers of T lymphocytes including CD19 CART cells (Hedger and Meinhardt 2000). If transferred to female reproductive tract along with sperm, T cells are likel y to be recognized as non-self by the female immun e system and therefore be destro yed. A fundamental risk may arise from the presence of RCL the female organism may be exposed to after sexual intercourse. However, the principal design of the vector and the analytic measures taken during manufacturing of tisagenlecleucel will exclude the presence of RCL with highest probability, and the female risk for exposure to tisagenlecleucel and/or RCL is considered extremel y low. As it is also not known whether tisagenlecleucel can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacit y, tisagenlecleucel should not be administered to pregnant women and care should be taken to avoid conceptions. Therefore, women of child bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women phy siologicall y capable of becoming pregnant, and sexually active males are excluded from clinical trials with tisagenlecleucel unless they use adequate contraception. No data are currentl y available to determine the duration of contraception after receiving tisagenlecle ucel. Women of child bearing potential and sexually active males must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study , and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirements outlined in the exclusion criteria. If there is any question that the patient will not reliably comply , they should not be entered or continue in the study. There is no information regarding the presence of tisagenlecleucel in human milk, the effect on the breast -fed child or the effects of tisagenlecleucel on milk production. Nursing women are excluded from participation in this study . 3 Objectives and endpoints Objectives and related endpoints are described in Table 3-1 below."

A condom is required for allsexually active male participants to prevent them from fathering a child AND to prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to their partner. In addition, male participants must not donate sperm for the time period specified above. 18.Intolerance to the excipients of the tisagenlecleucel cell product. 6 Treatment 6.1 Stud y treatment Tisagenlecleucel is an autologous cellular immunotherapy product that is comprised of CD3+ T cells that have undergone ex vivo T cell activation, gene modification, expansion and formulation in infusible cryomedia. The transgene to be expressed via lentiviral vector trans duction is a CAR targeted against the CD19 antigen. The CAR contains a murine scFv that targets CD19 linked to a transmembrane region derived from the CD8 receptor, which is linked to an intracellular bipartite signaling chain of TCR -ζ (or CD3- ζ) and 4-1BB intracellular signaling domains. The extracellular scFv with specificit y for CD19 is derived from a mouse monoclonal antibody . T cells which are enriched from a patient leukapheresis unit are expanded ex vivo using commercially available magnetic beads that are coated with anti-CD3 and anti- CD28 monoclonal antibodies. The cells are transduced with the CD19 CAR lentiviral vector which ensures that only peripheral white blood cells enriched for lymphocy tes are exposed to the vector. The residual non-integrat ed vector is washed away during the process. Tisagenlecleucel cells will be expanded ex vivo for up to 10 days. At the end of the culture, the tisagenlecleucel cells are depleted of magnetic beads, washed, concentrated, and cryopreserved . Results from a release testing procedure are required prior to release of the product for infusion. 6.1.1 Dosing regimen The recommended dose will consist of a single intravenous (i.v.) infusion of 0.6 – 6.0 x 108 CAR -positive viable T cells. 6.1.2 Bridging therapy As it is not expected that the patients will progress rapidl y during the screening and pre— treatment period, the patients are unlikel y toneed bridging therapy . If, however, a bridging therap y is administered , the investigator should follow the recommendations described in Section 6.4.1 Prohibited concomitant therap y. PET-CT should be performed after bridging and prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion unless the bridging therap y consists of steroids only. Patients with no measurable disease at baseline after bridging therap y will still receive tisagenlecleucel infusion ."
45,page_45,"Novartis Confidential Page 46 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 6.1.3 Lymphodepleting chemotherapy It is anticipated that many patients will have been receiving chemotherapy for relapsed or resistant disease. Prior to tisag enlecleucel infusion, each patient should receive lymphodepleting chemotherap y. This may be omitted in case of significant cytopenia (e.g. WBC <1,000 cells/µL , absolute lymphocy te count <200/µL ) or any condition that, in the investigator’s opinion, preclud es lymphodepleting chemotherapy . When given, ly mphodepleting chemotherap y should be started 1 week before tisagenlecleucel infusion so that the tisagenlecleucel cells will be given 2 to 6 days after completion of the lymphodepleting chemotherap y.The chemotherapy start date will vary based on the selected chemotherapy . The purpose of this chemotherap y is to induce lymphopenia in order to facilitate engraftment and homeostatic expansion of tisagenlecleucel cells. For lymphodepleting chemotherap y, cyclophosphamide -based regimens are preferred agents as there is the most experience with the use of these agents in facilitating adoptive immunotherapy . The first option as lymphodepleting regimen is: Fludarabine (25 mg/m2intravenousl y [i.v.] daily for 3 doses) and cy clophosphamide (250 mg/m2i.v. daily for 3 doses starting with the first dose of fludarabine) Note: Side effects of fludarabine can include severe nervous system events of seizure, agitation, blindness, coma and death. Instances of life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune phenomena such as hemoly tic anemia, autoimmune thrombocy topenia/thromb ocytopenic purpura (ITP), Evans syndrome, and acquired hemophilia have been reported to occur after one or more c ycles of treatment with fludarabine phosphate injection. It may also severel y decrease bone marrow function (Fludarabine full prescribing information ). Cyclophosphamide toxicities include cardiac d ysfunction. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi- drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of Cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first Cyclophosphamide dose. Severe marro w suppression is seen and occasional anaphy lactic reactions have been reported. Hemorrhagic cystitis, pulmonary toxicity (pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease leading to respiratory failure) and veno -occlusive liver disease may occur ( Cyclophosphamide full prescribing information ). If there was previous grade IV hemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide, or the patient demonstrated resistance to a previous cyclophosphami de-containing regimen, then the following regimen should be used: Bendamustine 90 mg/m2i.v. daily for 2 day s Note: Side effects of bendamustine include severely decreased bone marrow function, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea; jaundice may occur, including without other signs of hepatic dysfunction. Fatal and serious cases of liver injury have been reported (Bendamustine full prescribing information ). No other regimen is allowed for l ymphodepletion. Femal e patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the start of lymphodepleting therapy . If the patient does not require"

The tisagenlecleucel cell product will be prepared and released b y the manufacturing facility to the study site approximately 4-6 weeks after manufacturing has commenced, provided all required safety and quality release criteria have been met. For details on the cryopreserved components, and the specific storage and handling requirements of the tisagenlecleucel cell product, see the [Investigational Product Handling Manual] . 6.1.4.1 Pre-Infusion Evaluation If any of the following criteria is met tisagenlecleucel infusion must be delay ed until resolution to grade 1. If the period of delay is more than 4 weeks from completing lymphodepletion and there is no significant cytopenia (see Section 6.1.3) lymphodepletion should be repeated, and these criteria will need to be re - checked prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 1.Rapidly progressing primary disease 2.Clinical evidence of CNS involvement by primary disease 3.Laboratory abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigator, may impact patient safet y or the patient ’sability to receive tisagenlecleucel. 4. Following clinical abnormalities: Pulmonary : Requirement for supplemental oxy gen to keep saturation greater than 90% or presence of progressive radiographic abnormalities on chest x -ray Card iac arrh ythmia not controlled with medical management Hypotension requiring vasopressor support Active infection, as evidenced b y positive blood cultures for bacteria, fungi, or PCR positivity for viral DNA in blood within 72 hours of tisagenlecleucel cell infusion, or clinical or radiographic evidence 5. A significant change in clinical status that would, in the opinion of the investigator, increase the risk of adverse events associated with tisagenlecleucel 6.Concomitant medications as described in Section 6.4.1 7.Positive influenza test within 10 days prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion (please refer to Table 7-1). If the patient is positive for influenza, oseltamivir phosphate or zanamivir should administered for 10 days as preventative treatment (see Tamiflu® or Relenza® package insert for dosing). The patient must complete their 10 day preventative treatment course prior to receiving tisagenlecleucel. The test does not need to be repeated prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion however if flu -like or respiratory signs and symptoms are present, tisagenlecleucel infusion should be delay ed until the patient is asymptomatic. For patients residing in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan, influenza testing is required durin g the months of October through May (inclusive). For patients residing in the southern hemisphere such as Australia, influenza testing is required during themonths of April"
47,page_47,"Novartis Confidential Page 48 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 through November (inclusive). For patients with significant international travel, both calendar intervals above may need to be considered. 8.Live vaccines must not be used in tisagenlecleucel recipients for at least 2 weeks prior to the star t of ly mphodepleting chemotherapy , during tisagenlecleucel treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with tisagenlecleucel. 6.1.4.2 Additional safety procedures prior to administration Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome The risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is dependent on disease burden. Patients will be closel y monitored both before and after lymphodepleting chemotherap y and tisagenlecleucel infusion including blood tests for potassium and uric acid. Patients with elevated uric acid or high tumor burden will receive prophy lactic allopurinol, or a non-allopurinol alternative (e.g. febuxostat). Infection proph ylaxis should follow local guidelines dictated only by the preceding lymphodepleting chemotherapy . Infection prophy laxis per sefor tisagenlecleucel is not recommended. Infections Infection proph ylaxis with regard to lymphodepletion and other additional treatments should follow local guideline. Infection proph ylaxis is not recommended in the setting of tisagenlecleucel infusion. Cytokine Release Syndrome Prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion two doses of tocilizumab per patient (for the first 3 weeks after tisagenlecleucel infusion) must be confirmed as available and must be available for infusion within 2 hours for the management of CRS related adverse events (s ee Section 6.2.6.1 for details). Premedication Side effects from T cell infusion can include fever, chills and/or nausea. All patients should be pre-medicated with acetaminophen (paracetamol) and diphenhy dramine or another H1 antihistamine. These medications can be repeated every 6 hours as needed. Non -steroidal anti - inflammatory medication may be prescribed if the patient continues to have fever not relieved with acetaminophen (paracetamol). Steroids should NOT be used for premedication. It is recommended that patients NOT receive systemic corticostero ids other than physiologic replacement, except for serious emergency , since this may have an adverse effect on tisagenlecleucel cell expansion and function. Supportive care Local guidelines will be followed for the supportive care of immunosuppressed and chemotherap y treated patients. All blood products administered should be irradiated. For details about prohibited concomitant medications and non -drug therapies please refer to Section 6.4.1."

For detailed instructions on the storage, handling, preparation and administration of the tisagenlecleucel cell product, refer to the [I nvestigational Product Handling Manual] . Vital signs (temperature, respiration rate, pulse, pulse oximetry , and blood pressure) will be taken prior to, during and immediately after the infusion and then approximately every 15 minutes for one hour and then every hour for the next two hours, or until these signs are satisfactory and stable. A study investigator MUST evaluate the patient just prior to infusion to ensure the patients meets tisagenlecleucel infusion criteria. Trained study staff wi ll administer the tisagenlecleucel infusion using precautions for immunosuppressed patients. Protective isolation should follow institutional standards and policies. Emergency medical equipment should be available during the infusion in case the patient ha s a significant reaction to the infusion such as anaphy laxis or severe hypotension. After cell thawing, tisagenlecleucel cell product should NOT be washed prior to infusion, and all contents will be infused. A single dose of 0.6 to 6 x 108CAR -positive viable T cells will be administered via intravenous infusion, preferabl y through a central line. Following tisagenlecleucel infusion, should emergency treatment be required in the event of life-threatening hypersensitivity or other acute infusion- related reaction, supportive therap y such as oxygen, bronchodilators, epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids should be given according to local institutional guidelines.

49,page_49,"Novartis Confidential Page 50 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 6.2.5 Toxicity management, stopping rules and study termination It is expected that AEs will occur frequentl y in this population based on the underl ying advanced malignancy and that these can be SAEs. Therefore, there is no specific occurrence of SAEs that define a stopping rule, but the review of SAEs will form the basis for potential earl y stopping of the study. The rev iew of these adverse events, and an y decision to prematurel y stop patient enrollment, will be determined by theSteering Committee (SC) and reviewed by the IRB. Premature termination of the clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authorit y decision, change in opinion of the IRB, the SC,or determination that there are problems in the cell product generation or safet y at the discretion of the study investigators. Additionally , recruitment may be stopped at the sponsor’s discretion and may include reasons such as low recruitment, protocol violations, or inadequate data recording. 6.2.6 General toxicity management considerations Patients infused with tisagenlecleucel are at risk of developing a number of AE that are related either to tisagenlecleucel itself, other therapies (e.g. immunochemotherap y) and conditions concurrent with the patient’s primary disease. Following tisagenlecleucel infusion, patients can be discharged from the treating site only if, in the investigator’s opinion, they do not demonstrate any adverse events or worsening of under lying diseases. This chapter describes the management of such AEs. Drug and non- drug therapies used to treat AEs must be recorded on appropriate CRFs. 6.2.6.1 Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) Ensure that tocilizumab is available on site prior to infusion of tisagenlecleucel. Supportive care, tocilizumab, and corticosteroids have been used for effective management of CRS. Prompt responses to tocilizumab have been seen in most patients. Identify cytokine release sy ndrome (CRS) based on clinical presentation (see Section 2.7.1.1 ). Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. Although signs and symptoms of CRS occur in most cases within 1-14 days after tisagenlecleucel infusion, monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after treatment with tisagenlecleucel. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or sy mptoms of CRS occur at an y time. At the first sign of CRS, immediately evaluate patient for hospitalization and institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as indicated. A detailed treatment algorithm for the management of CRS ( Lee at al 2014 ) is presented below in Table 6 - 1and Table 6 -2.Patients will be required to remain proximal to the treating site for the first 4 weeks."

If the patient experiences ongoing CRS despite administration of anti-cytokine directed therapies, anti-T cell therapies such as cyclophosphamide, anti- thymocy te globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab may be considered. These therapies need to be captured in appropriate CRFs. The management of CRS is based solel y upon clinical parameters as described in Section 2.7.1.1. Ferritin, CRP and serum cy tokine levels should NOT be used for clinical management decisions. Cases of trans ient left ventricular dysfunction, as assessed by ECHO, have been reported in some patients with severe (Grade 4) CRS. Therefore consideration should be given to monitoring cardiac function by ECHO during severe CRS, especially in cases with prolonged severe hemodynamic instability, delayed response to high dose vasopressors, and/or severe fluid overload. 6.2.6.2 Neurological adverse events during CRS Patients should be monitored for neurological events following tisagenlecleucel infusion, in particular during and after resolution of CRS. Prompt and effective management of CRS may prevent some neurological complications associated with tisagenlecleucel therapy . Supportive treatment should be given for tisagenlecleucel associated n eurological events as per standard of care and diagnostic work -up considered to exclude other causes for these sy mptoms. 6.2.6.3 Hypersensitivity including acute infusion reactions Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity following initiation of tisagenlecleucel infusion and treated appropriately . Tisagenlecleucel is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tisagenlecleucel or to any component of the product formulation. As appropriate, prophy lactic medications should be administered to minimize the risk of immediate hypersensitivity including acute infusion reactions . It is recommended to pre- medicate all patients with acetaminophen (paracetamol) and diphenhy dramine or another H1 antihistamine within approximately 30-60 minutes prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. These medications can be repeated every 6 h ours as needed. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed for fever not responding to acetaminophen. Steroids should not be used for premedicatio n. Sy stemic corticosteroids should only be used for severe conditions."

Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. 6.2.6.4 Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome (TLS) Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of TLS both before and after lymphodepleting chemotherap y and tisagenlecleucel infusion including relevant laboratory tests. To minimize risk of TLS, patients with elevated uric acid or high tumor burden should receive allopurinol, or an alternative proph ylaxis, prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. Events should be managed according to local guidelines. Depending on the stud y phase, the following measures should be followed: Screening phase: Prophy lactic allopurinol, or a non- allopurinol alternative (e.g. febuxostat), and increased oral/ i.v. h ydration prior to lymphodepleting chemotherap y and tisagenlecleucel infusion should be given in patients with elevated uric acid or high tumor burden Prompt supportive care in case of acute TL S (i.v. fluids and rasburicase as clinically indicated, when uric acid continues to rise despite allopurinol/febuxostat and fluids) Post-infusion monitoring phase: Frequent monitoring of the following laboratory tests (2 to 3 times/week for 3 weeks from start of l ymphodepleting chemotherapy , then weekl y): potassium, phosphorus, calcium, creatinine, and uric acid Encourage oral h ydration Based on laboratory and clinical TLS criteria (modified from Cairo and Bishop (2004) ), the following mea sures for TLS should be also followed: Laboratory TLS Laboratory TLS is defined as two or more of the following values within three days before or in the day s following tisagenlecleucel infusion: Uric acid ≥ 8 mg/dL or 25% increase from baseline Potassium ≥ 6 mEq/L or 25% increase from baseline Phosphorus ≥ 6.5 mg/dL (children) or ≥ 4.5 mg/dL (adults) or 25% increase from baseline Calcium ≤ 7 mg/dL or 25% decrease from baseline Regimen: If none or one of the laboratory values above is abnormal, continue to manage with allopurinol or a non-allopurinol alternative (e.g. febuxostat) and oral fluids. If uric acid remains elevated, consider i.v. fluids, rasburicase, and hospital monitoring. Laboratory TLS should be managed with i.v. fluids, laboratory blood tests every 6 to 8 hours and inpatient care.

Patients should be monitored for signs and s ymptoms of infection and t reated appropriatel y. As appropriate, proph ylactic antibiotics should be administered and surveillance testing prior to and during treatment with tisagenlecleucel should be employ ed. Institutional guidelines for vaccination (e.g. pneumococcus) should be fo llowed before starting tisagenlecleucel therap y. As the lack of effective B cells after infusion makes the likelihood of a systemic infection considerable, vaccination with live virus vaccines should not be given for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherap y, during tisagenlecleucel and until immune recovery following treatment with tisagenlecleucel. Any suspected cases of viral hepatitis or HIV should be referred to a specialist. In patients with low immunoglobulin levels preventi ve measures such as immunoglobulin replacement and rapid attention to signs and sy mptoms of infection should be implemented as per age and local specific guidelines. 6.2.6.6 Febrile neutropenia Febrile neutropenia (significantly decreased neutrophil count with fever) may develop in the course of chemotherap y (including lymphodepletion) and may be concurrent with CRS. A febrile patient should be evaluated for infection (Section 2.7.1.5) and CRS (Section 2.7.1.1) and managed appropriatel y with fluids, antibiotics, and supportive care, if applicable. In the event that the patient develops sepsis or systemic bacteremia following tisagenlecleucel cell infusion, appropriate cultures and medical management should be initiated. If a contaminated tisagenlecleucel cell product is suspected, the product can be retested for sterility using archived samples that are stored at the manufacturing site. 6.2.6.7 B cell depletion and/ or hypogammaglobulinemia Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with tisagenlecleucel , use infection precautions including antibiotic prophy laxis and immunoglobulin replacement as appropriate and per local standard of care. In case of new or worsening symptoms suggestive of PML, consultation with a neurologist should be considered"

The following two categories of abnormalities / adverse events have to be considered during the course of the study (irrespective of whether classified/reported as non- serious AE/SAE): Liver laboratory triggers, which will require repeated assessments of the abnormal laboratory parameter Liver events, which will require close observation, follow- up monitoring and contributing factors are recorded on the appropriate CRFs Please refer to Table 14.4.1 in Appendi x 4for complete definitions of liver laboratory triggers and liver events. Every liver event defined in Table 14.4.1 should be followed up by the investigator or designated personnel at the trial site, as summarized below. Additional details on actions required in case of liver events are outlined in Table 14.4.1. Repeat liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, TBL, PT/INR, ALP and G- GT) to confirm elevation. These liver chemistry repeats should be performed using the local laboratory used by the site. Repeated laboratory test results must be reported as appropriate. If the initial elevation is confirmed, close observation of the patient will be initiated, including consideration of treatment interruption if deem ed appropriate. Discontinuation of the investigational drug (refer to Section 7.1.5 ), if appropriate Hospitalization of the patient if appropriate Causality assessment of the liver event Thorough follow -up of the liver event, which can include based on investigator’s discretion: Serology tests, imaging (e.g., such as abdominal US, CT or MRI , as appropriate) and pathology assessments, gastroenterologist’s or hepatologist’s consultancy ; obtaining more det ailed history of sy mptoms and prior or concurrent diseases, history of"

All follow -up information, and the procedures performed must be recorded as appropriate in the CRF. 6.3.2.2 Follow up on potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) cases Patients with transaminase increase combined with TBIL increase may be indicative of potential DILI, and should be considered as clinically important events. The threshold for potential DILI may depend on the patient’s baseline AST/AL T and TBIL value; patients meeting any of the following criteria will require further follow -up as outlined below: For patients with normal AL T and AST and TBIL value at baseline: AST or ALT > 3.0 x ULN combined with TBIL > 2.0 x ULN For patients with elevated AST or ALT or TBIL value at baseline: [AST or ALT > 2 x baseline AND > 3.0 x ULN] OR [AST or ALT > 8.0 x ULN], combined with [TBIL > 2 x baseline AND > 2.0 x UL N] Medical review needs to ensure that liver test elevations are not caused by cholestasis, defined as ALP elevation > 2.0 x ULN with R value < 2 in patients without bone metastasis, or elevation of AL P liver fraction in patients with bone metastasis. Note: (The R value is calculated by dividing the ALT by the ALP, using multiples of the ULN for both values. It denotes wheth er the relative pattern of ALT and/or ALP elevation is due to cholestatic (R ≤ 2), hepatocellular (R ≥ 5), or mixed (R >2 and < 5) liver injury ). In the absence of cholestasis, these patients should be immediately discontinued from study treatment, and repeat LFT testing as soon as possible, preferabl y within 48 hours from the awareness of the abnormal results. The evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , physical assessment and the possibility of liver metastasis or new liver lesions, obstructions/compressions, etc. 1.Laboratory tests should include ALT, AST, albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT, prothrombin time (PT)/INR and alkaline phosphatase. 2.A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, concomitant medications, herbal remedies, supplement consumption, history of any pre-existing liver conditions or risk factors, should be collected. 3. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C or E infection and liver imaging (e .g. biliary tract) may be warranted. 4.Obtain PK sample, as close as possible to last dose of, if PK anal ysis is performed in the study . 5.Additional testing for other hepatotropic viral infection (CMV, EBV or HSV), autoimmune hepatitis or liver biopsy may be considered as clinically indicated or after consultation with specialist/hepatologist.

Every renal laboratory trigger or re nal event as defined in Appendix 5 , Section 14.5 should be followed up by the investigator or designated personnel at the trial site as summarized in Appendix 5 . 6.4 Concomitant therapy Clinically significant prescription and nonprescription medication, excluding vitamins, and herbal and nutritional supplements, and procedure -related (inpatient or outpati ent) medications taken by the patient during the 30 days prior to screening will be recorded. At every visit following the screening visit up to the end of the study , concomitant medications will be recorded in the medical record and on the appropriate CRF . During selected trial phases, concomitant medication collection will be modified as outlined in Appendix 3: Tisagenlecleucel Modified Data Reporting -Treatment and Follow -Up Phase, CRF Completion Guidelines (CCGs). Modified collection of concomitant medi cation information during these periods is designed to capture tisagenlecleucel -related toxicity , severity , interventions and response/resolution following intervention. Any additions, deletions, or changes of these medications will be documented. The fol lowing guidelines must be adhered to during the stud y: Granulocy te macrophage -colony stimulating factor (GM -CSF) should be avoided due to the potential to worsen CRS sy mptoms. Short acting granulocy te colon y stimulating factor (G-CSF) should not be given w ithin 72 hours of tisagenlecleucel infusion and long acting G-CSF should not be given within 10 day s of tisagenlecleucel infusion. The effects of granulocy te colon y stimulating factor (G -CSF) on the other hand, are unknown. Steroids or other immunosuppress ant drugs should NOT be used as pre- medication for tisagenlecleucel therap y (refer to Section 6.1.4.1) or following tisagenlecleucel infusion, except as required for physiological glucocorticoid replacem ent therap y, or under life threatening circumstances. Use of steroids with blood product administration should be eliminated just prior to and following tisagenlecleucel if possible or at least minimized. Patients with moderate to severe signs and s ymptoms attributable to CRS should be managed with supportive care and administration of tocilizumab as defined in Table 6 -2 and Section 6.2.6.1."

The Subject No. consists of the Center Number (Center No.) (as assigned by Novartis to the investigative site) with a sequential patient number suffixed to it, so that each patient is numbered uniquel y across the entire database. Upon signing the informed consent form ,the patient is assigned to the next sequential Subject No. available to the investigator through the Clinical Data Management Sy stem interface. The investigator or designated staff will contact the IRTsystem and provide the requested identify ing informat ion for the patient to register them into the IRT system. Once assigned, the Subject No. must not be reused for an y other subject. If the patient fails to be enrolled or to start treatment for any reason, the reason will be entered into the appropriate CRF page. The IRT system must be notified within 2 day s that the patient was not treated . 6.5.2 Treatment assignment or randomization This is a single -arm open -label study . Patients will be enrolled and assigned to treatment upon confirmation of all clinical eligibility criteria by the investigator, and acceptance of the leukapheresis product for manufacturing. 6.5.3 Treatment blinding This is a single -arm open -label study . 6.6 Tisagenlecleucel preparation and dispensation For details on the cryopreserved components, and the specific storage and handling requirements of the tisagenlecleucel product, see the [Investigational Leukapheresis, Cryopreservation & Scheduling Manual and Investigational Product Handling Manual] . 6.6.1 Tisagenlecleucel packaging and labeling The tisagenlecleucel product will be shipped from Novartis in a dry vapor shipper where temperature is maintained and continuously monitored. Confirmation of temperature excursions during transport and unloading of the tisagenlecleucel product and accompan ying documentation will be done. The tisagenlecleucel product will be carefull y examined to ensure that it is intact and free from damage. The tisagenlecleucel product will be transferred to on- site storage. Medicat ion labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the patient except for the medication number . Each infusion bag will typically contain 10 mL-50 mL of cells.

84,page_84,"Novartis Confidential Page 85 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 7.1.1 Screening Phase Patients must sign the IRB/EC approved ICF before any study specific screening procedures. Screening assessments to determine eligibility should be performed as per the visit evaluation schedule detailed in Table 7 -1. Patients who have signed an informed consent will be registered in the IRT system and undergo a routine lymphoma staging workup including all screening assessment outlined in Table 7-1. For detailed screening procedures, related to the use of Interactive Response Technology (IRT), please refer to the [IRT User Manual ]. The assessments below do not need to be repeated if performed as part of clinical routine within the period sdefined below : Serum immunoglobulin levels as per Table 7- 5within 6 weeks of the ICF signature Viral serology as per Table 7 - 5 within 6 weeks of the I CF signature Bone marrow biops y within 6 months of the I CF signature provided that there are no symptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggesting bone marrow involvement by lymphoma LVEF assessment by ECHO/MRI or MUGA within 6 months of the I CF signature provided that there are no clinical sy mptoms of impaired cardiac function 7.1.1.1 Leukapheresis Leukapheresis will be scheduled for cell procurement prior to final enrollment. It is strongl y recommended to schedule leukapheresis prior to any planned chemotherapy or non-physiolo gic dose of steroids as an absolute T -cell count (absolute lymphocy te count multiplied by the percentage of CD3 positive lymphocytes) ≤ 300/mm3may result in a poor T -cell collection and manufacturing failure. Cryopreserved non mobilized leukapheresis products collected prior to study entry (historical) may be usable for manufacturing if collected at a certified leukapheresis center and if the product is accepted for manufacturing. Please refer to the Leukapher esis Key Requirements within the most recent [Leukapheresis, Cryopreservation & Scheduling Manual] for more detailed instructions on optimal timing of leukapheresis collection and the recommended procurement, handling and shipment procedures of the leukaph eresis samples to the designated manufacturing facility Flow cytometry should be performed before leukapheresis in peripheral blood and post leukapheresis on leukapheresis product ( i.e.ALC, absolute CD45+/CD3+, CD45+/CD3+/CD28- /CD27-, CD4+/CD25+, CD45+/CD14+). Viably frozen samples from the leukapheresis material as well as the tisagenlecleucel product will be collected at the manufacturing site for correlative studies. The date of Leukapheresis will be registered in the I RT s ystem. For patients who under go leukapheresis collection on study after signing ICF, the following criteria must be met prior to leukapheresis collection:"
85,page_85,"Novartis Confidential Page 86 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 Peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥ 500/µL (0.5x109/L), or if ALC < 500/µ L (<0.5x109/L), then the absolute CD3 ly mphocy te count must be ≥ 150/µL Please also refer to the [Leukapheresis, Cryopreservation & Scheduling Manual ]for further details on the requirements prior to leukapheresis collection. 7.1.1.2 Re-screening A patient who has a laboratory test result(s) that does not satisfy the entrance criteria may have the test(s) repeated. These test(s) may be repeated as soon as the investigator believes the re- test result(s) is/are likely to be within the acceptable range to satisfy the entrance criteria, but should be completed within approximately 3 weeks of the original screening visit date. In this case, the patient will not be required to sign another ICF, and the original patient ID number assigned by the investigat orwill be used. In the event that the laboratory test(s) cannot be performed within 3 weeks of the original screening visit, or the re-test(s) do not meet the entrance criteria, or other eligibility criteria have changed and are not met anymore, the patie nt is considered a screen failure, and must be discontinued from the study . A new ICF will need to be signed if the investigator chooses to re-screen the patient after a patient has screen failed, and the patient will be assigned a new patient ID. All required screening activities must be performed when the patient is re-screened for participation in the study . An individual patient may only be re-screened once for the study . Once the number of patients screened and enrolled is likely to ensure target enrol lment, the Sponsor may close the study to further screening. In this case, the patients who screen failed will not be permitted to re-screen. 7.1.1.3 Enrollment Following informed consent, information on the patient’s leukapheresis product including sample sentin el vials collected from leukapheresis (when available) will be sent to Novartis manufacturing separatel y or together with leukapheresis product. Final enrollment is defined as the point at which a patient meets all clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria andthe patient’s leukapheresis product is received and accepted for manufacturing. The patient is then enrolled using the same Subject Number assigned at screening by the site investigator or designated staff. Once assigned, the Subject Number must not be reused for any other patient and the Subject Number for that individual must not be changed. If a screened patient is not enrolled for any reason, the specific reason will be entered into the clinical database. Enrollment will be entered in the IRT system. For detailed enrollment procedures, related to the use of Interactive Response Technology (IRT), please refer to the [IRT User Manual ].A Disposition CRF should be completed indicating the date of enrollment and the specific reason if a patient is not enrol led as applicable. 7.1.1.4 Information to be collected on patients not enrolled (screen failure) The reason for not being enrolled will be entered in the clinical database.

An additional blood sample will be collected post-infusion for tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics assessment as per Table 7 -1. Details on the administration of the tisagenlecleucel infusion are found in Section 6.1.4.3 . The tisagenlecleucel infusion visit must be registered in the IRTsystem . 7.1.3.2 Post -tisagenlecleucel infusion visits : D2 to M2±14d Following CT019 infusion, patients will undergo assessments as per Table 7 -1. Weekly (or more frequent, see Table 7-1) sample collections for serum cytokines, tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics, and inflammatory markers (e.g. ferritin and CRP) are mandated during the first 28 days following tisagenlecleucel infusion. However, as the time - course and rapidit y of CRS development varies among patients, additional unscheduled samples for these markers may also be collected as needed, if it is clinically feasible. Frequent monitoring of serum CRP, ferritin and cytokines should be considered during the clinical course of CRS of an y severit y (e.g. ever y day to several days) especiall y around the following clinical events: initial persistence of fevers, hemod ynamic instability , initial and worsening of respiratory distress, rapid clinical deterior ation, just prior to and daily for 2 days following tocilizumab administration, around other clinically significant events and upon the clinical resolution of CRS. Please note that results of cytokine analy ses are NOT to be used for clinical management decisions of CRS. A detailed treatment algorithm has been established with clear criteria for CRS management (see Table 6 -1and Table 6 -2). 7.1.3.3 Post -tisagenlecleucel infusion visits: M 3±14d toM24±14d, Q6M... ±14d At the intervals listed in the Table 7-1, patients will undergo assessments including disease response evaluation with efficacy assessment sent to I RC for review. Ifat any of these visitsthe patient has a radiological CR based upon imaging assessments, a bone marrow biops y or aspirate needs to be performed in patients that had prior bone marrow involvement to confirm the CR. If at any of these visits the patient is confirmed to have relapse or disease progression, no further imaging assessments (see Section 7.2.1 andSection 7.2.4). Patients will continue to be followed for safet y according to the assessments described inTable 7-1. Cellular kinetic sampling will only continue to assess B -and T-cell levels, transgene persistence, and immunogenicit y. For details please refer to Section 7.2.3 .Assessments of patient -reported outcomes (SF -36 version 2; EQ -5D- 3L; FACT - Lym) will be continued for the next two visits as per Table 7 -1 (see Section 7.2.6 ).

Identified vector integration sites will be evaluated using bioinformatic approaches to determine the frequency of integration events in regions with known relationships to human cancers (i.e. near oncogenes). If integration site analysis reveals mono -or oligo -clonality pattern and/or integration at or near an oncogenic locus, a monitoring plan, including follow - up molecular analyses, will be developed in collaboration between the Investigator, Sponsor and Health Authorities that is specific for the health care risks that are anticipated given the nature of the integration site and vector target cell ty pe. 7.1.3.4 End of study visit The End of Study (EOS) visit for each patient will be at the time when all patients have completed their Month 24 evaluation or discontinued prematurel y. Patients who have completed their Month 24 visit before the end of the study will be followed for assessments at onsit e visits every 6 months (Q6M) until the end of the study . See Section 4.3for more information. During the EOS visit patients will undergo the assessments specified in Table 7 -1, and a Disposition CRF should be completed. Following the EOS vi sit, patients will be enrolled in the L TFU study [CCTL019A2205B] . 7.1.4 Survival follow -up For all patients who receive a tisagenlecleucel infusion, follow -up for survi val every 3 months until end of study is required . If a patient misses a quarterl y scheduled visit where survival status is required, or if the quarterl y time-point where survival status is required does not align with a scheduled visit, survival status ca n be obtained via phone contact. After the end of this study , patients will continue to be followed for survival under the LTFU protocol [CCTL 019A2205B]. 7.1.5 Discontinuation of study treatment Tisagenlecleucel infusion may be discontinued if, in the investigat or’s opinion, its continuation would be detrimental to the patient's safet y. Patients who discontinue from tisagenlecleucel treatment should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study and should continue to be followed as per assessment schedule provided in Table 7-1. A Disposition CRF should be completed. If for any reason a patient is discontinued from study treatment while or after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherap y and before the scheduled infusion of tisagenlecleucel, a visit should be scheduled as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the End of Study visit will be performed.

Withdrawal of consent occur s onl y when a patient: Does not want to participate in the study anymore, and Does not allow further collection of personal data In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) to understand the primary reason for the patient’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missi ng. Further attempts to contact the patient are not allowed unless safety findings require communicating or follow -up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the patient ’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the assessment table. Novartis will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data resulting from the analy sis of a patient ’s samples until their time of withdrawal) according to applicabl e law. For US and Japan: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further testing/analy sis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent form. For EU and RoW: All biological sample s not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will no longer be used, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored according to applicable legal requirements. 7.1.8 Follow up for s afety evaluations –Long -term follow -up study As a single administration study , patients are followed on study for at least 2 years post-infusion for safety and efficacy evaluations. A long term post-study follow -up for lentiviral vector safety will continue under a separate destination protocol [CCTL 019A2205B] .

All patients who either complete or prematurel y discontinue from the study will be enrolled in this destination protocol at the time ofstudy completion/discontinuation . A separate informed consent/assent forms will be provided for this protocol . One to two times a year patients will visit the clinical site for a physical exam and medical history (including concomitant medications and adverse events) with careful attention to features possibly related to lentiviral associated events such as new malignancies, new incidence or exacerbation of a pre-existing neurologic disorder, new incidence or exacerbation of a prior rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder, or new incidence of other hematologic disorders. In addition, labs will be drawn to evaluate routine safet y endpoints, tisagenlecleucel vector persistence and RCL. 7.1.9 Lost to fo llow- up For patie nts whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stati ng an intention to withdraw consent, the investigator should show ""due diligence"" by contacting the patient, family or family physician as agreed in the infor med consent and by docum enting in the source docu ments steps taken to contact the patient, e.g. dates of telephone calls, regis tered letters, etc. A patie nt sho uld not be considered lost to follow -up until due diligence has been completed. Patients lost to follow up should be recorded as such on the Study Disposition CRF. 7.2 Assessment ty pes 7.2.1 Efficacy assessments Efficacy assessments will be performed as indicated in Table 7-2until disease progression or relapse, start of another anticancer therapy , death, lost to follow - up or withdrawal of consent . Efficacy will be evaluated by anIndependent Review Committee (IRC) using the Lugano classification 2014 ( Cheson et al 2014; Barrington et al 2014 ) as detailed in Appendix 14.1. The latest efficacy assessments after bridging therap y and prior to inf usion will be used as basel ine. Radiological imaging will be transmitted by the sites to the imaging Contract Research Organization (CRO) designated by Novartis to undergo qualit y checks and central review by the IRC. Clinical data such as, physical exam, bone marrow results, patho logy/histology and cytology results; as well as, information regarding prior interventions, pre-existing radiographic findings that may mimic lymphoma at screening /Pre-lymphodepletion evaluation (pre-infusion) and on-study interventions will be transmitted to the imaging CRO for review by a medical oncologist/hematologist. At IRC, during the overall review the available clinical data will be integrated with the pathological and radiological response data to provide the overall disease response: The presenc e of one(1) or more stable, but persistent clinical lesions will downgrade a radiology CR to an overall PR. The presence of one (1) or more new or worsening clinical lesions will result in Overall PD."
91,page_91,"Novartis Confidential Page 92 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 If bone marrow biops y is not negative, a radiographic TPR of CR at that time point would be downgraded to an overall PR. A new lesion biopsy result indicating a malignancy would result in overall PD, if not already assessed as PD during the radiology review. For any given time point, any clinical listings that are within a +14day window (+28 day window for bone marrow data) of the radiographic time point date can be used for the corresponding oncology time point assessments. Clinical listings that are +15 days after a radiographic time point will be grouped with the next radiographic time point .For example, if the radiographic time point date is 01Mar, and the non -bone marrow clinical evaluations on the listings occur on 10Mar and 16Mar, the listings from 10Mar will be associated with the radiographic time point date of 01Mar. The listings from 16Mar will not be associated with the 01Mar radiographic time point and will be grouped with the next radiographic time point. Any clinical listings that fall outside the allowable window will be evaluated with the next radiographic time point. A definition of assessment date is provided in Appendix 1, Section 14.1.4.5.3. For bone marrow data, the assessment window will be extended to +42 days if there are no subsequent radiographic time points. This +42 day window will only apply to overall assessments associated with the patients’s last radiographic time point. Further details regarding the IRC will be provided inthe IRC charter. The decision regardin g patient management will remain with the local investigator. Eligibility will be determined by local assessment of the required images obtained during screening. Imaging studies used to determine eligibility must be submitted to the I RC. Disease status at baseline and efficacy during the study will be evaluated using the following: Lesions from ph ysical exam findings Pathology assessment Imaging Bone marrow biops y or aspirate CSF cy tology Procedures (e.g surgeries) performed on stud y The results of the IRC assessment will be used for primary and secondary analysis purposes. Any imaging assessments alread y completed during the regular work -up of the patient within 8 weeks prior to start of infusion, including before signing the main study ICF, may beconsidered as the pre-infusion images for this study . Any imaging assessments obtained after infusion cannot be considered pre-infusion images. Any potentially measurable lesion that has been previously treated with radiotherap y should be considered as a non-measurable (non-index) lesion. However, if a lesion previously treated with radiotherap y has clearly progressed since the radiotherapy , it can be considered as a measurable lesion."

Baseline/ Pre-infusion imaging assessment should be done as close to infusion as possible .In the event more than one imaging assessment is performed after ICF and prior to infusion then the assessment datedclosest to infusion will be used as baseline/pre -infusion. Any imaging assessments alread y completed during the regular work- up of the patient within 8 weeks prior to infusion, including before signing the main study ICF, can be considered as the baseline images for this study . Any imaging assessments obtained after infusion cannot be considered baseline images. The patient should not receive an y anticancer therap y bet ween the screening images and infusion. One of the following assessments are required at screening and/or baseline , month 3 and Month 6 and at other timepoints only for new CR on CT scan not previously documented to confirm response: PET-CT with diagnostic CT (or PET-CT without diagnostic CT + dedicated diagnostic CT/MR I or dedicated CT/MRI of diagnostic quality +dedicated PET when PET-CTwith diagnostic contrast -enhanced CT is not available) must be performed at screening , Months 3, 6and prior to or after Months 3/6 only for new CR not previously documented to confirm response. The CT component of the PET-CT may be used in lieu of a standalone CT/MRI , only if the CT component is of similar diagnostic qualit y as a contrast enhanced CT perfo rmed without PET. If a contrast enhanced PET-CTwith diagnostic CTis not available, a PET (using a PET-CT without diagnostic CT or a dedicated PET scanner) must be performed and a dedicated contrast - enhanced diagnostic CT/MRI should be performed in additi on to the FDG -PET scan. If independent CT and PET scanners are used, and both scans are to be done on the same day, the PET must be performed prior to the contrast -enhanced CT as to not compromise PET results. The PET-CT acquisition methodology (e.g., admi nistration of intravenous contrast) should remain consistent between baseline, Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, Q6M (if applicable), and EO S for an y given patient. PET imaging is alway s required in order to confirm the first documented complete response (CR). If the first documented radiological CR is seen on CT scan only, a confirmatory PET scan (either FDG PET or PET -CT) should be obtained within 14 day s in order to confirm that timepoint’s response of CR. If the PET scan is not obtained within 14 days, the timepoint must be assessed as a PR, and the next scan should be done by one of the 3 methods above as soon as possible to confirm the CR. Once CR has been esta blished by PET imaging, subsequent CR and/or PD may be followed by CT imaging onl y. The possible scanning scenarios that are to occur are: 1.PET-CT with diagnostic CT 2.PET-CT with non -diagnostic CT + dedicated diagnostic CT/MRI 3.Dedicated diagnostic CT/MRI + dedicated FDG PET It ispreferred to obtain a PET-CT with diagnostic CT at all protocol required imaging visits when possible.

Brain MRI or CT should be completed if clinically indicated at screening and post infusion. Contrast enhanced brain MRI is preferred, however, if MRI contrast is contraindicated, then MRI without contrast or CT with/without contrast is ac ceptable. If skin lesions are present as a result of a physical exam, these are to be documented via the Lugano classification 2014 assessment as a ph ysical exam, skin lesion. If EO Sis performed outside of the scheduled study visits, efficacy assessments only have to be performed if the last assessment was done >30 day s before this visit. Additional imaging assessments for suspicion of PD or to support efficacy evaluation may be performed at any time during the study at the investigator’s discretion. If imaging is done for safet y reasons only there should be no efficacy assessment and/or submission to the imaging CRO. (All imaging submitted to the imaging CRO are expected to have a corresponding local efficacy assessment). Any on protocol scheduled and/or unscheduled imaging assessment sdone within +/- 14 day window are to be assessment under a single evaluation. Clinical suspicion of disease progression at an y time requires prompt ph ysical examination and imaging without waiting for the next scheduled imaging assessment. It is recommended to verify disease progression by CT and tumor biopsy , if applicable (see Table 7 -2). Once disease progression has been confirmed, no further efficacy assessments will have to be performed.

Brief description of each questionnaire is given in the sections below. For patients who relapse or progress, assess ments of patient -reported outcomes (SF -36 version 2; EQ- 5D-3L; FACT -Lym ) will be continued for the next two visits as per Table 7 -1."
110,page_110,"Novartis Confidential Page 111 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 PRO data will be collected byelectronic devices (i.e. tablet) .Each of the questionnaires described below is designed for patient self-administration. The method of activating and operating the data capture device is provided in a separate user guide. The patient should be given the electronic device to complete the questio nnaire(s) at the scheduled visit before other clinical assessments are conducted. The questions should be completed in the language the respondent is most familiar with, at the scheduled visit before the patient sees the investigator for clinical assessments. The patient should be given sufficient space and time to complete the questions. The study coordinator should check the patients’ responses for completeness and encourage the patient to complete any missing responses. Detailed instructions relating to the administrative procedures of the questionnaires will be provided to the sites. Patient’s refusal to complete all or an y part of a questionnaire should be documented in the study data capture s ystem. The completed ePRO data and any unsolicited comments made by the patient should be reviewed and assessed by the investigator for responses which may indicate potential AEs, including SAEs, before any clinical study examinations. This assessment should be documented in study source records. If AEs or SAEs areconfirmed, study investigators should not encourage the patient to change responses reported in the completed ePRO data. Study investigators must follow r eporting instructions outlined in Section 8.1.2. 7.2.6.1 FACT-Lym The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Lym phoma (FACT -Lym ) is a questionnaire to assess the qualit y of life in patients with Lymphoma. It consists of a general qualit y of life instrument (FACT -G) and a condition specific module Lym . The FACT -Lym is a fully validated QOL questionnaire applicable for patients with lymphoma and includes a module which assesses specific concerns of patients with lymphoma. The FACT -G has 27 statements that patients will need to endorse on a five -point scale (not a t all, a little, somewhat, quite a bit, very much). The statements cover five subscales (Phy sical Well- Being, Social/Famil y Well- Being, Emotional Well- Being, Functional Well- Being and Additional Concerns). The Lym module consists of 15 statements patients need to endorse on an identical five -point scale. This scale is designed for patient self -administration. Patients should be instructed to read the brief. After the patient's correct understanding has been confirmed they should be encouraged to complete every item in order without skipping any. Some patients may feel that a given question is not applicable to them and therefore will skip the item altogether. Patients should be encouraged to check the response most applicable. 7.2.6.2 SF-36v2 (Acute form) The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a widely used and extensively studied instrument to measure health -related quality of life among healthy patients and patients with acute and chronic conditions. It consists of eight subscales that can be scored individually :Physical Functioning, Role -Physical, Bodil y Pain, General Health, Vitality , Social Functioning, Role - Emotional, and Mental Health. Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) also can be computed . The SF - 36 has proven useful in monitoring general and specific populations, comparing the relative"

The measure is divided into two distinct sections. The first section includes one item addressing each of five dimensions (mobility , self-care, usual activity , pain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression). Patients rate each of these items from “no problem,” “some problem,” or “extreme problem.” A composite health index is then defined by combining the levels for each dimension. The second section of the questionnaire measures self-rated (global) health status utilizing a verticall y oriented visual analogue scale where 100 represents the “best possible health state” and 0 represents the “worst possible health state.” Respondents are asked to rate their current health by placing a mark along this continuum. The recall period is “today ,” and the questionnaire requires approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. 8 Safety monitoring and reporting 8.1 Adverse events 8.1.1 Definitions and reporting An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease ) in a patient or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study .Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the infusion of tisagenlecleucel. The investigator has the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual patient and identify ing adverse events. Novartis qualified medical p ersonnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. The occurrence of AEs must be sought b y non -directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study . Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the patient during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underl ying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate Adverse Event."
112,page_112,"Novartis Confidential Page 113 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 Adverse events must be recorded under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associate d with them, accompanied by the following information (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section 8.2): 1.Adverse events will be assessed and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, with the exce ption of CRS, which will follow Table 6-1. If CTCAE grading does not exist for an AE, the severit y of mild, moderate, severe, life -threateni ng and fatal, corresponding to Grades 1 - 5, will be used 2.its relationship to the study treatment and other investigational treatment If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression of underlying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) th e assessment of causalit y will usually be ‘Not suspected’. The rationale for this guidance is that the symptoms of a lack of efficacy or progression of underly ing illness are not caused b y the trial drug, they happen in spite of its administration and/or both lack of efficacy and progression of underly ing disease can only be evaluated meaningfully by an anal ysis of cohorts, not on a single patient 3.its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing , an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported. 4. whether it constitutes a serious adverse events (SAE) (see Section 8.2 for definition of SAE) and which seriousness criteria have been met 5.action taken regarding with study treatment. 6.All adverse events must be treated appropriatel y. Treatment m ay include treatment interruption or withdrawal. 7.its outcome, i.e., its recovery status or whether it was fatal If the event worsens the event should be reported a second time in the CRF noting the start date when the event worsens in toxicity . For grade 3 and 4 adverse events onl y, if improvement to a lower grade is determined a new entry for this event should be reported in the CRF noting the start date when the event improved from having been Grade 3 or Grade 4. Conditions that were alread y present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in medical history CRF. Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underly ing signs and s ymptoms. Adverse event monitoring should be continued for the duration as specified in Appendix 3 Section 14.3.1. Once an AEis detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent (e.g. continuing at the end of the study ), and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequentl y, if necessary ) of any changes in severity , the suspected relationship to the study treatmen t, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), if documented as per Lugano guideline, should not be reported as a serious adverse event. Adverse events separate from the progression of malignancy (example, deep vein thrombosis at the time of progression or hemopty sis concurrent with finding of disease progression) will"
113,page_113,"Novartis Confidential Page 114 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 be reported as per usual guidelines used for such events with proper attribution regarding relatedness to the treatment. Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the [Investigator ’sBrochure ]. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms they are considered clinically significant they require therapy Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, s ignificant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typical in patients with the underl ying disease. Detailed AE reporting requirements during the periods of screening, pre-treatment and treatment and follow -up are outlined in Appendix 3 Section 14.3.1. 8.1.2 Adverse Event of special reporting requir ements If specifically requested by a local Health Autho rity, expedited reporting of pre -specified AEs will occur. 8.1.3 Duration of adverse event reporting Detailed guidance to determine whether or not a non-serious AE, an SAE, concomitant medication, or laboratory result has to be recorded in the eCRF during the relevant study period is provided in Appendix 3 (Section 14.3 ). 8.2 Serious adverse events 8.2.1 Definitions Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adver se event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)] undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria : fatal life-threatening Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in whi ch the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that h ypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the ICH -E2D Guidelines). Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongati on of existing hospitalization, Note that hospitalizations for the following reasons should not be reported as serious adverse events:"
114,page_114,"Novartis Confidential Page 115 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent Social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s general condition treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission Is medicall y significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Such events should be considered as “medicall y significant”. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse. All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met and the malignant neoplasm is not a disease progression of the study indication. Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. 8.2.2 SAE reporting To ensure patient safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent must be reported to Novartis safet y within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence for the duration as specified in Appendix 3(Section 14.3.1 ).Additional SAE reporting requirements, including those for theperiods of screening, pre-treatment, treatment and follow -up, are also outlined inAppendix 3(Section 14.3.1). Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements a re to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site. All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow - up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. If the SAE is not p reviously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment, a CMO & PS Department associate may urgentl y require further information from the investigator for health authorit y reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all"

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collect ed and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with [EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01] or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. 8.3 Emergency unblinding of treatment assignment Not applicable 8.4 Pregnancies To ensure patient safet y, each pregnancy occurring after signing the informed consent must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy follow up in this study will end after birth or after any adverse pregnancy outcome associated with the end of the pregnancy . In case of live birth the newborn will be followed up until 12 months of age to detect an y developmental issue or abnormalit y that would not be seen at birth. Pregnancy outcomes must also be collected for the femal e partners of any males who received tisagenlecleucel in this study . Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the mother. Pregnancy should be recorded and reported by the investigator to the Novartis Chief Medical Office and Patient Safety (CMO&PS). Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to tisagenlecleucel infusion any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported. Pregnancy outcomes should be collected for the female partners of any males who took study treatment in this study . Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the mother. For more information about the effects of tisagenlecleucel on reproduct ion please refer to the recent [Investigator’s Brochure] . 8.5 Warnings and precautions No evidence available at the time of the approval of this study protocol indicated that special warnings or precautions were appropriate, other than those noted in the provided [Investigator ’s Brochure ].Additional safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the stud y as needed. 8.6 Reporting of study treatment errors including misu se/abuse Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient or consumer (EMA definition)."

During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality /integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of data capture / data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized Novartis/CRA organization. Additionally , a central analytics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis c linical teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the patient ’s file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed b y the patient (a signed cop y is given to the patient). The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry . Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the patients will be disclosed. 9.2 Data collection The designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF). The eCRFs have been built using fully validated secure web- enabled software that conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements, Investigator site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs and, allow modification or verification of the entered data b y the investigator staff. The investigator/designee is responsible for assuring that the data entered into eCRF is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely manner. The Investigator must certify that the data entered are complete and accurate . After final database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the patient data for archiving at the investigational site."
118,page_118,"Novartis Confidential Page 119 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 All data should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation and verification. 9.3 Database management and quality control Novartis personnel (or designated CRO) will review the data entered by investigational staff forcompleteness and accuracy . Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and sent to the investigational site via the EDC system. Designated investigator site staff are required to respond promptly to queries and to make any necessary changes to the data. Concomitant treatments and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Medical history /current medical conditions and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology . Once all the necessary actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written agreement b y Novartis development management. Samples and/or data will be processed centrall y and the results will besent electronically to Novartis. 10 Statistical methods and data analy sis Data from all participating centers will be combined. The primary analysis will be performed when 90 patients have received tisagenlecleucel infusion and completed 6 months from study day 1 infusion or discontinued earlier. A final Clinical Study Report (CSR) will be produced once all patients complete the study . 10.1 Analysis sets The analysis sets to be used are defined as below. The Efficacy Anal ysis Set (EAS) will be used as the primary efficacy analy sis set. The Safet y Set will be used for all the safet y anal ysis. The Cellular K inetic Anal ysis Set ( CKAS) will be used for the cellular kinetic analy sis. All tables and listings will be presented b y one treatment arm of tisagenlecleucel . 10.1.1 Screened Set The Screened Set comprises all patients who have signed informed consent and screened in the study . 10.1.2 Enrolled Set The enrolled set comprises all patients who are enrolled in this study . Enrollment is defined as the point at which the patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the patients’ leukapheresis product is received and accepted b y the manufacturing facility."

Patients will be categorized as below, within or above the prescribed dose range. Prior and concomitant medications and significant non-drug therapies prior to and after the start of infusion will be listed by patient and summarized by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) term. Transfusion during the study will be listed. In addition, whether patients have received anti -cytokine medications for the management of CRS will be summarized. 10.4 Primary objective The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel reflected by the complete response rate (CRR) determined by anindependent review committee (I RC). 10.4.1 Variable The primary endpoint is the CRR as determined by IRC. The CRR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR recorded from tisagenlecleucel infusion until progressive disease or start of new anticancer therapy , whichever comes first. 10.4.2 Statistical hy pothesis, model, and method of analy sis The primary efficacy analysis will be performed by testing the null hypothesis of CRR being less than or equal to 15% at one -sided cumulative 2.5% level of significance, i.e. H0: p ≤ 0.15 vs. H a: p > 0.15 The CRR will be summarized along with the 2-sided 95% exact Clopper -Pearson confidence intervals. P -value from binominal exact test will be provided. The primary efficacy endpoint, CRR will be analyzed based on the data observed in the E AS. In addition, sensitivity analysiswill be performed using the local investigator response assessments instead of the I RC assessment. 10.4.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuat ions Patients in this study who are of unknown clinical response will be treated as non-responders. See als o the Novartis guideline for efficacy evaluation in ly mphoma studies (based on Lugano 2014 response criteria) ( Section 14.1) for more details. Other missing data are simply noted as missing on appropriate tables/listings. 10.4.4 Supportive and Sensitivity analyses The primary analysis will also be performed on the Enrolled Set and PPS using the same methodology . In addition, analysis will also be performed using all patients who satisfy all clinical el igibility criteria."

Grouping of classes will be considered if there are too few patients in some subgroups. 10.5 Secondary objectives 10.5.1 Key secondary objective(s) Not applicable because no formal hypothesis testing is planned other than for the primary objective. 10.5.2 Other secondary efficacy objectives IRC assessment will be used in the main analy sis of secondary endpoints that involve disease response. 10.5.2.1 Overall response rat e (ORR) Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall disease response of CR or PR. The ORR will be summarized along with the 2-sided 95% exact Clopper -Pearson confidence intervals 10.5.2.2 Duration of response (DOR) Duration of response (DOR) applies only to patients whose best overall disease response was CR or PR. It is defined as the time from the date of first documented disease response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression or death due to FL. If a patient has not had an event, duration of overall response is censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. I n case a p atient do es not h ave progression or death du e to FL prior to data cutoff , DOR will be ce nsore d at the date of the last adeq uate asse ssment on or prior to the earliest censoring event . The censoring reason could be: Ongoing without event Lost to follow - up Withdrew consent"
122,page_122,"Novartis Confidential Page 123 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 New anticancer therap y (also see below for handling HSCT) Event documented after at least two missing tumor assessments Adequate assessments no longer available In the main analy sis of DOR, death due to reason other than FL will be considered as a competing risk event to other events of interest (progression or death due to FL). In this analy sis, the median response duratio n as well as proportion of patients without events following response (progression or death due to FL) at 3, 6, 9, 12 months, etc. will be presented with 95% confidence intervals using the cumulative incidence function (CIF). Distribution of DOR will also be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method in which death due to reason other than FL will be censored. As HSCT is an important treatment option in responding patients, it is appropriate to consider the date of HSCT as censoring date, instead of censoring at the last tumor assessment date. If a patient received HSCT after a CR or PR, relapse or survival status after HSCT will be recorded on the corresponding follow -up CRFs, although data on individual disease response components (e.g. CT scan) will not be collected. In such cases, the date of relapse or death (if due to FL) after HSCT will be used for calculation of DOR as a sensitivity anal ysis. Distribution of DOR will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the median response duration as well as proportion of patients without event at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months will be presented along with 95% confidence interval. Duration of response will be summarized for patients with CR only as well as with CR or PR. 10.5.2.3 Progression free survival (PFS) Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, progression -free survival is censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. In ca sea patient does not h aveprogression or death prior to data cutoff ,PFS willbe censore d at the dat e of the la stadeq uate assessment on or prior to the earliest censoring event . The censoring reason could be: Ongoing without event Lost to follow -up Withdrew consent New anticancer therap y (see below for handling of HSCT) Event documented after at least two missing tumor assessments Adequate assessments no longer available In the main analy sis of PFS, patients who proceed to HSCT after tisagenlecleucel infusion will be censored at the time of HSCT. In addition, a sensitivity analy sis of PFS will be performed without censoring for HSCT."

If a death has not been observed by the date of analysis cutoff, OS will be censored at the date of last contact. OS will be assessed in all patients (FAS). The distribution function of OS will be estimated using the Kaplan Meier (KM) me thod. The median OS and the proportion of patients alive at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months with 95% confidence intervals will be presented. 10.5.3 Safety objectives 10.5.3.1 Analysis set and grouping for the analy ses For all safet y analyses, the safet y set will be used, unless otherwise specified.

The overall observation period will be divided into three mutually exclusive segments: Pre-treatment period: from day of patient’s informed consent to the day before first lymphodepleting chemotherap y dose or the pre -infusion visit if the ly mphodepleting chemotherap y is not given. Lym phodepleting period (note: this period only applies to patients who received lymphodepleting chemotherap y): from the first day of lymphodepleting chemotherap y to the day before infusion of tisagenlecleucel , for patients who received infusion, or to the earlier of date of discontinuation and 30 days after last dose of ly mphodepleting chemotherap y for patients who didn’t receive infusion of tisagenlecleucel Post-infusion period: starting at day of tisagenlecleucel infusion 10.5.3.2 Adverse events (A Es) Reporting of adverse events will be based on MedDRA and CTCAE version 4.03. Adverse events that start or worsen after informed consent should be recorded in the patient’s source documents. New or worsening adverse events prior to starting study treatment (i.e. lymphodepleting chemotherap y or the pre -infusion visit if the ly mphodepleting chemotherap y is not given per Section 6.1.3) are not required to be recorded in the CRF unless it is an AE meeting criteria outlined in Section 8.1 or SAE meeting criteria outlined in Section 8.2.2 . Once the patients begin lymphodepleting chemotherapy or the pre-infusion visit, all newor worsening adverse events will be recorded in the Adverse Event CRF. Summary tables for adverse events will be provided for AEs that start or worsen during the post-infusion period, i.e. the tisagenlecleucel -treatment- emergent AEs. In addition, AEs that start or worsen during the lymphodepleting period will be summarized for all patients who received lymphodepleting chemotherap y.All safety data (including those from the pre-treatment period) will be listed along with the period (as defined in Section 10.5.3.1 ) of the starting date of AE."

129,page_129,"Novartis Confidential Page 130 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 10.7 Interim analy sis One interim analysis for overwhelming efficacy is planned for the study when approximately 50 patients of the planned 90 (55.6%) have received tisagenlecleucel infusion and have either completed 6 months from study day 1 infusion or discontinued earlier. An α -spending function according to Lan-DeMets (O’Brien -Fleming), as implem ented in EAST 6.3, will be used to construct the efficacy stopping boundary (Lan and DeMets 1983). Based on this choice of α- spending function, if the interim analysis is performed with 50 patients, the lower bound of the 2-sided 99.48% exact confidence in terval for CRR will need to be greater than 15% to declare statistical significance. As a result, a CRR of 16/50=32% will be needed to claim success at interim analy sis. At the final analy sis when 90 patients are treated and followed for at least 6"
130,page_130,"Novartis Confidential Page 131 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 months, 2-sided 95.16% exact CI will be used correspondingly , requiring an CRR of 21/90=23.3% to claim success. In case the actual number of patients included in the interim anal ysis cut -off date is not exactl y equal to the planned 50 patients, the efficacy bound aries will be re-calculated based on the actual number of patients using the pre-specified α- spending. By the time of the interim analy sis, all patients are expected to have been treated. Therefore, the study will not be stopped for outstanding efficacy regardless of the interim analy sisresults . The operating characteristics of certain scenarios are summarized in Table 10 -2below. Table 10 -2 Scenarios for interim and final analy sis ScenarioProbability (%) to claim success at interim analy sisProbability (%) to claim success at interim or final analy sis p=0.15 (H 0)0.19 2.35 p=0.20 3.08 24.45 p=0.25 16.31 67.06 p=0.30(H a)43.08 92.94 p=0.35 71.99 99.23 10.8 Sample size calculation The observed CRR was 14% in a recent study of idelalisib -treated patients with relapsed or refractory follicular ly mphoma ( Salles et al 2017 ). Based on the null hypothesis of CRR ≤ 15% and assuming the underly ing CRR of 30% for tisagenlecleucel , 90 patients in the primary analysis will provide at least 90% cumulative power to demonstrate statistical significance, using a 2-look Lan-DeMets group sequential design with O’Brien -Fleming type boundary and an exact confidence interval at one -sided cumulative 0.025 level of significance, if the underl ying CRR is 30%. In this setting, a CRR of 21/90=23.3% will be needed to claim success. Assuming 20% enrolled patients will not be infused due to reasons such as manufactory failure, worsening of patient’s condition, etc., at least 113 patients need to be enrolled to ensure 90 patients are treated and hence will be used for the primary anal ysis. 10.9 Power for an alysis of key secondary variables Not applicable because no formal hypothesis testing is planned other than for the primary objective. 11 Ethical considerations and administrative procedures 11.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance This clinical study was designed, shall be implemented and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC , US CFR 21), and with the ethical principles laid down in t he Declaration of Helsinki."

The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the stud y. The investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported in the CRFs and all other required reports. Data reported on the CRF, that are derived from source documents, should be consistent with the source docume nts or the discrepancies should be explained. All data requested on the CRF must be recorded. Any missing data must be explained. Any change or correction to a paper CRF should be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the original entry . For electronic CRFs an audit trail will be maintained by the sy stem. The investigator should retain records of the changes and corrections to paper CRFs. The investigator/institution should maintain the trial documents as specified in Essenti al Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (ICH E6 Section 8) and as required by applicable regulations and/or guidelines. The investigator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents (written and electronic) should be retained for a period of not less than fifteen (15) years from the completion of the Clinical Trial unless Sponsor provides written permission to dispose of them or, requires their retention for an additional period of time because of applicable laws, regulations and/or guidelines. 11.8 Confidentiality of study documents and patient records The investigator must ensure anon ymity of the patients; patients must not be identified by names in any documents submitted to Novartis. Signed informed consent forms and patient enrollment log must be kept strictl y confidential to enable patient identification at the site. 11.9 Audits and inspections Source data/documents must be available to inspections by Novartis or designee or Healt h Authorities. 11.10 Financial disclosures Financial disclosures should be provided by study personnel who are directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of patients at the site -prior to study start. 12 Protocol adherence Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. Under no circumstances should the investigator contact Novartis or its agents, if any, monitoring the study to request approval of a protocol deviation, as no authorized deviations are permitted. If the investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by Novartis and approved by the IRB/IEC/REB it cannot be implemented. All significant protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in the CSR."

143,page_143,"Novartis Confidential Page 144 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 14.1.1 Introduction The purpose of this document is to provide working definitions and rules to evaluate efficacy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) studies conducted by Novartis. This document is based on the International Working Group response criteria (Cheson et al 1999), the International Harmonization Project revised response criteria (Cheson et al 2007), and the revised Consensus of the International Conference on Malignant Imaging Working Group and the Lugano Classification ( Barrington et al 2014; Cheson et al 2014), and it is inten ded for studies of radiographically measurable disease. For studies without measurable disease, e.g., studies of consolidation of complete response, maintenance treatment, or autologous stem cell transplantation, see [Appendix A ]. 14.1.2 Methodologies 14.1.2.1 Computed to mography (CT) The same method of assessment and technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion throughout the study . Contrast -enhanced CT of neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, from skull base through lesser trochanters ensuring complete coverage of the pelvis and inguinal areas, should be performed using a ≤ 5 mm slice thickness with a contiguous reconstruction algorithm. If a patient has a CT contrast allergy or develops it during the trial, non-contrast CT of the chest plus contrast-enhanced MRI of abdomen and pelvis are acceptable for a follow up. Chest MRI is not recommended due to respiratory artifacts. 14.1.2.2 Positron emission tomography (PET) Studies of FDG -avid histologies require PET using the radiotracer 18F -fluorodeox yglucose (FDG) to confirm any new CR determined by CT. PET will not be required to confirm progression or relapse. PET scans should cover the whole body from base of skull to mid -thigh. Examinations should be consistent across all time points including amount of tracer, location of injection, arm location, and scan delay . Information of height, weight, gender, administered dose, time between dose administration and imaging, and glucose level are required for each time point. PET images should be converted to SUV map s to support comparison across time points and to standardize viewing conditions. 14.1.2.3 PET-CT Hybrid PET-CT may be used to acquire PET and CT images ifCT images produced by the scanner are of diagnostic quality and include intravenous contrast. Non-diagnostic CT images acquired for attenuation purposes during PET-CTare NOT acceptable as the only images for the time point. If diagnostic CT and PET are to be acquired on the same day , PET must be performed prior to CT with I V contrast to avoid compromising PET results. Thus, any of the three following imagining methodologies are possible in a ly mphoma study : PET-CT with diagnostic PET-CT with non -diagnostic CT and dedicated diagnostic CT"
144,page_144,"Novartis Confidential Page 145 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 Dedicated diagnostic CT and dedicated FDG PET 14.1.2.4 Magnetic resonance imaging (M RI) and PET- MRI MRI or PET -MRI is an acceptable method of imaging if CT is contraindicated e.g., due to CT contrast allergy . If at baseline a patient is known to be allergic to CT contrast or develops allergy during the trial, the following change in imagi ng modality will be accepted for follow up: a non-contrast CT of the chest plus contrast -enhanced MRI of abdomen and pelvis (MRI of the chest is not recommended due to respiratory artifacts). 14.1.2.5 Five point scale (5PS) To standardize PET interpretation, a simp le reproducible scoring method called the five point scale (5PS) or the Deauville criteria has been implemented for initial staging and assessment of interim and end of treatment responses (Barrington et al 2014). The 5PS assesses the most intense uptake i n a site of disease ( Table 14 -1). Table 14 -1 Five Point Scale (5PS) Score Findings Score 1 No uptake above background Score 2 Uptake ≤mediastinum Score 3* Uptake > mediastinum, but ≤ liver Score 4** Uptake moderately > liver Score 5** Uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions * The protocol will need to define the significance of a score 3, depending on the studied disease, patient characteristics and goal of therapy ●Score 3 may be considered PET negative in low risk disease (e.g. follicular lymphoma) and where no further treatment is necessary ●Score 3 may be considered PET positive in high risk disease that is curable and aggressive (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma) and in de-escalation studies ** Score 4 should be applied to uptake greater than the maximum standard uptake value (SUV) in a large region \ of normal liver and score 5 to uptake 2 times greater than the maximum SUV in the liver. PET images should be converted to SUV maps to support comparison across time points and to standardize viewing conditions. (New) areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma will be marked as “X” ( Barrington et al. 2014 ). 14.1.3 Definitions 14.1.3.1 Disease stage Extent and involvement by lymphoma is described by the disease stage and is an important prognostic factor. Stage can also influence treatment decisions. 14.1.3.2 Baseline Baseline examination should be as close as possible to the randomization/start of treatment (e.g., within 4 weeks prior to randomization/start of treatment). Longer periods may be allowed depending on the disease studied and the study design."
145,page_145,"Novartis Confidential Page 146 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 14.1.3.3 Nodal vs. extranodal lesion A lesion can be categorized as: Nodal lesion (a l ymph node or a nodal mass) Extranodal lesion (a lesion located in other organs, including spleen and liver) 14.1.3.4 Measurable disease All anatomic measurements should be taken in two perpendicular dimensions and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. Throughout this document, a lesion will be called measurable if: It can be meas ured accurately in two perpendicular dimensions: longest diameter (LDi) (also known as transverse diameter), and shortest diameter (SDi), which is the longest diameter perpendicular to L Di (also known as perpendicular diameter). The LDi and SDi must be mea sured on the same slice. For a nodal lesion, LDi is greater than 15 mm, regardless of SDi For an extranodal lesion, if both L Di and SDi are greater than 10 mm A lymph node not meeting the measurability criteria but with LDi greater than 15 mm (e.g. SDi cannot be measured accuratel y) will constitute a non- measurable nodal lesion if FDG -avid (for FDG -avid histologies). A lymph node not meeting the measurability criteria but with LDi ranging from 11 mm to 15 mm and with SDi greater than 10 mm will be checked f or relationship to disease as follows: If it is related to l ymphoma, it will constitute a non-measurable nodal lesion (referred to as “involved node” in Cheson et al 2007) If not related to l ymphoma and n ot FDG -avid, it will constitute an abnormal ly mph node but not a nodal lesion for FDG -avid histologies All lesions visible on PET but not on CT/MRI will be treated as non- measurable. Bulky disease Bulk y disease is captured by means of the longest measureme nt by CT scan. The definition of bulky disease (a minimum size) should be included in the study protocol. 14.1.3.5 Assessable disease Assessable disease refers to disease presentations that are consistent with lymphoma but are not suitable for measurement, e.g., pleural effusion, ascites, etc. Assessable disease will be followed qualitatively . 14.1.3.6 Index lesion Up to 6 of the largest nodes, nodal masses or other ly mphomatous lesions, including extranodal lesions, measurable in two diameters (LDi and SDi) Should represent overall disease burden and include mediastinal and retroperitoneal disease, if involved"
146,page_146,"Novartis Confidential Page 147 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 14.1.3.7 Non- index lesion All other lesions which are not selected as index lesions but are consistent with ly mphoma Abnormal nodes and extranodal lesions, both measurable and non-measurable, such as cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and bone lesions, pleural or pericardial effusions, and ascites 14.1.3.8 New lesions Regrowth of previousl y resolved lesions A new nodal lesion > 15 mm in any axis A new extranodal lesion > 10 mm in any axis A ne w extranodal lesion ≤ 10 mm in any axis that is unequivocal and attributable to lymphoma A new assessable lesion attributable to ly mphoma (e.g., ascites, pleural effusion) 14.1.4 Efficacy assessments 14.1.4.1 Eligibility In general, patients should have at least one measurable nodal lesion (greater than 15 mm in the long axis) or at least one measurable extranodal lesion (with both L Di and SDi greater than 10 mm). 14.1.4.2 Methods of disease assessment 14.1.4.2.1 PET combined with diagnostic CT The integration of PET into more frequentl y acqu ired CT evaluation does present a challenge to the way response is assessed in a clinical trial. The study protocol must clearl y define the imaging intervals and imaging methods to be used at each imaging visit. PET scans should be performed at pre-specifi ed times for example at randomization before treatment and at clearly defined times during and/or after the end of treatment. PET may also be acquired to confirm CT results. The same CT imaging modality should be used at baseline and all post- baseline asse ssments in order to reduce the risk of false responses or progressions based on measurement error. A change in modality can be either a change in contrast use (i.e., with contrast versus without contrast) or a change in technique (e.g. from CT to MRI ). Response assessments made after a change in imaging modality should be queried, and if the investigator or blinded central reviewer can provide sufficient justification, then the response can be accepted. In order to calculate the sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters (PPD) of all index lesions, their size must be recorded throughout the study . Actual lesion measurements should be entered on the corresponding CRFs. If, during the course of the study , either of the perpendicular diameters of a lesion cannot be reliably measured because of its small size, it is recommended to enter the minimum limit of detection as the diameter size (e.g., 5 mm for spiral CT). In other cases when, during the course of the study , the diameter cannot be reliabl y measure d for reasons other than its size (i.e., borders of the lesion are confounded by"
147,page_147,"Novartis Confidential Page 148 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 neighboring anatomical structures), no measurement should be entered and the lesion cannot be evaluated. If lesions become confluent over time, it is recommended to measure th em as one lesion, report the overall diameters to one of the lesions and assign 0 mm × 0 mm to each of the other previously measured lesions. The PPD of the current confluent mass should be used to measure response, with more than 50% increase in the PPD o f the confluent mass compared with nadir of the sum of individual nodes necessary to indicate progressive disease. If a lesion splits into several discrete lesions, the individual product of the perpendicular diameters (PPDs) of each lesion should be summe d together to represent the PPD of the split lesion; this PPD is added to the sum of the PPDs of the remaining lesions to measure response. If subsequent growth of any or all of these discrete nodes occurs, the nadir of each individual node is used to determine progression (as if each individual node was selected as an index lesion at baseline). 14.1.4.2.2 Bone marrow assessment Bone marrow should be evaluated b y biops y or aspirate in all patients at baseline. If lymphoma involvement in bone marrow is observed at baseline, then biopsy or aspirate should be performed post-baseline to confirm radiological CR. Any deviation from this approach should be justified in the study protocol. 14.1.4.2.3 Physical examination Skin lesions must be histologicall y confirmed for lymphoma involvement (the investigational site must document the histological confirmation (yes or no) on the corresponding CRF) and photographed including a ruler (color photograph y using digital camera). Response assessment of skin lesions will be performed and results will be recorded on the corresponding CRF at baseline and at the time of each radiological assessment. 14.1.4.3 Documentation of disease For the evaluation of disease at baseline and throughout the study , the following will be recorded. 14.1.4.3.1 FDG uptake FDG uptake in a nodal or extranodal site that is suggestive of l ymphoma will be assessed using 5PS. 14.1.4.3.2 Index lesions A minimum of one measurable index lesion and a maximum of six of the largest dominant nodal and extranodal lesions must be documented at baseline and assessed throughout the study in two dimensions. The lesions should come from different body regions representative of the patient’s overall disease burden and should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal disease, if involved. Two perpendicular dimensions (LDi, SDi) must be recorded on the corresponding CRF at each assessment of a measurable lesion selected to be an index lesion. Index nodal lesions"
148,page_148,"Novartis Confidential Page 149 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 Index nodal lesions are selected from the measurable nodal lesions and should be documented at baseline and assessed throughout the study . Index nodal lesions should be from disparate regions of the body including mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved. Index extranodal lesions Other organs such as breast and lung can be occasionall y involved by lymphoma. Such extranodal lesions (e.g. hepatic nodules) may be included (if measurable) in the six index lesions to be assessed throughout the study . In some cases histological examination may be necessary to confirm that these lesions represent ly mphoma involvement (e.g. skin lesions). 14.1.4.3.3 Non-index lesions Non-index nodal lesions Nodal lesions not selected as index lesions (both measurable and non-measurable) are considered as non-index lesions. Non-index lesions should be documented at baseline and assessed throughout the study . Measurements of these lesions are not required to be documented on the CRF. Non-index extranodal lesions Measurable extranodal lesions not selected as index lesions and all non -measurable extranodal lesion s (including non-measurable but assessable disease e.g. pleural effusion) will be documented at baseline and assessed throughout the study as non -index lesions. Measurements of these lesions are not required to be documented on the CRF. 14.1.4.3.4 Spleen involvement Splenic involvement is determined by imaging: vertical (cranial to caudal) length > 13 cm is considered as involved, and spleen length must be assessed at each imaging time point. Intrasplenic lesions should be followed as index, non-index and new extranodal lesions. 14.1.4.3.5 Liver involvement Given variability in physical habitus and the impact of numerous medical conditions, assessment of liver size is not considered a reliable measure of hepatic involvement and therefore liver assessment is not included in the Lugano 2014 classification. Intrahepatic lesions should be followed as index, non - index and new extranodal lesions. 14.1.4.3.6 Bone marrow involvement Lym phoma involvement in bone marrow should be documented in the CRF as “Yes” or “No” at each bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration. 14.1.4.4 Response evaluation The efficacy variables in the statistical analy sis are based on overall disease response , which is a combined evaluation of response based on both radiological and clinical findings, and is determined at each post-baseline assessment. The radiological response is first obtained from CT and PET studies according to the Lugano criteria ( Table 14 -2) and overall disease response"
149,page_149,"Novartis Confidential Page 150 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 is then determined by taking into account results of bone marrow biopsies and other clinical information ( Table 14-3 ). 14.1.4.4.1 Radiological response There are three separate components to radiological response, all of which should be collected on the CRF at eac h post -baseline assessment: 1.CT response based on anatomical measurements of index/non -index/new lesions and spleen length. The possible response outcomes are complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) as defined in Table 14-2. 2.PET response based on 5PS, changes in intensit y or extent of standard uptake values (SUVs) and bone marrow assessments directl y from the PET scan. The possible outcomes for PET response are complete metabolic response (CMR), partial metabolic response (PMR), no metabo lic response (NMR), or progressive metabolic disease (PMD) as defined in Table 14-2. 3.Overall radiological response combines CT response with PET response. The outcomes include CR, PR, SD, and PD. For time points when both CT and PET are available, PET response overrules CT response. Overall radiological response at a time point with CT only may also be affected by PET response obtained at a different time point. 1.Example 2.A CT response of PR at the same assessment as a PET response of CMR will constitute an overall radiological response of CR, and (i) a subsequent time point with CT only and CT response of PR will still constitute an overall radiological response of CR, (ii) a previous time point with CT onl y and CT response of PR may be upgraded to CR at the discretion of the investigator or blinded central reviewer.

It is recommended that either a biopsy be performed or the lesion be reassessed in at least 2 weeks, and if there is continued evi dence of tumor progression, the date of progressive disease is the previous evaluation. †PET 5PS 1: no uptake > background; 2: uptake ≤ mediastinum; 3: uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver; 4: uptake moderately > liver; 5: uptake markedly > liver and/or new lesions; X: new areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma. 14.1.4.4.2 Overall disease response Overall disease response is determined by assessing whether the combined radiological responses at each time point are appropriate, based on bone marr ow biopsies and other clinical findings that may be available, such as cytology results, physical examination results of palpable lesions or skin lesions, and biopsies of ly mph nodes or extra -nodal lesions ( Table 14 - 3). The possible outcomes for overall disease response are CR, PR, SD, and PD. For example, suppose there was lymphoma involvement in the baseline bone marrow biops y, and the month 3 combined radiological response was CR (imply ing that PET-based bone marrow involvement at month 3 was negative). In that case, overall disease response could only be CR if there was a negative bone marrow biopsy otherwise overall disease response would be downgraded to PR. This is a case where the bone marrow biops yresults overrule the bone marrow findings on PET. Another example is when the combined radiological response is SD, but cytology results of a pleural effusion show lymphoma involvement: this could lead to an overall disease response of PD. Overall disease response at each post-baseline assessment should be captured on the CRF, along with the date of response. In addition, the source of any clinical data that affected the overall disease response should be documented."

The definition of new anticancer therapy may need to be defined in the study protocol (e.g., high -dose chemotherap y with autologous stem cell transplantation). A patient will have a best overall response of CR if they have CR as overall disease response for at least one of the assessments. A patient will have a best overall response of PR if at least one overall disease response of PR is available (and the patient does not qualify for CR). A best overall response of SD will be declared when at least one overall disease response of SD is available at least 6 weeks after randomization/start of treatment (and the patient does not qualify for CR or PR). If SD is observed before this minimum follow -up period, and the patient does not qualify for CR, PR or PD, then the best overall response would be unknown (UNK). If a different minimum follow -up period for SD is more appropriate (e.g., if first post- baseline visit is at 28 day s) then this must be specified in the Study Protocol. A patient will have a best overall response of PD if overall disease response is PD between randomization/start of treatment and the second scheduled post-baseline assessment (and the patient does not qualify for CR, PR or SD). For example, assuming 12 weeks between assessments and a permi tted variation in visit timing of ± 1 week, this would mean during the first 25 weeks after randomization/start of treatment. If PD is observed after this maximum follow -up period, and the patient does not qualify for CR,"
153,page_153,"Novartis Confidential Page 154 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 PR or SD, then the best overall response would be UNK. If a different maximum follow -up period for PD is more appropriate then this must be specified in the Study Protocol. A patient will have a best overall response of UNK if the patient does not qualify for CR, PR, SD or PD. Overall dise ase response at a given assessment may be provided from different sources: Per Investigator: overall disease response based on local radiological assessments, using investigator choice of index lesions, measurements and assessments of lesion status and 5PSalong with clinical findings Per Central Blinded Review, with or without blinded adjudication: based on central review of local radiological assessments, using central reviewer choice of index lesions, measurements and assessments of lesion status and 5PS , along with clinical findings In studies that include a central blinded review, the Study Protocol should state which source will be used for the primary anal ysis. Best overall response is summarized by calculating the overall response rate (ORR) , which i s defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR. Similarly , the complete response rate is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR. 14.1.4.5.2 Time to event variables Most of the time to event variables are define d in this section according to the revised International Working Group response criteria (Cheson et al 2007 ). Further details on dates and censoring rules are provided respectivel y in Section 14.1.4.5.3 and Section 14.1.4.5.4. Overall survival Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, OS will be censored at the date of last contact. Progression -free survival Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization/start of treatment to the date ofevent defined as the first documented progression (overall disease response = PD) or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, PFS is censored at the date of the last adequate assessment as defined in Section 14.1.4.5.3. Time to progression Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from the date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of first documented progression (overall disease response = PD) or death due to lymphoma. If a patient has not had an event, TTP is censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. Duration of response Duration of response (DOR) applies only to patients with best overall disease response of CR or PR. It is defined as the time from the date of the first documented overall disease response"
154,page_154,"Novartis Confidential Page 155 Oncol ogy Clinical Trial Protocol v00 Protocol No. CCTL019E2202 of CR or PR to the date of first documented progression or death due to l ymphoma. If a patient has not had an event, DOR is censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. I t should be stated that thi s analy sis might introduce a bias as it includes only responders. Duration of complete response applies only to patients with best overall disease response of CR. It is defined as the time from the date of the first documented overall disease response of CR to the date of first documented progression or death due to ly mphoma. If a patient has not had an event, duration of CR is censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. Duration of CR might be calculated in addition for studies in which a reasona ble number of complete responders are seen. The analysis of DOR should only be used as a descriptive analysis. If used as an inferential comparison between treatments, clear justification must be given in the study protocol. Time to response Time to respon se (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of first documented overall disease response of PR or CR. Depending on the study design, this anal ysis could be based on all patients only, or on responders only, or both of these analysis populations may be used .The choice of analy sis population for TTR should be stated in the study protocol. For analysis using all patients, TTR will be censored for patients who did not achieve a PR or CR: At maximum follow -up (i.e. FPFV to LPLV used for the analysis) for patients who had a PFS event (i.e. either progressed or died due to any cause) At the date of the last adequate assessment otherwise Time to complete response (TTCR) is defined similarly to TTR except using CR only instead of either PR or CR, and with this difference, the above rules and definitions for TTR also appl y to TTCR. Lymphoma specific survival Lym phoma specific survival (LSS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of death documented as a result of lymphoma. If a patient has not had an event, LSS will be censored: at the date of last contact if the patient is not known to have died at the date of death if the patient died for reason other than l ymphoma Event -free survival Event -free survival (EFS) may be appropriate in studies of advanced disease where early discontinuation is typically related to intolerance of the study drug. In some protocols, EFS may be considered as a sensitivity analysis for TTP. If a patient has not had an event, EFS is censored at the date of the last adequate assessment as defined in Section 14.1.4.5.3. The definition of event needs to be defined in the Study Protocol according to study design."

For the calculation of duration of response variables the following start date should be used: Date of first documented response is the assessment date of the first overall disease response of CR for duration of complete response or CR/PR for duration of response End date The end dates which are used to calculate ‘time to event’ variables are defined as follows: Date of death as rep orted on the disposition CRF Date of last contact is defined as the last date the patient was known to be alive as derived from different CRF pages (see details in Section 14.1.4.5.2 ) Date of progression is the first assessment date at which the overall disease response was recorded as PD Date of last adequate assessment is the date of the last assessment with overall disease response of CR, PR or SD which was made before an event or a censoring reason occurred. If no post -baseline assessments are available (before an event or a censoring reason occurred) the date of randomization/start of treatment is used. Date of next scheduled assessment is the date of the last adequate assessment plus the protocol spec ified time interval between assessments. This date may be used if back - dating is considered when the event occurred beyond the acceptable time window for the next radiological assessment as per protocol. Example (if protocol defined schedule of assessments is 3 months): response assessments at baseline - 3 months - 6 months -missing -missing -PD. Date of next scheduled assessment would then correspond to 9 months. Date of treatment discontinuation is the last known date subject took study drug (to be used, if applicable) Date of new anti -cancer therapy is defined as the start date of first new antineoplastic therap y (including medication, radiotherap y, surgery or HSCT) 14.1.4.5.4 Censoring and sensitivity analyses Censoring reasons"

This reason corresponds to any censoring reasons after two or more missing response assessments. This reason will also be used for censor in cas e of no baseline assessment Event date, censoring date and sensitivity analyses This section outlines the possible event and censoring dates for progression (Table 14-5), as well as addressing the issues of missing response assessments during the study . It is important that the protocol and analy sis plan specify the primary analysis in detail with respect to the definition of event and censoring dates and also include a description of one or more sensitiv ity analyses to be performed. Based on definitions outlined in Section 14.1.4.5.2 , and using the draft FDA guideline on endpoints ( FDA 2007 ) as a reference, the following anal yses can be considered: Table 14 -5 Options for event dates used in PFS, EFS, TTP, DOR Situation Options for end -date (progression)1 (1) = default unless specified differently in the protocol or analy sis planOutcome A No baseline assessment (1) Date of randomization/start of treatment2Censor B Progression at or before next scheduled assessment(1) Date of progression (2) Date of next scheduled assessment1Event Event C1 Progression or death due to any reason after exactly one missing assessments(1) Date of progression (or death) (2) Date of next scheduled assessment1Event Event C2 Progression or death due to any reason after two or more miss ing assessments(1) Date of last adequate assessment1 (2) Date of next scheduled assessment1 (3) Date of progression (or death)Censor Event Event D No progression (1) Date of last adequate assessment Censor"

The primary analysis and the sensitivity analyses must be specified in the Study Protocol. Clearly define if and why options (1) are not used for situations C, E and (if applicable) F. Situations C (C1 and C2): Progression or death after one or more missing assessments: The primary anal ysis is usually using options (1) for situations C1 and C2, i.e. (C1) taking the actual progression or death date, in the case of only one missing assessment (C2) censoring at the date of the last adequate assessment, in the case of two or more consecutive missing assessments In thecase of two or missing assessments (situation C2), option (3) may be considered jointly with option (1) in situation C1 as sensitivity analysis. A variant of this sensitivity analysis consists of backdating the date of event to the next scheduled assessme nt as proposed with option (2) in situations C1 and C2. Situation E: Treatment discontinuation due to ‘Disease progression’ without documented progression: By default, option (1) is used for situation E as patients without documented PD should be followed for progression after discontinuation of treatment. However, option (2) may be used as sensitivity analy sis. If progression is claimed based on clinical deterioration instead of response assessment by e.g. CT -scan, option (2) may be used for indications with high earl y progression rate or difficulties to assess the response due to clinical deterioration. Situation F: New cancer therapy given (except for EFS): the handling of this situation must be specified in detail in the protocol. However, option (1), i.e. censoring at last adequate assessment may be used as a default in this case.

The latter could be handled b y replacing in Table 14-5 the “Date of last adequate assessment” b y the “Date of previous scheduled assessment (from baseline)”, with t he following definition: Date of previous scheduled assessment (from baseline) is the date when a response assessment would have taken place, if the protocol assessment scheme was strictl y followed from baseline, immediately before or on the date of the last adequate assessment. The need for these types of sensitivity analyses will depend on the requirements for a specific study and disease area and have to be specified in the Study Protoc ol or SAP documentation. 14.1.5 Data handling and programming conventions The following rules should be used and specified in the SAP documentation: 14.1.5.1 Calculation of ‘time to event’ variables Time to event = enddate -startdate + 1 (in day s) When no post-baseline assessments are available, the date of randomization/start of treatment will be used as enddate (duration = 1 day) when time is to be censored at last assessment, i.e. time to event variables can never be negative. 14.1.5.2 Date of last contact The date of last cont act will be derived for patients alive using the latest complete date among the following: Assessment dates (e.g., vital signs assessment, performance status assessment, efficacy assessment, laboratory , pharmacokinetics assessment) Medication dates including study medication and antineoplastic therapies administered after stud y treatment discontinuation Adverse events dates Last known date subject alive collected on the ‘Survival information’ eCRF Randomization date 14.1.5.3 Date of new anti -cancer therapy The date of new anti-cancer therapy is the date of the first antineoplastic therapy (including medicine, radiotherap y and surger y) reported on the post -treatment antineoplastic therap y CRF or from other sources (e.g., HSCT CRF). 14.1.5.4 Incomplete assessment dates All investigation dates (e.g., PET-CT scan) must be completed with day, month and year. If one or more investigation dates are incomplete but other investigation dates are available, this/these incomplete date(s) are not considered for calculation of the assessment date (and assessment date is calculated as outlined in Section 14.1.4.5.3). If all measurement dates have no day recorded, the 1st of the month is used."

If a previous and following assessment is not available, this assessment will not be used for any calculation. 14.1.5.5 Incomplete dates for last contact or death All dates must be completed with day, month and year. If the day is missing, the 15th of the month will be used for incomplete death dates or dates of last contact. 14.1.6 References Barrington SF, Mikhaeel NG, Kostakoglu L, et al (2014) Role of imaging in the staging and response assessment of lymphoma: Consensus of the International Conference on Malignant Lym phomas Imaging Working Group.

Relapsed disease Any of the following meets the definition of relapsed disease (RD): Any new nodal lesion > 15 mm in any axis (i.e. previously normal lymph node becoming >1.5 cm in an y axis) on CT (or MRI ) after baseline Any discrete extranodal lesion (including liver or spleen) reliabl y appearing on CT (or MRI ) after baseline ≥ 50% increase in long axis from baseline of any residual ly mph node or mass. A residual lymph node or mass is defined as a previously lymphoma -involved ly mph node or mass (>10 mm in short axis (without any upper limit)) that was PET negative at baseline and only reliabl y detected b y baseline CT (or MRI). Note: If a residual ly mph node or mass at baseline decreases in size during treatment and becomes normal (i.e. complete disappearance of extranodal mass or ≤ 10 mm in short axis and ≤ 15 mm long axis for nodal mass), then reappearance of an extranodal lesion at the same site or increase of the"

If a patient has not had an event, DFS is censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. Similar censoring rules and reasons as the ones used for PFS can be applied. 14.2 Appendix 2: Eligibility based on serologic markers for hepatitis B and C Test Result HBsAg + - - - - HBcAb Any + - + - HBsAb Any - + + - HCV Ab Any Any - - - Eligibility Not Eligible Not Eligible Eligible Eligible Eligible If indeterminate results are obtained, viral DNA (hepatitis B) or RNA (hepatitis C) should be measured to confirm negative viral status.
