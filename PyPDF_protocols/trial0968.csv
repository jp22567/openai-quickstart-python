Rationale: New fax number. ●Section 5.2.1 , Inclusion Criteria: removal of the following redundancy: ""Females of non-childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile as defined above) at Screening do not require pregnancy testing at Study Day 1."" Rationale: Editorial change. ●Section 5.2.3.3 , Prohibited Therapy: moving the time point from which phototherapy (e.g., UVA, UVB, any othe r UV-therapy or balneotherapy) not- associated with systemic UV-sensitizing agents, topical treatment for psoriasis or any other skin condition (e.g., corticosteroids, cvitamin D analogues, vitamin A analogues, pimecrolimus, retinoids, salicylvaseline, salicylic acid, lactic acid, tacrolimus, tar, urea, andanthralin, α-hydroxy acid, fruit acids) are prohibited from 14 days prior to Screening to 14 days prior to Baseline. Rationale: The half-life of those therapies is short and no interaction with study medication is to be expected if they are discontinued 14 weeks before 1stdose of study medication, i.e., 14 days before Baseline (Day 1, Week 0). ●Section 5.3.1.1 , Study Procedures, and Appendix C , Study Activities: FUMADERM®INITIAL and FUMADERM®Subject Diary: Clarification that the subject diary will be dispensed to the subject at every visit, starting at the Week 0/Baseline Visit rather than at the Screening Visit, and that the"
2,page_2,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 3 subject will be trained on how to complete the diary at the Week 0/Baseline Visit. Rationale: Clarification. ●Section 5.4.1.1 , Discontinuation of Subjects on FUMADERM®: Point 8: Restriction of the discontinuation of the subjects on FUMADERM®for rash/flush to those with severe rash/flush. Rationale: In clinical practice only severe persistent rash/flush leads to discontinuation of the patients from FUMADERM®. The FUMADERM®label language does not request discontinuation of FUMADERM®treatment for all adverse events of rash/flush, but says: ""… severe forms (of rash/flush) may lead to (FUMADERM®) treatment discontinuation."" ●Section 5.5.1 , Treatments Administered: the sentence ""Additional dosing instructions will be provided separately from this protocol"" has been removed. Rationale: Risankizumab will be administered by site personnel only, therefore no additional instructions on how to administer an SC injection is required. ●Appendix J , NAPPA-CLIN®: Extension of the prohibition of artificial nail and/or nail polish to all subjects instead of subjects with nail psoriasis only. Rationale: Consistency within the protocol. The analysis of the efficacy on nail psoriasis is planned on all subjects regardless of a concomitant nail psoriasis. An itemized list of all changes made to this protocol under this amendment can be found in Appendix K ."

Investigator: Investigator information on file at AbbVie. Study Site: Approximately 25 sites in Europe Study Population: Adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI > 10), affected body surface area (BSA) > 10% and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) > 10] who are naïve to and candidates for systemic therapy. Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: Approximately 110 [2 × 55] Methodology: This study is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label study with blinde d assessment of efficacy to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of SC risankizumab in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are naïve to and candidates for systemic therapy compared with oral FUMADERM ®provided as study medication. This study will be conducted in approximately 110 subjects. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by prior phototherapy, with a maximum of 20% of subjects with prior phototherapy) to one of two arms of either risankizumab or oral FUMADERM® provided as study medication. The following are the dosing arms: !Risankizumab 150 mg SC at Week 0/Day 1, Week 4 and Week 16 or, !Oral FUMADERM®provided as study medication daily starting at Week 0/Day 1 and until Week 24 (last intake in the morning on the day of Week 24 visit): FUMADERM®INITIAL provided as study medication starting at Week 0/Day 1 until Week 2 and FUMADERM®provided as study medication starting at Week 3, both at starting dose of 1 tablet per day, followed by an increase in the daily dose of 1 tablet per week, with the intention of achieving PASI 90. The maximum daily dose of FUMADERM®provided as study medication may not exceed 6 tablets per day. After the targeted efficacy on the psoriasis cutaneous lesions has been reached, an attempt should be made to reduce the dose of FUMADERM ®provided as study medication to the individual maintenance dose. Efficacy outcomes will be measured at each visit until Week 24 and safety data will be collected throughout the study."

6,page_6,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 7 Statistical Methods: Efficacy: The efficacy analysis will be performed in the Intent to Treat (ITT) set which includes all subjects who are randomized. The primary efficacy endpoint (PASI90 at Week 24) will be analyzed using a two-sided Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test stratified by prior phototherapy at level of significance 5%. Missing data will be imputed using non-responder imputation, i.e., a subject with missing PASI90 at Week 24 will be considered a non-responder in the primary analysis. For categorical secondary endpoints, the same statistical test as for the primary endpoint will be used, missing data will be imputed using non-responder imputation. For continuous secondary endpoints, two-sided two-way ANOVA will be used with treatment and prior phototherapy as factors and missing data will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF). Secondary endpoints will not be used for confirmatory interpretation, thus no adjustment for multiplicity will be done. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Immunogenicity: Risankizumab serum concentrations will be determined. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for each sampling time (study visit). The number and percentage of subjects with ADA will be calculated. Additional analyses combining pharmacokinetic and ADA data from this study and other studies may be conducted if appropriate. Safety: The safety analysis will be performed in the safety set which includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term, whereby the most current implemented MedDRA dictionary will be used. Also, summaries by severity and relationship to study drug will be done. Certain adverse events, like serious or severe, leading to discontinuation, will be listed and described in detail. Adverse events of interest for treatment with biologics will be defined in the statistical analysis plan and analyzed separately. Adverse events will be summarized by frequency and percentage and presented by treatment group, statistical comparisons will be performed using Fisher's exact test. Other safety variables like laboratory data and vital signs will also be described by descriptive statistics for each treatment group. Treatment comparisons will be performed by one way ANOVA. In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory will be used. * Criteria Committee, New York Heart Association, Inc.

15,page_15,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 16 3.0 Introduction Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory diseas e with raised, well-demarcated erythematous plaques with adherent silvery scales.2 It is the most prevalent immune mediated skin disease, affecting 2% of the world population.3 Twenty-five percent of patients have moderate to severe disease with considerable negative impact on psychosocial and economic status.4 It is increasingly recognized that psoriasis is more than a superficial disease, with 30% of patients having join t involvement and a high correlation between psoriasis and obesity, diabetes, depression, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk.5 While the majority of psoriasis patients are managed initially with topical therapies, those with severe and/or refractory disease may require phototherapy and/or systemic therapy. Oral systemic agents provide modest efficacy, but increasingly patients are treated with biological agents such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors (etanercept, adalimumab) and the interleukin (IL)-12/23 inhibitor (ustekinumab). 6 While the clinical efficacy of ustekinumab indicates a role for both IL-12 and IL-23 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, 7more recent data suggest that IL-23 is disproportionately involved in the maintenance of chronic psoriasis.7 IL-23 is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of psoriasis via induction and maintenance of Th17 type cells, and other IL-23 responsive cells. This is supported by recent clinical data indicating that monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that block IL-17, the cytokine produced by Th17 cells, have high efficacy in psoriasis. 8 There is still clinical need for increased efficacy as the most effective anti-TNF and IL12/23 agents provide approximately 75% improvement in psoriasis in about 60 – 70% of patients and these responses tend to be lost over time. While the anti-IL-17 agents (i.e., secukinumab) may provide better efficacy, they require monthly injections, thus their long term utility is still undetermined. 8 Risankizumab is a fully humanized mAb of the IgG1 subclass directed towards IL-23p19. The antibody has been engineered to reduce Fc γ receptor and complement binding and potential charge heterogeneity. Risankizumab binds with high affinity to human IL-23"
16,page_16,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 17 and inhibits IL-23 stimulated IL-17 production at inhibitory concentration (IC) 50 concentrations below 10 pM, as compared with 167 nM for ustekinumab in the same system. Risankizumab does not affect IL-12 at a maximum tested concentration (33 nM) and it does not inhibit IL-12 stimulated IFN- γ production. The toxicology data suggest that risankizumab can be safely administered to humans, as supported by chronic administration to monkeys for up to 26 weeks. The monkey was identified as the most relevant toxicology species with no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 50 mg/kg/dose, corresponding to an exposure (combined sex) of 677 μg/mL for the maximal concentration (C max) and 86,250 μg•h/mL for area under the curve (AUC) 0 – 168, respectively. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 risankizumab has been studied in approximately 200 subjects with psoriasis without any unexpected adverse events (AEs) or safety signals. Based on the efficacy and safety findings in the completed and ongoing studies, the risk benefit profile of risankizumab is appropriate for further conduct of Phase 3 studies. In the Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) Study 1311.1, 9a Phase 1 single rising dose study in 39 subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis, both intravenous (i.v.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of risankizumab was well tolerated. Over the 24 weeks following a single i.v. or s.c. administration of risankizumab, 65% (20/31) of subjects experienced an adverse event (AE) compared with 88% (7/8) of subjects r eceiving placebo. There was no relationship between the overall frequency of AEs and treatment groups, or between the occurrence of AEs in specific system organ classes, or individual AEs, and treatment groups. Four serious adverse events (SAE) were reported in subjects receiving risankizumab. All resolved without sequelae and were considered unrelated to study treatment. After a single i.v. administration, risankizumab geometric mean AUCAUC 0-infranged from 2.93 – 1650 day• μg/mL and C maxfrom 0.311 – 110 μg/mL, with exposure increasing in a dose-proportional manner. Group mean clearance and terminal phase volume of distribution were 0.33 L/day and 10.8 L, respectively. Based on all dose groups, the absolute bioavailability of risankizumab after SC administration was estimated to be 73%."

Overall, there was no difference in the AEs across treatment groups and no evidence of a dose effect for any AE. During the 48-week study, 11 subjects (8.7%) on risankizumab reported at least 1 serious adverse event. One subject administered risankizumab (90 mg) experienced an SAE that was considered related to study treatment (basal cell carcinoma). All other SAEs were considered unrelated to study treatment. Treatment with 90 or 180 mg risankizumab resulted in a higher percentage of subjects satisfying and maintaining Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 through Week 48 as compared with ustekinumab and risankizumab 18 mg. 10 Figure 1.

For a more detailed description of the drug profile, refer to the latest version of the investigator's brochure (IB). 9 Fumaric acid esters was approved in Germany as systemic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis in 1995. The commercial product, Fumaderm ®contains a mixture of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and three salts of ethyl hydrogen fumarate. DMF is considered to be the actual active ingredient. 1 Most of the reports on the clinical effects of Fumaderm®on psoriasis are from open label studies that consistently showed that a significant improvement in the condition of the skin is reached over a period of about 3 months of treatment. 1-16 Preliminary results of a recent adequate and well controlled clinical study including a Fumaderm ®arm indicate that PASI 75 and PGA 0 or 1 responses were achieved at Week 16 in 40.3% and 37.4% of the subjects treated with Fumaderm®, whereas 22.3% of the subjects achieved PASI 90 at Week 16.17 Serious adverse events were reported in 2.8% of the subjects and discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 24% of the subjects receiving FUMADERM ®. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were gastrointestinal disorders, including diarrhea (39.9%), upper abdominal pain (22.6%), abdominal pain (15.9%) and nausea (8.5%). Flushing was also commonly reported (16.3%) as well as pruritus (9.9%). Lymphopenia was observed in 10.6% of the subjects and was considered severe in two subjects (0.07%). Erythema, headache and nasopharyngitis were also reported (8.1% each). Proteinuria was reported in 2.1% of the subjects."
19,page_19,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 20 3.1 Differences Statement The present study will only include subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are naïve to systemic therapy, whereas the subjects included in the worldwide risankizumab psoriasis development program may have previously been exposed to biologic or non-biologic systemic treatment for psoriasis. The comparator will be fumaric acid esters, commercialized as FUMADERM ®in Germany whereas the ongoing studies of risankizumab use placebo, ustekinumab or adalimumab as comparators. One further difference between other studies of risankizumab in psoriasis and this study relates to the definition of moderate to severe psoriasis, which, for this study, is defined as PASI > 10, body surface area (BSA) > 10% and dermatology life quality index (DLQI) > 10, this later definition being based on a European consensus decision. 1,18 In other studies of risankizumab, moderate to severe psoriasis is defined as PASI ≥ 12, BSA ≥10% and static physician global assessment (sPGA) ≥ 3. 3.2 Benefits and Risks In Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of risankizumab in patients with psoriasis, the majority of subjects receiving risankizumab achieved 90% improvement of their disease and risankizumab was well tolerated. As with many immune modulating agents, risankizumab may impair immune function resulting in a risk of infection. This will be monitored by collection of all AEs during the treatment and observation periods. Subjects with active infection will not be included in the study.Subjects with a positive QuantiFERON ®-test or a positive Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) skin test for tuberculosis (TB) must fulfill entry criteria as specified in Section 5.2.1 of this protocol. Interleukin-23 inhibiti on is not known to increase the risk of TB infection or impair the response to TB infection in animal models.19,20 Thus, low"
20,page_20,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 21 risk subjects with positive Quantiferon testing do not need to be treated with anti- tuberculosis therapy prior to receiving risankizumab, but should be carefully monitored for any sign of TB reactivation. Absence of TB reactivation, despite not receiving anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis will provide important information in humans as to whether TB testing is required prior to treatment with risankizumab. 21 There is not enough information at this ti me to rule out a risk of cancer with risankizumab, but this risk is considered small with this type of compound as experience with the anti-Il-12/23 mAb ustekinumab has not suggested significant risk for cancer or serious infection. Increases in major adverse cardiovascular (MACE) events including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and cardiovascular death, reported initially with anti-IL-12/23 agents, such as ustekinumab, have not been observed in longer term studies. Although rare, a potential for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is under constant surveillance by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects' safety. In conclusion, the benefit-risk profile of ri sankizumab is considered appropriate for this stage of clinical development.Fumaderm ®is a widely prescribed systemic therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis, although registered for this indication in Germany only, a high proportion of patients treated with FUMADERM®experience a significant improvement in their psoriatic skin disease over a period of about 3 months of treatment.1 The safety profile of FUMADERM®is well characterized. Gastrointestinal complaints (in up to 60% of subjects especially in the initial weeks of therapy) and flush are the most common side effects of fumaric acid esters. Gastrointestinal tract symptoms include diarrhea, increased frequency of stools, nausea, and abdominal cramps. The symptoms of flush are highly variable and range from a brief feeling of warmth to reddening of the face"

Leukocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, and eosinophilia are common side effects of fumaric acid esters. The other adverse events reported in association with FUMADERM ®remain uncommon to very rare: acute lymphocytic leukemia, increase in liver function tests, Fanconi syndrome, opportunistic infection increases including isolated cases of progressive multifocal encephalopathy. There is no known association of FUMADERM ®with malignancy.1,22 There are no studies on the use of fumaric acid esters during pregnancy or in nursing women. Toxicology studies have shown that fumaric acid esters have neither teratogenic nor mutagenic potential. The well codified dosing schedule for FUMADERM ®, based on individual efficacy and safety response and the long experience in clinical practice since its commercialization guarantees an acceptable risk-benefit balance. Pregnancy and breastfeeding as well as severe liver, kidney and gastrointestinal diseases are contraindication to Fumaderm ®. 4.0 Study Objective The objective of this study is to compare th e efficacy and safety of SC risankizumab and oral FUMADERM®provided as study med ication in sub jects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are naïve to and candidates for systemic therapy. 5.0 Investigational Plan 5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label study with blinded assessment of efficacy to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of SC risankizumab in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are naïve to and candidates for systemic therapy as compared with oral FUMADERM ®provided as study medicati on.

The symptoms included are: pain, redness, itching and burning from psoriasis. Current symptom severity is assessed as a daily diary, using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 26,27 The DLQI has been extensively used in clinical studies and has a large evidence base supporting reliability and validity. The DLQI is a self-administered, ten-question questionnaire used to assess the effect of different skin diseases on a subject's quality of life, overall health, and disability status. The questionnaire covers six domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships and treatment and has a one week recall period. 26,27 Each item is scored on a 4 point scale where a 0 score indicates ""not relevant/not at all,"" and scores from 1 to 3 range from ""a little,"" to ""very much."" Question 7 is a ""yes""/""no"" question where ""yes"" is scored as 3. If Question 7 is answered ""no,"" scores range from 0 (""not at all"") to 2 (""a lot""). Medical Outcome Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Version 2 (Acute Form) 28,29 The SF-36 is a widely used and extensively studied instrument to measure health-related quality of life among healthy sub jects and patients with acute and chronic conditions. It consists of eight subscales that can be scored individually: Physical Functioning, Role- Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) also can be computed. The SF-36 has proven useful in monitoring general and specific populations, comparing the relative burden of different disease, differentiating the health benefits produced by different"
45,page_45,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 46 treatments, and in screening individual subjects. The purpose of the SF-36 in this study is to assess the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of subjects. Given the acute nature of this disease, version 2, with a 1-week recall period, will be used in this study. Patient Benefit Index (PBI) 30,31 The PBI is a 25 item PRO instrument that assesses the benefit of psoriasis treatment. Patient relevant treatment needs and benef its are assessed through these 5 subscales: Reducing social impairment, reducing psychosocial impairments, reducing impairments due to therapy, reducing physical impairments, having confidence in healing. Treatment benefit is assessed using the PBI score ranging from 0 (""no benefit"") to 4 (""maximal benefit""). Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale (HADS) 32,33,34 The HADS is a self-assessment scale which detects the presence and severity of anxiety and depression in the general population. It contains 14 items and is comprised of anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items) subscales , which are scored separately and summed to give a total score. Item scores range from 0 (best) to 3 (worst) and total scores are categorized as normal (0 – 7), borderline a bnormal (8 – 10) and abnormal (11 – 21). The HADS has been widely used in clinical trials in a variety of disease areas and has extensive evidence to support its acceptability, reliability and validity. Patient's Global Assessment (PtGA) 35,36 The PtGA is a PRO instrument to assess the patient's assessment of disease severity. This self-reported measure is used to assess disease activity using a 4-point scale where a higher score indicates higher level of disease activity. Disease activity is assessed from 0 (""complete disease cont rol"") to 3 (""uncontrolled disease""). European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) 37 The EQ-5D is a standardized non-disease specific instrument for describing and valuing health-r elated quality of life. 1 The EQ-5D consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care,"
46,page_46,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 47 usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiet y/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problem, slight problem, moderate problem, severe problem or unable to perform activity/extreme problem. It also contains a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Subjects are asked to indicate the level that describes their current level of function or experience for each dimension. As a measure of health status, it provides a descriptive profile and can be used to generate a single index value for health status, where full health is equal to 1 and death is equal to 0. The VAS records the subject's assessment of his/her own health along a vertical 20 cm line, which has health state scores between 0 and 100. FUMADERM ®INITIAL and FUMADERM®Subject Diary Subjects will be dispensed a paper diary at every visit, starting at the Week 0/Baseline visit and will be trained on how to complete the diary for FUMADERM®INITIAL and FUMADERM®(provided as study me dication) dosing by site staff during the Week 0/Baseline visit. All subjects should complete their subject diary on a daily basis throughout the entire study. The diary will be reviewed by site personnel with the subject at each visit and collected at the Week 24/ET Visit. The dosing records will be reviewed and verified for compliance at each visit by the site personnel at the study center and reinforced if necessary. All relevant dosing information will be captured into the eCRF by site personnel. Study Drug Administration Refer to Section 5.5.1 . Monitoring for Hypersensitivity Reactions A hypersensitivity r eaction is a clinical sign or symptom, or constellation of signs or symptoms, caused by an inappropriate and excessive immunologic reaction to study drug administration. A systemic hypersensitivity reaction is a hypersensitivity reaction that does not occur at the local site of study drug administration (e.g., not an injection site reaction). A serious systemic hypersensitivi ty reaction is a systemic hypersensitivity reaction that fulfills criteria for a serious adverse event."

Risankizumab will be administered as a SC injection in the abdomen, thighs, gluteal regions, or upper arms (contra-lateral to that used for pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) samples). The two injections done subsequently should be at least 2 cm apart and should not be close to a vein. The injection sites should avoid sites of psoriasis involvement as well as sites where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated and should be alternated to other areas for subsequent doses. Subjects randomized to FUMADERM ®will receive doses as noted in Table 5 . FUMADERM®dose is increased with the intention of achieving PASI 90, if tolerability allows. The decision of a slow increase in FUMADERM®INITIAL or FUMADERM® dose or of a return to FUMADERM®INITIAL after initiation of FUMADERM®will be made by the investigator and the justificati ons for all deviations from the pre-specified dosing schedule of FUMADERM®will be documented in the eCRF. The maximum daily dose of FUMADERM®may not exceed 6 tablets per day. After the targeted efficacy on the psoriasis cutaneous lesions has been reached, an attempt should be made to reduce the dose of FUMADERM®to the individual maintenance dose. FUMADERM®INITIAL and FUMADERM®tablets must be swallowed without chewing with plenty of liquid during and immediately after meals.

All clinical supplies must be stored and locked in a secure place until they are dispensed for subject use or are returned to AbbVie.Investigational products (IP) are for investigat ional use only and are to be used only within the context of this study. 5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups All subjects will be centrally randomized using an Interactive Voice Response System/Interactive Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS). Before the study is initiated, the telephone number/call-in directions and web based information for the IVRS/IWRS will be provided to each site. All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by the IVRS/IWRS at the Screening Visit. Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 respectively will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two dosing arms at Week 0/Day 1 (Baseline). The IVRS/IWRS will assign a randomizatio n number according to the randomization schedule generated by the Statistics Department at AbbVie. 5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject An IRT will be used to allocate study drug to subjects. At visits where study drug is to be administered/dispensed, study sites will be required to complete the study drug resupply module in the IRT to receive assigned study drug/kit numbers. Risankizumab will be administered at the study site by authorized site personnel (e.g., st udy nurse) after all study procedures have been completed. For subjects randomized to risankizumab, injections will be given in an open label fashion with each subject receiving injections of risankizumab ( mg) at each dosing visit."

The Investigator or designee will verify that study drug supplies are received intact, at the appropriate temperature, (temperature recording devices [e.g., TempTales] are provided in the shipments), and in the correct amounts from the drug depot. This will be documented by signing and dating the proof of receipt (POR) or similar document included with each drug shipment and by registering the arrival of drug through the IRT. The original POR note or similar document and the IRT confirmation sheet will be kept in the site files as a record of what was received. An accurate (running) inventory of study drug will be kept by the site, and will include the kit number, lot number, subject number, Proof of Receipt number(s), the number of pre-filled syringes or FUMADERM ®blisters dispensed, initials of person who dispensed/administered the drug, and the date study drug was administered for each subject. All empty/used study drug packaging and used pre-filled syringes will be inventoried by the site and verified by the site monitor. Each site will use their own sharps disposal container designated to store used pre-filled syringes for this study. Empty/used study drug packaging and sharps containers will be retained (unless prohibited by local law or site policy/procedure) by the site for accountability and compliance purposes. Study drug accountability will be completed via IRT, source documents, subject dosing diaries, and by visually inspecting the packaging and syringes in the sharps container whenever possible. Used sharps containers should never be opened. An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed by the site and verified by an AbbVie monitor throughout the study and at the site close-out visit. After verification of drug accountability, used syringes must be destroyed at the site according to local regulations governing biohazardous waste. Destruction of used study supplies must be"

All unused supplies must be inventoried, accounted for and destroyed on site according to local procedures or regulation or returned to a destruction facility by the CRA. A copy of the Drug Accountability Form , in accordance with instructions provided by the AbbVie monitor, will be included in the return shipments. 5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design This is a parallel group, two arm, open-label study comparing risankizumab with Fumaderm ®with a blinded assessment of efficacy. Although a double-blind study would have been preferable to potentially reduce bias, the logistical difficulties associat ed with blinding Fumaderm ®led to a compromise on an open label-study with a blinded assessment of efficacy. 5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups Fumaderm®is widely used for the treatment of psoriasis and is registered as 1stline treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis in Germany where it has a market share > 50%. Fumaderm®will be familiar to the participating investigators, particularly in Germany where the study will be initiated. Alignment on the protocol Fumaderm®dosing adjustment, which are based on the labelled dosing instructions, is expected to be easy to achieve. In spite of requesting dosing adjustment, Fumaderm ®is suitable for a clinical study, since the labelled dosing recommendations are straightforward based on the routine assessment of efficacy and safety. 5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements The primary efficacy endpoint will be PASI 90 at Week 24, which is in line with the Gemeinsamen Bundesausschusses (G-BA) strong requirement for ""long-term"" data and for a stringent endpoint reflecting a PASI response of at least 75% compared to Baseline. Although PASI 75 has been the primary efficacy variable recommended by the EMA for"
62,page_62,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 63 clinical trials in psoriasis subjects, the recent breakthroughs in this therapeutic field have led to using a more stringent criterion. The secondary efficacy endpoints will evaluate the impact of study treatment on the different facets of the cutaneous disease as well as on multiple aspects of quality of life, which will also address a request from the G-BA. 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population The subject enrolled are adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis PASI score of > 10, affected BSA > 10% and DLQI > 10 who are naïve to and candidates for systemic therapy. Risankizumab will be positioned as first line systemic therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis and the study population corresponds to this target population. The definition of moderate to severe psoriasis is derived from the European guideline 1and differs from that used in risankizumab pivotal studies [PASI ≥ 12, BSA ≥ 10% and sPGA ≥ 3]. The selection criteria relating to safety guarantee that the subjects enrolled can safely be treated with both study drugs, risankizumab and Fumaderm ®, based on the current knowledge on those drugs. 5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study Risankizumab is currently in Phase 3 development for treatment of subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Four Phase 3 studies are currently ongoing, which have enrolled approximately 2100 subjects, and evaluating risankizumab dose of 150 mg administered at Week 0, 4 and thereaf ter every 12 weeks. The risankizumab dosing regimen selected for the current study is the same as used in the ongoing risankizumab Phase 3 studies. The Fumaderm ®dosing recommendations are taken from the Fumaderm®label, with the caveat that the dose will be increased until PASI 90 is achieved, if tolerance allows."

An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event. Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is b eing performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event. 6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie a serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event. Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject."

This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or af ter birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle). Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or c onvulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

The safety population consists of all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. In order to evaluate the impact of major protocol deviations on the results of the trial, additional sensitivity analyses may be performed on the per-protocol population, which excludes subjects with major protocol deviations from the ITT population. If it is decided that this analysis should be performed, the criteria for exclusion of subjects from the protocol analysis will be fully defined and documented in the final SAP and before the database lock. 8.1.2 Planned Methods of Statistical Analysis All statist ical tests will be two-tailed. The statistical tests for the primary endpoint will be performed at the significance level 0.05. All Pvalues will be rounded to 3 decimal places. Descriptive s tatistics will be provided. These include the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, quartiles and maximum for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for discrete variables.

Missing data will be imputed using non-responder imputation, i.e., a subject with missing PASI90 at Week 24 will be considered a non-responder in the primary analysis. Further sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint may be specified in the SAP prior to database lock. For the analysis of categorical secondary endpoints, the same statistical test as for the primary endpoint will be performed, missing data will be imputed using non-responder imputation. For the analysis of continuous secondary endpoints, two-sided two-way ANOVA with treatment a nd prior phototherapy as factors will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF). The order of the secondary endpoints does not reflect a ranking and secondary endpoints will not be used for confirmatory interpretation, thus no adjustment for multiplicity will be done.

Recommendations on the Technique of Blood Pressure Measurement Proper techniques to measure blood pressure are important to ensure consistent and reliable measurements. The purpose of the recommendations below is to screen in routine practice the patients that will require explorations in a specialized department. 40 1. If anatomical conditions, deformity or surgical history interfering with proper access or blood flow to the upper arm, use the opposite arm for the blood pressure measurement 2. Use a high quality and well calibrated equipment 3. Prepare the patient ●The examination room should be quiet, with a comfortable ambient temperature. ●Ideally, blood pressure should not be meas ured if the patient has engaged in recent physical activity, used tobacco, ingested caffeine, or eaten within the past 30 minutes ●Correct positioning of the patient is essential. ○The patient's back and legs should be supported, with the legs uncrossed and the feet resting on a firm surface. ○The arm in which blood pressure will be measured should be bare to the shoulder, and the garment sleeve, if rais ed, should be loose, so that it does not interfere with blood flow or with proper positioning of the blood- pressure cuff. ○The arm should be supported and level with the heart. The manometer should be positioned at the health care practitioner's eye level. 4. Make sure that you are using the properly fitted cuff (undersized cuffs will result in overestimation of blood pressure) ●Selection of an appropriately sized cuff requires assessment of the patient's arm circumference at the midpoint of the upper arm."
97,page_97,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 98 5. Place the cuff on a bare arm, approximately 2 cm above the elbow crease, with the midline of the bladder (usually indicated by the manufacturer) directly over the brachial artery. It should fit snugly but should still allow for two fingers to slide under the cuff. 6. Estimate the systolic blood pressure by first measuring pulse-obliteration pressure 7. For blood pressure measurement, proceed as follows: ●Place the bell of the stethoscope over the brachial artery, using sufficient pressure to provide good sound transmission without over-compressing the artery. To avoid extraneous noise during cuff deflation, ensure that the stethoscope is not in contact with the patient's clothing or with the blood- pressure cuff. ●Initiate the auscultatory blood pressure measurement by rapidly inflating the cuff to a level 20 to 30 mmHg above the pulse-obliteration pressure. ●Then deflate the cuff at a rate of 2 mmHg per second while listening for the Korotkoff sounds. As the cuff is deflated, turbulent blood flow through the brachial artery generates a series of sounds. Classically, these have been described according to five phases. ○Phase 1 is characterized by a clear, repetitive tapping sound, coinciding with reappearance of a palpable pulse. The initial appearance of Phase 1 sounds is equal to the systolic blood pressure. ○During Phase 2, audible murmurs in the tapping sounds are heard. ○In Phases 3 and 4, muted changes in the tapping sounds occur (usually within 10 mmHg of the true diastolic pressure) as the pressure measurement approaches the diastolic pressure. ○Phase 5 is not really a sound; it i ndicates the disappearance of sounds and equates to the diastolic blood pressure. To ensure that diastole has been reached, continue to deflate the cuff pressure for an additional 10 mmHg beyond the fifth Korotkoff sound."

PASI SCORE Definitions and Use Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) The PASI score is an established measure of clinical efficacy for psoriasis medications.24 The PASI is a tool which provides a numeric sc oring for subjects overall psoriasis disease state, ranging from 0 to 72. It is a linear co mbination of percent of surface area of skin that is affected and the severity of eryt hema, infiltration, and desquamation over four body regions. The endpoints used are based on the percent reduction from baseline, generally summarized as a dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an X% reduction (or PASI X), where X is 50, 75, 90 and 100. To calculate the PASI score, the four main body areas are assessed: head (h), trunk (t), upper extremities (u) and lower extremities (l). These correspond to 10, 30, 20 and 40% of the total body area respectively.The area affected by psoriasis within a these four areas site is estimated as a percentage of the total area of that anatomic site and assigned a numerical value according to the degree of psoriatic involvement as follows: ●0 = no involvement ●1 = < 10% ●2 = 10% to 29% ●3 = 30% to 49% ●4 = 50% to 69% ●5 = 70% to 89% ●6 = 90% to 100% The signs of severity, erythema (E), infiltration (I) and desquamation (D) of lesions are assessed using a numeric scale 0 – 4 where 0 is a complete lack of cutaneous involvement and 4 is the severest possible involvement; scores are made independently"

102,page_102,"Risankizumab M16-178 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-003718-28 103 The PASI score for each body region is obtained by multiplying the sum of the severity scores by the area score, then multiplying the result by the constant weighted value assigned to that body region. Since the head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities correspond to approximately 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of BSA, respectively, the PASI score is calculated using the formula. The PASI score is calculated according to the following formula:PASI = 0.1(E h+Ih+D h)Ah+ 0.3(E t+It+D t)At+ 0.2(E u+Iu+D u)Au+ 0.4(E l+Il+D l)Al where E, I, D, and A denote erythema, induration, desquamation, and area, respectively, and h, u, t , and ldenote head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, respectively.
