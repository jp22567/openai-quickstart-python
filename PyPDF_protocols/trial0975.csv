In the first -line setting in advanced gastric cancer, plat inum/fluoropy rimidine regimens form the backbone of chemotherapy .Meanwhile ,in the second -line setting, there has been no standard regimen established for gas tric cancer to date. The high incidence and mortality of gastric cancerand relatively limitedchemotherapeutic options after first-line therapy underpin the need for research in second-line therapeutic options. One promising approach to the treatment of cancer is inhibit ion of angiogenesis bytargeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway . Ramucirumab (IMC -1121B, LY3009806) is a recombinant human monoclonal ant ibody that specifically binds to the extracellular domain of VEGFReceptor 2 (VEGFR-2) with high affinit y as demonstrated in animal models. APhase 3global study (I4T-IE-JVBD[JVBD])demonstrated that ramucirumab monotherapy plus best supportive care (BSC) following disease progression on init ialtherapy coul d improve overall survival (OS; median 5.2months versus3.8months, hazard ratio [ HR] =0.776, 95%confidence interval [CI] =0.603to 0.998, p=.0473) and progressio n-free survival (PFS; median 2.1months versus1.3 months, HR=0.483, 95% CI =0.376to 0.620, p<.0001)as compared with placebo plus BSC in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcino ma. Furthermore,preclinical and clinical data have shown that the addition o f agents targeting the VEGF pathway can improve the efficacy of chemotherapy,providing a rationale to invest igate the efficacy and safet y of adding ram ucirumab to a commonly used second-line chemotherapeutic drug such as paclitaxel in advanced gastric cancer.Accordingly, another Phase 3 globalstudy (I4T-IE-JVBE[JVBE])was design ed to dem onstrate the superiorit y of ramucirumabplus paclitaxelcomparing with placeboplus paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcino ma after failure offirst-line therapy with platinum and fluoropyrimidine.Study JVBEdemonstrated that ramucirumab plus paclitaxel as a combination therapy for patients improve sOS (median 9.6months versus7.4months, HR= 0.807, 95%CI= 0.678to 0.962, p=.0169)and PFS (median 4.4months versus2.9months, HR= 0.635, 95% CI= 0.536to 0.752, p<.0001 )as compared with paclitaxelmonotherapy.Based on the results of these 2 Phase 3 studies, ramucirumab was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administrati onas a single agent,as well as in combinat ion withpaclitaxel,for the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, with disease progression on or after prior fluoropyrimidine-or platinum-containing chemotherapy . To further confirm the results ofStudy JVBEina predominant ly East Asian population, this multicenter randomized study is designed to evaluatethe efficacy and safet y ofpaclitaxel plus ramucirumabversuspaclitaxel plus placebo inpatients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcino ma, refractory to or progressive after first -line therapy wit h platinum and fluoropyrimidine."

Objectives: The co-primary objective of this study is to evaluate PFS and OSin patients treated with paclitaxel plus ramucirumab (IMC 1121B) versus paclitaxel plus placebo as second -line treatment in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma after failure of any platinumand fluoropyrimidine doublet with or without anthracycline (epirubicin or doxorubicin). The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate : Time to progression Objective response rate Duration of objective response Safety profile Patient-reported outcome measures In addition, exploratory objectives include: To explore biomarkers relevant to gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma or safety, efficacy, and mechanism of action of ramucirumab. Study Design: This is a multicenter, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel plus ramucirumab using a double -blind, placebo -controlled design. Approximately 450patients will be randomized on a 2:1 ratioto receive either Arm A (paclitaxel plus ramucirumab) or Arm B (paclitaxel plus placebo) to observe at least 336deaths. Randomization will be stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOGPS)(0 versus 1)and peritoneal metas tases (yes versusno). Patients will continue to receive all treatments until there is radiographic or symptomatic progression of disease, toxicity requiring cessation, protocol noncompliance, or withdrawal of consent. Patients will undergo radiographic assessment of disease status according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST ), Version1.1, every 6 weeks (±5days),following the first dose of study therapy for the first 6 months and every 9weeks (±5days) thereafter, until documentation of radiographic progressive disease (PD). During postdiscontinuation follow -up, allpatients will be followed for survival at regularly scheduled intervals (every 8 weeks [+0to 7 days]) for as long as the patient is alive, or until the study completion. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Male and female patients (age ≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced gastric or GEJadenocarcinoma who have received at least 1 cycle of therapy with any platinum and fluoropyrimidine as first -line treatment of their gastric adenocarcinoma, and who have experienced documented disease progression during first -line therapy, or within 4 months after the last dose of first -line therapy prior to study entry, wil l be randomized and treated at the investigational centers. Test Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration: Ramucirumab drug product (DP), injection for intravenous (IV) use, supplied in sterile ,preservative -free, single-use vials containing 500 mg/50-mL product, at a final concentration of 10 mg/mL in a histidine -buffered formulation, administered as an IV infusion at a dose of 8 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 of a 4-week cycle . The infusion should be delivered over approximately 60 minutes. The infusi on rate should not exceed 25 mg/minute."
4,page_4,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 4 LY3009806Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Ramucirumab DP placebo injection for IV use, supplied in single -use 50-mL vials containing histidine buffer only. Because investigators and ancillary medical personnel will be blinded as to assignment to active therapy versus placebo, the volume of placebo to be administered w ill be calculated as if it were active product formulated at 10 mg/mL (at a volume equivalent to a dose of 8 mg/kg) on Days 1 and 15 of a 4 -week cycle. Paclitaxel , administered over approximately 60 minutes according to manufacturer standards, at a dose of 80mg/m2on Days 1, 8,and 15 of a 4 -week cycle. Note: Premedication is required prior to infusion of paclitaxel according to the manufacturer’s instructions and local standards . Premedication mayconsist of dexamethasone 20 mg orallyadministered approximately 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel , and cimetidine 300 mg or ranitidine 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes before paclitaxel . An antiemetic (such as ondansetron 8 mg IVor equivalent) administered 30 to 120 minutes before paclitaxel is recommended. Planned Duration of Treatment: Study treatment period : Atreatment cycle will be defined as 28 days (4 weeks) in each arm and include the period of treatment with paclitaxel gi ven on Days 1, 8, and 15, in combina tion with either ramucirumab or ramucirumab placebo given on Days 1 and 15. The period during which no treatment will be administered is required for patients to recover from toxicities to the National Cancer Institute Common Termin ology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE),Version 4.03 Grade <2 or baseline (with the exception of alopecia), and is expected to last for 14 days. Patients will continue to receive all treatments until there is radiographic or symptomatic progression of disease, toxicity requiring cessation, protocol noncompliance, or withdrawal of consent. Short-term follow -up period (postdiscontinuation) : Approximately 30 days (no more than 37 days ). Long-term follow -up period (postdiscontinuation) : After the decision is made to discontinue study treatment , follow-up informatio n regarding further anticancer treatment and survival status will be collected at least every 8weeks (+0 to 7 days). For patients who discontinue treat ment for any reason other than radiographically documented PD ( for example, symptomatic deterioration), information on disease progression (radiographic assessment) will also be collected until PD is documented by imaging. Follow -up will continue as long as the patient is alive, or until study completion , whichever is first ."
5,page_5,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 5 LY3009806Criteria for Evaluation: Efficacy: Progression -free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization tothe date of the first radiographically documented PD as defined by RECIST, Version1.1, or death due to any cause , whichever is first. Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Time to progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first radiographic ally documented PDas defined by RECIST, Version1.1. Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of randomized patients achieving a best overall responseof partial response (PR) or complete response (CR). Duration of objective response is measured from the time measurement criteria first met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) to the date of the first radiographic allydocumented PD as defined by RECIST,Version1.1, or death due to any cause , whichever is first. Assessment for response, according to RECIST, Version1.1, will be performed every 6 weeks (± 5days) following the first dose of study therapy for the first 6 months , and every 9 weeks (±5 days) thereafter ,until documentation of radiographic PD. Safety: Safety will be evaluated based on reported adverse events ( AEs), clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs ,and physical examinations. Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Clinical laboratory toxicity and AEs will be graded using the NCI -CTCAE,Version4.03. Health Outcomes: The assessment of quality of life and health status will be conducted us ingthe European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 ( QLQ-C30),and EuroQol-5 Dimension -3Level (EQ-5D-3L), respectively . Translational Research: Whole blood samples maybe used for DNA/genotype analysis and may include an examination of genes associated with angiogenesis, the mechanism of ramucirumab, and/or cancer , including but not limited to, VEGFR-2 andVEGF-A. Plasmasamples maybe analyzed for potential pharmacodynamic markers, including, but not necessarily limited to, placental growth factor, VEGF -A,VEGF-C,VEGF-D, soluble VEGFR -1, and soluble VEGFR-2.In addition, collection of tumor tissue samples will be strongly recommended for potential evaluation of tumor-specific mutations, VEGFR-2 expression, VEGFR -2 copy number variabi lity, and other cancer- associated biomarkers."
6,page_6,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 6 LY3009806Statistical Methods: Statistical : Approximately 450patients will be randomized to the 2treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio ( 300patients in Arm A [paclitaxel plus ramucirumab] and 150patients in Arm B [paclitaxel plus placebo]) in order to obtain at least 336 deaths. Assuming an exponential distribution in each arm and a true underlying HR of 0.81 as observed in the global study, 336 deaths will provide at least 80% probability to assurethatthe effect size observed in this study is consistent withthe global study . Also assuming a constant accrual rate of 12patients/month, a median OS of 10.5 months in Arm B and a median OS of 13 months in Arm A, the study will take approximately 44months to obtain the required 336deaths(37months for accrual and 7months for the follow -up).The primary PFS analysis and an interim OS analysis will be performed when at least 256PFS events have occurred. Efficacy: The analysis of PFS/OSin this study is to estimate the HR and its 2 -sided 95%CIs in a stratified Cox’s proportional hazards model using treatment arm as a single covariate. The stratification factor sincluded in the Cox model areECOG PS (0 versus 1)and peritoneal metastase s (yes versus no) . A sensitivity analysis with an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model will be employed. Stratified (using the same stratification factor) and unstratified log -rank tests will also be conducted. The survival curves for each random ized arm will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method. Two -sided, 95% CIs for median PFS/OSwill be computed by the Brookmeyer and Crowley method. Landmark s urvival rates will also be estimated using KM estimates on the survivalcurve for each randomized arm. Associated 2-sided 95% CIs will also be calculated. Safety: Safety analyses will be performed on all randomized patients who receive at least 1dose of study treatment. Safety analyses will include summaries of the incid ence of AEs by maximum CTCAE grade ( Version4.03) that occur during the study treatment period or within 30 days after the decision is made to discontinue study treatment. Health Outcomes: QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-3Lanalyses will be performed on all randomized patients with 1 baseline assessment and ≥1 postbaseline assessment. They will be analyzed descriptively by treatment arm. Translational Research: Translational research will be performed to analyze relevant biomarkers and their correlation to clinical outcomes."

The National Central Cancer Registry reportedthat there were 420,489new cases and 297,496 deaths in 2011 (Chen et al. 2015).Because of its significant mortalit y rates and poor prognosis, new treatm ents are urgently required. In the past decade, cy totoxic chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for gastric cancer. In the first -line setting in advanced gastric cancer, plat inum/fluoropy rimidine regimens form the backbone of chemotherapy . Triplet regimens ,such as addi ng an anthracycline or taxane,result in better outcomes. However, triplet regimens are reserved only for selected patients due to toxi city. Meanwhile ,in the second -line setting, there has been no standard regimen established for gastric cancer to date. Several Phase3trials have demonstrated that monotherapi es in second- line, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel ,and irinotecan, are superior to best supportive care (BSC),resulting in longer survival (Thuss -Patience et al . 2011;Kanget al. 2012; Hironakaet al. 2013; Ford et al . 2014).Weekly administration of paclitaxel (at a dose of 80 mg/m2) has becom e a commo n practice for second- line treatment in gastric cancer. However, only marginal improvements in patient outcomes have been achieved. Theprogress of targeted therapy in gastric cancer has been slow as compared wit h other commoncancers,such asbreast, colorectal, and lung cancers . With the results of ToGA trial, trastuzumab in combinat ion with chemotherapyhas demonstrate da survival ben efitas first-line therapy in human epidermal growth factor 2 positive gastric cancerpatients(Bang et al . 2010). Many other molecular targeted agents are still undergoing clinical trials. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)is expressed in gastric can cer, and it has been associated with more aggressive clinical disease (Feng et al. 2002). Previous studies showed that VEGF inhibition was effect ive in inhibiting gastric cancer growth ( Jung et al. 2002). The AVAGAST trial, designed to evaluate the efficacyand safetyof adding bevacizumab to fluoropyrimidine-cisplatin in the first -line treatment of advanced gastric cancer, was the first Phase3evaluation of an ant iangiogenic agent with chemotherapy in advanced gastri c cancer. However, this trial d id not reach its primary objective ;the median overall survival ( OS)was 12.1months with bevacizumab plus fluoropy rimidine-cisplatin and 10.1 months with placebo plus fluoropy rimidine-cisplatin (hazard ratio [HR]= 0.87; 95% confidence interval [ CI]= 0.73 to"
20,page_20,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 20 LY30098061.03; p=.1002)(Ohtsu et al . 2011).Regional analysis indicated that patients enrolled in North America and Lat in America appeared to have a survival benefit wit h the addit ion of bevacizumab, whereaspatients enrolled in Asia (90% from Japan and Korea) appeared to have no benefit. In Chinese p atients withadvanced gastri c cancer, the results from the AVATAR trial also have demonstrated that bevacizumab plus capecitabine and cisplat in didnot significantly improve outcomes (Shenet al. 2015).Theseresults necessitate further invest igation of agents targeting the VEGF pathway in gastric cancerby refining the sele ction of the patient population. Ramucirumab (IMC -1121B,LY3009806 ) is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G, subclass 1 (IgG1)receptor-targetedmonoclonalantibody (mAb) that specifically binds to the extracellular domain of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2(VEGFR-2)with high affinit y. Preclinical studies showed that the mouse antibody counterpart of ramucirumab (DC101) therapy is associated with significant reductions in tumor vascularit y (asmeasured by cluster of differentiation 31 expressi on) and increase in endothelial and tum or apoptosi s, resulting in reduced tumor growth in gastric cancer xenografts (Jung et al. 2002) .DC101 has conferred enhanced antitumor effect when co mbinedwith cytotoxic agents, such aspaclitaxel in murine modelsof human prostate and bladder cancers (Inoue et al. 2000;Sweeney et al. 2002). A Phase 1 clinical study (I4T-IE-JVBM[JVBM]) has demonstrated that ram ucirumab m onotherapy, administered at doses ranging from 2 to 16mg/kg every week in patients wi th advanced cancer, achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 10.8% and a disease control rate (DCR) of 64.9% (Spratlin et al . 2010). In particular, 1 pat ient with gastric cancer had confi rmed partial response (PR) lasting 103weeks. In a Phase 3 globalstudy (I4T-IE-JVBD[JVBD]) in patientswith advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma , ramucirumab as a single agent plus BSC versusplacebo pl usBSC, reduced the risk of death by 22% (HR = 0.776; 95% CI =0.603to0.998; p=.0473), result ing in a 37% longer median survival in the ramucirumab arm (5.2 months versus 3.8months, a difference o f 1.4 months). Progression -free survival (PFS) was largely improved as well(median 2.1months versus1.3 months, HR=0.483;95% CI=0.376to0.620;p<.0001). Additionally, ramucirumab was well tolerated in this pat ient population, as demonstrated by similar rates between the ramucirumab and placebo arms for most adverse events ( AEs).The most frequentAEsof Grade ≥3 were: hypertensio n (7.6% ramucirumab ,2.6% placebo);fatigue (6.4% ramucirumab, 10.0%placebo); anemia (6.4% ramucirumab ,7.8%placebo);abdominal pain (5.9% ramucirumab ,2.6% placebo) ;decreased appeti te (3.4% ram ucirumab,3.5% placebo);and bleeding/haemorrhage (3.4%ramucirumab ,2.6% placebo) (Fuchs et al. 2014). Furthermore, the possibilit y of combining ramucirumab with an act ive chemotherapeut ic drug was also explored. Preclinical and clinical data have shown that the addit ion of agents targeting the VEGF pathway can improve the efficacy of taxaneregimens ( Enzinger et al. 2006; Shah et al . 2011). A Phase 1b study (I4T-IE-JVBW[JVBW]) investigating weekly paclitaxel wit h ramucirumab in 6 Japanese pati ents with advanced gastri c adenocarcino mas demo nstrated that the combination was safe and well -tolerated. There were no dose-limiting toxicit iesin this study.The DCRand the ORRwere100% and 16.7% ,respectively ( Ueda et al. 2015). The Phase 3 global study(I4T-IE-JVBE[JVBE])was designed to demonstrate efficacy in pat ients treated with paclitaxel plus ramucirumab compared to patients treated with paclitaxel plus"

Besides second -linetreatment, there is another ongoingPhase 3 study (I4T-MC-JVCU[JVCU]) investigat ing efficacy and safety ofcapecitabine(or 5-fluorouracil )and cisplatinwith or without ramucirumab in the fi rst-line setting of metastatic gastric orGEJadenocarcino ma. To investigate the same co mbination regimen in a predominant ly East Asian populat ion,this confirmatory studyis specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy andsafety of ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel in pat ientswith advanced gastri c or GEJadenocarcino ma that have failed standard therapy with platinum andfluoropyrimidines.

Continua tion of Therapy On -Study in the Setting of Discontinuation of One Component of Therapy If 1therapeutic agent is perm anently discont inued secondary to toxicit y, then therapy with the other study agents shoul d continue and the patient should remain on -studywith full adherence to all protocol related requirements. Patients who have paclitaxel discont inued may co ntinue to receive ramucirumab /placebo on -study, provided they cont inue to meet entry criteria and do not have evidence of disease progression. Pati ents who have ramucirumab/placebo discont inued (that is,in the setting of Grade 4 hypertensio n or proteinuria) may receive ongo ing paclitaxel therapy on-study, provided they continue to meet entry criteria and do not have evidence of disease progressi on.

All patients will be fo llowed until resolution or stabilizat ion of any SAE or study -related toxi city. If the reason for wi thdrawal from the trial is the death of the patient, the 2options for categorizing wit hdrawal are either progressive disease (PD) or an AE (>1AE may be documented as a reason for withdrawal). Only 1event will be recognized as the cause of death. If a patient is discontinued from all study therapy: The reasons for discont inuation should be docum ented in the patient’s medical record and electronic case report form ( eCRF). For patients who discont inue for reasons other than radiographic PD , radiographic assessment for tumor response should cont inue every 6 weeks (±5days)following the first dose of study therapy for the first 6 months, and every 9 weeks (± 5days) thereafter, until documentation of radiographic PD ."

During the extension period, patients on study therapy who cont inue to experience clinical benefit may continue to receive study therapy until one of the criteria for discont inuation is met. Crossover may be permitted to the control arm. The extensio nperiod includes extensio n period follow-up. oExtension Period Follow-Up: begins 1day after the pati ent and the invest igator agree that the patient will no longer continue treatment in the extensio n period and lasts approximately 30days(no more than 37 days). Baseline radiographic assessment of disease will be performed within 21 days prior to randomization; first treatment will be administered within 7 days following rando mization. Patients in both arms will receive any necessary premedication (see Section 9.1.1) prior to the first infusion of study therapy at each treatm ent session.

All AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of study treatment until 30 days after the decision is made to di scontinue study treatmentmust be reported to the Sponsor or its designee via eC RF.The short -term follow-up begins the day after the decision is made to discontinue study treatment and lasts approximately 30 days(no more than 37 day s): Physical examinat ion with weight measurement Vital signs ECOG PS evaluat ion Toxicity/AE assessment Serum or urine pregnancy test for WOCBP Hematology Full serum chemistry profile Coagulation profile Electrocardiogram Echocardi ogram/MUGA Urinalysis Concomitant medicat ion assessment Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) All SAEs and AEs considered at least possibly -related to study therapy will be foll owed until resolved, stabilized, returned to baseline, or deemed irreversible. For patients who discontinuetreatment for reasons other than radiographic PD, imaging studies with tumor measurements/di sease response assessments will cont inue to be performed every 6weeks (±5days) following the first dose of study therapy for the first 6months, and every 9weeks (±5days) thereafter, until documentation of radiographic PD. If it is deemed to be in the best interest of the patient to start a new ant i-cancer treatment prior to the scheduled end of the short -term follow-up visit, the follow-up visit duration may be shortened. In this case, the short -term follow-up assessments should be completed pri or to the initiation of the new therapy. 8.1.2.2. Long-TermFollow-Up Patients will be contacted at least every 8 weeks (+0 to 7 days) to obtain inform ation about survival status and detailed information on any subsequent sy stemic ant icancer therapy and disease progressi on (for patients not having a radiographic progression).

Serious adverse events will also be reported on the CRF and to Lilly Glo bal Patient Safety (GPS; see Section 10.3.1). In the event that an SAE occurs, Lilly may request addit ional information (such as local laboratory results, concomi tant medications, and hospitalizations) in order to evaluate the reported SAE. Drug administration informat ion Reason for study therapy discontinuation During the extensio n period, routine safet y and efficacy mo nitoring, including radiographic evaluation of disease and laboratory testing, such as pregnancy testing, should be continued as necessary , and docum entation retained wi thin the source files, to co nfirm patient eligibility to continue on treatment or the 30 -day short-term follow-up visit. Investigators will perform any other standard procedures and tests needed to treat and evaluate patients; however, the choice and timing of the tests will be at t he investigator’s discretion. Lilly will not routinely co llect the results of these assessments. 8.2.Discussion of Design and Control This study will be conducted since the prognosis for patients with advanced gastric canceris generally poor, and there is a great unmet medical need for novel treatments . Paclitaxel has been extensively studied as second -line chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer patients, usinga schedule consist ing of 80 mg/m2administered once a week for 3 weeks fo llowed by a 1-week rest period(Hironaka et al . 2006; Koderaet al. 2007) . This treatment, with the addition of placebo, will act as the control arm of this study . The study arm will add ramucirumab (8 mg/kg IVon Days 1 and 15 of every 28-day cycle) to weekly paclitaxel, with the objective of evaluatingthe efficacy and safet y of ramucirumab plus weekly paclitaxel as second -line therapy among patients with advanced gastric cancer . This ramucirumab dose is the same as that used in the globalPhase 3StudyJVBE. Investigational treatm ent administrati on in this study is double-blind; that is, patients, investigat ional sites, and the sponsor study team do not have immediate access to treatment assignments for any patients. Randomizat ion in this study will be stratified by ECOG PS(0 versus1)and peritoneal metastases ( yes versus no). Both factors were independent prognostic factors for OS in global Studies JVBD and JVBE."

On Days1 and 15 of each cycle, followi ng premedication, ramucirumab/placebo will be administered over approximately 60 minutes. Administration will be fo llowed by a 1 -hour observation period, and subsequent ly by administration of paclitaxel over approximately 60 minutes. The 1- hour observat ion period between administration of ramucirumab /placebo and paclitaxel is mandatory for thefirst 2cycles, but may be omitted in Cycle 3 and beyo nd, provided there has been no evidence of IRR. Any measurements used to determine dos e should be taken at each cy cle, and d ose should be recalculated for each cy cle. The invest igator or his or her designee is responsible for the following: Explaining the correct use of the drug(s) and planned duration of each individual’s treatment to the si te personnel Verifying that protocol instructions are fo llowed properly Maintaining accurate records of study drug storage, dispensing, and co llection Returning all unused medicat ion, if not al ready destroyed by the site, to Lillyor its designee at the end of the study . Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if they have a co mplaint or problem with the study drug so that the situation can be assessed. 9.1.1.Premedication Premedicat ion is recommended pri or to infusi on of ramucirumab DP or placebo. Recommended premedicat ion agents include histamine H1 antagonists such as diphenhydramine hydrochl oride (or equivalent). Addi tional premedicati on may be provided at investi gator discreti on. Premedication must be provided in t he setting of a pri or Grade 1 to 2 IRR, as detailed in Secti on9.4.2.1.1. Allpremedicati on administered must be adequately documented in pat ient’s source charts and on the eCRF. Premedication is required prior to infusio n of paclitaxel according to the manufacturer’s instructions and local standards . Premedication mayconsist of dexamethasone 20 mg orally administered approximately 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel,diphenhydramine (or its"
42,page_42,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 42 LY3009806equivalent) 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel , andcimetidine 300 mg or ranitidine 50 mg IV(or equivalent )30 to 60 minutes before paclitaxel . An antiemetic (such as ondansetron 8 mg IVor equivalent) administered 30 to 120 minutes before paclit axel is recommended. When ramucirumab /placeboand paclitaxel are administered subsequent ly on the same day ( that is,Days 1 and 15 of each cycle) ,it is sufficient to administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride and dexamethasone only once, prior to administratio n of ramucirumab /placebo. 9.1.2.Ramucirumab D rug Productor Placebo Aseptic technique is to be used when preparing and handling ramucirumab or placebo. Patients will receive ramucirumab or placebo by IVinfusion over approximately 60 minutes at 8 m g/kg on Days 1 and 15 of every 28 daysin the absence of dis ease progression or other withdrawal criteria. Patients will receive ramucirumab/placebo via IVinfusion over approximately 60 minutes. The infusion rate should not exceed 25 mg/minute. In the event that the infusio n time takes longer than 60 minutes (b ased on the patient’s body weight), the infusio n time should be accurately recorded on the eCRF. The first dose of ramucirumab (or placebo) is dependent upon the patient’s screening/baseline body weight in kil ograms. Subsequent doses of ramucirumab (or placebo) must be recal culated if there is a ≥10% change (increase or decrease) in body weight from the time of the most recent dose calculat ion; subsequent doses may be recalculated if there is a <10% change (increase or decrease) in body weight from the time of the most recent dose calculation. For pati ents undergoing repeated palliative drainage procedures to remove pleural or peritoneal fluid, dry weight will be defined as weight obtained after the drainage procedure and before fluid reaccumulat ion. Insuch circumstances, dry weight will be used for dose calculation, if obtained wit hin 30 days prior to dose. If no recent dry weight is available, actual weight will be used. Ramucirumab is com patible with co mmon infusion containers. The use of a low protein binding 0.22 micron in –line filter is recommended .Based on the calculated volume of ramucirumab, add (or remove from pre-filled [with 0.9% normal saline] IV infusion container) a sufficient quant ity of sterile normal saline (0.9% weight/vo lume) to the container to make the total vo lume 250 mL. For dose volumes greater than 250 mL, the addit ion of sterile normal saline is not required. Do not use dextrose -containing solut ions. The container should be gent ly inverted to ensure adequate mixing. The infusio n should be delivered in approximately 60 minutes. The infusion rate shoul d not exceed 25 mg/minute. Infusions of duration longer than 60 minutes are permitted in specific circumstances (that is, for larger patients in order to maintain an infu sion rate that does not exceed 25 mg/minute, or in the setting of prior ramucirumab IRR); the infusion durat ion must always be accurately recorded. The infusio n set must be flushed post infusio n with sterile 0.9% normal saline equal to or greater than inf usion set hold-up volume to ensure delivery of the calculated dose.

Aseptic technique is to be used when preparing and handling pacl itaxel. Pati ents will receive paclitaxel by IVinfusion over approximately 60 minutes at 80 mg/m2on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle. The first dose of paclitaxel is dependent upon the patient’s baseline body surface area. Subsequent doses of pac litaxel must be recal culated if there is a ≥10% change (increase or decrease) in body surface area fro m baseline; subsequent doses may be recalculated if there is a <10% change (increase or decrease) in body surface area from baseline. Paclitaxel must be d iluted prior to infusio n. When reconstituting paclitaxel, please fo llow the current local product l abeling instructions. Paclitaxel should be diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) injection, United States Pharmacopeia (USP)or local equivalent; 5% dextrose injection, USP or local equivalent; 5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride inject ion, USP or local equivalent; or 5% dextrose in Ringer’s injection, to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 mg/mL. The solut ions are physically and chemically stable for up to 27 hours at ambient temperature (approximately 25°C) and room lighting condit ions. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solut ion and container permit. Upon preparation, solut ions may show haziness, which is attributed to the formulat ion vehicle. No significant losses in potency have been noted following simulated delivery to the sol ution through IVtubing containing an in -line (0.22 micron) filter. Data collected for the presence of the extractable plasticizer di -[2-ethyl-hexyl] phthalate show that levels increase wit h time and concentration when dilut ions are prepared in polyvinyl chloride(PVC)containers. Consequent ly, the use of plasticized PVC containers and administration sets is not recommended. Paclitaxel so lutions should be prepared and stored in glass, polypropylene, or poly olefin containers. Non -PVC containing administration sets, such as those which are polyethylene -lined, should be used. 9.2.Materials and Supplies 9.2.1.Ramucirumab D rug Product Ramucirumab DP i s a sterile, preservat ive-free solution for infusio n formulated in hist idine buffer at a ramucirumab drug substance concentratio n of 10 mg/mL (500 mg/50 -mL vial).

The IWRS registration consists of assigning the patient a unique study identification number and rando mizing the patient to 1 of the 2 treatment arms. Once the patient is registered through the IWRS, he/she is considered to be enro lled in the study . Randomization will be stratified by ECOG PS (0 versus1)and peritoneal metastases ( yes versus no). To balance the treatment allocat ion among the stratification factors, a stratified permuted block rando mization will be ut ilized and incorporated into the IWRS. 9.4.Selection and Timing of Doses Patients will receive eit her paclitaxel plus ramucirumabor paclitaxel plus placebo (see Secti on 8.1). Study drug will be administered as shown in Section 9.1. A treatment cy cle is defined as 28 days (4weeks). It is recognized that in the course of clinical cancer care, it is not always possible to schedule therapeutic infusio ns at precise intervals (because of ho lidays, travel difficult ies, or other circumstances). Accordingly, in fusions administered within 3 days before or after the planned infusio n time point will be considered acceptable. Deviations beyond this window are strongly discouraged, and require Sponsor (or designee) approval. 9.4.1.Special Treatment Considerations 9.4.1.1. Treatment Requirements and Delays 9.4.1.1.1.

If a Grade 4 AE occurs and is deemed at least possibly related to ramucirumab/placebo, then ramucirumab/placebo should be discont inued except in the specific case of Grade 4 fever or Grade 4 laboratory abnormalit ies. If Grade 4 fever or laboratory abnormalities resolve to Grade ≤1 or pretreatment baseline within 1 treatment cycle (approximately 28 days), treatment with invest igational product may be continued at the discretion of the invest igator. In these settings, ramucirumab/placebo may be readministered. If a second instance of such an event occurs, ramucirumab/placebo should be subsequently readministered at a dose of 6 mg/kg every other week. A second dose reduction to 5 mg/kg every other week is permitted for this level of event (Grade 3 or 4 event). If the dose of ramucirumab/placebo is reduced because of potentially related AEs, subsequent dose increases are not permitted. Note that this section o f the protocol pertains only to general dose modifications. Criteria for dose reducti on in the setting of various specific AEs may be found in Section 9.4.2.1. Ramucirumab/placebo will be permanent ly discontinued in case of any ramucirumab/placebo -related event that is deemed life -threatening, regardl ess of grade. Patients who enter the study with symptom s or laboratory values equivalent to NCI -CTCAE, v4.03,Grade 1 or 2 AEs should not have dose reductio ns related to the persistence or mild worsening of those symptoms or laboratory values; dose reductions may be warranted if worsening of symptoms or laboratory values is clinically significant in the opinio n of the investigator. Except in the case of prot einuria, as described in Section 9.4.2.1.5, asymptomat ic laboratory abnormalities should not resul t in dose interruptions, modificat ions, or discontinuation of study therapy unless determined by the invest igator to be clinically significant or life-threatening. 9.4.2.1.

If a patient should have an IRRto ramucirumab/placebo, all attempts should be made to ob tain a blood sample for anti-ramucirumab ant ibody analysis as close to the onset of the event as possible, at the resolut ion of the event, and approximately 30 days fo llowing the event. In addition, these same samples may be assessed for levels of ramucirumab and for pharmacodynamic markers to provide informat ion on the nature of the IRR. The procedure for sample collect ion and handling is described in a separate procedural manual. 9.4.2.1.2. Hypertension The following are treatment guidelines for hypertensio n (an expected AE in patients receiving ramucirumab) that devel ops during the study : Grade <3 If the hypertensio n is not associated with symptoms, continue ramucirumab (or placebo) therapy and initiate antihypertensive therapy . If the hypertensio n is associated with symptoms, hold ramucirumab (or pl acebo) therapy until symptoms resolve and init iate antihypertensive therapy ."

Treatm ent with paclitaxel may be continued if appropriate in the opinio n of the investigator 9.4.2.1.3. Thromboembolic Events Investigators should perform all testing required to fully characterize arterial or venous thromboembolic/vascular events. The incidence and ty pe of thromboembo lic/vascular events will be co llected and reported. Ramucirumab therapy should be discont inued in the event of any Grade 3/4 arterial thromboembolic event or any Grade 3/4 venous thromboembo lic event that is considered by the investigator to be life -threatening, or sym ptomatic and not adequately treated by anticoagulation therapy. At the invest igator’s discretion, ramucirumab therapy may be continued in the setting of an incidentally diagnosed, asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmo nary embo lism,or following a sym ptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmo nary embolism when symptoms have resolved wit h the institution of anticoagulation therapy . Ramucirumab shoul d also be"

Bleeding (Hemorrhagic) Events Serious hemorrhagic AEs have been reported from clinical studies investigating ramucirumab . Hemorrhagic com plications are associated with some malignanci es (that is,variceal bleeding from portal hypertensio n in hepatocellular carcino ma, lower GIhemorrhage from bowel metastases in ovarian carcino ma) although the rate of these co mplications varies considerably. As detailed in the ramucirumab IB (Version 10.0and subsequent versions), the incidences of hemorrhagic events to date, significant background incidence of bleeding in so me malignancies, and use of conco mitant antiplatelet therapy in some of the reported cases precludes any definit ive association between bleeding and ramucirumab, although ongoing surveillance and ident ification (and exclusio n) of patients with high bleeding risk remain essential and are detailed in the inclusion/exclusion criteria(Section 7). 9.4.2.1.5. Proteinuria If, while on ramucirumab (or placebo) therapy , a patient has proteinuria ≥2+ per a di pstick or routine urinalysis test, a 24 -hour urine collect ion will be conducted. If the protein l evel is <2g/24-hours, the patient will cont inue on ramucirumab (or placebo) therapy at the same dose without interruption. If the protein level is 2 to 3 g/24-hours, ramucirumab (or placebo) therapy will be held for 1 week and a 24 -hour urine col lection will be repea ted. Ram ucirumab (or placebo) treatm ent will resume at a reduced dose level (6 mg/kg every 2weeks) once the protein level returns to <2 g/24-hours. A second dose reduction of ramucirumab (or placebo) to 5 mg/kg every 2weeks is perm itted if proteinuria ≥2 g/24-hours recurs. The patient will be discontinued from ramucirumab(or placebo) treatment if the protein level is >3 g/ 24-hours, if there is a third occurrence of proteinuria ≥2 g/24-hours, or if the protein level does not return to <2g/24-hours within 2 weeks. 9.4.2.1.6. Gastrointestinal Perforation Patients with unresected (or recurrent) primary tumors, mesenteric,or peritoneal disease who participate in this clinical study may be at increased risk for GI perforation due to the nature of the disease (metastatic gastric cancer). An infrequent incidence of GI perforations has been associated with so me antiangiogenic therapeutic agents, m ost specifically in the context of colorectal cancer(treated with co mbination regimens including ant i-VEGF antibodies and cytotoxic chemotherapy) and in advanced ovarian cancer. These events may be associated with extensive abdo minal/peritoneal disease burden. Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported from clinical studies invest igating ramucirumab. The incidences of these events to date and presence of significant comorbidit ies and risk factors preclude any definitiveassociation wit h ramucirumab , although ongoing surveillance remains essential. More information about GIperforation may be found in the IB."
54,page_54,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 54 LY3009806Patients with a history of GI perforati on within 6months prior to study entry are excluded from participation (Section 7.2). Ramucirumab DP should be perm anently discont inued for patients who have experienced GIperforation . 9.4.2.1.7. Fistula Formation Gastrointestinal and non -GI fistula format ion has been associated with ant iangiogenic agents including bevacizumab and sunit inib (Kamba and McDonald 2007). Some fistulas can be resolved wit h surgery procedures; however, fistulas can be fatal. The impact on the qualit y of life of having a fistula varies according to the locatio n and extent of the fistula (Chen and Cleck 2009). A small number of fistula events have been reported in ramucirumab clinical trials. Ramucirumab treatm ent should be discont inuedin patients who develop fistulas . 9.4.2.1.8. Congestive Heart Failure in Pa tients Who Received Ramucirumab in Combination with Mitoxantrone or Following Prior Anthracycline Therapy An increased risk of CHF has been associated with some antiangiogenic therapeutic age nts, particularly in pat ients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines or with other risk factors for CHF, including prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall . Findings have ranged fro m asymptom atic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF requiring treatm ent or hospitalization . Caution should be exercised when treating patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as preexist ing coronary artery disease or CHF . Patients with symptom atic CHF, unstable angina pectoris, or symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia shoul d not be enrolled in cli nical trials with ramucirumab . Ramucirumabshould be discont inued in the event of any Grade 3 to 4 events consistent with CHF. 9.4.2.1.9. Surgery an d Impaired Wound Healing Surgery and impaired wound healing have been observed wit h some antiang iogenic agents. Ramucirumab will not be administered to patients who have undergone major surgery within 28days prior to randomization or have undergone centr al venous access device placement within 7 days prior to randomization. Patients with postoperative and other nonhealing wound complications are excluded, as are patients for whom major surgical procedures are planned. 9.4.2.1.10. Liver Injury/Liver Failure An independentdata monitoring co mmittee(IDMC)for the ramucirumabstudyCP12-0919 (I4T-IE-JVBF[JVBF]) (a randomized ,blinded study evaluating ramucirumab versus placebo in hepatocellular carcino ma following prior sorafenib therapy ) recommended m odifications following a meetingon 02August 2012. This 02 August 2012 meeting was the fift h meeting of the IDMC for this stu dy (the prior meet ings had concluded wit h recommendat ions to continue this study without modifications), and occurred at the request of the Sponsor to investigate a potential association of liver failure and other events of severe liver injury wit h ramucirumab."

In review of the safet y data, the IDMC noted that death rates related t o study medication were in the expected range for patients with hepatocellular carcino ma and cirrhosis. However, the IDMC observed a numeric imbalance o f liver-related AEs, specifically for hepat ic encephalopathy , between the 2 treatm ent arms. Based on t his safety finding, the IDMC specifically addressed hepat ic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and ascites in the context of cirrhosis, exclusive of other etio logies of these diagnoses. The IDMC recommended cont inuing the CP12- 0919 study with modifications. These modifications included: (a) exclusio n of patients with Child-Pugh B ci rrhosis (or worse), (b)exclusion o f patients with cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites result ing from cirrhosis, and (c) an addit ional criteri onfor discontinuat ion of study drug (ram ucirumab or pl acebo) for patients with new occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy and/or hepatorenal syndrome resulting from liver cirrhosis. Although the CP12-0919 IDMC ’s recommendat ionsare specific to the CP12- 0919 study , ImClone Systems/Eli Lilly and Com pany (ImClone/Lilly) has chosen to implement these recommendat ions for ongoing Im Clone/Lilly-sponsored studies in which patients are receiving investigat ional ramucirumab. Ramucirumab should be discont inued following a new occurrence of hepat ic encephalopathy and/or hepatorenal syndro me resulting from liver cirrhosis. 9.4.2.1.11. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)is a clinical and radiologic syndrome typically consist ing of reversible cortical neurological dysfunct ion and brain -imaging findings of subcortical edema invo lving the posterior circulat ion, particularly the occi pital lobes (Hinchey et al. 1996). The symptoms of RPLS most often include generalized seizures, headache, delirium, and cortical blindness, although these may vary significant ly and occasionally include focal neurological deficit s (Hinchey et al. 1996 ; Garg 2001; Lee et al. 2008). Magnetic resonance imaging r epresents the m ost reliable method for the diagnosis (Lee et al. 2008). Clinical symptoms and MRI abnormalit ies usually recover within days to weeks with proper management, although permanent neurologic dysfunct ion has been reported (Hinchey et al. 1996; Tajima et al. 1999 ; Garg 2001; Lee et al.2008). has been associated with mult iple clinical condit ions including hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia, and renal failure with hypertensio n as well as the use of both immunosuppr essive and cy totoxic drug (Hinchey et al. 1996; Marinella and Markert 2009). More recently, RPLS has been associated with the use of the anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab, as described in the prescri bing information for this agent (Marinella and Markert 2009; Avast in package insert , 2011). While the precise pathogenesis o f RPLS has not been established, the pathophysio logy may involve impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation leading to blood -brain barrier disruption and vasogenic edema (Schwartz 1996). Although the pathogenesis of RPLS a ppears to be"
56,page_56,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 56 LY3009806multifactorial, drug -induced endothelial damage and acute hypertensio n are frequent ly proposed causes of cerebrovascular dy sfunction in RPLS (Garg 2001). RPLS should be identified and treated prompt ly in order to minimize potential for permane nt neurological damage. Treatm ent encom passes careful control of BP, withdrawal of potentially causative medication, and administration of ant iconvulsant agents to th ose experiencing seizures (Stott et al.2005). One SAE of RPLS has been reported in the d ouble-blind, rando mized, placebo -controlled , Phase3 colorectal cancerstudy CP12-0920 (I4T -MC-JVBB[JVBB]). The event was determined to be related to administration of all study drugs, including blinded invest igational DP(the treatment assignment for this pat ient remains blinded) . Because hypertensio n is an identified risk for ramucirumab, invest igators should control BPin accordance wit h the guidelines in Section 9.4.2.1.2. Inaddition, investigators should consider a diagnosis of RPLS in the setting of seizures, headache, nausea, delirium, visual changes ,and/or other unexplained neurological symptom s, especial ly in combinat ion with hypertensio n and MRI findings of hyperintensit y on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversio n recovery images. Ramucirumab DP should be permanent ly discont inued in pat ients with a confirmed diagnosis of RPLS. 9.4.3.General Dose Modifica tions: Paclitaxel No dose m odification for paclitaxel is allowed wit hin a given cycle . The paclitaxel dose will be reduced by 10 mg/m2for the following cycle when NCI- CTCAE,Version4.03,Grade 4 hematological toxicity or Grade 3 paclitaxel -related nonhematol ogical toxicity (except for alopecia) is observed. If the dose of paclitaxel is reduced because of potentially related AEs, subsequent dose increases are not permitted. Paclitaxel wi ll be permanently discont inued if dose reduction to less than 60 mg/m2would be requi red, or in case of any paclitaxel-related event that is deemed life -threatening, regardless of grade. 9.4.3.1. Treatment Guideline and Dose Modification for Specific Adverse Events of Paclitaxel 9.4.3.1.1. Paclitaxel Hypersensitivity Reactions In each case of hypersensit ivity reaction associated with paclitaxel, the invest igator should institute treatment measures according to the best available medical pract ice. The fo llowing treatment gui delines may be applicable: For mild symptoms : Complete paclitaxel infusio n. Supervise at bedside. No treatment required. For moderate symptom s: Stop paclitaxel infusio n. Administer diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV and dexamethasone 8 to 20 mg IV(or equivalent, per institutional guidelines). Resume the paclitaxel infusio n after recovery of symptom s at a reduced rate (20 mL/hour for 15 minutes). The infusio n rate may then be increased to 40 mL/hour for 15 minutes, and subsequently at the full rate if symptom s do not recur. If symptoms recur, stop the paclitaxel infusio n and rem ove patient from paclitaxel treatment."
57,page_57,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 57 LY3009806For severe life -threatening symptoms : Stop paclitaxel infusio n. Give IVdiphenhydramine and dexamethasone (per inst itutional guidelines). A dd epinephrine or bronchodilators if indicated. The patient should be removed fro m paclitaxel treatment. 9.5.Blinding This is a rando mized, double -blind, Phase 3 study . The randomization number will be assigned based on informat ion obtained fro m the IWRS. Pati ents will be randomized to receive ramucirumab or m atching placebo in a double -blind fashio n such that neither the invest igator, northe patient, nor m edical and an cillary medical staff, nor the Sponsor or its designees, will know which drug is being administered in addit ion to paclitaxel. Ramucirumab and pl acebo for infusio n will be ident ical in appearance in order to preserve blinding. In order to maintain this blind, study drug (ram ucirumab or pl acebo) will be uniquely labeled and will be assigned to a patient by using IWRS. 9.5.1.Emergency Unblinding In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a patient’s treatment assignment is warranted. Patient safet y must always be the first consideration in making such a determinat ion. If the invest igator decides that unblinding is warranted, the invest igator should make every effo rt to contact the LillyCRP prior to unblinding a patient’s treatm ent assignment unl ess this coul d delay emergency treatment of the patient. If a patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lillymust be notified immediately. 9.5.2.Inadvertent Unblinding Every effort will be m ade to blind both the patient and the invest igator to the ident ity of the treatment, but the inadvertent unblinding of a patient may occur. A double -blind study design is known to be imperfect in the oncoly tic setting because the potential for individual unblinding exists due to treatment -related signs and symptom s. If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the unblinding will not be sufficient cause (in and of itself) for that pati ent to be di scontinued from study therapy or excluded from any safety or efficacy analyses. Additionally, there may be ethical reasons to have the patient remain on the study treatment. For patients to con tinue on study treatment in the event of unblinding, the invest igator must obtain specific approval fro ma Lilly CRP for the pati ent to conti nue in the study . 9.6.Concomitant Therapy Appropriate documentation of all forms of premedicat ions, supportive care, and concomitant medications must be captured at each visit in the e CRF. Concomitant medicat ions and supportive care therapies must also be documented at the time of discontinuation and at the 30-day short-term follow-up visit. Palliative and supportive care for other disease -related symptoms and for toxicit y associated with treatment will be offered to all pa tients on this tri al. Supportive care measures may include but"

Nondrug supportive care procedures m ay be performed as medically necessary and appropriate in the opinio n of the investigator. Appropriate management of hypersensit ivity reactions is described in Section9.4.2.1.2 (ramucirumab) and Section9.4.3.1.1 (paclitaxel). With the exceptions listed in the sect ions below, no other chemotherapy, experimental medications, other anticancer therapy , immunotherapy , hormonal cancer therapy , radiation, surgery for cancer, or experimental medications will be permitted while pat ientsare on study treatment. 9.6.1. Antidiarrheal Agents In the event of diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed: hydration, octreoti de, and antidiarrheals. If diarrhea is severe ( requiring IVrehydration ) and/orassociated with fever or severe (Gr ade 3 or 4) neutropenia, broad- spectrum antibiot ics mustbe prescribed. Patients with severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomit ing must be hospi talized for IVhydration and correction of electrolyte imbalances. 9.6.2. Antiemetic Agen ts The use of antiemet ic agents is permitted at the discretion of the investigator. 9.6.3. Analgesic Agents The use of analgesic agents is permitted at the discretion of the invest igator. The chronic use of NSAIDs wit h a high risk of bleeding ( for example, indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or similar agents) is strongly discouraged unless at the discret ion and responsibilit y of the investigator after careful assessment of the individual bleeding risk of the patient. Chronic use of analgesic agents with no or lo w bleeding risk ( for example, paracetam ol/acetaminophen, metamizo le, dipyrone, or propyphenazone) is acceptable. 9.6.4. Appetite Stimulants The use of appet ite stimulants is permitted at the discretion of the invest igator. 9.6.5. Granulocyte -Colony Stimulating Factors The protocol does not permit the routine use of co lony-stimulating factors during treatment. The protocol does not allow the use of products that stimulate thrombopoiesis. The use of granulocyte -colony stimulating factors is permitted during invest igational therapy at the discretion of the invest igator. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors or similar agents are strongly recommended foll owing Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia of duration >5 days or following any incidence of febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 × 109/L with temperature ≥38.5°C)."
59,page_59,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 59 LY30098069.6.6. Erythroid Growth Factors The use of ery throid-stimulating factors ( for example, erythropoietin) is permitted at the discretion of the investigator. Erythropoietic therapy may be considered for treatment of chemother apy-inducedanemia for patients ;refer toAmerican Societ y of Clinical Oncology and FDA guidelines (FDA2007; Rizzo et al. 2008),or according to l ocal guidelines. 9.7.Treatment Compliance Patient compliance wi th study medication will be assessed at each visit . Treatmen t compliance is monitored by the review of drug accountabilit y records (Secti on 9.1), and study medication administration data recorded in the pati ent’s medical record and eCRF . The study medication will be administered only at the investi gational sites by the authori zed study personnel. As a result, treatment compliance is ensured. A patient willbe considered significant ly noncompliant if he or she is judged by the invest igator to have intent ionally missedmore than 28consecutive days of study medication (full doses) during the study . Potential discont inuation of a patient due to study drug noncom pliance will be discussed between the i nvestigator and the Lilly CRP before the final determinat ion is made to discontinue the pat ient."

Com puted tom ography, including spi ral CT scans ,and MRIsare the preferred methods of measurement. Investigators may co llect PET scans for addit ional analyses,but PET scans will not be used as a method of response assessment . Bone scans may be performed if clinically indicated. The method of assessment used at baseline must be used consistent ly for tumor assessment and will be repeated every 6 weeks (± 5days) following the fi rst dose of study therapy for the first 6months, and every 9 weeks (± 5days) thereafter ,until radiographic documentation o f PD. The Sponsoror its designee will collect and store all tumor measurement images on all enrolled patients throughout the study ; if necessary , independent revi ew of all scans may be considered following the co mpletion of the study (Section 8.1.3). 10.1.2.Efficacy Assessments During the Study Period Postdiscontinuation Follow-Up Postdiscontinuati on follow-up during the study period will be conducted as described in the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ). For those patients who discont inue study treatment without radiographical PD, the invest igative sites will cont inue to monitor patients and peri odically evaluate tum or response every 6 weeks (±5days) following the first dose of study therapy for the first 6 m onths, and every 9 weeks (± 5 days) thereafter ,until radiographic documentation of PD , by the same method used at ba seline and throughout the study . After the patient has radiographic disease progression, radio logic tests are no longer requi red and the patient will be followed up approximately every 8weeks(+0to 7 days)until the patient’s death or overall st udy completion. After patients have discont inued study treatment, they may receive addi tional anticancer therapy at the discretion of the invest igator. The addit ional treatments should be documented on the CRF during the study period. 10.1.3.Primary Efficacy Measure The primary efficacy measuresarethe duration of PFS and OS."
61,page_61,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 61 LY3009806Progression -free survival is measured fro m the date of rando mization to the date of the first radiographically documented PD as defined by RECIST, Version1.1, or the date of death due to any cause, whichever is first. The censoring is taken in the fo llowing order: -if a patient does not have a complete baseline or post-baseline radiographic disease assessment, then the PFS will be censored at the date of rando mization, regardless of whether or not radiographically determined disease progression or death has been observed for the patient; otherwise, -if a patient is aliveand does not have radiographic progression as o f the data-inclusion cut-off date, the PFS time will be censored at the date of the last adequate radiographic tumorassessment prior to cut-off date. Overall survival is measured from the date of randomizat ion to the date of death from any cause. For each patient who is not known to have died as of the data -inclusion cut- offdate, OS duration will be censored at the date of last known alive date prior to the data-inclusion cut-off date. Lilly or its designee will collect and store all tum or measurement images on all enrolled pat ients throughout the study . The date of first documented radiographic disease progression must be recorded on the CRF even if it occurs after the patient has started a new therapy . 10.1.4.Secondary Efficacy Measures The following secondary efficacy measures will be collected at the times shown in the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).A responder is defined as any pat ient who exhibits a nunconfirmed complete response (CR)or PR. Best response is determined fro m the sequence of responses assessed. The following definit ions for secondary efficacy measures will apply: Time to progressi onis defined as the time of randomizat ion to the date of the first radiographically documentedPDas defined by RECIST,Version1.1. For each patient who is not known to have had radiographic progressio n of disease as of the data -inclusion cut-off date, or who has died without radiographic progression of disease, TTPwill be censored at the date of the patient’s last radiographic tumorassessment prior to that cut - off date. Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of pat ients with a best overall response (BOR) of PR or CR . Patients who do not have a tumor response assessment for any reason are considered nonresponders and are included in the deno minator when calculatingthe response rate . For each treatment arm, the number of patients achieving a response will be divided by the total of patients randomized to yield the proportion responding: ORR (%) = # of evaluable pat ients who have a best response of PR or CR × 100 # of patients in analysis population Duration of objective response is measured fro m the time measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) tothe date of the first radiographically documented PD as defined by RECIST ,Version1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever i s first."
62,page_62,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 62 LY300980610.2.Health Outcome/Quality of Life Measures 10.2.1.Patient-Reported Outcomes Disease-free, OS, and toxicit y endpoints are typically included in onco logy clinical trials to evaluate the effect of study treatment. Recent ly, however, inclusion o f PROshas become routine as greater emphasis is placed on evaluating pat ient self-reports of the treatment benefit including the effect on symptoms and overall funct ioning or qualit y of life (QoL). These PRO measuremen ts are intended to result in data useful to inform treatment decisio ns. The assessment of QoL and health status endpoints will be conducted through use of the EORTC QLQ-C30and the EQ -5D-3Lquestionnaires , respectively . The instrum ents shouldbe administered together and in sequence order, with the EORTC QLQ -C30 presented first, followed by presentation of the EQ-5D-3L. Please refer to Secti on 8.1for the specific timing of these assessments. 10.2.1.1. EORTC QLQ- C30 The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a self-administered, cancer -specific quest ionnaire with multidimensio nal scales(Aaronson et al . 1993). It consists of both mult i-item scales and single-item measures, including 5functional domains, a global QoL dom ain, 3symptom domains, and 6single items. Only patients for whom there is a validated translat ion in language in which the pat ient is fluent will complete the QLQ -C30. 10.2.1.2. EQ-5D-3L The EQ-5Dis a nonspecific and standardized instrument for use as a measure of self -reported health status. The EQ-5D 3 level version (EQ -5D-3L) was introduced in 1990 (EuroQolGroup 1990). The EQ-5D-3L essentially consists of 2 pages -the EQ-5D descript ive system and the EQ visual analogue scale. The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system co mprises 5 dimensio ns and each dimension has 3 levels. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her healt h stateby ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensio ns. Additionally, patients will indicate their current health status by marking on a continuum ranging from 100 (best imaginable healt h state) to 0 (worst imaginable healt h state) (EuroQolGroup 1990; Brooks et al. 1996). In 2014, investigators had validated EQ -5D-3L and generated a Chinesegeneralpopulation–based social valuesetusingthe time trade -offmethod(Liu et al. 2014). 10.3.Safety Evaluations Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study and for al erting Lillyor its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient . The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious , considered related to the study, or that caused the patient to discont inue treatment before com pleting the study . The pati ent should be followed until the event is reso lved,"
63,page_63,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 63 LY3009806stabilized, returned to baseline, unt il deemed irreversible, or otherwise explained. Frequency of follow-up evaluat ion is left to the discretion o f the investigator. 10.3.1.Adverse Events Lillyhas standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory requirements that m ay be less stringent. A clinical study AE is any untoward medical occurrence ina patient or clinical invest igation subject administered a pharmaceut ical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tem porally associ ated with the use of a m edicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the m edicinal (investigational) product. Any clinically significant findings from ECGs, laboratory assessments, vi tal sign measurements, or other procedures that result in a diagnosis shoul d be reported to Lillyor its designee. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical trials, because the purpose of the clinical trial is to establish drug effect. Cases of pregnancy that oc cur during maternal or paternal expos ures to study treatment and up to 12 weeks following last study treatment dose should be reported immediately. Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safet y evaluation. Study site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing conditions, including clinically significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in the study. After the ICF i s signed, site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of any AEs and any change in the preexist ing condit ion(s). All AEs related to protocol procedures are reported to Lillyor its designee. In addi tion, all AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of study treatment until30 days after the deci sion is made to discontinue study treatment must be reported to the Sponsor or its designee via eCRF. Any clinically significant findings from labs and vital sign measurements that result in a diagnosis shoul d be reported to the Spon sor or its designee. Investigators will be instructed to report to Lillyor its designee their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, study drug ,or chemotherapy via eCRF. The invest igator will decide whether he or she interprets the observed AEs as related to disease, to the study medication, study procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies. To assess the relat ionship of the AE to the study drug or procedure, the following termino logies are defined: Probably related : a direct cause and effect relat ionship between the study treatment and the AE is likely Possibly related : a cause and effect relat ionship between the study treatment and the AE has not been demo nstrated at this time and is not probable, but is also not impossible"
64,page_64,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 64 LY3009806Does not know: the investigator cannot determine Not related : without questi on, the AE is definitely not associated with the study treatment The invest igator should classify all “probably related,” “possibly related,” or “does not know” AEs and SAEs as related to study treatment/study procedure. Patients will be evaluated for AEs at each visit and will be instructed to call their physician to report any AEs between visit s. The NCI-CTCAE,Version4.03,will serve as a reference document for choosing appropri ate terminology for, and grading the severit y of, all AEs and other symptom s. For AEs without matching termino logy within the NCI -CTCAE,Version4.03, the invest igator will be responsible for selecting the appropriate system organ class and assessing severit y grade based on the intensity of the event. In addition to collect ing the AE verbat im, the NCI-CTCAE term, and the NCI -CTCAE severit y grade, AE verbat im text will also be mapped by the Sponsor or designee to corresponding terminology within Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly report to Lillyor its designee via eCRF the circumstances and data leading to any such dosage reduction or discont inuation of treatment. 10.3.1.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AEfrom this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es: Death Alife-threatening exper ience (that is, immediate risk of dying) Persistent or si gnificant disabilit y/incapacity Initial or prolonged inpat ient hospitalization Congenital anomaly/birth defect Considered significant by the invest igator for any other reason . Important m edical event s that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered seri ous adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention toprevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion. Serious adverse event collect ion begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has received study drug. If a patient experiences an SAE after signing informed consent, but prior to receiving study drug, the event will not be reported as serious unless the invest igator feels the event may have been caused by a protocol procedure. Data on SAEs that occur before the end of trial will be stored in the collect ion database and the Lilly Safety System."
65,page_65,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 65 LY3009806Study site personnel must alert Lillyor its designee of any SAEwithin 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed with official notificationon study-specific SAE forms. This 24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up SAE informat ion. Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the co urse of the study . Planned hospi talizations or procedures for preexisting condit ions that are already recorded in the patient’s medical history at the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion without a preci pitating clinical AE (for example, for the administration of study therapy or other protocol -required procedure) shoul d not be considered SAEs. Serious adverse events due to disease progression, including death, should not be reported unless the investigator deems them to be possibly related to the study drug. The invest igator does not need to actively mo nitor patients for AEs once the trial has e nded, unless provided otherwise in the protocol; however, if an investigator becomes aware of an SAE occurring after the patient’s participat ion in the trial has ended, and the investigator believes that the SAE is related to a protocol procedure or study drug, the invest igator should report the SAE to the sponsor, and the SAE will be entered in the Lilly Safety System. Information on SAEs expected in the study population independent of drug exposure and that will be assessed by the sponsor in aggregate per iodically during the course of the trial may be found in the IB. 10.3.1.2. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the Development Core Safet y Informati on in the IB and that the invest igator ident ifies as related to the invest igational product or study procedure. Lilly has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regulations and associat ed detailed guidances. 10.3.2.Safety Monitoring The Lilly CRP will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study . Lillywill review SAEs wit hin timeframes mandated by co mpany procedures. The Lilly CRP , will, as is appropriate, consult with the functionally independent GPS therapeutic area physician or clinical scient ist, and review trends in safet y data, laboratory analyses,and AEs: If a patient experiences elevated ALT ≥5×ULN and el evated total bilirubin ≥2×ULN, clinical and laboratory monitoring shoul d be initiated by the invest igator.For patients"
66,page_66,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 66 LY3009806entering the study with ALT >3×ULN, monitoring should be triggered at ALT >2 × baseline. Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory test abnor malities.To ensure patient safet y and comply with regulatory guidance, the investigator is to consult with the Lilly CRPregarding collect ion of specific recommended clinical information and fo llow-up laboratory tests. See Attachment 4. In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the group level, only the GPS therapeuti c area physician or clinical scientist can conduct additional analyses of the safet y data. For the purpose of this study , in which survival is a primary endpoint, all deaths and SAE reports will be reviewed in a blinded manner by Lilly during the clinical trial. These report s will be reviewed to assure completeness and accuracy but will not be unblinded to Lilly during the clinical trial. If a death or other clinical AE is deemed serious, unexpected, and possibly related to study drug, only Lilly representatives external to the study team will be unblinded for regulatory reporting and safet y monitoring purposes. These measures will preserve the integrit y of the data collected during this trial and minimize any potential for bias while providing for appropriate safety monitoring. 10.3.3.Complaint Handling Lillycollects product complaints on study drugs used in clinical trials in order to ensure the safety of study participants, m onitor quality, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Complaints related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant drugs are reported direct ly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package insert. For blinded studies, all product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by Lillyor its designee will be reported. The invest igator or his or her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the product complaint process in accordance wit h the instructions provided for this study : Recording a complete description of the produc t complaint reported and any associated AEs using the study -specific co mplaint form s provided for this purpose Faxing the com pleted product complaint form wit hin 24 hours to Lillyor its designee.

Standard laboratory tests, including hematology , coagulation, and urinalysis panels will be performed and analyzed by a local laboratory . Patient randomization and treatment decisio nsarebased on l ocal laboratory results only, unless the investigator chooses to use the central laboratory for such a purpose . Central laboratory results are used for study report purposes and where appropriate for safety analyses. Central laboratory samples should be collected even when local laboratory results are used to assess eligibilit y. A pregnancy test will be performed lo cally.For chemistry test, both central and local laboratory test should be performed atscreening/ baselineandprior to D1 of each treatment cy cle. But only local laboratory test is required for chemistry test prior to D8 and D15 of each treatment cy cle. Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. Laboratory results that coul d unblind the study will not be reported to invest igative sites or other blinded personnel unt il the study has been unblinded. Samples collected for spec ified laboratory tests will be destroy ed within 60 days of receipt of confirmed test results. Tests are run and confirmed prompt ly whenever scient ifically appropriate. When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples to batch the tests run, or to retain the samples until the end of the study to confirm that the results are valid. Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory certificati on standards. 10.4.2.Samples for Translational Research There is growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy . Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabo lism, and excreti on, the m echanism of act ion of the drug, the disease etiology,and/or the molecular subt ype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and ERB allow, a who le blood sample will be co llected for pharmacogenet ic analysis. This collection is a one-time who le blood collect ion that can be taken at any t ime during the study . However, it is reco mmended that the sample be co llected before the first dose of study treatment. Collection of samples for other bio marker research is al so part of thi s study. Plasma and tum or tissuewill be collected. Required samples for translational research to be collected fro m all patients in this study are the following: Whole blood Plasma."
68,page_68,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 68 LY3009806Optional samples for translational research that shoul d be collected from pat ients in the study where possible arethe following: Tumor tissues. Attachment 5lists the sampling schedule for translational research . Whole blood samples will be stored and analysis may be performed on biomarker variants thought to pl ay a role in endothelial cell proliferat ion,angiogenesis , ramucirumab m echanism of action, and/orcancer, which may include but not limited to VEGFR -2 and VEGF -A, to evaluate their association with clinical outcomes to ramucirumab . Polymorphisms in VEGF -A have been associated with OS and hypertensio n using other ant iangiogenesis agents (Schneider e t al. 2008). In the event of an unexpected AE or the observat ion of unusual response, the pharmacogenetic biomarker samples may be genotyped and analysis may be perform ed to eval uate a genet ic association with response to ramucirumab. These investigat ions may be limited to a focused candidate gene study or, if appropri ate, genom e-wide analysis may be performed to identify regions of the genome associated with the variability observed in drug response. The pharmacogenet ic biomarker samples will only be used for invest igations related to disease and drug or class o f drugs under study in the context of this clinical program. They will not be used for broad expl oratory unspecified disease or population genet ic analysis . Pharmacogenet ic data will not be pro vided back to the invest igator or the patient except where required by local law . Plasma will be stored and maybe used for the analyses of various circulat ing factors related to the VEGF pathway and/or cancer; these factors may include, but not be limited to, levels of circulating VEGF -A, VEGF -B, VEGF -C, VEGF -D, placental growth factor ( PlGF), soluble VEGFR-1, and soluble VEGFR -2, basic fibroblast growth fac tor(bFGF), and stromal cell- derived factor 1a (SDF1a). Slides with unstained tum or sections or archived tissue blocks are requiredfor biomarker research. Due diligence should be used to make sure that tumor specimen (not a normal adjacent or a tumor margin sample) is provided. Pathology reports accompanying archival t issue may also be requested. Previously archived tum or tissue will be ident ified at baseline and designated for submissio n to the central laboratory . Pretreatment, formalin-fixed,paraffin-embedded tum or tissue obtained from the primary tumor or metastatic site should be provided as a whole block or unstained slides. After sectioning has been completed, the paraffin -embedded who le blocks will be returned to the investigator within 2 months. Slides will not be returned. The tissue may be used to assess bio markers that pr edict clinical outcome to treatm ent with ramucirumab. Mutations in VEGFR -2 have been ident ified in tumors and have been associated with VEGFR-2 expressio n and clinical outcome (Cerri et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2011). Such mutations may have an impact on ra mucirumab binding and efficacy. This study may determine if these VEGFR -2 findings are relevant for gastric cancer and specifically for ramucirumab efficacy. Mutation profiling, copy number variabilit y, gene expressi on, and"
69,page_69,I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 69 LY3009806immunohistochemistry may be performed on tissue samples to determine an associat ion between these biomarkers and ramucirumab efficacy . The samples will be coded with the patient number and stored for up to a maximum of 15years after the last patient visit for the study at a facility selected by the sponsor. The samples and any data generated from them can only be linked back to the patient by investigator site personnel. The durati on allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory requests related to the study drug. Samples will be destroyed according to a process consistent with local regulat ion. 10.5.Appropriateness of Measurements The measures use d to assess safet y and efficacy in this study are consistent wi th those used in most convent ional oncology trials.

71,page_71,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 71 LY3009806 12. Sample Size and Statistical Methods 12.1. Determination of Sample Size The study plan is to enroll approximately 450 patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma after failure of any platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet with or without anthracycline. The approximately 450 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Ar m A (paclitaxel plus ramucirumab) and Arm B (paclitaxel plus pl acebo). Patients will be randomized using stratification factors ECOG PS (0 versus 1) and peritoneal metastatis (yes versus no). Under the following assumptions:  The randomization ratio is 2:1;  OS in each arm follows exponential distribution;  The OS hazard ratio for Arm A vs Arm B is 0.81;  Control arm median OS = 10.5 months, 336 deaths (that is, 25% censoring ra te) will provide at least 80% pr obability to assure that the effect size observed in this st udy is consistent with the global study, where effect size is defined by 11 HR . The above assurance probability is defined by Prob උߜመ௃௏஼ோ൐ ߜߩ መ௃௏஻ாඏ, where JVBEˆ=0.235 was estimated from the observed HR of 0.81 in the global study andJVCRˆ will be estimated from the observed HR in this study.  is a constant set to 0.5, corresponding to 50% effect size retention from the global study. Assuming further a constant accrual rate of 12 pa tients/month, it is estimated that the study will take approximately 44 months to obtain the re quired 336 deaths, with 37 months for accrual and 7 months for follow-up. 12.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans 12.2.1. General Considerations Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of Eli Lilly and Company. Analyses of OS, PFS, and ORR will be based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set. This population is defined as all patients randomized to study treatment. Patients will be grouped according to randomized treatment. Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoints and other selected efficacy endpoints based on the per-protocol set (PPS) of patients may be performed if there are significant numbers of patients with major pr otocol violations. The PPS is defined as those patients in the ITT set who ar e compliant with the study protocol without major protocol violations. Sa fety will be analyzed for randomized patients receiving at least 1 dose of study treatment grouped by actual treatment r eceived. Analyses of PROs will include"
72,page_72,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 72 LY3009806randomized patients that provide (for the instrument being analyzed ) a baseline assessment and at least 1 postbaseline assessment ; however, compliance will be based on the ITT population . Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol . Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report. Addi tional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. 12.2.2.Patient Disposition A detailed description o f patient disposition will be provi ded. It will include: Summary of patients entered and randomizedby country Total number of patients entered Total number of patients rando mized, by treatment arm Summary of reasons for patients entered, but not rando mized Total number of patients treated, by treatment arm Summary of reasons for patients rando mly assigned but not treated. A detailed summary of reasons for patient discont inuation from study treatmentwill be provided. A summary of all identified important protocol vio lations will be provided. 12.2.3.Patient Characteristics Patient demographics, including the following, will be reported using descript ive statistics: Patient demographics Baseline disease characteri stics Preexisting condit ions Prior therapi es Baseline factors. 12.2.4.Concomitant Therapy Concomitant medicat ions will be summarized for the safet y population. 12.2.5.Treatment Compliance The number of dose omissio ns, reducti ons, delays, the number of cycles received, and dose intensity will be summarized for all treated patients per treatment arm. 12.2.6.Primary Outcome and Methodology The co-primary efficacy objectivesinclude evaluations of PFSand OS. 12.2.6.1. Progression -free Survival The PFS is defined as the time fro m randomization to the date of the first radiographically documented PD as defined by RECIST, Version1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever is first."
73,page_73,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 73 LY3009806Imaging will be performed every 6 weeks (± 5days) following the first dose of study therapy for the first 6months, and every 9 weeks (± 5days) thereafter, until documentation of radiographic PD. Patients alive and without disease progression at data cut -off date or patients lost to follow - up will be censored at the day of their last adequate radiographic tumor assessment. If no baseline or post -baseline radiographic assessment is available, the patient will be censored at the date of rando mization. If death or PD occurs after two or more consecut ivelymissed radiographic visit s, censoring will occur at the date of the last radiographic visit prior to the missed visits. The use of a new anticancer therapy prior to the occurrence of PD will result in censoring at the date of last adequate radiographic assessment prior to init iation of new therapy . The primary analysis of PFS in this study will estimate the HR and its 2 -sided 95% CI in a stratified Cox’s proportional hazards model using treatment arm as a single covariate. The stratificat ion factors included in the Cox model are the same as r andomization strata. A sensitivityanalysis wi th an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model will be emplo yed. Stratified and unstratified log -rank tests will also be conducted. The survival curves for eac h randomization arm will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product-limit method. Two-sided, 95% CI s for median PFSwill be computed by the Brookmeyer and Crowl ey method (Brookm eyer and Crowley 1982) using l og-log- transformation. Survival rates at 6, 12, 18 and 24 mo nths will also be est imated using KM estimates on the survival curve for each arm. Associated two- sided 95% CIs will also be calculated. In addition, a multivariate Cox model will be used to adjust for baseline covariates because imbalances in potenti al prognosti c factors coul d impact the analysis of survival. Covariates that are planned to be included are those prognostic factors identified in StudyJVBE. Details of pre- specified covariates will be listed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Additional sensitivity analyses for PFS using alternat ive censoring rules described in the SAP will be performed. 12.2.6.2. Overall Survival Overall survival is measured fro m the date of randomizat ion to the date of death from any cause. For each patien t who is not known to have died as of the data -inclusion cut-off date, OS will be censored at the date of last known alive date prior to the data -inclusion cut-off date. The analysis of OS will be conducted via similar methods for PFS, that i s, stratified and unstratified Cox model and log- rank tests, KM curve, median est imates and survival rates with CI. An interim OS analysis will be performed concurrent ly with the primary PFS analysis, and a final OS analysis will be performed if the primary objective is not achieved at interim. 12.2.7.Secondary Efficacy Analyses Secondary efficacy endpo ints include TTP, ORR and DOR ."
74,page_74,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 74 LY3009806Time to progression is defined as the time of randomizat ion to thedate of the first radiographically documentedPDas defined by RECIST, Version1.1. For each patient who is not known to have had radiographic progression of disease as of the data -inclusion cut -off date, or who has died without radiographic progression, TTP will be censored at the date of the patient’s last adequate radiographic tumorassessment prior to that cut -off date. Time to progression will be analyzed using similar methods as described for PFSin Section 12.2.6. Additional sensit ivity analyses for TTP using alternat ive censoring rules will be specified in the SAP. Best overall response (BOR)will be determined using RECIST, Version 1.1. Objective response rate will be calculated as the number of patients who achieve a BOR of CR or PR, divided by the total number of pat ients randomized to the corresponding treatment arm (ITT analysis set). Patients who do not have a tumor response assessment for any reason are considered as nonresponders and are included in the deno minator when calculat ing the response rate. Objective response rate will be reported along with 2- sided 95% exact CIs using Clopper and Pearson’s method for each treatment arm. The difference o f ORR between 2 treatment arms will be evaluated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for ECOG PS and peritoneal metastases . Duration of objective response is measured fro m the time measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever is first) to the date of the first radiographic ally documented PDas defined by RECIST, v 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever is first. Patients alive and without radiographic disease progressi on at data -inclusioncut-off date or patients lost to follow -up will be censored at the dateof their last radiographic tu mor assessment. DOR will be analyzed using KM method. Medians and their t wo-sided 95% CIs will be calculated . 12.2.8.Health Outcome/Quality of Life Analyses Patient-reported outcome measures (that is, EORTC QLQ -C30and EQ-5D-3L) data will be summarized by treatment arm using descript ive statist ics including quest ionnaire compliance rates for the ITT population. Exploratory analyses may be perform ed to invest igate associat ions between the PRO and clinical efficacy endpoints. Following the EORTC guidelines ( Fayers et al . 2001), the 30 i tems of the QLQ -C30 will be transformed into the 15 scales (1 global healt h status/QoL scale, 5 functional scales, and 9symptoms scales/items). A linear transformation will be used to obtain scales ranging fro m 0 to 100, with a high score indicat ing a high level o f functioning for the global and the funct ional scales and, conversely , a high level of symptom atology for the symptom s scales. Mi ssing items within a scale will be handled according to the EORTC recommendat ions (Fayers et al. 2001). Scales will be presented using descript ive statistics. The 5-dimension single-item 3-level EQ-5D-3L responses will be summarized using frequency distributions. The index score for the EQ - 5D-3L will be calculated from a combinat ion of responses using a weighting algorithm current ly in development based on EQ -5D-3L Chinese validation study(EuroQolGroup 19 90; Brooks et al. 1996 ; Liu et al. 2014). The visual analog"
75,page_75,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 75 LY3009806scale is scored from 0 (worst imaginable health state) through 100 (best i maginable healt h state) to represent the patient’s self -reported heal th during that day . The index score and the visual analog scale will be presented using summary statistics. QoL scores and change from baseline will be summarized descript ively at each a ssessment time pointby subtracting baseline scores for each individual fro m his or her own scores at the specific time point. The proportion of patients in each arm with deterioration in scores, improvement in scores, and stable scores at specific time p oints will be presented. Scores will be considered improved or deteriorated if change is ≥10 points (Osobaet al. 1998). 12.2.9.Safety Analyses All safety summaries and analyses will be based upon the safety population as defined in Section12.2.1. Safety analyses will include summaries of the incidence of AEs by maximum NCI -CTCAE grade (Version 4.03) that occur during the study treatment period or within approximately 30days after the decision is made for di scontinuation from study treatment. Addi tionally, the following safet y-related outcomes will be summarized: Study treatment discont inuations due to AEs Deaths during the study treatment period or within 30 days after the decisio n is made to discontinue study treatment SAEs during the study treatment period or within 30 day s after the deci sion is made to discontinue study treatment All hospitalizations and transfusio ns during the study treatment period or within 30 days after the decision is made to di scontinue study treatment Selected concomitant medicat ions, including growth factors (erythro id growth factors, granulocy te-colony stimulating factors, granulocy te-macrophage co lony-stimulating factor), antiemet ics, antihypertensive age nts, and ant ibiotics, during the study treatment period or within 30days after the decision is made to discont inue study treatment. 12.2.10. Subgroup Analyses The following prespecified subgroup analyses are planned according to baseline characterist ics. More subgroups maybe provided in the SAP . Gender (males versus females) Age (<65 y ears versus ≥65 years) Ethnicity(Chinese versus non -Chinese) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS (0 versus 1) Peritoneal metastases (yes versus no) Post discontinuation therapy use (yes versus no) Weight loss over the prior 3 months ( ≥10% versus <10%) Primary tumor locat ion (gastric versus GEJ tumor) Time to progression on first -line therapy (<6 months versus ≥6 months) Presence of ascites (y es versus no)"
76,page_76,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 76 LY3009806Pharmacodynamic bio markers. Cox models using treatment arm as a single covariate will be emplo yed to estimate these HRs and CIs. 12.2.11. Statistical Analysis for Translational Research Pharmacodynamic bio marker (that is, soluble VEGR -1 and VEGR-2; VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D; PlGF,bFGF, and SDF1a) characteri stics will be summarized by treatment arm. To expl ore the predict ive features of bio markers, subgroup analyses by these biomarkers will be performed for selected primary and secondary endpoints. For time -to-event variables such as OSand PFS, KM estimates will be generated by these biomarkers and Cox’s proportional hazard m odels will be fitted including treatment -by-biomarker interactions. Objective response rate will be summarized by treatment and bio markers. 12.2.12. Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring The primary PFS analysis and an interim OSanalysis will be reviewed by theIndependent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC)after at least 256 PFS events have been observed. The interim analysis will be conducted to provide early efficacy information and could potentially result in early communicati on with regulatory agencies. The IDMC will be instructed to engage the Senior Management Designee ( SMD), who may, if necessary ,subsequent ly forman Internal Review Committee ( IRC)to propose actions based upon the IDMC’s reco mmendation.If the study showsearly efficacy at interim (that is, both of the condit ions described below are met) , enrollment will be terminated and subjects randomized to the control armmaybe permitted to cross over to the treatmentarm under invest igator discretion . The primary objective will be claimed achieved if bothof the followingconditionsaremet: (1)The point estimate of stratified HR for invest igator-assessed OS is less than 1. (2)The analysis of invest igator-assessed PFS shows a one-sided, stratified p-valuefavoring Ramucirumab+pacli taxel armless than 0. 025. If at least one of the condit ions above are not met, the blinded study continues and a final OS analysis will apply. Thefinal analysis will be conducted when approximately 336 OS events have been observed. The unblinded interim analysis, including the efficacy and safety data, will be reviewed by the IDMC.Only the IDMC is authorized to evaluate unblinded interim efficacy and safety analyses. Study sites will receive informat ion about interim results ONLY if they need to know for the safety of their patients. Unblinding details are specified in the unblinding plan sect ion of the SAP."

The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are as fo llows: An interim analysis was added. Evaluation of PFS was added as aco-primary object ives along OS. Statisticalassumptions and cor responding analysis plan were updated accordingly . Deleted the “fo llow up” and “study completion” in Figure JVCR 8.1, since the detailed information has been clarified in Figure JVCR 8.2. For the benefit of the patient, clarified crossover to the control arm may be permitted if the study show early efficacy at interim. Clarified the short- term follow-upprocedure for subject init iating new anti-cancer therapy within this period. “Different drug product lots must not be mixed in a s ingle infusion ” was deleted, as Ramucirumab iscommercial product and there is no such requirement. Clarified the treatm ent delay is at investigator discretion when AE/toxicit ies not listed in the protocol happened. To keep consistency wit h IB, “FistulaFormation”was addedto “Treatment Guideline and Dose modification for Specific Adverse Events of Ramucirumab” and the following chapter numbers were updated. The footnotes e and f in attachment 1 are not applied for ECG and ECHO of V801, therefore theywere deleted."

Also assuming a constant accrual rate of 1 2patients/mo nth, a median OS of 10.5 months in Arm B and a median OS of 13 months in Arm A, the study will take approximately 44 months to obtain the required 336 deaths (37 months for accrual and 7months for the follow-up). The primary PFS analysis and an interim OS analysis will be performed when at least 256 PFS events have occurred. Efficacy: The primaryanalysisof OSPFS/OSin this study is to estimate the HR and it s 2-sided 95%CIs in a stratified Cox’s proportional hazards model using treatment arm as a single covariate. The stratificat ion factorsincluded in the Cox model areECOG PS (0 versus 1)and peritoneal metastases (y es versus no). An additionalA sensitivityanalysis wi th an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model will be emplo yed to explore the effect of the stratification factor . Stratified (using the same stratification factor) and unstratified log -rank tests will also be conducted. The OSsurvival curves for each randomized arm will be est imated using the Kaplan - Meier (KM) product -limit method. Two -sided, 95% CIs for median OSPFS/OSwill be computed by the Brookm eyer and Crowl ey method. Landmark s urvival rates will also be estimated using KM e stimates on the OSsurvivalcurve for each rando mized arm. Associated 2 - sided 95% CIs will also be calculated. 6.Objectives 6.1 Primary Objective The co-primary object ive of this study is to evaluate PFS andOS in patients treated with paclitaxel plus ramucirumab (IMC -1121B,LY3009806) versus paclitaxel plus placebo as second-line treatment in pat ients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcino ma after failure of any platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet with or without anthracycline (epirubicin or doxorubicin)."

Short-TermFollow-Up For patients who discontinuetreatment for reasons other than radiographic PD, imaging studies with tumor measurements/di sease response assessments will cont inue to be performed every 6weeks (±5days) following the first dose of study therapy for the first 6months, and every 9weeks (±5days) thereafter, until documentation of radiographic PD. If it is deemed to be in the best interest of the patient to start a new ant i-cancer treatment prior to the scheduled end of the short -term follow-up visit, the follow-up visit duration may be shortened. In this case, the short- term follow-up assessments should be co mpleted prior to the initiation of the new therapy. 8.1.3. Study Completion and End of Tr ial This study will be considered com plete (that i s, the scientific evaluation will be co mplete [study completion]) following the interim analysis (256 PFS events) if the study is stopped early, or followingfinal analysies of OS (336deaths; see Section 12) if the study is not stopped early, as determined by Lilly.

Congestive Heart Failure in Patients Who Received Ramucirumab in Combination with Mitoxantrone or Following Prior A nthracycline Therapy An increased risk of CHF has been associated with some antiangiogenic therapeuti c agents, particularly in pat ients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines or with other risk factors for CHF, including prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall . Findings have ranged fro m asymptom atic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF requiring treatm ent or hospitalization. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as preexist ing coronary artery disease o r CHF. Patients with symptom atic CHF, unstable angina pectoris, or symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia shoul d not be enrolled in clinical trials wit h ramucirumab. Ramucirumabshould be discont inued in the event of any Grade 3 to 4 events c onsistent with CHF. 9.4.2.1.8. 9.4.2.1.9. Surgery and Impaired Wound Healing Surgery and impaired wound healing have been observed wit h some antiangiogenic agents. Ramucirumab will not be administered to patients who have undergone major surgery within 28days prior to randomization or have undergone central venous access device placement within 7 days prior to randomization. Patients with postoperative and other nonhealing wound complications are excluded, as are patients for whom major surgical procedur es are planned. 9.4.2.1.9.9.4.2.1.10. Liver Injury/Liver Failure An independent data monitoring co mmittee (IDMC) for the ramucirumab study CP12 -0919 (I4T-IE-JVBF [JVBF]) (a randomized, blinded study evaluating ramucirumab versus placebo in hepatocellular carcinoma following prior sorafenib therapy ) recommended m odifications following a meet ing on 02 August 2012. This 02 August 2012 meeting was the fift h meeting of the IDMC for this study (the prior meetings had concluded wit h recommendat ions to continue this study without modificat ions), and occurred at the request of the Sponsor to investigate a potential association of liver failure and other events of severe liver injury wit h ramucirumab. The IDMC reviewed unblinded safet y data from 400 patients who ha d been treated with either ramucirumab or pl acebo. The data cut -off date of this safet y review was 18 July 2012. In review of the safet y data, the IDMC noted that death rates related to study medication were in the expected range for patients with hepatoc ellular carcino ma and cirrhosis. However, the IDMC observed a numeric imbalance o f liver-related AEs, specifically for hepat ic encephalopathy , between the 2 treatm ent arms. Based on this safet y finding, the IDMC specifically addressed hepat ic encephalopa thy, hepatorenal syndrome, and ascites in the context of cirrhosis, exclusive of other etio logies of these diagnoses. The IDMC recommended cont inuing the CP12- 0919 study with modifications. These modifications included: (a) exclusio n of patients with Child-Pugh B ci rrhosis (or worse), (b)exclusion o f patients with cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites result ing from cirrhosis, and (c) an addit ional criterion for discontinuat ion of study drug (ram ucirumab or pl acebo) for patients with new occurrence of"

Although the CP12-0919 IDMC’s reco mmendations are specific to the CP12 -0919 study , ImClone Systems/Eli Lilly and Com pany (ImClone/Lilly) has chosen to implement these recommendat ions for ongoing Im Clone/Lilly-sponsored studies in which patients are receiving investigat ional ramucirumab. Ramucirumab shoul d be discont inued following a new occurrence of hepat ic encephalopa thy and/or hepatorenal syndro me resulting from liver cirrhosis. 9.4.2.1.10.9.4.2.1.11. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)is a clinical and radio logic syndrome typically consist ing ofreversible cortical neurological dysfunct ion and brain -imaging findings of subcortical edema invo lving the posterior circulat ion, particularly the occi pital lobes (Hinchey et al. 1996). The symptoms of RPLS mo st often include generalized seizures, headache, delirium, and cortical blindness, although these may vary significant ly and occasionally include focal neurological deficit s (Hinchey et al . 1996; Garg 2001; Lee et al . 2008). Magnetic resonance imaging represents the most reliable method for the diag nosis (Lee et al . 2008). Clinical symptoms and MRI abnormalit ies usually recover within days to weeks with proper management, although permanent neurologic dysfunct ion has been reported (Hinchey et al. 1996; Tajima et al. 1999; Garg 2001; Lee et al. 2008) . has been associated with mult iple clinical condit ions including hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia, and renal failure with hypertensio n as well as the use of both immunosuppressive and cy totoxic drug (Hinchey et al. 1996; Marinella and Markert 2009 ). More recently, RPLS has been associated with the use of the anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab, as described in the prescribing information for this agent (Marinella and Markert 2009; Avast in package insert, 2011). 10 Efficacy, Patient -Reported Outcomes, Safety Eva luations, Sample Collection and Testing, and A ppropriateness of Measurements 10.1.3. Primary Efficacy Measure The primary efficacy measuresisarethe duration of PFS andOS. Progression -free survival is measured fro m the date of rando mization tothe date of the first radiographically documented PD as defined by RECIST, Versi on1.1, or the date of death due to any cause, whichever is first. The censoring is taken in the following order: -if a patient does not have a complete baseline or post -baseline radiographic disease assessment, then the PFS will be censored at the date of rando mization, regardless of whether or not radiographically determined disease progression or death has been observed for the patient; otherwise, -if a patient is alive and does not have radiographic progression as o f the data-inclusion cut-off date, the PFS time will be censored at the date of the last adequate radiographic tumor assessment prior to cut-off date."
110,page_110,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 110 LY3009806Overall survival is measured from the date of randomizat ion to the date of death from any cause. For each patient who is not known to have died as of the data -inclusion cut- off date, OS duration will be censored at the date of last known alive date prior to the data-inclusion cut-off date. Lilly or its designee will collect and store all tum or measurement images on all enrolled pat ients throughout the study . The date of first documented radiographic disease progression must be recorded on the CRF even if it occurs after the patient has started a new therapy . 10.1.4. Secondary Efficacy Measures The following secondary efficacy measures will be collected at the times shown in the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).A responder is defined as any pat ient who exhibits a n unconfirmed complete response (CR)or PR. Best response is determined fro m the sequence of responses assessed. The following definit ions for secondary efficacy measures will apply: Progression free survival is measured fro m the date of rando mization to the date of the first radiographically documented PD as defined by RECIST, Versi on1.1, or the date of death due to any cause, whichever is first. The censoring is taken in the following order: -if a patient does not have a complete baseline or post -baseline radiographic disease assessment, then the PFS will be censored at the date of rando mization, regardless of whether or not radiographically determined disease progression or death has been observed for the pa tient; otherwise, -if a patient is alive and does not have radiographic progression as of the datainclusion cutoff date , the PFS time will be censored at the date of the last adequate radiographic tumor assessment. Time to progressi onis defined as the time of randomizat ion to the date of the first radiographically documentedPDas defined by RECIST,Version1.1. For each patient who is not known to have had radiographic progressio n of disease as of the data -inclusion cut-off date, or who has died with out radiographic progression of disease, TTP will be censored at the date of the patient’s last radiographic tumorassessment prior to that cut - off date. Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of pat ients with a best overall response (BOR) ofPR or CR . Patients who do not have a tumor response assessment for any reason are considered nonresponders and are included in the deno minator when calculating the response rate . For each treatment arm, the number of patients achieving a response will b e divided by the total of patients randomized to yield the proportion responding: ORR (%) = # of evaluable pat ients who have a best response of PR or CR × 100 # of patients in analysis population Duration of objective response is measured fro m the time measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) tothe date of the first radiographically documented PD as defined by RECIST ,Version1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever i s first."

Determination of Sample Size The study plan is to enroll approximately 450 patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma after failure of any platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet with or without anthracycline. The approximately 450 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Ar m A (paclitaxel plus ramucirumab) and Arm B (paclitaxel plus pl acebo). Patients will be randomized using stratification factors ECOG PS (0 versus 1) a nd peritoneal metastatis (yes versus no). Under the following assumptions:  The randomization ratio is 2:1;  OS in each arm follows exponential distribution;  The OS hazard ratio for Arm A vs Arm B is 0.81;  Control arm median OS = 10.5 months. The primary objective of this study is to eval uate the OS in patients treated with Arm A (paclitaxel plus ramucirumab) versus Arm B (paclitaxel plus placebo) as second line treatment in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma after failure of any platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet with or without anthracy cline (epirubicin or doxorubicin). The study will randomize approximately 450 patients in a 2:1 ratio (300 patients in Arm A and 150 patients in Arm B). The primary analysis will be performed after 336 deaths have occurred (that is, a 25% censoring rate). Assuming an exponential distri bution in each arm and a true underlying HR of 0.81 as observed in the global Study JVBE, 336 deat hs (that is, 25% censo ring rate) will provide at least 80% probability to assure that the effect size observed in this study is consistent with the global study, where effect size is defined by 11 HR . The above assurance probability is defined by Prob උߜመ௃௏஼ோ൐ ߜߩ መ௃௏஻ாඏ, whereJVBEˆ=0.235 was estimated from the observed HR of 0.81 in the global study andJVCRˆ will be estimated from the observed HR in this study.  is a constant set to 0.5, corresponding to 50% eff ect size retention from the global study. Assuming further a constant accrual rate of 12 pa tients/month, it is estimated that a median OS of 10.5 months in Arm B and a median OS of 13 months in Arm A, the study will take approximately 44 months to obtain the required 336 deaths, with (37 months for accrual and 7 months for the follow-up). 12.2.6. Primary Outcome and Methodology Overall survival is measured from the date of randomization to th e date of death from any cause. For each patient who is not known to have died as of the data inclusion cut off date, OS will be censored at the date of last known alive date prior to the data inclusion cut off date."
112,page_112,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 112 LY3009806The primary analysis of OS in this study will estimate the HR and i ts 2sided 95%CIs in a stratified Cox’s proportional hazards model using treatment arm as a single covariate. The stratificat ion factorsincluded in the Cox model areECOG PS (0 versus 1)and peritoneal metastases (y esversus no). An additional analysis wi th an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model will be employed to expl ore the impact of the stratification factor. Stratified (using the same stratificat ion factor) and unstratified log rank tests will also be conducted. The OS curves for each rando mized arm wil l be estimated using the Kaplan Meier (KM) productlimit method. Two sided, 95% CIs for median OS will be co mputed by the Brookmeyer and Crowl ey method. Survival rates at 6 , 12, 18and 24months will also be est imated using KM estimates on the OS curve f or each rando mized arm. Associated two sided 95% CIs will also be calculated. In addition, a multivariate Cox model will be used to adjust for baseline covariates as small imbalances in potential prognostic factors could imp act the analysis of survival . Covariates that are planned to be included are those prognostic factors identified in StudyJVBE. Details of pre specified covariates will be listed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). The final efficacy analysis will be performed when at least 336 d eaths are observed. No interim analysis is planned. The co-primary efficacy object ives include evaluatio ns of PFS and OS. 12.2.6.1. Progression -free Survival The PFS is defined as the time fro m randomization to the date of the first radiographically documented PD as defined by RECIST, Versi on 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever is first. Imaging will be performed every 6 weeks (±5 day s) following the first dose of study therapy for the first 6 months, and every 9 weeks (±5 days) thereafter, until do cumentation of radiographic PD. Patients alive and without disease progression at data cut- off date or patients lost to follow - up will be censored at the day of their last adequate radiographic tumor assessment. If no baseline or post -baseline radiographic assessment is available, the patient will be censored at the date of rando mization. If death or PD occurs after two or more consecut ively missed radiographic visit s, censoring will occur at the date of the las t radiographic visit prior to the missed visits. The use of a new anticancer therapy prior to the occurrence of PD will result in censoring at the date of last adequate radiographic assessment prior to init iation of new therapy . The primary analysis of P FS in this study will estimate the HR and its 2 -sided 95% CI in a stratified Cox’s proportional hazards model using treatment arm as a single covariate. The stratificat ion factors included in the Cox model are the same as rando mization strata. A sensitivity analysis wi th an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model will be emplo yed. Stratified and unstratified log -rank tests will also be conducted. The survival curves for each rando mization arm will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product-limitmethod. Two-sided, 95% CIs for median PFS will be computed by the"
113,page_113,"I4T-CR-JVCR(c) Clinical Protocol Page 113 LY3009806Brookmeyer and Crowl ey method (Brookm eyer and Crowley 1982) using l og-log- transformation. Survival rates at 6, 12, 18 and 24 mo nths will also be est imated using KM estimates on the surviva l curve for each arm. Associated two-sided 95% CIs will also be calculated. In addition, a multivariate Cox model will be used to adjust for baseline covariates because imbalances in potential prognostic factors could impact the analysis of survival. Covariates that are planned to be included are those prognostic factors identified in Study JVBE. Details of pre- specified covariates will be listed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Additional sensitivity analyses for PFS using alternat ive censori ng rules described in the SAP will be performed. 12.2.6.2. Overall Survival Overall survival is measured fro m the date of randomizat ion to the date of death from any cause. For each patient who is not known to have died as of the data -inclusion cut-off date, OS will be censored at the date of last known alive date prior to the data -inclusion cut-off date. The analysis of OS will be conducted via similar methods for PFS, that is, stratified and unstratified Cox model and log- rank tests, KM curve, median est imates and survival rates with CI. An interim OS analysis will be performed concurrent ly with the primary PFS analysis, and a final OS analysis will be performed if the primary objective is not achieved at interim. 12.2.7. Secondary Efficacy A nalyses Secondary efficacy endpo ints include PFS,TTP, ORR and DOR . The PFS is defined as the time fro m randomization to the date of the first radiographically documented PD as defined by RECIST, Versi on 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever is first. Imaging will be performed every 6 weeks (± 5days) following the first dose of study therapy for the first 6 months, and every 9 weeks (± 5days) thereafter, until documentati on of radiographic PD . The primary censoring rules are the fo llowing: if a patient does not have a complete baseline or post baseline radiographic disease assessment, then the PFS will be censored at the date of rando mization, regardless of whether or not radiographically determined disease progression or death has been observed for the patien t; otherwise, if a patient is alive and does not have radiographic progression as o f the datainclusion cutoff date, the PFS time will be censored at the date of the last adequate radiographic tumor assessment.

Time to progression is defined as the time of randomizat ion to the date of the first radiographically documentedPDas defined by RECIST, Version1.1 . For each pati ent who is not known to have had radiographic progression of disease as of the data -inclusion cut-off date, or who has died without radiographic progression, TTP will be censored at the date of the patient’s last adequate radiographic tumorassessment prior to that cut -off date. Time to progression will be analyzed at the sam e time of the fina l analysis for OSusing similar methods as described for OSPFSin Section 12.2.6. Additional sensit ivity analyses for TTP using alternat ive censoring rules will be specified in the SAP. Best overall response (BOR)will be determined using RECIST, Version 1.1. Objective response rate will be calculated as the number of patients who achieve a BOR of CR or PR, divided by the total number of pat ients randomized to the corresponding treatment arm (ITT analysis set). Patients who do not have a tumor response assessment for an y reason are considered as nonresponders and are included in the deno minator when calculat ing the response rate. Objective response rate will be reported along with 2- sided 95% exact CIs using Clopper and Pearson’s method for each treatment arm. The diffe rence of ORR between 2 treatment arms will be evaluated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for ECOG PS and peritoneal metastases . Analyses will be conducted at the same time of the final analysis for OS. Duration of objective response is measured fro m the time measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever is first) to the date of the first radiographic ally documented PDas defined by RECIST, v 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever is first. Patients alive and without radiographic disease progressi on at data -inclusioncut-off date or patients lost to follow -up will be censored at the dateof their last radiographic tumor assessment. DOR will be analyzed using KM method. Medians and their t wo-sided 95% CIs will be calculated. Analyses will be conducted at the same time of the final analysis for OS. 12.2.12. Interim Analyses No interim analyses are planned for this study . If an unplanned interim analysis is deemed necessary for reasons other than a safet y concern, the protocol must be amended. 12.2.12.Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring The primary PFS analysis and an interim OS analysis will be reviewed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) after at least 256 PFS events have been observed. The interim analysis will be conducted to provide early efficacy informat ion and could potentially result in early communicati on with regulatory agencies. The IDMC will be instructed to engage the Senior Management Designee (SMD), who may, if necessary, subse quently form an Internal"
