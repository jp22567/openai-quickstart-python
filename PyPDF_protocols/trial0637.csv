To combat obesity and its myriad comorbidities, annually almost 156 200,000 Americans undergo bariatric surgery, the most effective treatment for obesity. Of contemporary 157 procedures, Roux -en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) achieves the greatest weight loss - between one and two 158 years following RYGB, patients tend to have lost over 30% total body weight. However, the majority of 159 patients regain weight follo wing a two -year nadir [1]. As time from surgery increases, so does the 160 amount of weight regain ed. Some have reported that more than a third of patients no longer manifest loss 161 of more than 50% pre -surgical excess body weight by ten years after sur gery [2]. Weight regain after 162 RYGB is associated with the return of obesity -related comorbidies initially resolved following surgery 163 [3]. Many patient s opt for revisional bariatric surgery to address weight regain , but these procedures are 164 often the source of significant morbi dity [4, 5] . There are currently few non -surgical therapies with which 165 to address inadequate weight loss and weight regain after bariatric surgery, and these are of limited 166 efficacy. 167 168 The use of GLP -1 agonists holds great promise for this population, which likely numbers in the hundreds 169 of thousands in the United States a lone. GLP -1 agonist use has been associated with weight loss in 170 diabetic populations, with a meta -analysis finding an average loss of 3% total body weight with GLP -1 171 receptor agonists v ersus placebo [6]. Further, several recent randomized trials have demonstrated the 172 efficacy of a specific GLP -1 receptor agonist, liraglutide 3 .0mg daily, for the p urpose of weight loss. In a 173 study of overweight and obese subjects who first completed a low calorie diet, W adden and colleagues 174 reported 6.2% weight loss at 56 weeks v ersus 0.2% with placebo [7]. Another recent trial in over 3 ,500 175 overweight and obese patients randomized to liraglutide or placebo, in addition to lifestyle interventions, 176 demonstrat ed 8.0% weight loss in the liraglutide arm versus 2.6% in the placeb o group [8]. Neither of the 177 above randomized trials included overweight or obese patients who had previously undergone bariatric 178 surgery. Although the use of a GLP -1 receptor agonist as an adjuvant to bariatric surgery for weight loss 179 has shown promis e in animal mo dels, this therapy has yet to be tested in humans [9]. 180 181 The use of GLP -1 receptor agonists to augment weight loss and combat weight regain could provide a 182 sorely needed adjunctive therapy to prevent remission following bariat ric surgery. With nearly 200,000 183 bariatric surgical procedures performed annually in the United States, a sizable population of patients 184 experiencing post-surgical weight regain stands to potentially benefit from therapy with liraglutide. The 185 safety and efficacy of the medication in this population must first be assessed, however. The purpose of 186 the present study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of 3.0mg liraglutide to achieve weight los s in 187 patients at least 18 months status -post RYGB who are e xperiencing weight regain at the time of 188 enrollment. 189 1.2 Investigational Agent 190 1.2.1 Name: Saxenda® (liraglutide (rDNA origin)) or matching placebo 191 Saxenda® is a clear, colorless solution. Each 1 mL of Saxenda® solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide and 192 the following inactive ingredients: disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.42 mg; propylene glycol, 14 mg; 193 phenol, 5.5 mg; and water for injection. Each pre -filled pen contains a 3 mL solution of Saxenda® 194 equivalent to 18 mg liraglutide (free -base, anhydrous). 195 196 Match ing placebo will have the same ingredients without the active ingredient ( 6 mg of liraglutide ). 197"

GLP -1 regulates appetite and calorie intake, 249 including via receptors that are present in the brain. The weight reduction effect of liraglutide is 250 due to decreased calorie intake 251 1.2.8 Contraindications 252 • Hypersensitivity to liraglutide or any product component 253 • Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma 254 • Personal or family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 255 • Pregnancy 256 1.2.9 Limitations of Use 257 • Saxenda® i s not indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 258 • Saxenda® and Victoza ® both contain the same active ingredient, liraglutide, and therefore 259 should not be used together. Saxenda® s hould not be used in combination with any other 260 GLP-1 receptor agonist. 261 • Saxenda® h as not been studied in patients taking insulin. Saxenda® a nd insu lin should not 262 be used together. 263 • The effects of Saxenda® on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not established. 264 • The safety and effectiveness of Saxenda® in combination with other products intended for 265 weight loss, including prescription drugs, ove r-the-counter drugs, and herbal preparations, 266 have not been established. 267 • Saxenda® h as not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. 268 1.2.10 Precautions 269 • Black Box Warning 270 • Risk of Thyroid C -cell Tumors 271 o Liraglutide causes dose -dependent and treatment -duration -dependent thyroid C - 272 cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice . It is 273 unknown whether Saxenda® causes thyroid C -cell tumors, including medullary 274 thyroid carcinoma (MTC) , in humans, as the human relevan ce has not been 275 determined. 276 o Saxenda® is contraindicated in patients with a pe rsonal or family history of MTC 277 and in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). 278 Counsel patients regarding the risk of MTC with use of Saxenda® and inf orm 279 them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, 280 dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Do not restart if pancreatitis is confirmed. 287 o Acute Gallbladder Disease: If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected, 288 gallbladder studies are indicated. 289 o Serious h ypoglycemia : Can occur when Saxenda® is used with an insulin 290 secretagogue (eg, sulfony lureas). Consider lowering the dose of anti -diabetic drugs 291 to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. 292 o Heart rate increase: Monitor heart rate at regular intervals. Discontinue Saxenda® if 293 patients experience a sustained increase in resting heart rate. 294 o Renal impairment: Has been reported postmarketing, usually in association with 295 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration which may require hemodialysis . Use 296 caution when initiating or escalating doses of Saxenda® in patients with renal 297 impairment. 298 o Hypersensitivity reactions: Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity 299 reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema). Discontinue Saxenda® and 300 other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice. 301 o Angioedema has been reported with other GLP -1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a 302 patient with a history of angioedema with another GLP -1 receptor agonist because it 303 is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with Saxenda®. 304 o Suicidal behavior and Ideation: monitor for depression or suicidal thoughts. 305 Discontinue Saxenda® if symptoms develop. 306 307 • Adverse Reaction 308 o Most common adverse reactions, reported in greater than or equal to 5% are: nausea, 309 hypoglycemia, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, headache, decreased appetite, 310 dyspepsis, fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, and increased lipase. 311 312 Pregnancy & Lactation 313 314 U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Pregnancy Category: Category X (All 315 Trimesters) 316 317 Crosses Placenta: Unknown 318 319 Clinical Management 320 The brand name Saxenda ®, which is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise for 321 chronic weight management in overweight or obese patients, has a pregnancy category of 322 X. Saxenda ® is contraindicated in all pregnant women, including those who are already 323 overweight or obese, because weight loss may result in fetal harm. If a woman becomes 324 or wishes to become pregnant while on Saxenda ®, discontinue treatment. 325 326 Literature Reports 327 There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of liraglutide in pregnant women. In 328 animal studies, teratogenicity occurred when female rats were given SC doses of 0.1, 329 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (0.8, 3, and 11 times the human exposure at the maximu m 330 recommended human dose (MRHD) based on plasma AUC) starting 2 weeks before 331 mating through gestation day 17.

In pregnant rabbits, teratogenicity was seen following SC doses of 0.01, 338 0.025, and 0.05 mg/kg/day (less than the exposure at the MRHD at all doses) from 339 gestation day 6 through day 18. Reduced fetal weight and dose -dependent major fetal 340 abnormalities were reported at all doses. Malformations at the various doses included 341 kidney and scapula (0.01 mg/kg), the eyes and forelimbs (0.01 mg/kg or greater), the 342 brain, sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels, heart, and umbilicus (0.025 mg/kg), the 343 sternum (0.025 mg/kg and greater), and parietal bones and major blood vessels (0.05 344 mg/kg). Ossification, skeletal abnormalities, and dose -dependent minor skeletal 345 variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities and bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder 346 were seen in all dose groups. 347 348 Breastfeeding 349 Micromedex Lactation Rating: Infant risk cannot be ruled out. 350 351 Available evidence and/or expert consensus is inconclusive or i s inadequate for 352 determining infant risk when used during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits of 353 drug treatment against potential risks before prescribing this drug during breastfeeding. 354 355 Clinical Management 356 It is not known whether liraglutide is e xcreted in human breast milk. In animal studies, 357 liraglutide was excreted unchanged in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations 358 approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. Because data are limited and 359 because of the tumorigenicity potential ev ident in animal studies, either discontinue 360 nursing or discontinue liraglutide considering the importance of the drug to the mother. 361 1.2.11 Storage & Stability 362 363 Preparation for administration 364 • Inject liraglutide S C in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Liraglutide may be 365 administered any time of the day, independent of meals. Do not share pens with other 366 patients. 367 • To reduce the risk of IM injections and for better tolerance, use 4, 5, or 6 mm needles in 368 all patients regardless of BMI or age. Injections should be giv en at a 90 degree angle to 369 the skin surface. When injecting into limbs or a slim abdomen, use a lifted skin fold (4 370 and 5 mm needles) or 45 degree angle (6 mm needle). 371 372 Storage 373 • Store unopened prefilled pens refrigerated, between 2 and 8 degrees C (36 and 46 degrees 374 F). 375 • Store opened pens up to 30 days at controlled room temperature, between 15 and 30 376 degrees C (59 and 86 degrees F), or refrigerated, between 2 and 8 degrees C (36 and 46 377 degrees F). 378 • Protect from excessive heat and sunlight. 379 • Avoid stori ng directly adjacent to cooling compartment in refrigerator. 380 • Do not freeze or use a pen that has been frozen. 381"

When given to bo th normal and obese rats, a significant reduction in food and 384 water intake was noted in both groups, leading to significant weight loss of up to 15% of initial 385 body weight [10]. A similar study in obese mini -pigs also noted substantial weight loss due to its 386 suppressive effect on food intake [11]. Candy -fed rats were also found to have normalized weight 387 and fat levels after administration of lira glutide, reversing the effects of their diets [12]. 388 1.4 Clinical Data to Date 389 (Please see Background and Significance for additional relevant clinical data) 390 391 Initial clinical data regarding the use of liraglutide in the treatment of obesity is from the 392 NN8022 -1807 study conducted by Astrup et al [13]. This was a double -blinded, placebo - 393 controlled trial comparing liraglutide to Orlistat. Liraglutide was administered at 4 differe nt doses 394 – 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg, and 3 mg daily. Patients taking liraglutide lost significantly more 395 weight than both the placebo and Orlistat group s. Based on the success of this trial, participation 396 in the study was extended to two years. Subjects rec eiving the 2.4 mg/3.0 mg liraglutide dos es for 397 two years lost on average 7.8 kg [14]. 67% of patients completed two year follow -up. The most 398 common reasons for discontinuing the study were poor results (placebo arm) and nausea/vomiting 399 (liraglutide arms). 400 401 Further stu dies were then conducted in obe se, non -diabetic subjects. Van Can et a l. showed 402 increased satiety, fullness, and decreased gastric emptying using both liraglutide 1.8 mg and 3.0 403 mg dosing compared to placebo [15]. Thi s suggested that liraglutide -induced weight loss was 404 secondary to reduced appetite and intake rather than increased energy expenditure. Pi-Sunyer et 405 al. conducted a recent trial in which over 3 ,500 overweight and obese patients were randomized 406 to liragluti de or placebo, in addition to lifestyle interventions . These authors demonstrated 8.0% 407 total body weight loss in the liraglutide arm , versus 2.6% in the placebo group [8]. 408 409 None of the above randomized trials included overweight or obese patients who had previously 410 undergone bariatric surgery. Although the use of a GLP -1 receptor agonist as an adjuvant to 411 bariatri c surgery for weight loss has shown promise in animal models, this therapy has yet to be 412 rigorously tested in humans [9]. 413 1.5 Dose Rationale 414 The dosage chosen for this study is 3 mg daily, injected subcutaneously. Dosages are steadily 415 escalated over a 5 week period, from 0.6 mg/day to 3 .0 mg/day. Route of administration is 416 subcutaneous injection, as this is the only current formulation of the d rug. The d osage chosen is 417 based on prior studies in obese patients. Astrup et al. demonstrated that the 3 .0 mg daily do se 418 showed the great est percentage of weight loss in patients, compared to doses of 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 419 mg, without increased adverse events [13]. Subsequent studies have also used the 3 .0 mg dosing 420 and shown comparable weight loss effects [7, 8] . The 3 .0 mg dosing is currently approved by the 421 FDA for the indication of weight loss in overweight and obese individuals. The d osage regimen 422 and period in this study are also based on these prior studies. Liraglutide is a once -daily dosed 423 medicine, with a half -life of 11 -12 hours [16]. 424 1.6 Research Risks & Benefits 425 1.6.1 Risk of Study Drug 426 • Nausea (39.3%) 427"

Randomization will 540 be 2:1 (drug:placebo) with stratification by gender and percent post-operative TBWL (25%, 25 – 49.9%). 541 3.4 Rationale for study Design 542 A randomized, placebo -controlled study design was chosen as this is the methodology that will best 543 assess the efficacy of liraglutide for weight loss in the post -RYGB population. 2:1 randomization was 544 chosen with the intention of increasing potential part icipant interest given better than even odds of 545 randomization to liraglutide. 546 547 A single -center study was chosen given that the NYU Langone weight management program has a pool 548 of 700 post-RYGB patients in our retrospective database , and that recent data from our program suggests 549 that 80 % of patients at least 18 months status -post RYGB exhibit regain of ≥10% of maximum post - 550 surgical TBWL – our program has a potential subject pool of 560. We estimate that at least 50% of 560 551 will be eligible for and agree to participate in the study, which will allow us to be able to enroll adequate 552 subjects from our program alone. In addition, approximately five post-RYGB patients are referred to our 553 program monthly for evaluation of weight regain . In the case that subject recruitment falls short of goals, 554 we would expand recruitment using advertisements. 555 3.5 Primary Study Endpoints 556 Proportion of subjects losing at least 5% of enrol lment body weight at 12 months . 557"

The average weight loss after RYGB is approximately 581 35% total body weight. . However, the majority of patients who undergo this procedure experience weight 582 regain and thus are at risk of, or re -acquire co -morbid conditions , such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus or 583 hypertension. Revisional surgery, which is the most common treatment for weight regain after bariatric 584 surgery, is often thwarted by resistance from insurance companies, leaving patient s with only diet and 585 behavioral change as an option. Due to the fact the GLP -1 agonism plays a significant role in weight loss 586 after RYGB, liraglutide is thought to be a promisin g adjunct to the long -term treatment plan in patients 587 who experience weight regain after RYGB. 588 4.3 Inclusion Criteria 589 • >18 years who are deemed medically stable 590 • ≥18 months status -post RYGB at time of enrollment 591 • BMI of ≥30 kg/m2 or ≥ 27 kg/m2 in the presence of at least one weight -related comorbid 592 condition 593 • Regain of ≥10% of maximum TBWL post -RYGB 594 • Ability to provide informed consent before any trial -related activities 595 • Express willingness to provide signed informed consent and follow protocol requirements 596 4.4 Exclusion Criteria 597 • BMI of >45 kg/m2 598"

The following data points will be requested: medical record number 632 (MRN), DOB (to assess current age), diagnosis, gender, and living status (alive). Patients will be 633 contacted either by phone or e -mail by members of the research team using an IRB approved 634 script. SendSafe Secure email will be used when sending these recruitment e -mails. Once contact 635 is made, approved recruitment language will be used to commun icate the reason they are being 636 contacted and subjects will be asked if they are interested in participating in this specific study. If 637 the potential subjects agree, the study team will provide the subjects with inf ormation regarding 638 the next steps for par ticipation. If a subject is ineligible or chooses not to participate their 639 information will be deleted from the list immediately. PHI, including name, MRN, and DOB of 640 patients who schedule an appointment will be kept on secure NYU servers. This information will 641 be deleted if patient s do not sign an informed consent form during their first visit.

A recent study o f liraglutide versus placebo in subjects weighing 106.2 902 +/- 21.1 kg (BMI 38.2 ± 6.4) at baseline demonstrated that nearly 2/3 of subjects treated with liraglutide 903 for 56 weeks lost at least 5% of enrollment body weight, vs. approximately 1/4 with placebo. We expect 904 to see similar results in our subjects. In order to detect an absolute difference of 36.1% in the proportion 905 of subjects losing at least 5% of enrollment body weight in the liraglutide (expected proportion 63.2%) 906 and placebo arms (expected prop ortion 27.1%), with an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.1, we will require a 907 sample size of 99 (2x liraglutide:1x placebo). In order to account for an estimated loss -to-follow -up of 908 25%, we increase the sample size to 132. 909 7.2 Statistical Methods 910 Data will be anal ysed on an intention -to-treat basis. Missing values will be assessed for patterns and 911 imputed using a multiple imputation method for measurements made after baseline. Patient demographics 912 will be summarized by treatment group. Categorical variables will be presented as proportions, normally 913 distributed continuous variables will be presented as mean ± standard deviation, and skewed continuous 914 variables will be presented as median [interquartile range]. Our primary outcome ( proportion of subjects 915 losing at least 5% enrol lment body weight) will be assessed using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test after 916 accounting for stratification variables . The treatment groups will be furthe r compared by secondary 917 outcomes, using t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, (as appropriate) for continuous variables. Prior to 918 analysis, n on-normally distributed continuous data will be categorized using quartiles or using an 919 appropriate transformation me thod (e.g. log-transformed ). 920 921 Paired sample t -tests assessing change at 6 months and 12 months will be used to test, separately for each 922 treatment group, whether each of the post -intervention measurements differs from the baseline 923 measurement. Change in continuous secondary outcome variables will be compared between treatment 924 groups using inde pendent samples t -tests. An AN COVA model including stratification variables (gender, 925 percent post -operative weight loss) will be used to assess changes in these secondary outcomes. These 926"

They may jeopar dize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of 1003 the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not 1004 result in in -patient hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergen cy department 1005 would typically be considered serious. 1006 1007 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 1008 adverse events . 1009 8.1.4 Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR) 1010 An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event for which a causal relationship (Possible/Probable 1011 relation) between the study drug and the occurrence of the event is suspected.

Subjects will be informed of these exceptions in the informed 1340 consent document. 1341 1342 Only consent forms signed by study subjects will be stored in a locked cabinet in side a locked office on 1343 NYULMC property. 1344 9.2 Confidentiality and HIPAA 1345 Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 1346 the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Those regulati ons require a 1347 signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 1348 • What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 1349 • Who will have access to that information and why 1350 • Who will use or disclose that informa tion 1351 • The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 1352 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, 1353 retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For 1354 subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 1355 permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled s tudy 1356 period. 1357 9.3 Source Documents 1358 Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 1359 clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in 1360 source do cuments. Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospital records, 1361 clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 1362 pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instr uments, copies or transcriptions certified 1363 after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or 1364 magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico - 1365 technical departments involved in the clinical trial. 1366 9.4 Case Report Forms 1367 The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study. All data 1368 requested on the CRF must be recorded. All missing data must be explained. If a space on the CRF is 1369 left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”. If the item is 1370 not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”. All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.

LONG (5 ACTIVITY DOMAINS ASKED INDEPENDENTLY) 1545 AND SHORT (4 GENERIC ITEMS) VERSIONS FOR USE BY EITHER TELEPHONE OR 1546 SELF -ADMINISTERED METHODS ARE AVAILABLE. THE PURPOSE OF THE 1547 QUESTIONNAIRES IS TO PROVIDE COMMON INSTRUMENTS THAT CAN BE USED TO 1548 OBTAIN INTERNATIONALLY COMPARABLE DATA ON HEALTH –RELATED PHYSICAL 1549 ACTIVITY. 1550 1551 BACKGROUND ON IPAQ 1552 THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL MEASURE FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 1553 COMMENCED IN GENEVA IN 1998 AND WAS FOLLOWED BY EXTENSIVE RELIABILITY 1554 AND VALIDITY TESTING UNDERTAKEN ACROSS 12 COUNTRIES (14 SITES) DURING 1555 2000. THE FINAL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THESE MEASURES HAVE ACCEPTABLE 1556 MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES FOR USE IN MANY SETTINGS AND IN DIFFERENT 1557 LANGUAGES, AND ARE SUITABLE FOR NATIONAL POPULATION -BASED PREVALENCE 1558 STUDIES OF PARTICIPATION IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. 1559 Using IPAQ 1560 Use of the IPAQ instruments for monitoring and research purposes is encouraged. It is recommended that 1561 no changes be made to the order or wording of the questions as this will affect the psychometric 1562 properties of the instruments. 1563 Translation from English and Cultural Adaptation 1564 Translation from English is supported to facilitate worldwide use of IPAQ. Information on the availability 1565 of IPAQ in different languages can be obtained at www.ipaq.ki.se . If a n ew translation is undertaken we 1566 highly recommend using the prescribed back translation methods available on the IPAQ website. If 1567 possible please consider making your translated version of IPAQ available to others by contributing it to 1568 the IPAQ website. Fur ther details on translation and cultural adaptation can be downloaded from the 1569 website. 1570 16 Further Developments of IPAQ 1571 International collaboration on IPAQ is on -going and an International Physical Activity Prevalence Study 1572 is in progress.
