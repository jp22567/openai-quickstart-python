Female that is pregnant or lactating/breast -feeding Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration ACE -083 drug product is provided as a lyophilized powder contained in stoppered and sealed glass vials (64 mg/vial ; nominal strength of each vial is 50 mg of AC E-083). After reconstitution with 1.2 mL of sterile water for injection, 1.0 mL will deliver 50 mg ACE -083. Using electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound guidance, each dose of ACE -083 will be administered into the non -tendinous portion of the TA or BB as a series of 4 injections . The use of EMG or ultrasound guidance will ensure that viable muscle is present at the injection site. If the degree of atrophy or fibro -fatty infiltration poses administration challenges, injections of ACE -083 should be distribu ted approximately 2 cm apart into viable muscle. Injection site locations , as well as measures to avoid adjacent nerves and blood vessels and prevent intravascular injection , are outlined in the Investigational Product (IP) Handling Guide. The maximum abs olute dose and schedule is 240 mg/muscle (4.8 mL) administered bilaterally by injection into the left and right TA or BB muscles q4w for up to 30 months (30 doses). Individual Dose Modification Rules For an adverse event (AE, including injection site reac tion) of grade 3 or higher, regardless of relationship to study drug, treatment will be paused and the patient will be monitored weekly. At the discretion of the investigator, dosing may resume upon resolution of the AE to ≤ grade 1 or baseline and dose may be reduced . Up to two dose reductions are permitted: from 240 mg/muscle to 200 mg/muscle and from 200 mg/muscle to 150 mg/muscle. Dose will not be reduced below 150 mg /muscle . Dose delay and/or modification may be considered and implemented unilateral ly or bilaterally. A maximum of 3 dose delays are allowed for subjects receiving q4w injections of ACE -083; only one dose delay is permitted for subjects in the q8w arm of Part 2 of the study. Duration of Treatment Study duration for a subject initially enrolled in Part 1 and then extended to Part 2 will be approximately 33 months, including a 1-month screening period, 6-month Part 1 loading phase , 24-month Part 2 maintenance phase , and 2-month follow -up period ."
16,page_16,"Clinical Study Protocol ACE -083 Study A083 -04 Revision: 00 09 January 2019 Acceleron Pharma Inc. Page 16 of 61 CONFIDENTIAL For subjects who enrolled directly into Part 2 of this study from Part 2 of Studies A083 -02 and A083 -03, the duration of the study will be approximately 26 months , including a 24-month maintenance phase and a 2-month follow -up period. If a subject has a positive anti -drug antibody (ADA) result at the last visit, the subject will be asked to return for additional ADA testing approximately every 3 months until a negative result is obtained or the titer is no longer increasing . Safety Assessment Safety Review Team: An SRT, comprised at minimum of a principal investigator, medical monitor, and an independent neuromuscular specialist, will meet periodically (approximately every 3 months for the first six months, and every six months thereafter) to review safety for each cohort. The review s will includ e all collected safety data and will begin when at least 10 subjects have received at least 3 doses of ACE -083 in this study . The SRT will review safety data , including AEs, laboratory results , and vital signs , to asses s overall safety. The SRT may reques t review of additional data including PD and efficacy measurements . Based on review of relevant data, the SRT will make one or more of the following recommendations:  Continue ACE -083 administration at the current dose  Reduce the dose for all subjects within a cohort , or for the study as a whole  Discontinue one or more cohorts, or the study as a whole Any changes in the dose level or schedule (e.g., continued treatment with q4w or q8w) in this study will be determined following review of study data and reco mmendations from the SRT. Further details on the role of the SRT are included in the SRT Guidelines. Assessments for Evaluation: Safety: AEs, injection site reactions, concomitant medications, clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry, a nd ADA), urinalysis, vital signs, physical examination findings Pharmacokinetics: ACE -083 serum concentrations Pharmacodynamics: Muscle assessments : Muscle volume and intramuscular fat fraction of TA or BB by MRI Biomarkers: including , but not limited t o, serum C -terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) Efficacy: Muscle strength: Quantitative muscle testing using m aximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC ) by hand -held dynamometry and manual muscle testing (MRC grade) of elbow flexion, ankle dorsiflexion , plantar flexion, and/or knee extension Motor function tests: TA muscle function by 10-meter walk/run, 6 -minute walk test, 4-stair climb (subjects from A083 -02 only) , 100-meter timed test ; BB muscle function by PUL test"

Similarly, t he sample size for Part 2 is based upon how many subjects from Part 2 of Studies A083 -02 and A083 -03 and Part 1 of this study participate in Part 2 of this study. Non-inferiority of the q8w or q4w maintenance dose regimen during the first 6 months of the maintenance phase for the percent change in total muscle volume relative to the start of the maintenance phase (or equiva lently the end of the loading phase – either from Part 2 of phase 2 studies A083 -02 and A083 -03 or from Part 1 of this study) will be analyzed . Based upon data from P arts 1 of Studies A083 -02 and A 083-03, it is assumed that the standard deviation is appro ximately 9 . A non-inferiority margin of -5 and a 0.05 significance level is used. If 75 subjects per maintenance regimen participate and the observed mean percent change in total muscle volume at the first 6 months of the maintenance regimen from the sta rt of the maintenance regimen is -2, the probability to conclude that the effect of any single maintenance regimen (q8w or q4w) is non -inferior is approximately 89%. If 65 subjects per maintenance regimen participate and the observed mean percent change i s -2, the probability to conclude that the effect of any singl e maintenance regimen (q8w or q4w) is non -inferior is approximately 85%. If 57 subjects per maintenance regimen participate , the probability is approximately 80%.

Background ACE -083 is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of a modified form of human folli statin (FST) linked to a human IgG2 Fc domain. FST is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF) -β superfamily, a large family of structurally related cytokine -like proteins and cell surface receptors that play pivotal roles in the development, differentiation, and maturation of virtually all cel ls and tissues .1 FST has been shown to be a potent activin antagonist through its role as a natural ligand trap, functioning as a key regulator of activin activit y.2 Growth and differentiation factor 8 (GDF8) , also known as myostatin, is a powerful negative regulator of skeletal muscle development and growth .3 Inhibition of the modulating effects of both activin and myostatin on skeletal muscle growth has been identified as a promising therapeutic approach for degenerative diseases of skele tal muscle .4 Unlike myostatin, which is primarily restricted to skeletal muscle, activin is produced in many different tissues and mediates a wide range of biolog ic processes i n animals and humans throughout all stages of development .5 The challenge for therapeutic intervention in muscle diseases, therefore, has been in the selective inhibition of activin/myostatin activity only in the target tissue (i.e., skeletal muscle) in order to prevent or minimize undesirable effects du e to broad systemic inhibition of activin. ACE -083 has been engineered and developed as a locally -active ligand trap of activin and myostatin , in addition to other ligands. When administered by injection into muscle , ACE -083 remains primarily within the injected muscle , resulting in an increase in mass and strength of the targeted muscle while minimizing systemic distribution and off -target effects . As described in the ACE -083 Investigator’s Brochure (IB), a number of nonclinical pharmacology studies hav e defined the ligand -binding properties of ACE -083 and assess ed its anabolic effects on skeletal muscle in normal animals and in a mouse model of muscle disease. Preclinical studies in normal mice and rats have demonstrated increased muscle mass is a resu lt of increased fiber hypertrophy and not hyperplasia. This ACE -083-induced muscle hypertrophy translate s to functional improvement in muscle strength in normal mice. ACE -083 has also been evaluated in a well -established mouse model of human Duchenne mus cular dystrophy , representative of a degenerative muscle disorder , as well as the SOD1 mouse model of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), representative of a neurogenic disorder . ACE -083 treatment in both mouse models resulted in significant increa ses in the mass and peak strength of the injected muscle. These studies provide evidence that local inhibition of activin/myostatin by ACE -083 can increase muscle mass even in animals with degenerative skeletal muscle disease. In addition, Study A083 -01, a Phase 1, double -bind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of local muscle injections of ACE -083 in healthy postmenopausal women has been completed .6 Forty -two subjects have received ACE -083 at dose s of 50 to 200 mg administered as single or multiple injections into either the right rectus femoris or right TA muscle . ACE -083 was generally saf e and well tolerated in this study with no serious adverse events or grade ≥ 3 AEs reported. A significant dose-dependent change in volume of the injected muscle was noted in the subjects treated with ACE -083.6"

Study Ra tionale ACE -083 is intended for the treatment of focal myopathies that affect specific skeletal muscles and/or muscle groups (e.g., facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy [FSHD], Charcot Marie Tooth [CMT] disease , and sporadic inclusion body myositis [sIBM ]). The initial clinical indications being pursued are FSHD and CMT disease , as specific features of these diseases lend themselves favorably to treatment with ACE -083. The ongoing Phase 2 studies (Study A083 -02 and Study A083 -03) in subjects with FSHD an d CMT , respectively, have been designed to assess safety and tolerability of ACE -083, as well as to determine if local injection of ACE -083 results in clinically meaningful effects on specific skeletal muscles that could result in improved clinical functio n. This study is an extension of A083 -02 and A083 -03 with the primary goal of establishing long -term safety and tolerability of ACE -083. This extension study will also assess the efficacy of ACE -083 in the treatment of FSHD and CMT by examining muscle vo lume, muscle strength, and motor function parameters, as well as patient - and physician -reported disease burden and quality of life measures. Part 2 of this study will evaluate the long -term safety , tolerability, and efficacy of ACE -083, as well as assess different dosing regimens in the maintenance phase to determine if dosing less frequently (q8w versus q4w ) is sufficient to maintain increases in total muscle volume that are produced with an initial 6 -month loading phase of q3w and/or q4w. Less frequent dosing may improve patient convenience and compliance. FSHD is one of the most common muscular dystrophies and has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in most patients .7,8 FSHD is characterized by complex genetic mechanisms relating to the double homeobox protein 4 gene (DUX4). DUX4 is normally repressed in somatic cells through epigenetic mechanisms but is derepressed in FSHD , leading to toxic damage to skeletal muscle cells. The DUX4 gene is located in the D4Z4 microsatellite array in the 4q35 region. In FSHD1, one D4Z4 allele is contracted (1 to 10 repeat units) and has been associated with DNA hypomethy lation and chromatin structural changes. FSHD2 is also characterized by hypomethylation of both normal D4Z4 alleles. Mutations in the SMCHD1 gene resulting in changes in the D4Z4 chromatin structure have been linked to FSHD2. The types are phenotypicall y indistinguishable .9 Laboratory and muscle biopsy findings are often non -specific and therefore are not required for diagnosis ; diagnosis of the most common varian ts of FSHD, as well as o ther rare atypical variants of the disease , is by genetic testing . Patients with FSHD typically present in their second decade of life and live a normal lifespan. The disease is clinically characterized by slowly progressive focal and asymmetric areas of muscle weakness, typically involving facial, scapular, upper arm, lower leg, and abdominal muscles. Weakness of the tibialis anterior (TA), a commonly affected lower extremity muscle in FSHD patients, often results in impaired dor siflexion and foot drop, which can lead to gait instability and falls requiring the use of assistive devices. The biceps brachii (BB) muscle, located in the upper arm, is another muscle that is often affected in FSHD and whose loss of function is detrimen tal to patient movement and quality of life. Another indication being pursued for ACE -083 is the treatment of h ereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN), more commonly known as Cha rcot-Marie -Tooth (CMT) disease. CMT is the most commo n form of hereditary peripheral neuropathy, with a worldwide prevalence of 1 in 2500 individuals ; it affects approximately 125,000 people in the U S.10 A specific mutation in"

Page 22 of 61 CONFIDENTIAL one of several myelin genes results in defects i n myelin formation, structure, and maintenance in patient with CMT type 1 . Duplication of the PMP22 gene causes CMT1A, the most common type of CMT , accounting for approximately 40 percent of cases. X -linked forms of CMT (CMTX) account for approximately 10 to 15 percent of cases11. Patients with CMT typically present with both motor and sensory nerve symptoms , including distal leg weakness, foot deformities (pes cav us, hammer toes), and sensory deficits . Involvement of the hands may also follow as the disease progresses. Weakness in the lower leg manifests as foot drop , and patients have difficulty lifting their toes while walking . As this weakness progresses, pat ients lose mobility and are at increased risk for falls and injury. There is a high unmet medical need for drug therapy options in both CMT and FSHD . Although some clinical and pharmacological trials have been performed in both patient populations , the results have not been encouraging , and there is currently no approved therapy available for either condition .9,12 To date, treatment for both FSHD and CMT has been restricted to symptomatic interventions. Patients will commonly wear braces and/or use assistive devices such as canes and walkers to preserve mobility , but eac h of these orthopedic interventions is associated with practical as well as social limitations. Surgery can successfully treat some, but not all, foot deformities (in CMT) and foot drop (in CMT and FSHD) , but surgical intervention is not appropriate for e very case. Exercise is recommended for some patients; however, the safety of exercise, as well as the appropriate regimen of exercise, must be established for each individual patient .13 In our Phase 1 study , local injection of ACE -083 into the tibialis anterior (TA) of healthy volunteers led to a dose -dependent increase in TA muscle volume. In Phase 2 Studies A083 -02 and A083 -03, subjects received 150 to 240 mg/musc le, unilaterally or bilaterally q3w for 3 months (5 doses , Part 1 ) or 240 mg/muscle bilaterally for 12 months ( 17 doses , Part 2 ). Preliminary data for Part 1 of the study indicated that the study drug was well tolerated and produced significant muscle vol ume increases that were maintained for up to 8 weeks following the last dose. Because CMT disease selectively impacts muscles in the lower leg innervated by longer nerve fibers, including the TA, a locally acting agent such as ACE -083 can be can be used to selectively target atrophied muscle s that are contributing to functional limitations. In CMT and FSHD patients with lower limb weakness and atrophy of the TA, or in FSHD patients with affected BB muscles, an ACE -083-mediated increase in muscle volume h as the potential to increase strength and function associated with ankle dorsiflexion or elbow flexion, respectively . This could improve a patient’s mobility , activities of daily living, and ultimately their quality of life. This study will evaluate the longer -term safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ACE -083 for up to 30 months ."

Overview of Study Design This i s an open -label, multicenter, phase 2 extension study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PD, efficacy, and PK of ACE -083 in patients with FSHD previously enrolled in Study A083 -02 and patients with CMT1 and CMTX previously enrolled in Study A083 -03. Th is study will be conducted in two Parts: Part 1, consisting of a loading phase of 6 months, and Part 2, consisting of a maintenance phase of 24 months . Subjects who enroll in this study without interruption of treatment following the previous study will e nroll directly into Part 2 of this study. Part 1 is a non -randomized, open -label, loading phase in which subjects will receive bilateral injections of 240 mg/muscle ACE -083 every 4 weeks. Part 1 will include subjects previously treated in P art 1 of Stud ies A083 -02 and A083 -03 after a washout period of at least 3 months . Upon completion of this 6 -month loading phase, these subjects will then rollover into Part 2 of this study, which is the maintenance phase. Subjects who complete Part 2 of stud y A083 -02 or A083 -03 will enroll directly into Part 2 of this study without interruption . The end -of-treatment visit in the previous study will coincide with the Day 1 visit of this study. Part 2 is an open -label maintenance phase study in which subjects will be randomized to receive bilateral injections of 240 mg/muscle ACE -083 either every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks. A schematic diagram of subject enrollment and disposition is shown in Figure 1. Duration of Treatment For subject s enrolled in Part 1 and Part 2 of this study, s tudy duration will be approximately 33 months, including a screening period of up to 1 month, the 6 -month Part 1 loading phase, the Part 2 maintenance phase of 24 months, and a 2 -month follow -up period. For subjects who enroll directly into Part 2 of this study from Part 2 of Stud y A083 -02 or A083 -03, study duration will be approximately 26 months , including a maintenance phase of 24 months and a 2 -month follow -up period. These subjects will sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF) for this stu dy at the end -of-treatment visit for Study A083 -02 or Study A083 -03 (i.e., Day 1 of this study) . If a subject has a positive anti -drug antibody (ADA) result at the last scheduled follow -up visit, the subject may be asked to return for additional ADA testin g approximately every 3 months, until a negative result is obtained or the titer is no longer increasing . Part 1 (non -randomized , open -label, loading phase with subjects from A083 -02 Part 1 and A083 -03 part 1 ) Part 1 will consist of 3 cohorts of up to 18 subjects each. In this loading phase, 240 mg/muscle ACE -083 will be administered bilaterally q4w for 6 doses (6 months) into either the TA muscle or BB muscle , depending on the muscle injected in the previous study; subjects may not switch muscle cohort up on enrollment in this study . Subjects in each cohort will be enrolled in a screening period of up to 4 weeks before beginning treatment. Subjects enrolled in Cohorts 1 a and 1b will have complet ed the 3 -month, dose escalation, non - randomized, open -label P art 1 of Study A083 -02. As part of that study, t hese subjects will have"
25,page_25,"Clinical Study Protocol ACE -083 Study A083 -04 Revision: 00 09 January 2019 Acceleron Pharma Inc. Page 25 of 61 CONFIDENTIAL previously received injections of up to 240 mg/muscle ACE -083, either unilaterally or bilaterally, q3w for up to 5 doses. Subjects enrolled in Cohort 1c, will have completed the 3 -month, dose escalation, non - randomized, open -label Part 1 of Study A083 -03. These subjects will have previously received up to 240 mg/muscle ACE -083 bilaterally by injection into the TA every q3w for up to 5 doses. Part 2 (randomized, open -label rollover m aintenance phase, with subjects from Part 1 A083 -04 and A083 -02 part 2 and A083 -03 part 2 ) Part 2 will consist of 6 additional cohorts. Cohort s 2a, 2b, and 2c will receive 240 mg/muscle ACE -083 q4w, and Cohort s 3a, 3b, and 3c will receive 240 mg/muscle AC E-083 q8w. Cohorts are separated and randomized based upon disease (FSHD or CMT) and target muscle (BB or TA). Subjects who complete Part 1 (loading phase ), will immediately r ollover into Part 2 (open -label maintenance phase ) treatment with ACE -083. The subjects will be randomized into treatment groups to receive 240 mg/muscle ACE -083 bilaterally either q4w or q8w. Subjects who completed Part 2 of Study A083 -02 or Part 2 of Study A083 -03 will directly enter into Part 2 (open -label maintenance phase) of th is study and wi ll be randomized to receive 240 mg/muscle either q4w or q8w . The first study visit of this study will coincide with the end-of-treatment visit of the previous study (either A083 -02 or A083 -03). 7.2. Justification for Dose Level A starting dose of 150 mg /muscle was used in the dose escalation cohorts in Part 1 of Phase 2 Study A083 -02 and Part 1 of Phase 2 Study A083 -03, with a maximum dose in these studies of 240 mg/muscle unilaterally or bilaterally q3w for 3 months (5 doses) . All dose s were well- tolerated , including bilateral cohorts . The most common TEAEs in all cohorts were grade 1 injection site reactions , and there were no treatment -related SAEs . Injections of 150 to 240 mg/muscle ACE -083 produced significant , dose-dependent muscle volum e increases that were maintained for up to 8 weeks following the last dose. Based upon these safety and efficacy data, the dose of 240 mg/muscle bilaterally was chosen for Part 2 of the A083 -02 and A083 -03 studies as well as for this extension study. This study will evaluate if long -term, maintenance phase dosing of 240 mg/muscle q8w and/or q4w can maintain total muscle volume increases and functional improvements reached at the conclusion of the loading phase (q3w or q4w for 6 months ). Any changes in t he dose level or schedule in this study will be determ ined following review of study data and recommendations from the SRT. A maximum absolute dose level of 240 mg/muscle has been chosen based in part on administration feasibility and volume constraints. 7.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment Information about the known and expected benefits, risks, SAEs, and reasonably anticipated AEs of ACE -083 is provided in the IB."

DISCONTINUATION / WITHDRAWAL CRITERI A The reasons for treatment discontinuation / study withdrawal must be recorded in the patient’s case report form (CRF). The investigator must notify the sponsor and medical monit or when a patient has been withdrawn from the study. All patients who are withdrawn from the study prior to the end of treatment (EOT) visit should complete the tests and evaluations (excluding the MRI if it has been done within 4 weeks of study withdrawa l) scheduled for the EOT visit (Day 673) at the time of withdrawal and will be asked to return to the clinic to complete the remaining follow -up visit assessment. 9.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Reasons that may lead to discontinuation of study treatme nt include:  Treatment completed  Adverse event  Patient request (withdrawal of consent)  Death  Lost to follow -up  Pregnancy  Protocol deviation  Study terminated by s ponsor1 9.2. Withdrawal from the Study Reasons that may lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the stud y include:  Study terminated by sponsor1  Patient’s request  Screen failure  Patient’s unwillingness or inability to comply with the protocol  Death  Lost to follow -up  Adverse event 1 The sponsor may terminate this study after consultation with the investigator and the SRT at any time f or safety or administrative reasons. The sponsor will terminate the study if the occurrence of SAEs or other findings suggests unacceptable risk to the health of the patients.

Treatments Administered Using electr omyography (EMG) or ultrasound guidance, each dose of study drug will be administered into the non -tendinous portion of the target muscle (TA or BB) as a series of up to 4 equal -volume injections. The use of EMG or ultrasound guidance will help to ensure that viable muscle is present at the injection site. If the degree of atrophy or fibro -fatty infiltration poses administration challenges, injections of ACE -083 should be distributed approximately 2 cm apart into viable muscle. Injection site locations a s well as measures to avoid adjacent nerves and blood vessels , and prevent intravascular injection are outlined in the IP Handling Guide. For Part 1 of this study, t he dose and schedule will be 240 mg/muscle administered bilaterally by injection into the TA or BB muscles every 4 weeks for up to 6 doses . For Part 2, ACE -083 will be administered q4w for up to 24 months (24 doses) or q8w for up to 24 months ( 12 doses) . Subjects who complete the Phase 1 loading phase treatment period will immediately be rando mized into the 24-month maintenance phase . The planned dose scheme s for Parts 1 and 2 are shown in Table 6 and Table 7.

Individual Dose Modification Rules For an adverse event (AE, including injection site reaction) of grade 3 or higher, regardless of relationship to study drug, treatment will be paused and the patient will be monitored weekly. At the discretio n of the investigator, dosing may resume upon resolution of the AE to ≤ grade 1 or baseline and dose may be reduced. Dose delay and/or modification may be considered and implemented unilaterally or bilaterally. Up to two dose reductions are permitted: fr om 240 mg/muscle to 200 mg/muscle and from 200 mg/muscle to 150 mg/muscle . Dose will not be reduced below 150 mg/muscle. A maximum of 3 dose delays are allowed for subjects receiving q4w injections of ACE -083; only one dose delay is permitted for subject s in the q8w arm of Part 2 of the study. 10.2. Safety Review Team An SRT, comprised at minimum of a principal investigator, medical monitor, and an independent neuromuscular specialist, will meet periodically (approximately every 3 months for the first six months, every six months thereafter) to review safety for each cohort. The review s will include all collected safety data and will begin when at least 10 subjects have received at least 3 doses of ACE -083. The SRT will review safety data, including AEs, labo ratory results, and vital signs, to assess overall safety . The SRT may request review of additional data including PD and efficacy measurements . Based on review of relevant data, the SRT will make one or more of the following recommendations:  Continue ACE -083 administration at the current dose  Reduce the dose for all subjects within a cohort, or for the study as a whole  Discontinue one or more cohorts, or the study as a whole Any changes in the dose level or schedule (e.g., continued treatment with q4w or q8w) in this study will be determined following review of study data and recommendations from the SRT. Further details on the role of the SRT are included in the SRT Guidelines. 10.3. Concomitant Medications During screening and throughout the study, subject s may take stable doses of medications for chronic conditions that are not specifically excluded by the protocol. These medications include: single agent low dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg daily), intra -articular/topical/inhaled/intranasal physiologic doses of corti costeroids, and topical physiologic androgen replacement. Any change in medications potentially affecting muscle strength or function (e.g., creatinine, CoQ10, or systemic beta adrenergic agonist) is not allowed. If there is an immediate clinical need du ring the study to prescribe a new medication or a new dosage of an existing medication for either a new or chronic condition, concurrent therapy may be administered at the discretion of the investigator. The investigator may consult the medical monitor re garding what constitutes a stable dose or a chronic condition. Information regarding concomitant medications will be collected beginning at study screening and will include all medications taken within 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1."

Additionally, patients must be withdrawn from study t reatment if at any time during their participation they receive other investigational compound(s) or start any new experimental or approved therapies related to the treatment of CMT or FSHD . This withdrawal excludes standard of care procedures and partici pation in observational research. 10.4. Treatment Compliance Each dose of study drug will be administered via injections at the clinical site by the study staff and will be documented in the study record. Monitoring for patient compliance with the treatment reg imen is therefore unnecessary. 10.5. Randomization and Blinding Part 1: This is an open -label extension study enrolling subjects from Study A083 -02 part 1 and Study A083 -03 part 1 and does not require randomization. Part 2: Subjects who have signed the informed consent and meet all eligibility criteria will be grouped by disease (FSHD or CMT) and target muscle (for FSHD; BB or TA) and then randomized to receive 240 mg/muscle bilateral ACE -083 either q4w or q8w . The randomization scheme will be computer -generated and will be prepared by a statistical group designated by the sponsor. Because this study is an open -label extension of Studies A083 -02 and A 083-03, no blinding is necessary.

Adverse Event For this protocol, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence during the treatment period that occurs in a subject who has received a treatmen t in this pr otocol . An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationsh ip with treatment and can be any unfavorable and unintended sign , symptom, or disease (including an abnormal laboratory finding) temporally associated with the use of the study drug . Abnormal labo ratory and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g., physical exam, ECG) should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead to treatment discontinuation, or are otherwise considered clinically relevant by t he investigator. In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself. In the case of a fatality, the cause of death is considered as the AE, and the dea th is considered as its outcome. 13.1.1.1. Unexpected Adverse Events An unexpected AE is an AE that is not described in nature or severity in the IB under the Reference Safety Information. 13.1.1.2. Events Not to Be Considered as Adverse Events Pre-existing medical condition s/signs/symptoms present before the screening period that do not worsen in severity or frequency during the study are defined as baseline medical conditions and are not to be considered AEs. 13.1.1.3. Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE (after the first dose in this protocol ), occurring at any dose, regardless of causality , that:  Results in death  Is life -threatening: life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred (i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form)  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; however, a hospitalization for an elective procedure will not be considered a SAE  Results in pers istent or significant disability/incapacity  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child of a subject that was exposed to study drug prior to conception or during pregnancy  Is an important medical event: an important medical event is an event that may n ot result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the"

Page 36 of 61 CONFIDENTIAL patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes li sted in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the developm ent of drug dependency or drug abuse. 13.1.1.4. Events Not to Be Considered as Serious Adverse Events Elective hospitalizations to administer or to simplify study treatment or perform procedures are not considered SAEs. Unexpected complications and/or prolongation of elective hospitalization should be recorded as AEs. 13.1.1.5. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and the investigator identifies as related to t he investigational product or procedure. Acceleron follows procedures for the expedited reporting of SUSARs consistent with global regulations and associated guidance . 13.2. Severity Investigators must evaluate the severity/intensity of AEs according t o the C TCAE current version, preferentially using the graded scales. If the severity/intensity of a particular AE is not specifically graded, the investigator should apply the general guidelines for determination of Grade 1 through Grade 5 as listed in the CTCAE v4 cover page (reproduced below), using their best medical judgment: Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated ; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ( e.g., preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.) Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospital ization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living ( e.g., bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden) Grade 4: Life-threatening consequ ences; urgent intervention indicated Grade 5: Death related to AE 13.3. Relationship to Study Drug Investigators must also assess the causal relationship of each AE to study drug. Factors for the assessment of causal relationship include, but are not limited to , temporal relationship between the AE and the administration of study drug, known side effects of study drug, medical history, concomitant therapy, course of the underlying disease and pertinent study procedures."
37,page_37,"Clinical Study Protocol ACE -083 Study A083 -04 Revision: 00 09 January 2019 Acceleron Pharma Inc. Page 37 of 61 CONFIDENTIAL Probabl y: A causal relationship is clinic ally/biologically highly plausible and there is a plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of study drug and there is a reasonable response on withdrawal. Possibl y: A causal relationship is clinically/biologically plausible and th ere is a plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of study drug. Unlikely: A causal relationship is improbable and another documented cause of the AE is most plausible. Not R elated: A causal relationship can be definitively exclud ed and another documented cause of the AE is most plausible. 13.4. Recording Adverse Events It is the responsibility of the i nvestigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. Subjects will be evaluated and questioned generally for AEs during the cours e of the study . The investigator must report in detail all adverse signs and symptoms which a re either volunteered by subjects or observed during or following the course of investigational product administration on the appropriate CRF page. All clearly r elated signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedure results should be recorded as a single diagnosis. All untoward medical occurrences arising after signing of the ICF until a patient is dosed on Dose 1 Day 1 are to be documented on the medical hist ory CRF. All AEs occurring on or after the Dose 1 Day 1 dose through Day 701/End of Study visit are to be reported and documented on the AE CRF. All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient and/or in response to an open question from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination , or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the AE CRF. Any clinically relevant changes in laboratory assessments, or other clinical fin dings as described in Section 13.1 , are considered AEs and must be recorded on the AE CRF. AEs are to be followed until resol ution as described in Section 13.5. It is important that each AE report include a description of the event , duration (onset and resolution dates), severity, relationship to ACE -083, any other potential causal factors, any treatment given , or other action taken (including dose delay or discontinuation of study drug ), and outcome. In addition, SAEs should be id entified and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented. AEs categorized as SAEs must also be documented using an SAE Report Form as described in Section 13.4.1. Specific guidance can be found in the CRF Complet ion Guidelines provided by the s ponsor or designee. 13.4.1. Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after the first study drug administrati on in Part 1 unti l the End of Study visit in Part 2 are to be documented on the AE CRF. For all SAEs, an SAE Report Form must be completed with as much information as possible and submitted within the time frame described in Section 13.5. When new significant information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known, the investi g ator should record the information on a new SA E Report F orm. In all instances, the investigator should follow up with pati ents until the outcome of the SAE is known."

Reporting Adverse Events As described in Section 13.4 , all AEs must be recorded in the CRF up until the last follow -up visit. All subject s who received at least one dose of study drug, whether they completed the treatment period or not, should complete the end of treatment procedures. All AEs will be followed until clinical database lock (or resolution if it occurs before database lock). All SAEs will undergo active follow -up until the event(s) have returned to baseline status , have stabilized , or until the investigator and s ponsor have agree d that follow -up is no longer necessary. Follow -up data for SAEs obtained after clinical database lock will be incorporated into the study drug safety database. If a subjec t experiences an SAE that is considered to be related to study treatment at any time aft er the stu dy, it must be reported to the s ponsor. 13.6. Pregnancy Female subjects who are of childbearing potential at the time of consent or who become of childbearing potential during study participation must agree to use a highly effective method of birth con trol for the duration of the study and for 8 weeks after the last dose of ACE -083. Male subjects and their partners must be using a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study and for 8 weeks after last dose of ACE -083. Subject s must be counseled about effective contraception at the beginning of this study and every three months thereafter until the EOS Visit. All pregnancies occurring during the study and up to 8 weeks after the last dose of ACE -083 must be reported immediatel y to the investigator. The i nvestigator must report all pregnancies to the sponsor within 24 hours of notification. A pregnant subject must discontinue study drug immediately. Monitoring of the subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify Medpace Clinical Safety. At the completion of the pregnancy, the investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy mee ts the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e. , postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 13.7. Reporting Serious Adverse Events If an SAE occurs during the reporting period, the investigator must immediately (i.e., within a maximum 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the contract research organization (CRO ) by telephone, fax, or e -mail. All written reports sho uld be transmitted using the study -specific SAE Report Form, which must be completed by the investigator following specific completion instructions. Names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers for SAE reporting are located on the SAE Report Form and in th e completion instructions provided in the Study Manual. When an SAE (or follow -up information) is reported by telephone, a written report must be sent immediately thereafter by fax or e -mail.

In all cases, the information provided in the SAE Report Form must be consistent with the data that are r ecorded in the corresponding sections of the CRF. The investigator/reporter must respond to any request for follow -up info rmation or to any question the s ponsor or designee may have on the AE within the same timelines as described for initial reports. This is necessary to permit a prompt asse ssment of the event by the s ponsor an d (as applicable) to allow the s ponsor to meet regulatory timelines associated with expedited reporting obligations. Requests for follow -up will usually be made by the responsible clinical monitor or m edical monitor, or in exceptional circumstances , by a pharmacovigilance representative who may contact the investigator directly to obtain clarification on a particularly critical event. 13.7.1. Safety Reporting to Health Authorities, Independe nt Ethics Committees , Institutional Review Boards , and Investigators The s ponsor will send appropriate safety notifications to health authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The investigator must comply with any applicable site -specific requirements related to the reporting of SAEs involving his/her patient s to the IEC or IRB that approved the study. In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the s ponsor will inform the investigator of “findings that could adversely affect the safety of patient s, impact the conduct of the study, or alter the IEC’s/IRB’s approval/favorable opinion to continue the study.” The s ponsor will inform the investigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are considered to be related to study drug (SUS ARs). The investigator should place copies of these Safety Reports in the Investigator Site File. National regulations with regard to Safety Report notifications to investigators will be followed. When specifically required by r egulations and guidelines, the sponsor will provide appropriate Safety Reports directly to the concerned lead IEC/IRB and will maintain records of these notifications. When direct reporting by the s ponsor is not clearly defined by national or site-specific regulations, the investi gator will be responsible for promptly notifying the concerned IEC/IRB of any Safety Reports and for filing copies of all related correspondence in the Investigator Site File. For studies covered by the European Union Clinical Tr ials Directive 2001/20/EC, the sponsor’s responsibilities regarding the reporting of SAEs/SUSARs will be carried out in accordance with that Directive and with the related Detailed Guidances."

Page 43 of 61 CONFIDENTIAL Part 2 Individual pharmacodynamic parameter data will be listed. Descriptive statistics will be provided by cohort, treatment regimen and scheduled time for raw data and changes from baseline. The prim ary pharmacodynamic variable will be the difference in mean percent change in total muscle volume (average of left and right side) for the first 6 months of the maintenance phase (Day 169) from the total muscle volume (average of left and right sides) at the start of the maintenance phase (or equivalently the end of the loading phase). An mixed model will be fitted to the data and a non -inferiority analysis will be performed using a non -inferiority margin of -5. The non -inferiority analysis will be done for each maintenance dose regimen (q4w and q8w) . The lower bound of the one -sided 95% confidence interval will be used to assess non -inferiority. If data from the 6 -month (Day 169) visit are missing, the missing data mechanism will be investigated and an appropriate method for handling the missing data wi ll be applied . Sensitivity analyses will also be performed . In addition, using the same mixed model, the percent change in total muscle volume for the first 6 months of the maintenance phase (Day 169) from the start of the maintenance phase (or equivalen tly the end of the loading phase) will be compared between the two dosing regimens (q8w vs q4w). Secondary MRI pharmacodynamic variables include the difference in mean percent change for contractile muscle volume (average of left and right sides) as well intramuscular fat fraction (average of left and right sides) at the end of the first 6 months of the maintenance phase (Day 169, q4w or q8w) from the start of the maintenance phase (or equivalently the end of the loading phase).

Safety Data Unless otherwise specified, safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics and individual safety data will be listed. AEs will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities , and i ncidence of treatment -emergent AEs will be presented by syste m organ class and preferred term. AE incidence rates will be described by cohort with and without regard to causality. The frequency of occurrence of overall toxicity, categorized by toxicity grades (NCI -CTCAE, current version) will be summarized. Chang e from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters , ECG, and vital signs will be summarized across time. Shift tables will be presented for selected laboratory parameters and vital signs. Physical examination results will be presented in listings. 14.2.6. Pharm acokinetic Data Individual serum ACE -083 concentrations will be listed and summarized by treatment group . Listings will also include dosing times and actual sampling times relative to dosing. Individual and mean concentration data versus time will also be presented grap hically. PK parameters of ACE -083 will be determined using the standard non -compartmental method. Individual PK parameters will be listed and will be summarized by treatment group . 14.2.7. Anti -drug Antibody Data Individual ADA data will be listed. The results of ADA testing for ACE -083 over time as well as results following further characterization of positive ADA samples will also be presented. Exploratory analysis will be performed on the potential effect of ADA on ACE -083 PK exposure if ADA te sts are determined to be positive. 14.3. Determination of Sample Size There was no formal sample size calculation for Part 1 or Part 2 of this study. The sample size for Part 1 is determined by how many subjects from Part 1 of Studies A083 -02 and A083 -03 decid e to participate in this study. Similarly, t he sample size for Part 2 is based upon how many subjects from Part 2 of Studies A083 -02 and A083 -03 and Part 1 of this study participate in Part 2 of this study. Non-inferiority of the q8w or q4w maintenance do se regimen during the first 6 months of the maintenance phase for the percent change in total muscle volume relative to the start of the maintenance phase (or equivalently the end of the loading phase – either from Part 2 of phase 2 studies A083 -02 and A08 3-03 or from Part 1 of this study) will be analyzed . Based on data from Parts 1 of Studies A083 -02 and A083 -03, it is assumed that the standard deviation is approximately 9. A non -inferiority margin of -5 and a 0.05 significance level is used. If 75 subj ects per maintenance regimen participate and the observed mean percent change in total muscle volume at the first 6 months of the maintenance regimen from the start of the maintenance regimen is -2, the probability to conclude that the effect of any single maintenance regimen (q8w or q4w) is non -inferior is approximately 89%. If 65 subjects per maintenance regimen participate and the observed mean percent change is -2, the probability to conclude that the effect of any single maintenance regimen (q8w or q4 w) is non -inferior is approximately 85%. If 57 subjects per maintenance regimen participate, the probability is approximately 80% ."

For these subjects without treatment interruption, the D1D1 procedures shaded in grey may be conducte d as part of the ET visit for Study A083 -02 or A083 -03 and may not need to be repeated for study A083 -04. Visit schedule: All visit -day windows should be considered relative to the date of the previous dose of ACE -083. Actual visit days (e.g. Day 29, Day 57, Day 85) may be different than planned due to windows on visits and potential dosing delays. 2 Limited physical examination (skin, cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological assessments) only. 3 Vital signs (weight, heart rate, syst olic and diastolic blood pressure) must be taken prior to administration of study drug on dosing days 4 MRI assessments should be completed within 5 days prior to scheduled dose administration, with the exception of the Day 1 MRI , which may be completed wi thin 14 days prior to the Day 1 visit. If performed on the same day as study drug administration, the subject should receive the MRI first. MRI assessments during the follow -up period have a ± 5-day window. 5 These function tests may be performed within 3 days prior to Day 1 visit."
