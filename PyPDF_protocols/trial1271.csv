One of the determining factors for pedicle screw fixation is the qual ity of the bone within the vertebral bodies [1, 2]. It’s estimated that 50% and 15% of female and male sp ine subjects respectively, older than 50 years, have osteoporosis [3]. Complications resulting from th e use of pedicle screws in compromised bone may include screw loosening, screw pullout and/or complete hardware failure due to the poor fixation strength of the screws within the vertebrae. Therefore, stra tegies to ensure adequate anchorage of the pedicle screws within the vertebrae are necessary to treat these subjects. Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that the use of bone cement-augmented pedicle screw fixation results in significantly increased holding power of screws in osteoporotic spine [4, 5]. As a result, clinical techniques have been developed whereby bone ceme nt, such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is injected into the vertebral bodies, and when cured serves as the screw interface providing adequate pedicle screw fixation. There are two techniques by which surgeons augment pedicle screw fixation using bone cement. One technique is to create a channel in the pedicle where the pedicle screw will be inserted. Bone cement is first injected into the vertebral body through the ch annel followed by placement of the pedicle screws [6]. This technique increases the fixation strength of the pedicle screws [7] but is associated with additional risks [8, 9]. The second technique is to use a cannulated pedicle screw that has fenestrations or openings in the distal end of the screw. Fenestrated screws (FNS) are inserted into the vertebral body first, and bone cement is then injected through the screw cannula and extruded through the fenestrations into the cancellous bone of the vertebral body. This method also demonstrated increased fixation strength of the pedicle screws [10] as well as decreased cement leakage [11]. The primary safety risks associated with pedicle screw augmentation are the risks associated with cement extravasation either via the interverteb ral vasculature, or perivertebrally through breaches in the cortical shell. Although most cement leakages are asymptomati c [11-15], there are reports of clinically relevant leakages [8, 16]. Two widely accepted procedures that introduce cement into vertebral bodies at considerably higher volumes than FNS are kyphoplasty (K P) and vertebroplasty (VP). In these procedures, cement leakage has been reported from 11.3% [17] to 87.5% [18]. Reports of cement extravasation in PMMA-augmented fenestrated pedicle screw fixation range from 5.7% to 29.3% [13, 14]. The factors associated with the reduced extravasation rate and reduced volume of extravasation per occurrence with FNS is due to the controlled delive ry of a lower volume of cement under fluoroscopic imaging that provides immediate feedback and allows precise control of the cement delivery."

Amendola et al. [19], reported on 21 subjects with poor bone quality due to osteoporosis or tumo r that underwent posterior stabilization by fenestrated pedicle screws and PMMA augmentat ion. Pain improvement and long-term clinical outcome were assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and SF-36 health survey (SF-36) questionnaire. Complications were evaluated in all cases. VAS-pain scores and SF -36 questionnaires showed a statistically significant reduction in pain and improvement in the quality of life during the 36 months’ follow-up period. No screw loosening or screw pullout was observed. In two case s, cement leakage occurred intraoperatively: of these, one subject had transitory nerve root palsy, which improved spontaneously when the excess cement was removed by the surgeon. In three cases, the post-op CT scan revealed a small amount of cement in the canal without clinical relevance. Lubans u et al. [12] described a percutaneous or minimally invasive approach for augmentation of FNS. The safety and effectiveness of this technique was evaluated in 15 elderly osteoporotic subjects (mean T score = -2 .7, range = -2.1 to -4.1). Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Both the VAS-pain scores and ODI questionnaires showed a s tatistically significant improvement up to 13.3 months postoperatively. PMMA asymptomatic extravasations we re observed in 5/15 subjects. There were no cases of severe morbidity post-operatively (no death, no myocardial infarction, no pulmonary emboli, or intraoperative hypotension). Two postoperative complications related to the procedure were noted: one S1 screw misplacement associated with nerve radiculi tis (no cement injected through this screw), and one subcutaneous infection that was treated with 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Du ring the follow-up period, no construct failures, screw fractures, screw pullouts or loss of correction were noted. In another study [14], 37 subjects with degenerative spinal stenosis and osteoporosis (T-score <-2.5) were evaluated after placement of PMMA augmented cannulated pedicle screw s. The clinical outcome measurements included the VAS-pain score and the Prolo scale. The postoperati ve VAS score for low back pain and leg pain (2.30 ± 1.61 and 1.42 ± 0.73) improved significantly (p = 0.006, p = 0.003) from preoperative VAS scores (7.87 ± 0.95 and 8.82 ± 0.83). The average postoperative Prolo score (7.76 ± 1.74) improved significantly (p = 0.01) from the preoperative score (4.22 ± 0.95). There were no screw fractures or construct failures. Pedicle screw loosening was observed in one subject (2.7%). Lo cal extravasations of PMMA into the ventral aspect of the vertebral body were observed in two cases (5.4%). There were no pulmonary emboli or cases of osteomyelitis. Pinera et al. [13] studied 23 elderly subjects with lu mbar degenerative spondylolisthesis with instability, or lumbar stenosis requiring aggressive decompre ssion, that underwent a spinal fusion with PMMA- augmented cannulated pedicle screw instrumentation. All subjects had a history of osteoporotic fractures or had bone mineral density T-scores that indicated osteoporosis (mean T score was -2.4; range -1.8 to -4.1). The results showed that pain and functions improved at 6 months and were maintained over a time. There were no reports of screw pullout or instrumentation failure. There were no cases of adjacent vertebral fractures. Cement leakage was observed in 29.3% of the treated vertebrae; however, no clinical complications secondary to P MMA leakage were reported. CD HORIZON® Fenestrated Screw Spinal System ha s been CE-marked since 2011 and received 510(k) clearance in January 2016. Chandra et al. [20] reported on 25 osteoporotic subjects (average T-score -3.0) with up to grade III spondylolisthesis that were treated with the CD HORIZON® Fenestrated Screw Spinal System. The subject group experienced significant impr ovement in pain (VAS) and disability (ODI) from"

The study will evaluate overall 100 subjects with ar ound 50 subjects (no less than 48 subjects) in each indication subgroup at approximately 10 study site s in Europe. A minimum of 1 subject and a maximum of 25 subjects will be included per site. For each site , no more than approximately 15 patients are allowed to be included per subgroup (degenerative spinal disease, deformity). These limits may be subject to change during the course of the study and will be communicated as appropriate to the Investigators, EC/IRB and regulatory authority, if required. Commercially available study devices will be used in acco rdance with the instructions as listed in the IFUs applicable in each country. Only consented subjects can be enrolled into the study. Every effort will be made to enroll subjects in a consecutive manner. Clinical assessments will be completed at baseline (preoperatively), during the procedure, prior to hospital discharge, and postop eratively at 3 months, 12 months, and 24 months. Radiological assessments will be completed at baseline , prior to hospital discharge (only for deformity subjects if standard of care at the site) and postoper atively at 12 months. All subjects will be followed through the 24-month visit. 6.1 Duration Enrollment in the study for each subject is defined as th e date the subject first signs the informed consent. Enrolled subjects who do not meet baseline eligibility or who do not undergo the fenestrated screw procedure as defined in this protocol will be exited from the study but can be replaced if enrollment is still open. The completion of the study for each subject is defined as th e conclusion of th e 24-month visit (Study Exit). Each subject’s participation in the stud y is expected to last approximately 2 years from the date of the procedure. Each subject will be evaluated prior to the procedure (baseline), during the procedure, prior to hospital discharge, 3 mont hs, 12 months, and 24 months post procedure. The estimated time needed to enroll all subjects is approximately 2 years. The overall study duration, from first subject enrollment to last subject visit, is expe cted to last approximately 4 years. The completion of the study is defined as the approval of the Final Study Re port and closure of all sites. It is anticipated that the total duration of this study will be approximately 4.5 years."

The CD HORIZON® Fenestrated Screw Spinal System with Fenestrated Screw Cement is designed to enhance the fixation strength of instrumentation in vertebrae with compromised bone quality. Currently, in the US, these screws with Fenestrated Screw Cement are 510(k) cleared only for the treatment of advance stage tumor subjects. However, within the US , nearly 50% of the populat ion of subjects requiring spinal immobilization/stabilization procedures for de generative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, trauma (fracture or dislocation), or spinal stenosis, also ha ve compromised bone quality . Outside of the United States, the CD HORIZON® Fenestrated Screw Spinal System is CE-marke d for broader indications and is being used to treat subjects with compromised bone quality. The proposed study design provides an opportunity to collect real-world clinical and radiog raphic data for CD HORIZON® Fenestrated Screw Spinal System with Fenestrated Screw Cement when used for the treatment of degenerative spinal disease or deformity. The proposed primary endpoint at 12 months is sufficient to demonstrate improvement in disability (ODI). Furthermore, literature [21, 22] and previous Me dtronic sponsored studies have demonstrated that subject reported outcomes at 12 months are consis tent with outcomes reported at longer follow-up intervals. To confirm this, we will also be collecting patient reported clinical outcomes at 24 months. In addition, the proposed radiographic evaluation of th e pedicle screws at 12 months is sufficient time to reveal any apparent evidence of implant loosening. To assess long-term safety of the device, subjects wi ll be followed-up for 24 months to collect safety information. 7.Product Description 7.1 General The figure below shows the CD HORIZON® Legacy™ and Solera™ Fenestrated Screw Figure 1: CD HORIZON® Legacy™(left) and Solera™(right) Fenestrated Screw"

Prior to entering the study, the Investigator, or his/her designee, will inform all potential subjects about all aspects of the study (e.g. the purpose and nature of the study, procedures, follow-up schedule, and expected duration). All items addressed in the Patient Information and th e Informed Consent Form must be explained. The language used shall be as non-technical as possi ble and must be understandable to the subject. The Investigator or designee will discuss the foreseeable risks as well as potential benefits that may result from participating in the study and the available alternative therapies. The subject must have ample time and opportunit y to read and understand the Patient Information and the Informed Consent Form, to inquire about details of the clinical study, and to decide whether to participate in the clinical study. All questions ab out the clinical study should be answered to the satisfaction of the subject. Neither the Investigator, nor the in vestigation site staff shall coerce or unduly influence a subject to participate or to continue to participate in the clinic al study. The informed consent process shall not waive or appear to waive the subject’s rights. Subjects will be informed by the Investigator or designee that they are free to refuse to participate in the study, and if they choose to participate, that they may withdraw from the study at any time without compromising fu rther medical care. In addition, subjects will be informed that the Investigator may terminate their participation at any time without their consent. Written informed consent will be obtained prior to subject enrollment and before any study-specific procedures are initiated. Whenever new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s confirmed participation in the clinical study, Medtronic will revise the written Patient Information and Informed Consent Form and inform the Investigators. The revise d information will be sent to the Investigator for approval or notification by the EC. After approval/not ification by the EC, a copy of this information must be provided to the participating subjects, and the informed consent process as described above needs to be repeated. The Investigator should inform the su bject in a timely manner whenever new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subjec t’s confirmed participation in the clinical study. Local practice standards will be used to determine ap propriateness of mental capacity to be able to provide general informed consent. If there is any question, the physician staff attending for the subject will have final authority in deciding the subject’s capacity to provide their own informed consent. The Investigator or designee will also determine th at the potential subject can read, comprehend and make a decision regarding study participation. The original, signed and dated ICF must be retained in the subject’s study records. The informed consent process must be documented in the source document s and a copy of the ICF will be provided to the subject."

Follow-up assessments will be compared to baseline (preoperati ve) assessments to determine changes in health- related quality of life, pain, and disabili ty following the surgical procedure. 9.4.1 Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Disability associated with thoracic/lumbar spine conditions will be assessed using the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire, which yields the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Version 2.1a. [23]. This validated instrument is considered one of the princi pal condition-specific outcome measures used in the management of spinal disorders. The questionnaire will be used at baseline (preoperative ) and at 3-month, 12-month and 24-month visits (post-operative). 9.4.2 Back and Leg Pain (VAS) Levels of back pain and leg pain will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) at baseline (preoperative) and postoperative at 3-month, 12-month and 24-month visits. Subjects will be asked to rate the amount of back pain and leg pain they have had in the last week, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain possible. A summary of the data will be based on actual measur ements or changes in measurements from baseline (preoperative) to postoperative scores. 9.4.3 EQ-5D 5L Questionnaire The EQ-5D 5L (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions ) self-report questionnaire will be used to assess health-related quality of life status [24] at base line and postoperative at 3-month, 12-month and 24- month visits. The EQ-5D 5L questionnaire includes five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimensio n has five levels, reflecting “no health problems,” “slight health problems,” “moderate health problems ,” “severe health problems,” and “extreme health problems.” The EQ-5D 5L will be used for calculating EQ-5D index score. The EQ-5D VAS will also be utilized to document the subject’s self-rated overall health state on a 0 to 100 scale (0 = maximal health-related problems, 100 = minimal health-related problems).  A summary of data from each subject will be based on actual measurements or changes in measurements from baseline (preoperatively) to postoperative scores. 9.4.4 Neurological status Neurological status will be evaluated at base line and at the 12-month follow-up visit."

Each of the sections is compri sed of a number of elements. Following scales will be used to evaluate neurological status: reflexes (0 = Absent or Trace, 1 = Hyper-reflexic, 2 = Normal), sensory function (Light Touch or Pin Prick L1 to S1), motor fu nction (using 0-5 scores 0-5 whereas 0= Total Paralysis, 1 = Palpable or Visible Contraction, 2 = Active Movement, Gravity Eliminated, 3 = Active Movement, Against Gravity, 4 = Active Movement, Against Some Resistance and 5 = Active Movement, Against Full Resistance (full strength) and straight leg raise (posit ive = patient experiences radiating leg pain below the knee on elevating the leg between 15 and 70 with the knee extended, normal = no pain is experienced on elevating the leg between 15 and 70 with the knee extended). Overall neurological success will be defined as maintenance or improvement in all sections (motor, sensory, reflex, and straight leg raising) for the ti me period evaluated. In order for a section to be considered a success, each element in the section must remain the same or improve from the time of the baseline evaluation to the time period evaluated. Th erefore, if any one element in any section does not stay the same or improve, then a patient will no t be considered a success for neurological status. 9.4.5 Fusion Status (for those subj ects where fusion is intended) The surgeon or hospital radiologist will determine fu sion status for those subjects where fusion is intended. Fusion status will be classified as the fo llowing: No fusion success, Fusion success, and Unable to determine. The fusion assessment for each subject will be collected at 12 months, preferably by collecting a CT-scan, alternatively fusion may also be collected through X-rays. The criterion for fusion when assessed through a CT-scan is bony bridging and when assessed through X-rays the criteria bony bridging, no motion (<4 ˚) in Flexion/Extension views, and integrity of the instrumentation (implanted devices). A partial fusion (a fusion not meeting these criteria) should be recorded as “No fusion success”. For multi-level subjects, fusion success will be assessed for each level and overall fusion status for a subject will be defined as achieving fusion at all treated levels . If one level’s fusion status could not be determined while all the levels are success, then the subj ect level is considered unable to determine. If no fusion is observed at the 12-month follow-up, it will be at the di scretion of the Investigator to follow- up if fusion can be observed at 24 months (only if standard of care at the site). In case the patient is symptomatic at 24 months and receives a CT-scan or X-ray, fusion status will be assessed. 9.4.6 Stabilization of the pe dicle screw instrumentation The surgeon or hospital radiologist will review radiographs and or CT’s to assess for evidence of instability of the pedicle screw instrumentation at 12 months. The following are signs of instrumentation instability: xScrew pullout xScrew loosening"

Any evolution of parameters after the surg ery can indicate a change in spinopelvic alignment or a mechanism of regulation/c ompensation due to an evolutio n of the spinal alignment. The following spinopelvic alignment parameters will be assessed in the deformity patients on standing, frontal and sagittal full spine X-ray (at le ast C7 + femoral head must be visible): -Coronal alignment: oDistance between C7 plumb line (vertical line from the center of the C7 vertebral body) and the central sacral vertical line (CSVL) (vertical line drawn from the center of the sacrum). oCoronal curve type: the curve type is determ ined on the basis of maximal coronal angle measured according to standard Cobb technique and will be classified as: Curve type T: patients with a thoracic major curve of >30 ˚ (apical level of T9 or higher) Curve type L: patients with a lumb ar or thoracolumbar major curve >30 ˚ (apical level of T10 or lower) Curve type D: patients with a double major curve, with each curve >30 ˚. Curve type N: patients with no coronal curve >30 ˚. The standard cobb technique to measure coronal angles should be done by drawing a line perpendicular to a second line drawn across the superior endplate of the upper-end (most tilted) vertebra and the inferior endplate of the lowed end vertebra. The angle formed by the intersection of the two perpendicular lines is the Cobb angle, which is the me asure of the magnitude of the curve (see Figure 2)."

These should be documented in the AE eCRF. 9.5.3 Secondary surgery at the index and/or adjacent level(s) throughout the study When a patient requires additional surgery at the index and/or adjacent level(s), it can be an indicator of insufficient outcomes of the initial surgery. Addition al surgeries at the index and/or adjacent level(s) will be collected in the AE eCRF, including cases when th e Investigator or study personnel becomes aware of a second surgery at the index and/or adjacent level in another hospital. Pre-planned secondary surgeries at the index and/or ad jacent level(s) should not be reported as adverse events on the AE eCRF but instead a second surgery eCRF should be completed. The pre-planned secondary surgery should be performed within 3 months as of the time of the initial surgery. There should be at least 1 month in between the pre-planned secondary surgery and 3-month (-1,5/+3 months) follow- up visit to reduce any bias on th e patient reported outcomes. 9.6 Imaging guidelines Study subjects are required to undergo imaging proc edures at specified time points during the study and these will be obtained per the site’s practice. To ensu re consistency in the type and quality of all images obtained throughout this study some requirements have been defined: xClinical sites must use imaging equipment (DXA, X-ray, (q)CT-scan) that are maintained and calibrated according to the manufacturer’s specifications when performing imaging procedures on subjects for this study. Imaging equipment maintenance and calibration will be monitored. xTo reduce the radiation exposure to study subjec ts, all DXA, X-ray and (q)CT examinations should be realized at the lowest radiation dose that st ill provides the minimally required image quality. 9.7 Recording Data The Investigator must ensure accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data reported in the eCRFs and in all other required reports. Data reported on the eCRFs must be consistent with the source documents, and discrepancies need to be justified in a documented rationale, signed and dated by the Investigator, and filed in the subject medical file or appropriate location.  Patient neurological status can be recorded directly on the eCRF and is considered source data. All other source data entered in the eCRFs should be located in the subject’s medical records/source document (electronic or paper), (e.g., hospital recor ds, surgery reports, x-rays, MRIs, CTs, or any other material that contains original information used fo r data collection including the documentation of AEs"

Subject completed questionnaires as well as data collected during subject phone calls will be considered as source data. This study will be conducted using a remote data capt ure system. The Oracle Clin ical Remote Data Capture (RDC) system allows the study centers to enter st udy data into the sponsor’s database over a secure internet connection. Required data will be taken fr om source documents and directly entered into the study database by authorized site personnel in accordance with applicable regulations. Every attempt should be made to complete the required onsite clinic visit. However, if the subject is unable to return to the investigation al site for their scheduled clinic visit at 3 months and 24 months, the study site can contact the subject and collect the fo llowing data remotely using the remote visit source document worksheet: xMedication xVAS back and leg pain – conducted by phone or web-based application xEQ-5D-5L – phone version or web-based application xODI – phone version or web-based application xAdverse events and/or device deficiencies The Principal Investigator or an individual delegated by the Principal Investigator on the Delegation of Authority Log, is responsible for documenting an d entering data for the study on the eCRFs.

In any situation during the conduct of this study the In vestigator shall exercise his/her judgment to always safeguard the subject’s interest independent whether the action to be taken will lead to a Protocol Deviation or not. The Investigator shall report the deviation as soon as possible to Medtronic and the reviewing EC, as required. Medtronic will inform the regulatory authorities, if required. 9.8.2 Reporting requirements for study deviations The Investigator shall adhere to EC requirements an d procedures for reporting study deviations and shall report the deviation as soon as possible to Medtronic. Medtronic is responsible for analyzing deviations, assessing their significance, and identifying any addi tional corrective and/or preventive actions (e.g. amend the CIP, additional training, terminate the st udy, etc.). Repetitive or serious Investigator compliance issues may result in the need to initiate a corrective action plan, and in some cases, freeze enrollment or ultimately terminate the Investigator’s participation in the clinical study. Medtronic will provide investigation site-specific reports to the Inve stigators on a yearly basis summarizing information on deviations that occurred at the investigational site. 9.8.3 Amendments to the Clinical Investigation Plan The Investigator will propose any appropriate modifi cation(s) of the Clinical Investigation Plan or investigational device or investigational device us e. Medtronic will review this proposal and decide whether the modification(s) will be implemented.

Furthermore, Investigators shall sign any approved amendment for agreement. 9.9 Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation Subjects are free to voluntarily wi thdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. The Investigator can only withdraw a subject from the study with a valid reason. Withdrawn or exited subjects will be followed under normal medical practice. Examples of reasons for subject discontinuation include, but are not limited to, those listed below: xPatient Informed Consent procedure not followed xSubject does not meet all eligibility criteria xSubject death xSubject lost to follow-up xSubject voluntarily withdraws from the study xSubject did not undergo the fenestrated scre w procedure as defined in this protocol If a subject is withdrawn from the study, the reason for withdrawal (i f known) shall be recorded in the eCRF and in the subject’s hospital record. Subjects withdrawn from the study will only be replac ed when subjects did not meet baseline eligibility or did not undergo the fenestrated screw procedure as de fined in this protocol and if the enrollment is still open. Compliance to the minimum recommended follow-up sche dule is essential to enable the analysis of the results in a scientifically sound and meaningful way. If, for whatever reason, the subject follow-up cannot be scheduled within the time window or occurred outs ide the time window, it is still essential to schedule a follow-up visit and to document the subject data at a date as close as possible to the calculated follow- up date. As much as possible, it should be avoided that subj ects are lost-to-follow-up and Investigators are urged to do their utmost best to maintain pati ent’s follow-up compliance as per CIP. 9.9.1 Withdrawal of consent: Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason for withdrawal will be documented, if given by the subject, in the source documents"

If a subject withdraws consen t, they will not be replaced. The follow up of these subjects will be according to the standard of care at the site. 9.9.2 Lost to follow up: Before considering a subject as lost to follow up, the Investigator should make every attempt to contact the subject (or relevant other persons associated with the subject) to have the subject return for follow- up to determine their clinical status and th e occurrence/resolution of AEs, if any. Before documenting a subject as lost to follow up, the Investigator should do cument in the eCRF and source documents at least 3 contact attempts with the subject, subject’s relatives or other persons associated with the subject. In ad dition, the Investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject's rights (e.g . if a subject is deceased, the date of death should be completed or if the subject is alive, the date of last contact with subject should be provided). 10.Risks and Benefits 10.1 Potential Risks In all clinical studies, confidentiality of protected health information (PHI) may be breached due to study- related activities beyond those of routine clinical care. This risk will be minimized by not collecting personally identifying information on case report forms. The Investigator must continuously monitor, assess an d document the risks (Declaration of Helsinki 2013). Medtronic is not aware of any significant problems with this product. In the clinical study, the products will be used in accordance with thei r labeling; therefore, no risks other than the risks typically associated with a routine device implantation and follow-ups ar e anticipated. Reference is made to the IFU for a detailed list of all risks and contra-indications associated with the devices. Please specifically note that the CD HORIZON® Legacy™ Fenestrated Screws are contra indicated for pedicular/posterior wall defects and the CD HORIZON® Solera™ Fenestrated Screws are cont raindicated for pedicular/posterior wall defects when used with cement. In addition, subjects are treated according to general clinical practice. No additional risks are associated with participation in this clinical study. 10.1.1 Risk of imaging/Radiation At baseline, a hip DXA scan or spine qCT-scan will be collected depending on the hospital practice. For some patients/sites the hip DXA scan will be part of their standard of care, while for others this may not be the case. The worldwide average effective dose fr om natural background radiation is 2.4 mSv/year. An adult hip DXA has been reported to have an effect ive dose of 0.009 mSV [26]. At baseline and during follow-up, X-ray and/or CT-scan will be collected a ccording to the standard of care so no additional radiation risk is expected. For those countries where the X-ray and/or CT-scan is not standard of care at"

To conclude, the additional radiation risk associated wi th participation in this clinical study is negligible. 10.2 Potential Benefits There may be no direct benefits of study particip ation. However, subject participants may undergo an enhanced level of clinical scrutiny of back health compared to routine clinical care, which may provide some indirect health benefits. 10.3 Risk-Benefit Rationale Participation in this study will not expose the subject to greater risks than if he/she were receiving the CD HORIZON® Fenestrated Screw Spinal System with Fenestrated Screw Cement outside of the study. There might be other discomforts and risks related to the CD HORIZON® Fenestrated Screw Spinal System with Fenestrated Screw Cement and/or this study that ar e not foreseen. The risks are minimized by selecting only qualified Investigators experienced in the field of application and trained in the use of the study device(s) and qualified by education, training, and ex perience to assume responsibility for the proper conduct of the clinical investigation. 11.Adverse Events and Device Deficiencies All AEs, DDs and deaths, regardless of relatedness to su rgical procedure or outcome, should be reported throughout the study in the eCRF an d should be made available to the Me dtronic study team. If applicable, these AEs and DDs will be reported to other countries where studies are conducted with the same or a similar product.

SECONDARY SPINAL SURGICAL PROCEDURES Secondary spinal surgical procedures Secondary spinal surgical procedures will be classified using the following definitions, based on the description provided: • Revision : A procedure that adjusts or in any way modifies the original implant configuration at the index level(s). This includes implantation of any product to enhance fusion, such as auto genous or allogenic bone graft, bone graft substitutes, or bone growth stimulators. This also includes replacement of any device component; supplemental placement of a spinal fixation system; or an uninstrumented posterio r, posterolateral, or anterior fusion surgical inter vention. • Removal : A procedure that removes one or more components of the original implant configuration. Possible reasons for removals can be elective (subject preference) or non -elective (surgeon clinical decision). Non- elective removal is the result of an adverse event or treatment failure. This may occur in the case of migrated, bent, broken or infected device components. Whether removal is elective or non-elective, fusion or non- fusion should be noted at the index level(s). • Reoperation : Any surgical procedure at the index level that is not classified as a revision or removal. • Other : Any additional surgical procedure not classified as a revision, removal or reoperation . Note : Although the use of external bo ne growth stimulators will not be considered a subsequent/secondary surgical procedure, use of external bone growth stimulators to treat the index level(s) will be documented and summarized."

Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling. All device deficiencies must be documented and submitted to Medtronic on the Device Deficiency eCRF. In addition, the Investigat or must also determine and document on the eCRF device deficiencies that did not lead to adverse event but could have led to a serious adverse device effect: xif either suitable action had not been taken, xif intervention had not been made, or xif circumstances had been less fortunate xRefer to Table 14-1 for Investigator reporting timelines for device deficiencies. 11.5 Reporting Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Device Effects, and Device Deficiencies to Medtronic Reporting timelines can be found in Table 14-1 . The preferred way of transmission of AEs and DDs is the Oracle Clinical (eCRF) system, but in case the eCRF cannot be accessed, the Investigator can send an email to rs.mstsafetyspine@medtronic.com . The AE/DD worksheet that can be found in the patient binders may be used for completion of available information, preferably signed by Inve stigators and attached to the email. The same CIP reporting timelines apply for all types of reporting as if the eCRF would be available. 11.6 Deaths All subject deaths must be reported to Medtronic a nd the EC as soon as possible, after learning of a subject’s death, regardless of whether or not the death is related to the device system and/or procedure. The Investigator should also attempt to determine, as conclusively as possible, whether such deaths are related to the device system and/or procedure. If the death is evaluated as device and/or procedure related and unanticipated, the event will be reported as a USADE by Medtronic or its designee to the appropriate regulatory agencies. Any subject death will be reported on the Adverse Even t and Study Exit eCRFs. If limited information is known, the Adverse Event eCRF must be completed with available information as soon as possible. 12.Data Review Committees This study will not use a Clinical Ev ents Committee or Data Monitoring Committee. All devices will be used according to the IFU and patients will be treated acco rding to general clinical practice. Aggregate safety"

If a death occurs attributable to the FN S cement, the study wi ll be terminated. 13.Statistical Design and Methods This is a prospective, single arm and multicenter ev aluation of the CD HORIZON® Fenestrated Screw Spinal System with Fenestrated Screw Cement used in the treatment of spinal conditions in subjects with compromised bone quality. The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed prior to data analysis and will include a comprehensive description of the statistical methods used for the fi nal study report. Any change from the original SAP will be reported in the final study report, along with justification for the change(s). 13.1 Statistical Methods The primary endpoint of the study is the improvem ent of ODI at 12-month visit from baseline and the primary objective of the study is to demonstrate th at the improvement of ODI at 12-month visit from baseline is significantly greater than 0 for each indication subgroup. The null hypothesis is H 0: u_ODI ≤ 0, and the alternative hypothesis is H a: u_ODI > 0 where u _ODI is the mean improvement of ODI score at 12 months from baseline. A paired t-test for normally distribu ted data or Wilcoxon signed rank test for not normally distributed data will be carried out to test whether the mean improvement from baseline is significantly greater than 0. If p-value is ≤ 0.05, then primary objective is met. In addi tion, the descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviations, minimum and maximum will be presented. For the secondary endpoints including improvement of ODI from baseline at 3- and 24-month visit, improvement of VAS back and leg pain score from base line at 3-, 12- and 24-mon th visit and improvement of EQ-5D 5L from baseline at 3-, 12- and 24-month vi sit, similar methods as the one used for the primary endpoint will be used. For the secondary endpoints including neurological success at 12-month visit, intraoperative cement extravasation/leakage, pedicle screw instrumentation stabilization at 12-month visit and fusion success at 12-month visit, simple frequencies will be summari zed. As for secondary endpoints including Device and/or procedure related adverse events through 24 -months and secondary spinal surgeries at index and/or adjacent level(s), resulting from an AE, up to 24 months after the surgery, the event rate will be estimated using time-to-event analysis. The above analyses will be done separately for each indication subgroup. For the deformity group, the secondary endpoints, change in coronal and sagittal spinopelvic parameters from baseline at 12-month visit, will be analyzed using the same me thod as the one for the primary endpoint. "

Again, conservatively assuming 20% attrition rate, the requirement sample size is 48. The study plans to enroll around 50 subjects (no less than 48 subjects) in each indication subgroup. 13.3 Analysis Dataset All the analysis will be based on the primary dataset whic h consists of all subjects who are enrolled in this study, undergo the intended surgical procedure and rec eive the study device. The per-protocol dataset, which excludes from the primary dataset all subjects who violate inclusion/exclusion criteria may also be derived in the case there are a meaningful number of major protocol deviations. Subjects from all sites will be pooled together. The analysis will be based on the observed data. Missing data will not be imputed. 13.4 Interim Analysis An interim analysis will be performed when all the subjects in the degenerative spinal disease indication subgroup have reached the 12-month visit. We antici pate that all 12-month clinical outcomes including the primary endpoint will be finalized at the time of interim analysis. Hence the conclusion on the primary objective should remain unchanged when conducting the final analysis. 14.Ethics 14.1 Statement(s) of Compliance The study will be conducted in accord ance with this protocol, ISO14155 :2011 and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki 2013, all applicable laws and regulatory requirements of the countries in which the study is conducted, in cluding data protection laws and the clinical trial agreement.

This system is a fully validated system. The RDC system maintains an audit trail of entries, changes or corrections in eCRFs. User access will be granted to each individual based on his or her delegation of authorit y and completion of required training . If a person only authorized to complete eCRFs makes changes to an already sign ed eCRF, the system will require the Principal Investigator, or authorized Sub-In vestigator, to re-sign the eCRF. The Principal Investigator, or designated Sub-Investig ator, is responsible for the data submitted and must review all data for accuracy and provide his/her approval of the eCRF and sign each form with an electronic signature. 15.4 Direct Access to Source Data/Documents The Investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study- related monitoring, audits, EC review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data/documents. Medtronic or third-party auditors representing Medtro nic may perform Quality Assurance audits to verify the performance of the monitoring process and study conduct, and to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. Representatives for regulatory bodies such as the FDA may also perform site inspections related to this clinical study. The Principal Investigato r, site personnel, and instit ution will provide auditors with direct access to primary source data and all study-related documentation. Medtronic will investigate, and report suspecte d cases of fraud or misconduct as appropriate. 15.5 Confidentiality Subject confidentiality will be maintained throughout th e clinical study to the extent permitted by law. That is, every attempt will be made to remove subject identifiers from clinical study documents. For this purpose, a unique subject identification code (site nu mber and subject number) will be assigned and used to allow identification of all data reported for each s ubject. This will also ensure that the information can be tracked back to the source data. The sponsor, Medtronic, will collect this key-coded data and monitor study records. Third parties e.g. auditors, ECs, Governmental regulatory authoritie s may also have access to the study records. Participating patients will not be identified by name in any published reports about this study. 15.6 Liability Medtronic Bakken Research Center BV is a wholly ow ned subsidiary of Medtronic, which as the parent company of such entity maintains ap propriate clinical study liability insurance coverage as required under applicable laws and regulations and will comply with applicable local law and custom concerning specific insurance coverage. If required, a clinical study insurance statement/certificate will be provided to the EC, and/or the governing regulatory authority (if applicable)."
