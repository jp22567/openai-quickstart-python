Clarified throughout that this is now a 2 -arm rather than a 3 -arm study, with randomization in a 1:1 ratio rather than a 1:1:1 ratio. Revised Figure 3 (Figure 1in Amendment 03) according to new study design as follows: -Removed 20 -mg dose group. -Changed 14 -mg dose group to 18 mg -Changed randomization from 1:1:1 ratio to 1:1 ratio Section 7.2(Study Rationale) and Section 9.2wererevised and Section 7.3 (Rationale for Dose Selection) was rewritten describing the modified study design, and including Table 1(Simulated O bjective Response Rate [ORR] at 24Weeks) and Table 2(Simulated Average Dose and Proportion of Subjects with at Least One/Two Dose Reduction During 24 Weeks). This was done to make the wording of the protocol flow correctly to include the hist ory of how the doses were selected for the initial study, and then to summarize the changes resulting from the new modeling and simulation, and subsequent discussions with FDA and agreement with EMA . Section 7.2(Pharmacodynamics –Concentration -Effect Relationships) and subsections (7.2.1 and 7.2.2 )were deleted as they were no longer relevant to the current study design . Noted in the Synopsis, Section 9.5.1.5 Schedule of Procedures and Assessments (Table 7) and Section 9.1that treatment assignment was unblinded for all subjects enrolled prior to Amendm ent 03, and that these subjects were transitioned to commercial product or an access program in their country.

The description of the PK/pharmacodynamic analyses (Synopsis and Section9.7.1.7.2 ) also was modified to reflect that the modeling will use a mechanistically based approach if possible. The Number of Subjects section of the Synopsis and Section 9.3(Selection of Study Population) was modified to describe the handling of the initial 41subjects rand omized and subsequently unblinded and transitioned off the study, and the additional subjects who will be screened and randomized in the new design as of Protocol Amendment 03. Section 9.4.2.2 (Management of Proteinuria) wasrevised to be consistent with clearer wording used in newer lenvatinib protocols. Although the wording has changed, the actual management (including any dose modifications) has not changed fr om what was described in the initial wording. Section 9.4.5 (Prior and Concomitant Therapy) and the Clinical Study Synopsis (Concomitant Drug/Therapy) were revised to provide lenvatinib treatment interruption instructions for subjects undergoing surge ry while on study. Section 9.4.5.2 (Prohibited Concomitant Therapies and Drugs) wasmodified to clarify what are and are not prohibited therapies and to clarify the disposition of subjects who do receive such therapies, to be consistent with current wording of newer lenvatinib protocols. In Section 9.5.1.4.4 (Vital Signs and Weight Measurements), text describing blood pressure measurement procedure was revised and clarified to be consistent with clearer wording in newer lenvatinib protocols. Although the wording has changed, the actual procedure for measureme nt of blood pressure hasnot changed from what was described in the initial wording. An optional visit at Cycle 1 Day 22 (C1D22) wasadded to the Schedule of Procedures and Assessments (Table 7)to allow for optional predose blood samples to be taken for PK and biomarker assessment. Vital signs will also be measured, as well as the other assessments that occur throughout the study (eg, AEs). The optional visit/phone call to check on subject’s blood pressure on C1D8 was changed so that C1D8 is a mandatory clinic visit to assess vital signs and to draw predose blood samples for PK and biomarker assessments. These assessments wereadded for theoptional C1D22 visit, if the subject is willing to come to the clinic on that day. Changes reflecting this weremade in Section 9.5.1.5 Schedule of Procedures and Assessments (Table 7), and in the corresponding text in Sections 9.5.1.3.1 (PK A ssessments) and 9.5.1.4.4 (Vital Signs and Weight Measurements ).

Major changes include the following: -Clarified the definition of PFS2 in Sections 9.5.1.2.2 and 9.7.1.1.2 (and Synopsis). -Section 9.7.1.6.1 (and Synopsis): ◦Clarified that the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be based on a noninferiority test on the odds ratio, with a noninferiority margin of 0.4. ◦Removed text pertaining to analysis based o n logistic regression. ◦Removed text related to using the Cochran -Armitage trend test to assess statistically significant increasing trend in ORR 6Macross doses for statistical selection of the optimal dose. -Removed text pertaining to analysis of expected duration of response in Section 9.7.1.6.3 (and Synopsis). -In Section 9.7.1.7 (and Synopsis), clarified that analyses of PK and PK/pharmacodynamic data will include data from subjects treated prior to Amendment 03. -Removed text pertaining to analysis based on logistic regression and reporting of estimated odds ratios for treatment comparisons from Section 9.7.1.8.1 (Primary Safety Endpoint). -Section 9.7.1.8.4 (Laboratory Values) has been revised to reflect the use of CTCAE grading and grade shifts rather than the template language which mistakenly referred to the use of lab normal rang es (low, normal, high) for shift tables that is used in other therapeutic areas. -Revised sample size rationale in Section 9.7.2 (and Synopsis). Changed sample siz e from 210 (70 per arm) to 120 (60 per arm) accordingly throughout. Appendix 5 (NYHA Cardiac Disease Classification) modified to clarify that this classification only applies to subjects with heart failure based on cardiac functional capacity. Corrected the List of Abbreviations and Section 10(Reference List). 14 Dec 2017 Amendment 03.1: Amendment 03.1 was primarily created in response to VHP comments on the statistical methodology for demonstrating the noninfe riority of the lenvatinib 18mg arm as compared to the 24 mg arm, and to implement corresponding changes in the sample size."

Sites Approximately 100 sites gl obally. Study Period and Phase of Development Approximately 60 months duration. Phase 2 Objectives Primary Objective To determine whether a starting dose of lenvatinib 18 mg once daily (QD) will provide comparable efficacy (based on objective response rate [ORR] at 24 weeks [ORR 24wk ]) with an improved safety profile compared to 24 mg QD (based on treatment -emer gent adverse events [TEAEs] of Grade 3 or higher in the first 24 w eeks after randomization). Secondary Objectives To evaluate progression -free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with lenvatinib doses of 24 mg and18 m gQD. To evaluate the PFS after next line of treatment (PFS2) in subjects treated with lenvatinib doses of 24 mgand18 mg QD. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of lenvatinib doses of 24 mg and18 mg QD. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic relationship between exposure and biomarkers/ efficacy/safety , using a mecha nistically based approach ,if possible . To evaluate the impact of lenvatinib treatment on Health -Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as measured by the instruments EQ -5D-3L and FACT -G. Exploratory Objectives To explor eoverall survival (OS) in subjects treated with lenvatinib doses of 24 mgand18 mg QD. To explore thyroglobulin ,thyroid -stimulating hormone ( TSH ), and other serum biomarkers as potential biomarker sfor tumor response . To explore DNA sequence vari ants in genes that may influence PK, safety, or pharmaco dynamic data. Study Design This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind study being conducted as a postmarketing commitment to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to evaluate whether there is a lower starting dosage of lenvatinib other than 24 mg QD that"

The initial study design was to compare starting daily doses of 24 mg, 20 mg and 14 mg lenvatinib. Based on discussions with FDA and EMA (see Sections 7.2and 7.3), the study has been redesigned and t he treatment assignment sof all subjects randomized and treated in Study 211 prior to Amendment 03 were unblinded as of 26 Aug 2016 . Following unblinding , the subjects weretreated with open -label lenvatinib study drug at the dose determined at the discretion of the investigator until they weretransitioned to commercial lenvatinib drug product or an access program in their country. Adverse event (AE) data werecollected for each of these subjects until the ytransition edto lenvatinib treatment outside the study. As per Amendment 03 .1, eligible subjects will have measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (R ECIST 1.1) and will be randomly a ssigned to treatment in a 1:1 ratio to receive lenvatinib 24 mg or 18 mg orally QD, with a total sample size of 152subjects ( 76 subjects per arm). Treatment will be stratified at randomization by age ( ≤65years or >65 years) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 vs 1 or 2. Subjects will receive study treatment until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request to discontinue, withdrawal of conse nt,orlost to follow -up, until the End of Study, or until study termination by the sponsor. After disease progression, subjects will be followed for PFS2 and survival until the data cutoff for the primary anal ysis (ie, end of the Randomizati on Phase) . This study consists of 2 phases, the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase. The Prerandomization Phase will last no longer than 28 days and will include a Screening Period to establish protocol eligibility and a Baseline Period to confirm elig ibility and establish disease characteristics prior to randomization and treatment. The Randomization Phase will consist of a Treatment Period and a Follow -up Period. It will begin at the time of randomization of the first subject and will consist of 28 -day blinded study treatment cycles. The data cutoff for the primary analysis will occur at the end of the Randomization Phase , which is defined as when the last subject enrolled completes the Week 24 tumor assessments or discontinues study treatment if before Week 24. Subjects on treatment at the time of data cutoff for the primary analysis will remain on blinded investigational product until the primary analysis has been completed andwill continue to receive investigational product until they complete the Off -treatment visit prior to their trans ition to commercial lenvatinib (if commercially available for that individual subject) or through an access program administered by the sponsor. While receiving investigational product, subjects should continue with the same assessments as noted in the Schedule of Assessments/Procedures. The last subject’s last assessment ( Off-treatment visit )will be the End of Study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with 1 of 2blinded dosages of lenvatinib in a 1:1 ratio. The Treatment Period for an individual subject will begin at the time of randomization and will end upon completion of the Off -treatment Vi sit, which will occur within 30 days after the final administration of study drug. Serious adverse events (SAEs) must be captured for 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects will undergo safety and efficacy assessments as defined in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments and will continue to receive study treatment until disease progressio n. The Follow -up Period will begin immediately after the Off-treatment Visit and will continue as long as the subject is alive, unless the subject withdraws consent, or until the data cutoff for primary analysis .

Investigators should therefore ensure that subjects enrolled to receive treatment with lenvatinib have BP of ≤150/90 mmHg at the time of study entry and, if known to be hypertensive, have been on a stable dose of antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week before Cycle 1/Day 1. Early detection and effective management of hypertension are important to minimize the need for lenvatinib dose interruptions and reducti ons. Regular assessment of BP should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments. Hypertension will be graded using CTCAE v4.03, based on BP measurements only (and not on the number of antihypertensive medications). If the subject’s initial BP measurement is elevated (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90mmHg), the BP measurement should be repeated at least 5 minutes later. The mean value of 2measurements at least 5 minutes apart is defined as one BP assessment. If the BP ass essment (ie, the mean of the 2 BP measurements obtained at least 5 minutes apart) is elevated (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg), a confirmatory BP assessment should be obtained at least 30minutes later by performing 2 measurements at least 5 minutes apart (to yield a mean value). Lenvatinib should be withheld in any instance where a subject is at imminent risk to develop a hypertensive crisis or has significant risk factors for severe complications of uncontrolled hypertension (eg, BP ≥160/1 00 mmHg, significant risk factors for cardiac disease, intracerebral Treatment -Related Toxicitya,b including hepatic injury and thromboembolic eventsManagement Dose Adjustment Grade 1 or Tolerable Grade 2 Continue treatment No change (continue at Level 0) Intolerable Grade 2c,dor Grade 3 First occurrence Interrupt until resolved to Grade 0-1 or baselineDose level -1once a day (20 or14 mg QD) (1-level reduction from previous) Second occurrence (same toxicity or new toxicity)Interrupt until resolved to Grade 0 -1 or baselineDose level -2once a day (14 or10 mg QD) (1-level reduction from previous) Third occurrence (same toxicity or new toxicity)Interrupt until resolved to Grade 0 -1 or baselineDose level -3once a day (10 or8 mg QD) (1-level reduction from previous) Fourth occurrence (same toxicity or new toxicity)Interrupt until resolved to Grade 0 -1 or baselineStop Treatment or discuss possible dose level -4with sponsor (8 or 4 mg QD) (1-level reduction from previous) Grade 4e: Discontinue Study Treatment Note: For grading see Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.

Once the subject has been on the same antihypertensive medications for at least 48 hours and the BP is controlled, lenvatinib should be resumed as described below Subjects with systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg must have their BP monitored on Day 15 (or more frequently as clinically indicated) until systolic BP has been ≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP has been ≤95 mmHg for 2 conse cutive treatment cycles. If a repeat event of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg occurs, the subject must resume the Day 15 evaluation until systolic BP has been ≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP has been ≤95 mmHg for 2 consecutive treatment cycles. The following guidelines should be followed for the management of systolic BP ≥140 mmHg up to <160 mmH g or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg up to <100 mmHg confirmed on repeat assessment after at least 30 minutes : Continue lenvatinib and initiate antihypertensive therapy, if not already receiving . Continue lenvatinib and increase the dose of the current antihypertensive therapy or initiate additional antihypertensive therapy. The following guidelines should be followed for the management of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg confirmed on repeat assessment after at least 30 minutes: Continue study drug and institute antihypertensive therapy for subjects not already receiving this. For those subjects already on antihypertensive medication, the dose of the current agent may be increased, if appropriate, or one or more agents of a different class of an tihypertensive should be added. If systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg persists despite maximal antihyp ertensive therapy, then study drug administration should be interrupted and restarted at one dose level reduction only when systolic BP ≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP ≤95mmH g and the subject has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for at leas t 48hours . -If systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg recurs on the first dose reduction despite optimal management of hypertension with antihypertensive medications (either by dose increase or the addition of a different class of antihypertensiv e), then study drug administration should be interrupted and restarted at an additional dose reduction only when systolic BP ≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP ≤95mmHg and the subject has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for at least 48 hours. -If systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg recurs on the second dose reduction despite optimal management of hypertension with antihypertensive medications (either by dose increase or the addition of a different class of antihypertensive), then s tudy drug administration should be interrupted and restarted at a third dose reduction dose only when systolic BP ≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP ≤95mmHg and the subject has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for at least 48 hours . -Additional dose reduction should be discussed with the sponsor. The following guidelines should be followed for the management of Grade 4 hypertension (life-threatening consequences): Institute appropriate medical management Discontinue study drug MANAGEMENT OF PROTEINURIA Regular assessment of proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments.

Management of lenvatinib administration will be based on the grade of proteinuria according to instructions contained in Table 4,“Study Treatment Dose Reduction and Interruption Instructions .” 2.Detection and Confirmation -Perfor m urine dipstick testing per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 7). -A 24 -hour urine collection ( initiated as soon as possible and at least within 72 hours) or an immediate spot urine protein -to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) test is requir ed in the f ollowing situations: ◦The first (initial) occurrence of ≥2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick while on study drug ◦A subsequent increase in severity of urine dipstick proteinuria occurring on the same lenvatinib dose level ◦When there has been a lenvatinib dose r eduction and at the new dose level the urine protein dipstick result is ≥2+ -A 24 -hour urine collection (initiated as soon as possible and at least within 72 hours) to verify the grade of proteinuria is required when an immediate spot UPCR is ≥2.4 3.Monitoring -Urine dipstick testing for subjects with proteinuria ≥2+ should be performed on Day 15 of each cycle (or more frequently as clinically indicated) until the results have been 1+ or negative for 2consecutive treatment cycles . MANAGEMENT OF HEPATO TOXICITY Liver function tests (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], bilirubin levels) should be monitor ed at baseline, every 2 weeks for the first 2 mont hs and monthly thereafter, and as clinically indicated (see Schedule of Procedures and Assessments) . If signs/symptoms indicating liver injury occur, instructions contained in “Study Treatment Dose Reduction and Interruption Instructions” should be followed. Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring . If hepatic failure occurs ,study drug must be discontinued. MANAGEMENT OF THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS Subjects should be advised to pay attention to symptoms suggestive of venous thromboembolic events which include acute onset of shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, DVT signs including lower -extremity swelling, and warmth to touch or tenderness. In case any of these symptoms appear, subjects should be instructed to report such symptoms promptly to the t reating physician. If a thromboembolic event is confirmed, instructions contained in “Study Treatment Dose Reduction and Interruption Instructions” should be followed. Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring. If a subject experiences life -threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reactions, including pulmonary embolism, study drug must be discontinued. MANAGEMENT OF POSTERIOR REVERSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME/REVERSIBLE POSTERIOR LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME (PRES/RPLS) In clinical studies with lenvatinib, events of PRES/RPLS were reported in <1% of lenvatinib -treated subjects. PRES/RPLS is a neurological disorder that can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, altered mental function, blindness, and other visual or neurological disturbances. Mild to sever e hypertension may be present. An MRI is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES/RPLS."

In subjects with signs or symptoms of PRES/RPLS, “Study Treatment Dose Reduction and Interruption Instructions” should be followed. MANAGEMENT OF HYPOCA LCEMIA Serum calcium should be monitored monthly per the Schedule of Procedures and Assessments. Corrected serum calcium should be used to assess the grade of hypocalcemia per CTCAE v 4.03, using the following formula: Corrected calcium (mmol/L) = measur ed total Ca (mmol/L) + 0.02 ×(40-serum albumin [g/L]) The formula is not applicable when serum albumin concentration is normal ( ≥40 g/L); in such situations, the total (uncorrected) serum calcium should be used. Hypocalcemia should be treated per inst itutional guidelines (eg, using appropriate calcium, magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation) until resolution. Duration of Treatment The duration of treatment for each subject is estimated to be: Prerandomization Phase : 4 weeks Randomization Phase: Depending upon when a subject is enrolled, their time on treatment may range from 6 months to 42 months. Treatment will continue until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request to discontinue, withdrawal of consent, subje ct is lost to follow -up, sponsor termination of the study, or until the End of Study . Subjects still on treatment will remain on blinded investigational product until the primary analysis is complete and will continue to receive investigational product until they complete the Off -treatment visit prior to their transition to commercial lenvatinib or an access program. While receiving investigational product, subjects should continue with the same assess ments as noted in the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures. Concomitant Drug/Therapy Any treatment that is considered necessary for the subject’s health and that is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of thyroid cancer may be administered duri ng the study. Treatment of complications or AEs or therapy to ameliorate symptoms (including blood products, blood transfusions, fluid transfusions, antibiotics, antidiarrheal d rugs, etc ) may be administered at the discretion of the investigator unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation of thyroid cancer. If a subject is receiving treatment with lenvatinib and requires surgery during the study, the stop time and restart time of lenvatinib should be as follows: •For minor procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 2 days before the procedure and restart it at least 2days after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding. •For major procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 1 week (5 half -lives) prior to surgery and then restart it at least 1 week after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding. Any additional procedural or patient -specific particularities should be discussed bythe investigator and the sponsor. Aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and anticoagulants are permissible but should be used with caution. The following are prohibited: Other investigational drugs Other antitumor therapies (except for thyroid hormone suppressive therapy) such as chemotherapy, palliative radio therapy, antitumor interventions ( eg, surgical resection), or cancer immunotherapy"

Investigator -determined response assessments will be performed at each assessment time point and entered onto the case report form (CRF) . Baseline tumor imaging scans will be sent to an imaging core laboratory designated by the sponsor for prospective eligibility confirmation . All postbaseline scans will be archived by the s ites and available for potential future review. Tumor assessments will be carried out following the guidelines provided by the imaging core laboratory. Historical scans (within prior 12 months; an additional month will be allowed to accommodate actual da tes of performance of screening scans, ie, within ≤13 months) that do not follow the guidelines completely may be used to demonstrate eligibility, as long as they meet minimum standards as separately defined by the imaging core laboratory. Tumor assessmen ts (CT chest, and CT or MRI neck, abdomen, pelvis, and other known or suspected sites of disease) will be performed during the Prerandomization Phase and then every 8 weeks (within the 8th week) from the date of randomization during treatment cycles in the Randomization Phase. A bone scan will be performed during the Prerandomization Phase to establish a baseline (a historical bone scan performed within 6 weeks before randomization is acceptable), every 24 weeks, and as clinically indicated. Lesions ident ified on bone scans should be followed with cross -sectional imaging. A brain scan will be performed at screening and as clinically indicated. For subjects with a history of protocol -eligible treated brain metastases, a brain scan will be required at all tumor assessment time points (eg, every 8 weeks). Subjects discontinuing treatment without disease progression in the Randomization Phase will continue to undergo tumor assessments every 8 weeks until disease progression is documented or another anticanc er therapy is initiated. Pharmacokinetic Assessments Sparse PK samples will be collected from all subjects and will be analyzed using the population approach. Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other Biomarker Assessments Samples will be collected at protocol specified time points as indicated in the Schedule of Procedures and Assessments and may undergo enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex bead-based immunoassay and/or other appropriate analysis procedures to explore thyroglobulin, antithyroglobulin autoantibodies (anti -Tg), and other serum biomarkers (including VEGF, Ang -2, sTie-2, and FGF23) . A blood sample will be collected for potential pharmacogenomic analysis from all consented subjects except where prohibited by regional or local laws. Variation in lenvatinib exposure or the occurrence of AEs observed in the study population may be evaluated by correlating single –nucleotide polymorphisms with PK, safety, or pharmacodynamic data. Safety Assessments Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording of all AEs, including all CTCAE v4.03 grades (for increasing severity), and SAEs; regular laboratory evaluations for hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs; ECGs; and the performance o f physical examinations. An echocardiogram or a multiple -gated acquisition (MUGA) scan including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) will be performed at screening, and as clinically indicated."

If the progression leads to an untoward medical occurrence (incr eased pain, pleural effusion, etc), then this medical occurrence should be the AE. Disease progr ession is a study endpoint and is to be captured in the CRF per the guidelines for reporting disease progression. Other Assessments Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL ) will be assessed at Baseline (prior to first dose of study drug), before performing tumor assessment scans every 8 weeks until Week 24, then every 16 weeks, and at the Off-treatment Visit. Subjects will complete the EQ -5D-3L and FACT -G questionnaires. The EQ -5D-3L generic QoL questionnaire comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each dimension has 3 levels (1) no problem, (2)some problem, or (3) extreme problem. Thus, the final scor ing consists of 243 possible combinations or health states. The utility value for each state is assigned based on a set of preference weights (tariffs) elicited from the general population. The FACT -G QoL questionnaire is comprised of 4 domains: physical, socia l/family, emotional, and functional well -being. Each domain is scored on a 5 -point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Subscale scores are added to obtain a total score. Bioanalytical Methods Lenvatinib will be quantified by means of a validated liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry/ mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) method. Statistical Methods Study Endpoints Primary Endpoint s Objective response rate (ORR) at 24 weeks (ORR 24wk ) as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1.

For the analysis of the primary safety endpoint, frequency (number and percentage) will be summarized for TEAEs with a CTCAE grade of 3 or higher by treatment (24 mg and 18 mg), and the differ ence in the frequency between the 2 treatment groups will also be presented with 95% CI . Analysis of Secondary Endpoints: Progression -free survival and PFS2 will be analyzed using stratified Cox regression including treatment as a factor and baseline ECOG PS and age group as strata. The e stimated hazard ratio (HR) will be reported for the treatment comparison between the 24-mg and18-mgdose groups along wit h the corresponding 95% CIs. The Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit estimates for each treatment group will be reported and plotted over time. PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to second objective disease progression (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who are alive and for whom a second objective PD has not been observed will be censored at the last time they are known to be alive and without a second objective PD.Subjects who were enrolled prior to implementation of Amendment 03 and who discontinued lenvatinib treatment due to progressive disease or due to an AEwere followed for PFS2 until the date that the last subject transitioned to lenvatinib treatment outside the study (the data cutoff date for this group of 41 subjects). PFS2 data for these subjects will be included in a separate report. Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints: Duration of response will be summarized using descriptive statistics among responders for each treatment group. Therates of durable SD, DCR (SD, CR, or PR), and CBR (CR, PR, and durable SD) and the corresponding 2 -sided 95% CIs will be calculated by treatment group. BOR of SD must be at least 7weeks following randomization. Durable SD is SD at lea st 23 weeks after randomization. Treatment differences (percentage -point difference) for 24 mg vs18will be summarized along with the corresponding 95% CIs. To explore OS, the m edian survival time and the survival rates at 12, 18 and 24 months will be calculated using KM product -limit estimates for each treatment group and presented with 2 -sided 95% CIs. The KM estimates of OS will be plotted over time. Subjects who were enrolled prior to implementation of Amendment 03 and who discontinued lenvatinib treatment due to progressive disease or due to an AEwere followed for survival until the date that the last subject transitioned to lenvatinib treatment outside the study (the data cutoff date for this group of 41 subjects). OS data for these subjects w ill be reported separate ly. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other Biomarker Analyses Pharmacokinetic Analyses Plasma PK lenvatinib exposure parameter s will be summarized by use of descriptive statistics and plotted as appropriate for each treatment group. Plasma concentration data , including data from subjects randomized before Amendment 03, will be analyzed using a population PK approach to estimate population PK parameters. The analyses will be detailed in a separate analysis plan. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data from subjects random ized before Amendment 03 will be included in the models whenever possible. Lenvatinib exposure parameters (AUC or concentration at the time of the event or c umulative AUC, as appropriate) derived from the population PK analysis will be related to biomarker, safety, and efficacy data and will be modeled using a mechanistically based approach ,if possible .

For efficacy, a tumor growth inhibition model based on long itudinal tumor size measurements of target lesions will be included. Lenvatinib exposure and measured biomarkers ( including thyroglobulin [accounting for anti -Tg], TSH , VEGF, Ang -2, sTie -2, FGF23 ) will be explored as predictors or correlations with tumor burden changes in the tumor growth inhibition model. Other analyses will include logistic regression analysis for ORR 24wk , KM plots of PFS data stratified by lenvatinib exposure, and Cox -regression analysis. For the Cox -regression analysis of PFS, adjustm ent will be made for each subject ’sbaseline characteristics or tumor -related features. In addition to lenvatinib exposure, changes in biomarker concentrations (thyroglobulin and TSH) and/or tumor burden will be related to PFS. For the exposure -response r elationship of safety, the model -based analysis will include the following AEs: hypertension, proteinuria, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. For hypertension, BP data will be analy zed using an indirect -response model. For proteinuria, urine dipstick and/or 24 -hour urine data will be analyzed using a longitudinal categorical logistic regression analysis with Markov element. For weight loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, data will be analyzed using a longitudinal categorical l ogistic regression analysis. For time to treatment discontinuation due to an AE and time to first dose reduction, KM plots stratified by lenvatinib exposure will be prepared. For the exposure -response relationship for biomarkers, thyroglobulin (accounti ng for anti -Tg),TSH , VEGF, Ang -2, sTie -2,and FGF23 data will be analyzed using a model -based approach. Direct, indir ect, and effect compartment models will be explored. Population PK and PK/ pharmacodynamic analyses will be detailed in a separate analysi s plan. Biomarker Analysis The effect of lenvatinib treatment on serum thyroglobulin ,TSH ,and other exploratory serum biomarkers will be summarized by treatment group. Associations between clinical outcomes and baseline biomarker levels , and/or change in levels from Baseline will be explored. The analys is may be detailed in the biomarker analysis plan ( BAP)and reported separately . Safety Analyses All safety analyses will be performed by treatment group. The incidence of TEAEs, intolerable Grade 2 TEAEs that lead to dose interruption, dose reduction, or drug discontinuation, and SAEs will be summarized and rates will be descriptively summarized. Time to treatment discontinuation due to an AE, number of dose reductions, and time to first dose reduction will be summarized . Other Analyses Laboratory test results, vital signs and their changes from baseline, and 12 -lead ECG results, will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Abnormal values will be flagged. Prior an d concomitant medications, medical / surgical history and subject demographics will be summarized and listed. Descriptive statistics of the derived functional/symptom scales according to the scoring manual and global health status scores will be summarized at each time point by starting dose. A separate prespecified HRQoL analysis following FDA and EMA patient -reported outcomes Guidelines will be performed and detailed in a separate SAP and a separate HRQoL report.

Assuming a 70% retention of the effect of lenvatinib 24 mg v ersus placebo in Study 303 , the noninferiority margin on the odds ratio (OR)scale is estimated to be 0.40 ( ie, Ha: OR [18mg/24 mg] >0.4). A sample size of 1 52subjects ( 76per arm) will provide a statistical power of 80% to declare noninferiority, a ssuming a 1 -sided alpha of 0.0 25, an ORR 24wk of 54.4% for lenvatinib 24mg,and a true OR of 1 with a noninferiority margin of 0.4. The sample size of 152subjects will also prov ide a precision for the observed differences between the arms with half -widths of the 95% CI of about 15%."

Lenvat inib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to thei r normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET ( LENVIMA Package Insert ). Lenvat inib was approved for the treatment of pat ients with progressive, radioiodine -refractory different iated thy roid cancer (RR -DTC) by the U SFood and Drug Administrati on (FDA) on 13 Feb2015, by the Pharm aceut icals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), Japan on 26 Mar 2015, and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 28May 2015. TheCommittee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP )granted a positive opinio n for LENVIMA (lenvatinib mesilate 4 mg and 10 mg capsules) on 26 Mar 2015 and the European Commissio ndecisio n was adopted on 28 May 2015. Lenvat inibis indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic, different iated (papillary/fo llicular/Hürthle cell) thyro id carcino ma, refractory to radi oactive i odine. This study is being conducted as a postmarketing com mitment for the FDA and the EMA. 7.1 Clinical Experience With Lenvatinib in Thyroid Cancer In Phase 3 study E7080 -G000 -303(Study 303) in subjects withRR-DTC , lenvatinib treatm ent dem onstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit as measured by progressi on-free survival ( PFS). Based on Independent Imaging Review (IIR) assessments, lenvat inib pro longed median PFS by 14.7 months compared with placebo (18.3 months vs 3.6 months, respectively). The difference in PFS between the lenvatin ib and placebo arm s was highly stati stically significant ( P<0.0001) using both stratified and unstratified log-rank tests. The hazard ratio estimated from the stratified Cox proportional hazard m odel was 0.21 (99% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14, 0.31) in favor of lenvat inib."
36,page_36,"Clinical Study Protocol incorporating Amendment 06E7080 -G000 -211 Eisai FINAL: 09 Jan 2020Confidential Page 37of 110Lenvat inib treatment also resulted in a highly statistically significant effect on re sponse rate (complete response [ CR] +partial response [ PR]) com pared wi th placebo (64.8% vs 1.5%; P<0.0001). Four subjects in the lenvat inib arm had a complete response, an at ypical finding for an antiangiogenic agent. The objective response rate ( ORR )of the l envatinib -treated subjects at 6 months was 57.5% (n=150). Thus, at 6 months, approximately 89% of the subjects who ult imately responded had already achieved a response. Ad hoc analyses of Study 303 data indicated that lenvat inib induced a rapid on set of tumor shrinkage, with a large init ial reduct ion (median reduction of 28% at 8 weeks after rando mizat ion) in the sum of the diameters of target lesio ns at the first tumor assessment, followed by cont inued reduction of 1.3% per month for the duration of treatm ent. Importantly, subjects who required a dose reduction fro m the 24 mg starting dose (median time to reduction was 3 months) due to toxicit y had al ready achieved the m ajority of their tumor shrinkage prior to the first dose reduction (median tim e to first response was 2months). This appears to be a unique advantage of lenv atinib co mpared with other VEGF -targeted agents. About 79% of subjects in Study 303 needed dose reductions from the starting dose of 24 mg because of treatment -emergent AEs (T EAEs), with the second and third most frequent doses administered being 14 mg and 20 mg, respect ively. The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥30% of subjects, any grade) in the lenvat inib arm o f the Safet y Analysis Set were (in descending order of frequency ) hypertensi on, diarrhea, decreased appet ite, weight decreased, nausea, fat igue, headache, stomat itis, vo miting, proteinuria, palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, and dysphonia. Hypertensio n and proteinuria were the TEAEs that led to dose red uctions most frequent ly. Both these TEAEs are related to target engagement. In Study 303, PFS was si gnificantly lo nger in lenvatinib -treated subjects who had a TEAE of hypertensio n during treatm ent com pared wi th subjects who di d not devel op hy pertensi on during treatment (18.8 vs 12.9 months, respect ively; P=0.0085, unstratified log -rank test). The difference in overall survival ( OS)between subjects with and without hypertensio n was also statist ically significant ( P=0.0003) using the unstratified log -rank test. The development of hypertensio n was also predict ive of the efficacy of lenvat inib for ORR and tumor shrinkage. These data suggest that the TEAE of hypertensio n is a predict ive biomarker of tumor response and target inhibit ion. Refer to the Rando mized Phase clinical study report (CSR )and the Open -Label Results CSR for complete study resul ts. 7.2 Study Rationale After reviewing the pre -NDA Briefing Book for lenvat inib in RR-DTC , FDA noted that 79% of the subjects rando mized to receive lenvat inib in Study 303 were unable to tolerate the starting dose of 24 mg daily and requi red dose reducti on, and expressed concern that an optimal dose of lenvat inib has not been established for the treatment of patients with progressive RR-DTC . Clinical co mments sent by the FDA on 25 Apr 2014 in response to the submitted Expanded Access Protocol, E7080 -G000 -398, again stated that the FDA was concerned that toxicit y associ ated wi th the 24 -mg/day dosing regimen used in Study 303 is increased. They remarked that if lenv atinib is approved based on the review of Study 303,"
37,page_37,"Clinical Study Protocol incorporating Amendment 06E7080 -G000 -211 Eisai FINAL: 09 Jan 2020Confidential Page 38of 110the FDA will require that the safet y and efficacy of lower l envatinib doses be explored postm arket ing. This protocol wasdevel oped in response to the FDA’s request that Eisai conduct a study to test the hypothesis that a lower dose or alternative dosing regimen may result in co mparable efficacy with less toxi city in pat ientswith progressive RR-DTC . Eisai agreed to conduct such a study using object ive response rate at 24 weeks (ORR 24wk ) as the primary endpoint ,since 57.5% of subjects had an object ive response at 24 weeks and an ad-hoc analysis o f Study 303 dem onstrated that ORR predicted PFS and OS benefit. This m ulticenter, randomized, double -blind ,Phase 2 tri al of lenvat inib (E7080) in subjects with RR-DTC was ori ginally designed to evaluate whether an oral starting dose of 20 mg or 14 m g daily woul d provi de com parable efficacy to a 24 -mg starting dose with an improved safet y profile. The study design and study endpo ints were agreed upon by the FDA as specified in the NDA Approval Letter (13 Feb 2015). When the protocol was init ially designed, the dose regimens were chosen based on available inform ation that indicated that doses of 14 m g and above were projected to provide exposures that overlap with at least ~two -thirds of that of the 24 m g dose, and the 14, 20, and 24 m g were the m ost comm on lenvat inib doses used in Study 303 in DTC. The revised study design of Protocol Amendment 03is gui ded by resul ts of new m odeling andsimulat ion data that indicate that the starting dose of 14 mg is considered highly unlikely to achieve efficacy comparable to the approved starti ng dose of 24 m g, whereas a starting dose of 20 mg is not sufficie ntly dist inct from 24 mg to achieve improved safet y. Therefore, an 18 -mg starting dose was selected as the comparator. More informat ion appears in Secti on7.3. 7.3 Rationale for Dose Selection Following addi tional discussi ons with the FDA on 26 Jul 2016, the l ower starting dose sof lenvat inib were changed from 14 mg and 20 m g to a single lower dose level, 18 m g. This decisio n was based on the results of tumor -growth -inhibit ion (Emax) simulat ion studies presented in Table 1and Table 2. The E max model was created through a collaborative effort between Eisai and the FDA. Table 1 Simulated Objective Response Rate at24 Weeks Dosing RegimenORR (%) 24 weeks 24 mg without up -titration 50.0 18 mg without up -titration 41.5 14 mg with up -titration 41.7 20 mg without up -titration 43.5"

The results of the simulat ions provide devidence contradi cting the assumption o f equipoise between the 14-mg and 24 -mgtreatm ent arms . The resul ts suggest that while subjects treated with the exist ing 14 -mg dose regimen would likely experience less toxicit y, the efficacy of this dose regimen could be co mpro mised. The FDA also observed that the 20 -mg dose regimen would not provide sufficient ly lower exposure to different iate it from the 24-mgdose. The FDA reco mmended the inclusion of eit her an 18 -mg dose regimen wit hout up-titration (f or ease of administration) or a 14 -mg dose wi th up-titration. After internal discussio n, Ei sai decided that because of ease of administration, the 18-mg regimen shoul d be used as the co mparator . Subsequent ly, the study design has been discussed and agreed with the EMA. 8STUDY OBJECTIVES 8.1 Primary Objective To determine whether a starting dose of lenvatinib 18 m gonce dai ly (QD) will provide comparable efficacy (based on ORR 24wk ) with an improved safet y profile co mpared to 24 mg QD (based on treatment -emergent adverse events [TEAEs] of G rade 3 or higher in the first 24 weeks after randomization)."

The purpose of the Screening Period is to obtain informed consent and to establish protocol eligibilit y according to the inclusio n and exclusio n criteria listed in Secti ons9.3.1 and 9.3.2 . Informed consent will be obtained after the study has been fully explained to eac h subject and before the conduct of any screening procedures or assessments. Procedures to be fo llowed when obtaining informed consent are detailed in Section5.3. Subj ects m ust have a histologically or cy tologically confi rmed diagnosis of papillary or follicular RR-DTC that meets the cri teria for being 131I-refractory , and must have radiographic evidence of disease progress ionwithin the pri or 12 m onths as defined in the inclusio n criteria. The Screening Disposit ion Case Report Form (CRF) page must be completed to indicate whether the subject is eligible to participate in the study and to provi de reasons for screen failure, if applicable. 9.1.1.2 Baseline Period The purpose of the Baseline Period is to establish disease characterist ics prior to rando mizat ion to treatment, and to confirm protocol eligibilit y as specified in the inclusio n/excl usion criteria. Results of baseline assessme nts must be obtained and reviewed by the investigator prior to the first dose of study drug (Cy cle 1 Day 1 [C1D1]) to confirm eligibilit y. Baseline assessments may be perform ed on Day -1 or on C1D1 prior to treatment. Subjects who conti nue to meet the cri teria for inclusi on/excl usion (Secti ons 9.3.1 and 9.3.2 ) will begin the Rando mizat ion/Treatment Phase. 9.1.2 Randomization Phase The Randomization Phase will consist of a Treatment Period and a Fo llow-up Peri od. It will begin at the time of rando mizat ion of the first subject and will consist of 28 -day blinded study treatm ent cy cles. The data cutoff for the primary analysis will occur at the end of the Randomization Phase, which is defined as when the last subject enrolled completes the Week 24 tum or assessments or di scont inues study treatment before Week 24 .Subjects on treatm ent at thi s time will remain on blinded investigat ional product until the primary analysis has been co mpleted. After study unblinding, subjects will cont inue to receive investigat ional product until they co mplete the Off -treatment visit prior to their transit ion to commercial lenvatinib or an access program.

Subsequently, s imulation models co-developed wit h the FDA showed that the median ORR 24wk for the 14 -mg dose without up -titration woul d likely be decreased by more than 50% compared wit h the 24 -mg dose and was, therefore, not acceptable from an efficacy standpoint. Consequent ly, analternat ive lower starti ng dose of 18 mg was selected. Object ive response rate at 24 weeks (ORR 24wk ) is the primary endpoint, since 57.5% of subjects had an object ive response at 24 weeks and an ad -hoc analysis o f Study 303 demonstrated that ORR predicted PFS and OS benefit . Randomization will be used in this study to avoi d bias in the assignment of subjects to treatm ent, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg, demographics and baseline characterist ics) are balanced across treatment groups, an d to ensure the validit y of statistical com parisons across treatm ent groups. Blinding to treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collect ion and evaluation of endpo ints, particularly the safet y endpoints . 9.3 Selection of Study Population Prior to Am endment 03, approximately 300 subjects were planned to be screened to provide 210 randomized subjects (70 per arm) . A total of 56 subjects were screened andof these , 41subjects were randomized and treated . Efficacy and safet y data for the se41subjects enrolled from study start until they transit ionedto lenvat inib treatment outside the study will be reported separately."

Invest igators should therefore ensure that subjects enro lled to receive treatment with lenvat inib have BP of ≤150/90 mmHg at the time of study entry and, if known to be hypertensive, have been on a stable dose of ant ihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week before Cycle 1/Day 1. Early detecti on and effect ive management of hypertensio n are important to minimize the need for lenvat inib dose interruptions and reductions. Regular assessment of BP should be conducted as detailed in Schedule of Procedures/ Assessments ( Table 7). Hy pertensi on will be graded using CTCAE v4.03, based on BP measurements only (and not on the number of ant ihypertensive medicat ions). If the subject’s init ial BP m easurement is el evated (s ystolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90mmHg), the BP measurement should be repeated at least 5 minutes later. The mean value of 2 measurements at least 5 minutes apart is defined as one BP assessment. If the BP assessment (ie, the mean of the 2 BP meas urements obtained at least 5 minutes apart) is elevated (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg), a confirmatory BP assessment should be obtained at least 30 minutes later by performing 2 measurements at least 5 minutes apart (to yield a mean value ).Grade 1 or Tolerable Grade 2 Continue treatment No change (continue at Level 0) Intolerable Grade 2c,dor Grade 3 First occurrence Interrupt until resolved to Grade 0 -1 or baselineDose level -1once a day (20 or14 mg QD) (1-level reduction from previous) Second occurrence (same toxicity or new toxicity)Interrupt until resolved to Grade 0 -1 or baselineDose level -2once a day (14 or10 mg QD) (1-level reduction from previous) Third o ccurrence (same toxicity or new toxicity)Interrupt until resolved to Grade 0 -1 or baselineDose level -3once a day (10 or8 mg QD) (1-level reduction from previous) Fourth occurrence (same toxicity or new toxicity)Interrupt until resolved to Grade 0 -1 or baselineStop Treatment or discuss possible dose level -4with sponsor (8 or 4 mg QD) (1-level reduction from previous) Grade 4e: Discontinue Study Treatment Note: For grading see Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.

Subjects will be stratified by age ( ≤65years or > 65years) and ECOG PSof 0 versus 1 or 2. The rando mizat ion scheme and identificat ion for each subject will be included in the final CSR for this study . Randomization will be performed centrally by an interactive voice and web response system (IxRS). The IxRS or clinical supply vendor will generate the randomized blister card ident ificat ion numbers. At enrollment (and after successful co mpletion o f Visit 1), the investigator or designee will call /log into the IxRS to register the subject information. At randomization (Vi sit 2), the IxRS will assign each subject a uni que 6 -digit randomizat ion number. To dispense every subsequent carton (or 2 cartons ), the investigator or a designee will call /log into the IxRS to obtain dispensing instructions and register the subject’s visit and whether the same or a reduced dose should be dispensed . 9.4.3.1 Selection of Doses in the Study Twodosing regimens ( 24 m gand 18 m g) will be evaluated in this study beginning with Amendment 03 .See Section 7.3for informat ion on dose selection and timing of dose for each s ubject .

Additionally, all diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures relating to malignancy should be recorded. Any medicati on that is considered necessary for the subject’s healt h and that is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of or interact with lenvatinib may be cont inued during the study. Treatment of complicat ions or AEs, or therapy to ameli orate symptoms (including blood products, blood transfusio ns, fluid transfusio ns, antibiotics, and ant idiarrheal drugs), may be given at the discret ion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation of (or to interact with) lenvatinib. If a subject is receiving treatment with lenvat inib and requires surgery during the study, the stop time and restart time of lenvat inib shoul d be as follows: For minor procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 2 days before the procedure and restart it at least 2 days after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding. For m ajor procedures: stop l envat inib at least 1 week (5 half -lives) prior to surgery and then restart it at le ast 1 week after, once there is evidence o f adequate healing and no risk of bleeding.

Approximately 9 samples per subject will be obtained. The a ctual time and date of PK blood collection as well as t ime of drug administration will be r ecorded on the appropriate page of the CRF. On Cycle 1/Day 1, subjects will be instructed not to take the Cy cle1/Day 8dose of lenvat inib prior to arriving at the study site. Similar instructions will be given to the subjects regarding the Cy cle 1/Day 15, Cycle 1/Day 22 (if the subject will be coming to the study site for this visi t), and Cy cle 2/Day 1 doses. The Cycle 1/Day 8, Cycle 1/Day 15, Cycle 1/Day 22 (opti onal)and Cycle 2/Day 1doses of l envatinib will be administered at the study site at approximately the same t ime of day as the Cycle 1/Day 1 dose was administered in order to accommodate PK sample co llection timing.

A blood sam ple will be collected for potential pharmacogeno mic analysis fro m all consented subjects except where prohibited by regional or local laws. Variat ion in lenvatinib exposure or the occurrence of AEs observed in the study popul ation may be evaluated by correl ating single –nucleoti de polymorphisms wit h PK, safet y, or pharm acodynamic data. Data obtained will be used for research purposes, to assist in developing safer and more effect ive treatments and will not be used to change the diagnosis of the subject or alter the therapy of the subject. The DNA will not be used to determine or predict risks for di seases that an individual subject does not currently have.

Determinat ion of the overall safet y profile and tol erabili ty of lenvatinib ,the time to treatment discont inuat ion due to an AE,number of dose reductions, and the time to first dose reduction are secondary study endpo ints. As part of the overall safet y and tol erabili ty assessment , the rate of TEAEs of Grade 2 that are intolerable and lead to dose reductio n, dose interruption, or drug discontinuat ionwill be determined (Secti on7.2). Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recordi ng all AEs, including all CTCAE v4.03grades (for increasing severit y), and SAEs; regular laboratory evaluat ion for hematol ogy, blood chemistry , and urine values, periodic measurement of vital signs, ECGs; and the performance of physical examinat ionsas detailed in Table 7. An ECG or multiple- gated acquisit ion (MUGA) scan including left ventricular eject ion fraction (LVEF) will be perform ed at screening and as clinically indicated."

Progression of a subject’s thyroid cancer and signs and symptoms clearly related to disease progression should not be captured as an AE. Disease progression is a study endpoint and shoul d be captured in the CRF as per the guidelines for reporting disease progression. 9.5.1.4.1 ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST An AE is any untoward m edical occurr ence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an invest igational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. For this study , the study drug is lenvatinib administered at starting dosesof 24 m gand 18 m ggiven QD. The cri teria for identifying AEs in this study are: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or disease tem porally associated wi th the use of an invest igational product, whether or not considered related to the invest igational product Any new disease or exac erbat ion of an exist ing disease. However, worsening of the primary disease shoul d be captured under efficacy assessments as disease progression rather than as an AE. Any deter ioration in nonprotocol -requi red m easurements of a l aboratory value or other clinical test (eg, ECG or x -ray) that resul ts in symptom s, a change in treatment, or discontinuat ion of study drug Recurrence of an intermittent medical condit ion (eg, headache) n ot present pretreatment (Baseline) An abnormal laboratory test resul t shoul d be considered an AE if the ident ified laboratory abnorm ality leads to any type of intervent ion, whether prescribed in the protocol or not. A laboratory resul t shoul d be considered by the investigator to be an AE if it: Results in the wit hdrawal o f study drug Results in wit hholding of study drug pending so me invest igational outcome Results in an intervention, based on medical evaluation (eg, potassium supplement for hypokal emia) Results in any out -of-range l aboratory value that in the investigator’s judgment fulfills the definit ions of an AE wi th regard to the subject’s medical profile Increases in severit y compared to baseline by 2 or more CTCAE grades (see Appendix 6 for CTCAE v4.0 3), with the except ion of lymphocytes, albumin, cholesterol, glucose, and phosphate. For these tests, any change of 2 or more grades will be evaluated by the"

All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF. All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected be ginning from the time the subject signs the study ICF through the l ast visit. Subjects who fail screening primarily due to AE(s) must have the AE(s) leading to screen failure reported on the Screening Disposit ion CRF. Abnorm al laboratory values shoul d not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be part of the clinical syndro me that is being reported as an AE. It is the responsibilit y of the investigator to review all laboratory findings in all subjects and determine if they consti tute an AE. Medical and scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an iso lated laboratory abnorm ality shoul d be classified as an AE. Any laboratory abnormalit y considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF. Abnorm al ECG (QTc) resul ts, if not otherwi se consi dered part of a clinical symptom that is being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTc interval is more than 4 80ms and there is an increase of more than 60 ms from baseline. Any ECG abnormalit y thatthe investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such. Progression of malignant disease should not be recorded as an AE in studies where it is included as an endpo int for underlying disease. If the progression leads to an untoward medical occurrence (increased pain, pleural effusio n, etc), then this medical o ccurrence shoul d be the AE. Disease progression is a study endpo int and i s to be captured in the case report form per the guidelines for reporting disease progression. All AEs must be fo llowed for 28days after the subject’s last dose, or until reso lution, whichever comes first. Subjects with onset of an AE or deterioration of a preexist ing AE will be fo llowed unt il resolut ion to baseline, start of a new ant icancer treatment, or death. Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its severity and its relationship to the study treatment. Adverse events will be graded on a 5 -point scale according to CTCAE v 4.03(Appendix 6). Invest igators will report CTCAE grades for all AEs (for both increasing and decreasing severit y). For Grade 2 AEs that lead to changes in study drug administration (dose held, dose reduced, or dosing discontinuation), the invest igator will be re quired to confirm in the CRF that the AE is considered intolerable. Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatm ent are: Temporal relati onship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatm ent The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuat ion of study treatm ent or reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable"
64,page_64,"Clinical Study Protocol incorporating Amendment 06E7080 -G000 -211 Eisai FINAL: 09 Jan 2020Confidential Page 65of 110Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatm ent or wi th other similar treatments The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the event The presence of nonstudy , treatm ent-related factors that are known to be associated with the occurrence of the event Classification of Causality The rel ationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the CRF in response to the following question: Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the study drug caused the AE? Yes (rel ated) A causal relat ionship between the study drug and t he AE is a reasonable possibilit y. No (not related) A causal relat ionship between the study drug and the AE i s not a reasonable possibilit y. 9.5.1.4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST AnSAEis any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: Results in death Is life -threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to con tinue, might have caused death) Requi res inpat ienthospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study drug) Other important medical events that m ay not be immediately life -threatening or resul t in death or hospitalizat ion but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes in the definit ion of SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situat ions. In addit ion to the above, events associated with special situat ions include pregnancy or exposure to study drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error. These events associated with special situat ions are to be captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they meet o ne of the above criteria. All AEs associated with special situations are to be reported on the CRF whether or not they meet the cri teria for SAEs."

The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse event” (ie, there i s no untoward m edical occurrence) associated with the hospitalizat ion: Hospitalizations for respite care Planned hospi talizat ions required by the protocol Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condit ion requiring the hospi talizati on has not changed afterstudy drug administrati on) Hospitalization for administration of study drug or insertion of access for administration of study drug Hospitalization for routine maintenance o f a device (eg, battery replacement) that was in place before study entry If possible, a blood sample for the measurement of study drug plasma concentration shoul d be drawn at the first report of an SAE or a severe unexpected AE and at its resolution. 9.5.1.4.3 LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS Clinical laboratory tests will be perf ormed locally . All bl ood and urine samples will be collected and sent to the local laboratory on the day o f collection unless otherwise instructed. Laboratory certificat ion as available will be included in the final CSR for this study . All hematol ogy, blood chemistry (including pregnancy test, as applicable), and urinalysis samples are to be obtained prior to study drug administrati on and results reviewed prior to administration/dispensing of study drug at the beginning of Cycl e 1, and wi thin 48 hours of Day 1 of all subsequent cy cles. Refer to Table 4for the management of specific cli nically significant laboratory abnorm alities. A laboratory abnorm ality may meet the cri teria to qualify as an AE as described in this protocol (see Secti on 9.5.1.4.1 and the CRF Completion Guidelines ).

The EQ -5D-3L generic QoL questionnaire co mprises 5 dimensions: mobilit y, self-care, usual activit ies, pain or disco mfort, and anxiet y or depressio n. Each dimensio n has 3 levels (1) no probl em, (2) som e probl em, or (3) extrem e probl em. Thus, the final scoring consists of 243possible co mbinat ions or health states. The utilit y value for each state is assigned based on a set of preference weights (tariffs) elicited from the general population . The FACT -G QoL questi onnaire is com prised of 4 domains: physical, social/family , emotional, and f unctional well -being. Each domain is scored on a 5 -point scale fro m 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Subscal e scores are added to obtain a total score. 9.5.1.5 Schedule of Procedures and Assessments Table 7presents the schedule of procedures and assessments for the study ."

Subjects who choose to discont inue study drug pri or to disease progression will be followed in the poststudy treatm ent follow-up peri od and continue to undergo regularly scheduled disease assessment until documentat ion of disease progression or initiation of alternative ant icancer treatment. All subjects who discont inue study drug will be fo llowed for PFS2 and OS,and all postprogression cancer treatments administered will be recorded. Subjects may at any t ime withdraw consent for further study parti cipati on. No f urther data will be co llected on subjects once consent has been wit hdrawn. All subjects who di scont inue the study are to complete the study ’s early discont inuat ion procedures indicated in the Schedule of Procedures and Assessments (Table 7). The invest igator will pro mptly explain to the subject invo lved that the study will be discontinued for that subject and provide appropri ate m edical treatment and other necessary measures for the subject. A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be fo llowed up by mail, phone, or other means to gather information such as the reason for failure to return, the status of tre atment com pliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs and symptoms. Subjects who discont inue early fro m the study will be discontinued for one of these primary reasons: AE (s), lost to follow -up, subject choice, progressive dise ase, or administrative/other. In addit ion to the primary reason, the subject may indicate oneor more secondary reason (s) for discont inuat ion. Study disposi tion informat ion will be co llected on the Subject Disposi tion CRF.

The OR of ORR 24wk(18 m g vs 24 mg) al ong wi th the 9 5%CI will be calculated using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) method stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1 or 2) and age group ( ≤65 or >65 y ears). Overall ORR will also be analyzed according to the same approach for ORR 24wkas a sensit ivity analysis. 9.7.1.6.2 SECONDARY EFFICACY ANALYSES The stratified log -rank test using ECOG PS and age group as strata will be used to compare differences in PFS and PFS2 as assessed by invest igator between the 24-mg and 18 -mg treatm ent groups. The hazard ratio (HR) for the corresponding treatment comparisons will be est imated by the stratified Cox regressio n including treatment as a factor and baseline ECOG PS and age group as strata. The estimated HR will be reported for the treatm ent comparison b etween 24 m g vs 18 mg, along wi th the corresponding (2-sided) 95% CI. The Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit est imates for each treatment group will be reported and plotted over time. PFS2 i s defined as the time from randomizat ion to second objective disease progressi on, or death fro m any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who are alive and for whom a second objective disease progression has not been observed will be censored at the last time they are known to be alive and wit hout a second objective dis ease progression. Subjects who were enrolled prior to implementation of Amendment 03 and who discont inued lenvat inib treatm ent due to progressive disease or due to an AEwere followed for PFS2 until the date that the l ast subj ect transi tioned to l envat inib treatment outsi de the study (the data cutoff date for this group of 41 subjects). PFS2 data for these subjects will be included in a separate report. 9.7.1.6.3 EXPLORATORY EFFICACY ANALYSES Durati on of response will be defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression, the end of response shoul d coincide wi th the date of progressio n or death fro m any cause used for the PFS endpo int. The time o f the init ial response will be defined as the latest of the dates contributing towards the first visit response of PR or CR. If a subject does not progress following a response, then their duration of respon se will use the PFS censoring t ime. Durati on of response will be summarized using KM product -limit est imates for each treatm ent group and presented with 2 -sided 95% CIs. The rates of durable SD, DCR (SD, CR,or PR) ,and CBR (CR, PR ,ordurable SD) and the corresponding 2 -sided 95% CIs will be calculated by treatm ent group. BOR of SD must be at least 7 weeks fo llowing rando mizat ion. Durable SD is SD at least 23 weeks after randomizat ion.

Adverse events will be co ded to the MedDRA (Versio n 16.1 or higher) l ower level term closest to the verbat im term. The linked MedDRA preferred term and primary system organ cl ass (SOC) are also captured in the database. TEAEs will be defined as AEs that em erge during treatm ent, having been absent pretreatm ent (at baseline) or those that: Reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (Baseline) but stopped before treatment, or Worsens in severit y during treatment relat ive to th e pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous. Only those AEs that are treatment -emergent will be included in summary tables. All AEs, treatm ent-emergent or otherwise, will be presented in subject data list ings. An overview table, including the incidence of and the number of subjects with TEAEs, SAEs, deaths, and those TEAEs that led to study drug di scontinuati on, dose m odificat ion, or dose interruption will be provided. The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by SOC, preferred term , CTCAE grade, and relatedness to study drug. All summari es will be performed by treatm ent group. Al though a MedDRA term may be reported m ore than once for a subject, that subject will be counted only one time in the incidence count for that MedDRA term with the highest CTCAE g rade (in the summary by CTCAE grade) or with the closest relat ionship to study treatm ent (in the summary by relatedness to study treatm ent). The number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs will also be summarized by relat ionship to study drug (Yes [rel ated] and No [not related]). In addit ion, the overall proportion of subjects with TEAEs of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher and the overall proportion of subjects with intolerable CTCAE Grade 2 TEAEs that result in dose modificati on will be analyzed using the same approach for the primary safety endpo int, as sensit ivity analyses. 9.7.1.8.4 LABORATORY VALUES Laboratory test resul ts, vi tal signs and their changes from baseline, and 12 -lead ECG results, will be summarized using descript ive statist ics.

Based on the data from Study 303, the ORR 24wk for the lenvatinib 24-mg arm was 54.4% (142 responders, N=261) and 0.8 % for the placebo arm (1 responder, N= 131) and the lower 95% CI of the OR for lenvat inib 24 mg vs placebo was 21.4. Assuming a 70% retenti on of the effect of lenvatinib 24 mg versus placebo, the noninfe riority margin on the OR scale is est imated to be 0.40 (ie, Ha: OR [18 mg/24 mg] >0.4). A sample size o f 152 subjects ( 76per arm) will provide a statistical power of 80% to declare noninferiorit y, assuming a 1 -sided al pha of 0.025, an ORR 24wk of 54.4% for lenvatinib 24 mg and a true OR of 1, with a noninferiorit y margin o f 0.4. For the primary safety endpo int, based on the data fro m Study 303, where 70.5% of subjects in the lenvat inib 24 -mg arm had a TEAE of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher during the first 24week s, the sample size of 152 subjects will provide a precisio n for the observed differences between the arms wit h half widths of the 95% CI of about 15%. 9.7.3 Interim Analysis No interim analysis is planned for this study . 9.7.4 Other Statistical/Analytical Issues Not a pplicable. 9.7.5 Procedure for Revising the Statistical Analysis Plan If the SAP needs to be revised after the study starts, the sponsor will determine how the revisio n impacts the study and how the revisio n shoul d be implemented.

Amendments specifically affect ing the safet y of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scient ific qualit y of the study requi re submissi on to heal th or regul atory authori ties as well as addi tional approval by the applicable IRBs/IECs. These requirements should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the invest igator, or by the sponsor, in the interest of preserving the safet y of all subjects included in the st udy. If the invest igator determines that an immediate change to or deviat ion from the protocol is necessary for saf ety reasons to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects, the sponsor’s medical mo nitor and the IRB/IEC for the site must be notified im mediately. The sponsor must notify the healt h or regul atory authori ty as requi red per l ocal regulat ions. Protocol amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study may not requi re submissio n to health or regulatory authori ty or the IRB/IEC, but the healt h or regulatory authori ty and IRB/IEC (or if regionally required, the head of the medical inst itution) shoul d be kept informed of such changes as required by lo cal regulati ons. In these cases, the sponsor m ay be requi red to send a letter to t he IRB/IEC and the Competent Authorities (or, if regionally required, the head of the medical inst itution) detailing such changes. 11.2 Adherence to the Protocol The invest igator will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to ICH E6, Section4.5). 11.3 Monitoring Procedures The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the invest igator and designated staff by telephone, letter, or email between study visit s. Moni toring visits to each site will be conducted by the assigned CRA as describ ed in the m onitoring pl an. The investigator (or if regionally required, the head of the medical inst itution) will allow the CRA to inspect the clinical, laboratory , and pharmacy facilit ies to assure com pliance wi th GCP and l ocal regul atory requi rements. The CRFs and subject’s corresponding original medical records (source documents) are to be fully available for review by the sponsor’s representatives at regul ar intervals. These reviews verify adherence to study protocol and data accuracy in accordance w ith local regulat ions. All records at the site are subject to inspect ion by the local audi ting agency and to IRB/IEC review. In accordance with ICH E6, Section 1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to , the following: Clinic, office, or hospi tal charts"

A brief definit ion is provided to clarify the meaning of each AE term. To increase the accuracy of AE reporting, all adverse event terms in CTCAE versio n 4.0 have been correlated with single -conc ept, Medi cal Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) term s. CTCAE v4.0 grading refers to the severit y of the AE. CTCAE grades 1 through 5, with unique clinical descriptions of severit y for each AE, are based on this general guideline: Grade CTCAE S tatus 1 Mild: asymptomat ic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observat ions only; intervent ion not indicated. 2 Moderate: minimal, local, or noninvasive interventio n indicated; limit ing age -appropri ate instrum ental activities of daily living (ADL).a 3 Severe or m edically significant but not immediately life-threatening: hospi talizati on or prol ongati on of hospi talizati on indicated; disabling, limit ing self -care ADL.b 4 Life-threatening consequences: urgent intervention indicated. 5 Death rel ated to adverse event. CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. a: Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. b: Self -care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressi ng, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.
