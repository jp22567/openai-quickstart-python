Current treatment paradigms for AD suggest that there is a need for additional treatment options for patients. More selective JAK inhibitors may decrease the risk for infection (including viral reactivation) and/or malignancy that are observed with pan JAK inhibitors or less selective JAK inhibitors. AbbVie is developing a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, upadacitinib, that may address the current needs for subjects with AD. The second generation of JAK inhibitors, with different selectivity profiles against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2, is in development. 1 Upadacitinib (ABT-494) is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor being developed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and AD. In an in vitro setting, upadacitinib potently inhibits JAK1 activity, but to a lesser degree, inhibits the other isoforms, JAK2 and JAK3. The enhanced selectivity of upadacitinib against JAK1 may offer an improved benefit-risk profile in subjects with AD. In the upadacitinib Phase 2 AD study, a statistically significant difference in the mean percent change from Baseline in EASI score at Week 16 (primary endpoint) was observed for 7.5 mg (–39.4%; P= 0.032 vs placebo), 15 mg (–61.7%; P < 0.001 vs placebo) and 30 mg (–74.4%; P < 0.001 vs placebo) groups compared with placebo (–23.0%). Through Week 16 (Period 1), the percentages of subjects with AEs, SAEs, severe AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were similar across treatment groups. There were no deaths reported during Period 1. Additionally, upadacitinib was studied in rheumatoid arthritis with the results of two Phase 2 studies and two Phase 3 studies available as peer-reviewed manuscripts. 2,3,4,5Results from a Phase 2 study in AD showed that upadacitinib doses of 15 mg to 30 mg per day had efficacy and safety profile that can benefit patients with moderate to severe AD. Clinical Hypothesis Upadacitinib is expected to provide better efficacy compared to placebo and be well tolerated in adolescent and adult subjects with moderate to severe AD. 2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects Treatment of AD in adolescent and adult subjects depends on the extent and severity of disease. Topical agents alone are commonly used for mild to moderate cases. The most commonly used topical agents are corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitor agents, and moisturizers. When topical therapies are insufficient for treating the signs and symptoms of AD, systemic therapy or phototherapy are generally added to topical agents. 6 Treatment guidelines developed by the American Academy of Dermatology recommend the use of systemic immunomodulatory agents for subjects in whom optimized topical regimens and/or phototherapy do not adequately control the signs and symptoms of disease. These guidelines recognize Page 8 of 160"

More recently, dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 signaling, has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema (AD) in adults. Although dupilumab addresses the needs of some patients with moderate to severe AD, a large unmet need still exists in this population since, in the dupilumab Phase 3 studies (even when combined with TCS), fewer than 40% of patients achieved 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale; therefore, 60% or more of patients continued to experience significant symptoms on dupilumab therapy. 8,9 Nearly 50% of dupilumab subjects who were IGA 0 or 1 responders at Week 16 became non-responders by Week 52.10 At this time very few systemic agents are approved for AD and, of those, cyclosporin A and oral prednisone are not suitable for long-term use. Thus, there is a high unmet need for a significant number of patients with an inadequate response to topical agents. Upadacitinib is a novel selective orally available JAK1 inhibitor with the potential to decrease Th2 mediated skin inflammation and itch while having minimal inhibitory effects on JAK2 and JAK3. This could potentially minimize some of the reported safety concerns with non-selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be mediated by inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways. 11,12 Events of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors includingupadacitinib. The results of genetic toxicology testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic; however, upadacitinib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in females of childbearing potential. Based on the calculated safety margins for human fetal exposure with seminal fluid transfer, there is judged to be no risk to the pregnancy of female partners of male subjects who are treated with upadacitinib. Primary results from the ongoing Phase 2 study demonstrated superior efficacy of upadacitinib with an acceptable safety profile at the selected doses for Phase 3 (15 mg and 30 mg once daily [QD]) compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe AD. Taken together, the efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 AD study and cumulative safety data from ongoing Phase 2 and 3 programs in other disease indications support further development of upadacitinib in subjects with moderate to severe AD. In view of the Coronavirus Disease – 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various immunomodulatory therapies on COVID-19 is being evaluated. At this time, the effects of upadacitinib on the course of COVID-19 are not well defined. For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in upadacitinib Investigator's Brochure. 13 Page 9 of 160"

Eligible subjects must have a documented history of inadequate response to treatment with topical AD treatments or documented use of systemic treatment for AD or for whom topical treatments are otherwise medically inadvisable. The study is comprised of a 35-day Screening Period, a 16-week DB Period, a Blinded Extension period of up to Week 260, and a 30-day Follow-up Visit. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria in the main study will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of upadacitinib 15 mg (N = 270) or of upadacitinib 30 mg (N = 270) or matching placebo (N = 270). Upon completion of enrollment of 810 subjects in the main study, a supplemental study will continue to enroll adolescent subjects (adolescent sub-study) until a total of 180 adolescent subjects are enrolled in the overall study (main study + adolescent sub-study). Randomization for the main study will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [vIGA-AD 3] vs. severe [vIGA-AD 4]), by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada, Japan, China, and Other), and by age (adolescent [ages 12 to 17] versus adult [ages 18 to 75]). The separate randomization for the adolescent sub-study will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [vIGA-AD 3] vs. severe [vIGA-AD 4]) and by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada and Other). At Week 16, subjects in the placebo group will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of upadacitinib 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg during the Blinded Extension period. Subjects originally in the 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD upadacitinib group will continue their treatment into the Blinded Extension period up to the Week 260 visit. Starting at the Week 4 visit, rescue treatment for AD may be provided at the discretion of the investigator if medically necessary (further details are available in Section 5.4). Information on the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC) are described in Section 6.3. The Primary Analysis for the main study will be conducted after all ongoing subjects have completed Week 16. After the Primary Analysis, an additional analysis for the main study will be conducted when the required safety exposure target is reached. In addition, a Week 52 analysis of the main study will be performed after all ongoing subjects complete the Week 52 visit. Furthermore, a Primary Analysis for the adolescent population (including the adolescent subjects from the main study and the adolescent sub-study) will be conducted after all ongoing adolescent subjects have completed Week 16. An additional analysis for the adolescent population will be conducted after all ongoing adolescent subjects have provided at least 1 year of upadacitinib exposure. In addition, interim database locks may be performed after all subjects (main study and adolesce nt sub-study) have completed the study activities up to the relevant timepoints after Week 140. The study sites and subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignments for the duration of the study. The schematic of the overall study is shown in Figure 1 . Page 15 of 160"

Study Schematic DB = double-blind; QD = once daily Note: This schematic applies to both the main study and adolescent sub-study. 4.2 Discussion of Study Design Choice of Control Group Placebo has been selected as the appropriate control group since, as discussed in Section 2.2, there is no established standard for systemic therapy in moderate to severe AD. There is no anticipated medical risk for subjects randomized to placebo and if needed, rescue treatment will be available for these subjects. Appropriateness of Measurements Standard clinical and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study. All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with AD. Other than the biomarker analyses which are exploratory, all clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard andgenerally accepted. Care should be taken to minimize the pain and discomfort of laboratory procedures, especially in adolescent subjects. Use of a butterfly needle for venipuncture and/or a needle gauge appropriate for vein size may optimize the comfort for some individuals. Attempts at venipuncture should be limited to the subject's tolerance of the procedure; after 2 unsuccessful attempts for venipuncture, consider requesting the subject to return at a later time for the blood sample collection within the timeframe allowed by the protocol. Suitability of Subject Population The target study population for this study represents an adolescent and adult AD population with moderate to severe disease activity appropriate for systemic therapies.

Inclusion of Adolescent Subjects 12 to 17 Years of Age The adult phase of AD begins at puberty and frequently continues into adulthood.14 In adolescents and adults, the disease presents similarly, typically involving the flexural folds, face, neck, upper arms and back, and dorsal surface of the hands and feet with few notable pathogenetic differences between these age groups. 15,16 While there are no published studies comparing AD disease factors and treatment between adolescents 12 to 17 years of age and adults ≥ 18 years of age, published guidelines in both the United States and Europe make no distinctions in the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of AD in adolescents and adults. 6,7,16 The rationale for selection of doses for adolescents is detailed below. To confirm dose assumptions, PK evaluation will be performed for adolescents and adults in the study. Selection of Doses in the Study This study will evaluate two doses of Upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg QD). The selection of these doses was informed by the analyses of the 16-week safety, efficacy, and exposure-response data from Period 1 of the Phase 2 AD Study M16-048, which evaluated 3 doses of upadacitinib (7.5 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg QD) versus placebo. In addition, available PK, pharmacodynamic, and safety data from upadacitinib studies in other disease indications were used to support the selection of these doses. The Phase 2 study results demonstrated superior efficacy of upadacitinib with an acceptable safety profile at the selected doses (15 mg and 30 mg QD) compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe AD. A statistically significant difference in the mean percent change from Baseline in EASI score at Week 16 (primary endpoint) was observed for 7.5 mg (–39.4%; P= 0.032 vs placebo), 15 mg (–61.7%; P< 0.001 vs placebo) and 30 mg (–74.4%; P< 0.001 vs placebo) groups compared with placebo (–23.0%). Through Week 16 (Period 1), the percentages of subjects with AEs, SAEs, severe AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were similar across treatment groups. There were no deaths reported during Period 1. Preliminary exposure-response analyses for Period 1 of the Phase 2 study show that the percentage of subjects achieving EASI 75, EASI 90, or IGA 0/1 increased with increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures. Simulations using preliminary exposure-response models indicate that doses lower than 15 mg QD (e.g., 7.5 mg QD) are not predicted to provide adequate efficacy in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD. Bodyweight was not found to be correlated with upadacitinib apparent clearance within the evaluated range of 39 kg to 152 kg in the preliminary population-pharmacokinetic analysis across healthy volunteers and in subjects with RA, CD, and AD. Consistent with this finding, upadacitinib estimated apparent clearance was found to be similar between adult subjects with low body weight (< 50 kg) and rest of the subjects across Phase 1 and 2 studies (bodyweight greater than or equal to 50 kg). Adult subjects with CD have been evaluated with chronic dosing of upadacitinib up to 24 mg twice a day using the immediate release formulation (exposures equivalent to that of 60 mg QD regimen using the extended release tablet formulation) with acceptable safety profile. Therefore, there is no anticipated risk resulting from higher exposures for adult subjects weighing less than 40 kg receiving the 30 mg QD dose in the AD clinical trials. As for adolescents, given that no adolescents have been exposed to Page 17 of 160"

Among the cytochrome P450s (CYPs), upadacitinib is mainly eliminated via CYP3A mediated metabolism (approximately 24% and 38% of upadacitinib immediate-release dose is excreted as unchanged upadacitinib in urine and feces, respectively and 34% is excreted as metabolites). Literature suggests that maturation of the CYP3A activity in children 2 years and above is similar to that of adults. 17 Therefore, upadacitinib clearance is not expected to be different between adolescents and adults because of age. Given the evidence in literature with regards to comparable maturation of the CYP3A activity in adolescents relative to adults and that upadacitinib clearance (the key pharmacokinetic parameter that drives the steady state exposures [area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve]) was shown not to be correlated with the bodyweight (within the range of 39 kg to 152 kg), it is estimated that upadacitinib exposures will be comparable within this body weight range in adolescents and adult subjects with atopic dermatitis. In summary, exposures associated with upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD using the once-daily formulation are predicted to be effective and have an acceptable safety profile across the proposed age range for the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe AD. Placebo Duration Rationale The 16-week DB Period is deemed to be a sufficient duration to be able to test the superiority of upadacitinib versus placebo for achieving the co primary endpoints (EASI 75 and vIGA-AD) at Week 16 and several secondary endpoints, while minimizing undue burden for subjects. The placebo-controlled period will allow for a 16-week assessment of efficacy and safety versus a control group. To ensure appropriate medical care for subjects, starting from Week 4, all subjects with an inadequate response may be rescued with escalating therapies ranging from higher potency topical agents to systemic agents of the investigator's choice (see Rescue Therapy in Section 5.4for further details). 5 STUDY ACTIVITIES 5.1 Eligibility Criteria Subjects must meet all of the following criteria in order to be included in the study.

Surgically sterile is defined as: !bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of both ovaries); or !bilateral salpingectomy (surgical removal of both fallopian tubes); or !hysterectomy (surgical removal of uterus) Postmenopausal is defined as: !Age > 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause; or !Age ≤ 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause AND a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40 IU/L. If the female subject is ≤ 55 years of age, postmenarchal, and has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening. !If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential and protocol- specified contraception is required. !If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with postmenopausal status, contraception is not required. !If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with premenopausal status, contraception is required, and pregnancy testing requirements for women of childbearing potential must be followed (see below). A female who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile, and who is postmenarchal or pubertal and has not yet had menses (premenarchal, Tanner stage 3 or higher), is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the following highly effective methods of birth control that is effective from Baseline Visit (or earlier) through at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. !Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with the inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Baseline Visit. !Progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Baseline Visit. !Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.

Periodic abstinence (e.g., using calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable. If required per local guidelines, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the birth control methods listed above (excluding true abstinence). For female adolescents not considered as having childbearing potential at baseline, if during the course of the study a female adolescent becomes of childbearing potential, she is required to take the recommended contraception measures (including true abstinence if acceptable per local requirements) listed above. If during the course of the study a female becomes surgically sterile or postmenopausal (defined above) and complete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as defined above are no longer required. It is important to note that contraception requirements described above are specifically intended to prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therapy upadacitinib. Contraception recommendations related to use of concomitant therapies prescribed per standard of care should be based on the local label. Additional local requirements may apply. In Japan, a Japanese female who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the following highly effective methods of birth control that is effective from Baseline Visit (or earlier) through at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. !Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) associated with the inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Baseline Visit. !Progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Baseline Visit. !Bilateral tubal ligation !Vasectomized partner(s) provided the vasectomized partner has received medical confirmation of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of the females of childbearing potential trial participant. !Intrauterine device. !Intrauterine hormone-releasing system.

It is recommended that the live herpes zoster vaccine be considered for administration at least 4 weeks before the first dose of study drug in subjects greater than 50 years of age (per label). If the herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered, pre-existing immunity should be confirmed through antibody testing at or prior to screening and prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine. If screening varicella antibody testing is negative the herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered. See Section 5.3for a list of commonly used live vaccines. If there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapies the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Scientific Director should be contacted who will then discuss with the AbbVie Medical Director and provide a recommendation. In Japan, it is recommended that the live herpes zoster vaccine be considered for administration at least 8 weeks before the first dose of study drug in subjects greater than 50 years of age (per label). Prior Therapy Any systemic treatments for AD since initial diagnosis (as determined through medical history records or through subject or parent or legal representative interview) and any prescribed treatments for AD prior to study entry will be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). Required Concomitant Medications Beginning at the screening visit, twice daily use of an additive-free, bland emollient is required for at least 7 days prior to Baseline and during the study until Week 16. Starting at the Week 16 Visit or after premature discontinuation of study drug, the use of emollients can be administered per investigator discretion. Note: Until Week 16, the subject may use prescription moisturizers or moisturizers containing ceramide, urea, filaggrin degradation products or hyaluronic acid if such moisturizers were initiated before the screening visit. Rescue Therapy Starting at the Week 4 visit, rescue treatment for AD may be provided, if medically necessary and the following parameters are met: !At Week 4 through Week 24: subjects with < 50% reduction in EASI (EASI 50) response at any two consecutive scheduled visits (e.g., at Week 2 and Week 4 with rescue at Week 4; or at Week 20 and Week 24 with rescue at Week 24), compared to the Baseline EASI score. !After Week 24: subjects with < EASI 50 response at any scheduled or unscheduled visit, compared to the Baseline EASI score.

Only systemic treatments for AD will be considered as rescue therapy for the purposes of statistical analyses of efficacy. Subjects who receive topical rescue treatment or oral corticosteroids during the study treatment period can continue study drug. Oral corticosteroids are not allowed for routine treatment of AD (see Prohibited Medications and Therapy in Section 5.3). If oral corticosteroids must be used, rescue treatment will be limited to prednisone or prednisolone for up to 1 mg/kg for no more than 2 consecutive weeks. Any subject who receives oral corticosteroid for more than 2 consecutive weeks regardless of the dosage of corticosteroid should permanently discontinue study drug. If a subject needs rescue treatment with a non-corticosteroid systemic agent (including but not limited to cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, dupilumab) or with an injectable or parenteral corticosteroid, study drug should be permanently discontinued prior to the initiation of rescue systemic agent. If rescue treatment is medically necessary outside of the parameters described above (i.e., to control intolerable AD symptoms), study drug should be permanently discontinued. Subjects who permanently discontinue study drug are encouraged to continue to participate in the study (no study drug given) and complete the schedule of study visits and assessments. Investigators should conduct efficacy and safety assessments (e.g., disease severity scores, safety labs) before administering any rescue treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose if necessary. 5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects and Discontinuation of Study Subjects may withdraw from the study completely (withdrawal of informed consent) for any reason at any time. Subjects who discontinue the study prematurely after randomization will not be replaced. Subjects may discontinue study drug treatment but may choose to continue to participate in the study. Subjects can request to be discontinued from participating in the study at any time for any reason including, but not limited to, disease progression or lack of response to treatment. The investigator may discontinue any subject's participation at any time for any reason, including but not limited, to disease progression, lack of response to treatment, an AE, safety concerns, or failure to comply with the protocol.

For example, permanent study drug discontinuation would apply at Week 8 if EASI score worsening criteria are met at Week 4 and Week 8 without rescue therapy given at Week 4. Permanent study drug discontinuation would apply at Week 12 if EASI score worsening criteria are met at Week 8 and Week 12 with rescue therapy given at Week 4. This rule applies similarly to later timepoints. !Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results or AEs, which rule out continuation of the study drug, as determined by the investigator and the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical/Scientific Director.

In addition, any data deriving from other clinical trials or toxicological studies that negatively influence the risk/benefit assessment may cause discontinuation or termination of the study. AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site. The investigator may also stop the study at his/her site if he/she has safety concerns. If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will promptly notify the investigator. For subjects to be considered lost to follow-up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain information on the final status of the subject. At a minimum, 2 telephone calls must be made and 1 certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source documentation. State of Emergency or Pandemic Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been necessary to employ mitigation strategies to enable the investigator to ensure subject safety and continuity of care. Acceptable mitigation strategies are identified and included in the Operations Manual in Appendix F . These mitigation strategies are only to be implemented locally during the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigator should contact the AbbVie medical contact before discontinuing a subject from the study for a reason other than ""planned per protocol,"" to ensure that all acceptable mitigation steps have been explored. Refer to the Operations Manual in Appendix F for details on how to handle study activities/procedures. Interruption/Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to COVID-19 Infection Delays in study drug dosing due to COVID-19 must be discussed with the AbbVie medical contact, along with the possibility of premature discontinuation from the study drug dosing period. Follow subsequent protocol Section 5.6for subjects who discontinue study drug. 5.6 Follow-Up for Subject Withdrawal from Study To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment should continue to be followed for all regularly scheduled visits, unless subjects have decided to discontinue the study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent). Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if they prematurely discontinue treatment with study drug. If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation, the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of study drug discontinuation. In addition, a 30-day follow-up visit should occur to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug, but continue study participation should complete a PD visit as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks. Afterwards, subjects should follow the regular visit schedule as outlined in Appendix D , and adhere to all study procedures except for dispensing study drug and PK sample collection. Once the subject has discontinued study drug, all rescue and efficacy driven discontinuation criteria no longer apply. If at any point a subject no longer wants to provide Page 33 of 160"

The 30-Day Follow-Up visit is not applicable for subjects who discontinued study drug and continued study participation and completed at least one study visit at least 30 days after last dose of study drug. All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug or study participation. The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition. Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue participation in the study. In the event a subject withdraws consent from the clinical study, biomarker research will continue unless the subject explicitly requests analysis to be stopped. When AbbVie is informed that samples are withdrawn from research, samples will not be analyzed, no new biomarker analysis data will be collected, and the samples will be destroyed. Data generated for biomarker research before subject withdrawal of consent will remain part of the study results. 5.7 Treatment After End of Study For active subjects randomized to upadacitinib, subjects will continue study treatment throughout the study for a period of up to 260 weeks or until premature discontinuation of study drug. At the subject's last study visit, the investigator will discuss the appropriate subsequent treatment with the subject. AbbVie will not provide drug or any other therapy once the subject's participation is concluded. 5.8 Study Drug The individual study drug information is presented in Table 2 . Table 2. Description of Study Drug and Placebo Investigational ProductMode of Administration Formulation Strength Manufacturer Upadacitinib (ABT-494) oral Film-Coated Tablet 15 mg 30 mgAbbVie Placebo for upadacitinib (ABT-494) oral Film-Coated Tablet NA AbbVie NA = not applicable Upadacitinib and matching placebo will be taken QD beginning on Day 1 (Baseline) and should be taken at approximately the same time each day. The study drug can be taken with or without food. The study drug should be taken whole and should not be split, crushed, dissolved, etc. If a subject should forget to take upadacitinib or matching placebo dose at their regularly scheduled dosing time, they should take the forgotten dose as soon as they remember as long as it is at least 10 hours before their next scheduled dose. Otherwise they should take the next dose at the next scheduled dosing time. Page 34 of 160"

The study site personnel will document compliance. AbbVie will not supply drug other than upadacitinib or matching placebo. If a subject is unable to come to the study site to pick up their study drug due to a state of emergency or pandemic (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), a direct-to-patient (DTP) study drug shipment can be made from the study site to the subject if allowed by local regulations. AbbVie will submit any required notifications to the regulatory authority as applicable. Refer to Section 5.10 for details on DTP shipment of study drug. There are no time limits for study drug interruption if no permanent study discontinuation criteria havebeen met. For allowed study drug interruption due to elective and emergency surgeries, the following rules apply: 1. If the subject must undergo emergency surgery, the study drug should be interrupted at the time of the surgery. After emergency surgery, allow reintroduction of study drug once the physician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection. 2. Elective surgery, and interruption of study drug for such a surgery, will not be allowed during the study until the primary endpoint has been assessed (Week 16). If the subject undergoes elective surgery, the study drug should be interrupted at least 1 week prior to the planned surgery. Allow reintroduction of study drug once the physician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection. Packaging and Labeling Upadacitinib and matching placebo will be packaged in bottles with quantities sufficient to accommodate study design. Each bottle (kit) label will contain a unique kit number. This kit number is assigned to a subject via IRT and encodes the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at the subject's corresponding study visit. Each kit will be labeled as required per country requirements. Labels must remain affixed to the bottles (kits). All blank spaces on the label will be completed by the site staff prior to dispensing to the subjects. Storage and Disposition of Study Drug Upadacitinib and matching placebo must be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° to 77°F). The investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this study. The study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or destroyed as appropriate. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject The study drug (upadacitinib or placebo) will be dispensed in the form of bottles with 15 mg, 30 mg, or matching placebo tablets at the visits listed in Appendix D . Subjects will be instructed to take study drug orally as 1 tablet once daily at approximately the same time each day with or without food. The study drug should be taken whole and should not be split, crushed, dissolved, etc. Page 35 of 160"

For subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by the IRT at the initial screening visit should be used. The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment group assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by the statistics department at AbbVie. Subjects in the main study will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups: !Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg (N = 270) !Group 2: Upadacitinib 30 mg (N = 270) !Group 3: Placebo (N = 270) Upon completion of enrollment of 810 subjects in the main study, the adolescent sub-study will continue to enroll adolescent subjects until a total of 180 adolescent subjects are enrolled in the overall study (main study + adolescent sub-study). Subjects in the adolescent sub-study will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups: !Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg !Group 2: Upadacitinib 30 mg !Group 3: Placebo For the main study, randomization will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [Investigator's Global Assessment (vIGA-AD) = 3] versus severe [vIGA-AD = 4] AD), by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada, Other, China, and Japan), and age (adolescent [ages 12 - 17] versus adult [ages 18 - 75]). For the adolescent sub-study, randomization will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [vIGA-AD = 3] versus severe [vIGA-AD = 4]) and by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada and Other). At Week 16 of the main study and of the adolescent sub-study, the subjects remaining in Group 3 will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups: !Group 4: Upadacitinib 15 mg !Group 5: Upadacitinib 30 mg For the main study, the re-randomization will be stratified by EASI 50 responder (Yes/No), by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada, China, Japan, and Other), and by age (adolescent [ages 12 to 17] versus adult [ages 18 to 75]). For the adolescent sub-study, the re-randomization will be stratified by EASI 50 responder (Yes/No) and by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada and Other). IRT will provide the appropriate study drug kit number(s) to dispense to each subject. Returned study drug must not be re-dispensed to any subject. All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team), the investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the study.

The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a medical emergency. Enrollment in Japan will be capped at 45 subjects (15 subjects per group), with a target enrollment number of approximately 30 to 45 subjects (10 to 15 subjects per group). Enrollment in China will be capped at 45 subjects (15 subjects per group), with a target enrollment number of approximately 30 to 45 subjects (10 to 15 subjects per group). Blinding Study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the study. To maintain integrity of the trial and avoid introduction of bias, the study team will only have access to unblinded subject level data for AEs of special interests and SAEs for regulatory submissions. In order to maintain the blind, the upadacitinib tablets and placebo tablets provided for the study will be identical in appearance. The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency. Unblinding is available in the IRT system via the Unblind Subject transaction, which is available only to the investigator. If the IRT system is unavailable, unblinding may occur by contacting EndPoint technical support via either phone (preferred) or email (support@endpointclinical.com). For country-specific phone numbers, please see the following website: http://www.endpointclinical.com/helpdesk/. In the event that the blind is broken before notification to the AbbVie TA SD, we request that the AbbVie TA SD be notified within 24 hours of the blind being broken. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be conveyed to AbbVie and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Treatment Compliance The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol. The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol. Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject dosing diary. Subjects will be instructed to return all drug containers (even if empty) to the study site personnel at each clinic visit. The study site personnel will document compliance in the study source documents. 5.9 Protocol Deviations The investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, written instructions and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations. Protocol deviations are prohibited except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified, including those that may be due to a state of emergency or pandemic (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/IRB, regulatory authorities (as applicable) and AbbVie. In Japan, the investigator will record all protocol deviations in the appropriate medical records at site. Page 37 of 160"

Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject or any medications being discontinued by the subject in order to participate in this study, the informed consent statement will be reviewed, signed, and dated by the subject or their legally authorized representative, parent or legal guardian (for subject ≥ 12 years old and < 18 years old) the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements. A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record. An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy. An assent form may need to be signed and dated for adolescent subjects, according to the country requirements. If a subject becomes of legal age during the course of the study, that subject will need to be consented using the approved informed consent form. Information regarding benefits for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed because of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form. Optional biomarker samples will only be collected if the subject has voluntarily provided consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions. If the subject does not consent to optional biomarker samples, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study. In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the study, optional biomarker samples will continue to be stored and used for research. In the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, the subject may request that their samples be withdrawn. Once AbbVie receives the request, remaining biomarker samples will be destroyed. If the subject changes his/her consent, and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data. Optional photography will be performed at selected sites and only if the subject has voluntarily provided consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the photography sub-study has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions. If the subject does not consent to the optional photography sub-study, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study. Due to a state of emergency or pandemic (e.g., COVID-19), it is possible that additional protocol modifications not outlined in this protocol may become necessary. If this situation arises, in addition to the study informed consent, additional verbal consent may be obtained prior to these adaptations or substantial changes in study conduct in accordance with local regulations. Screening and Re-Screening Procedures Within 35 days prior to the Baseline Visit, subjects will receive a full explanation of the study design and study procedures, provide a written informed consent, and undergo the screening procedures outlined in Operations Manual Section 2.1 ( Appendix F ). Laboratory values can be re-tested once during the screening period. If the re-tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will be considered a Page 38 of 160"

Redrawing samples if previous samples were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since previous result was never obtained. Subjects who initially screen-fail for the study are permitted to re-screen once following re-consent. For additional re-screening, AbbVie TA SD approval is required. As appropriate, sites are encouraged to contact the AbbVie TA SD to confirm if subjects should or should not be re-screened. All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below will be repeated during rescreening. The subject must meet all eligibility criteria at the time of re-screening in order to qualify for the study. There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re-screen for the study. If the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation including the following assessments, these tests will not be required to be repeated for re-screening, provided the conditions noted in Section 5.1, there are no changes in the subject's medical history that would warrant re-testing, and no more than 90 days have passed: !HBV, HCV and HIV serology !Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON TB Gold test [or IGRA equivalent such as T SPOT test] and/or local PPD skin test, if required) !Chest x-ray !ECG Subjects who are between ≥ 12 and < 18 years of age at the time of the Screening visit will be considered adolescents for the duration of the study. The age at the time of Re-Screening Visit will be used for subjects who Re-Screen. Medical History A complete non-AD medical history, including demographics, history of tobacco, alcohol, and nicotine use, will be taken at Screening. Additionally, a list of each subject's specific AD related medical history should be recorded at Screening. History of clinical herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history. The subject's medical history will be updated prior to study drug administration at the Study Day 1 visit. This updated medical history will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment and to ensure the subject is still eligible for enrollment. A detailed medical history with respect to TB risk factors will be documented in the study source documentation. This information will include Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccination, cohabitation with individuals who have had TB, and travel to, residence in, or work in TB endemic locations. In Japan, the hepatitis screen requirements are as follows: !A positive test result for HBc Ab or HBs Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing (automatic reflex testing). !A positive result for HBV DNA or a result that exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary. !A subject with a negative result for HBV DNA may be enrolled.

HBV-DNA PCR testing approximately every 12 weeks is not necessary in case of subjects with history of HBV vaccine and HBs Ab positive (+) and HBc Ab negative (–). !Subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespective of HBs Ab status) and negative HBV DNA at Screening who develop a positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing during the study accompanied by the following should be referred to a hepatologist within one week for consultation and recommendation regarding subsequent treatment, and study drug interruption should be considered per local guidelines: !an ALT or AST > 5 × ULN OR !ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and either a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 OR !ALT or AST > 3 × ULN along with clinical signs of possible hepatitis. In China, a syphilis Ab test will be performed at Screening utilizing the Toluidine Red Unheated Serum Test (TRUST) to test anticardiolipin antibody in serum. Subjects with a positive TRUST result will have a Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) to confirm a syphilis infection. A positive test result for both the TRUST and TPPA tests will be exclusionary. The syphilis tests will be performed by a certified laboratory. Drug and Alcohol History Subjects should have no history of clinically significant (per investigator's judgment) drug or alcohol abuse within the last 6 months preceding the Baseline Visit. Results are reported from the subject interview. Urine specimens will be tested at the screening visit for the presence of drugs of abuse. The panel for drugs of abuse will minimally include the drugs listed below. Any positive result must be assessed for clinical significance. These analyses will be performed by the certified central laboratory chosen for the study. !Opiates !Barbiturates !Amphetamines !Cocaine !Benzodiazepines !Alcohol !Phencyclidine !Propoxyphene !Methadone Page 40 of 160"

SAEs and protocol related nonserious AEs that occur after a subject signs the informed consent will be collected, prior to the first dose of study drug. Please refer to Section 6.1. Patient-Reported Outcomes Subjects will complete the self-administered patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument (when allowed per local regulatory guidelines) at study visits specified in Appendix D . Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item. Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks. Subjects who are functionally unable to read any of the instruments may have site personnel read the questionnaire to them. Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all specified visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items. Subjects will complete the following questionnaires below as specified in Operations Manual Section 2.1 (Appendix F ). Worst Pruritus NRS, ADerm-SS daily items, ADerm-IS daily items, ADerm-SS weekly items, ADerm-IS weekly items, SCORAD, POEM, PGIS, PGIC, PGIT, DLQI, CDLQI, EQ-5D-5L, SF-36, HADS, and WPAI should be administered before any study procedures in the order listed. A validated translation will be provided in their local language, as applicable. All PROs are collected electronically. The subject should complete the questionnaires before site personnel perform any clinical assessments and preferable before any interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing the subject's response. The PRO instrument should be completed prior to drug administration on Day 1 and prior to any discussion of AEs or any review of laboratory findings. State of Emergency or Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications Due to a state of emergency or pandemic (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), subject visits may be conducted via phone or video conference. The primary site monitor will inform the site which PROs are eligible for completion by interview. In this situation, sites will read the PRO questions and response options to the subject and record the subject's responses. The subject's ability to view the PRO to understand the questions and response options should be preserved. Sites may share the questionnaire by videoconference or send the questionnaires (email or hard copy) to the subjects to allow them to read/understand the questions and responses when the subject is providing responses over the phone. The date and time of PRO data collection should be recorded along with who collected the information. Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) The Worst Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool that subjects used to report the intensity of their pruritus during a daily recall period. Subjects are asked the question: ""On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst imaginable itch,' how would you rate your itch at its worst during the past 24 hours?"" The Worst Pruritus NRS will be administered on electronic hand-held devices from Screening through Week 16; devices will be given to subjects to take home at Screening.

Starting at the Week 20 visit, the frequency of administration will be reduced from daily assessments to assessments only at scheduled site visits using a tablet at the site. Atopic Dermatitis Symptom Scale (ADerm-SS) The ADerm-SS is an 11-item PRO questionnaire designed to assess signs and symptoms that subjects may experience due to AD using a 24-hour recall period. The ADerm-SS includes three items that subjects complete daily and 8 items that subjects completed each week. The daily items include: worst itch during sleep hours, worst itch during awake hours, and worst skin pain. The 8 weekly items are also assessed using a 24-hour recall period. These items include worst skin cracking, worst pain caused by skin cracking, worst dry skin, worst skin flaking, worst rash (i.e., redness, blisters, bumpy skin), worst skin thickening, worst bleeding, and worst skin oozing. All items of the ADerm-SS are scored on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no [sign/symptom concept]) to 10 (worst possible [sign/symptom concept]). The ADerm-SS will be administered on electronic hand-held devices from Screening through Week 16; devices will be given to subjects to take home at Screening. Hand-held device usage ends at the Week 16 visit. Starting at the Week 20 visit, the frequency of administration will be reduced from daily/weekly assessments to assessments only at scheduled site visits using a tablet at the site. Atopic Dermatitis Impact Scale (ADerm-IS) The ADerm-IS is a 10-item PRO questionnaire designed to assess a variety of impacts that subjects experience from their AD across both a 24-hour recall period (the daily items 1 to 3) and 7-day recall period (the weekly items 4 to 10). Daily items are related to sleep, and include difficulty falling asleep, impact on sleep, and waking at night. Weekly items include household activities (e.g., washing dishes, sweeping, doing laundry), physical activities (e.g., walking, exercising), social activities, concentration, self-consciousness, embarrassment, and sadness. All items of the ADerm-IS are scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (no impact) to 10 (extreme impact). The ADerm-IS will be administered on electronic hand-held devices from Screening through Week 16; devices will be given to subjects to take home at Screening. Hand-held device usage ends at the Week 16 visit. Starting at the Week 20 visit, the frequency of administration will be reduced from daily/weekly assessments to assessments only at scheduled site visits using a tablet at the site. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) The DLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QoL). It consists of 10 questions assessing impact of skin diseases on different aspects of subject's QoL over the prior week. The DLQI items include symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships and the side effects of treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale: 0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much. Item scores (0 to 3) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater impairment of QoL. For general inflammatory skin conditions, a change in DLQI score of at least 4 points is considered the MCID. The DLQI will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. Throughout this study, the DLQI will be administered to subjects who are ≥ 16 (16 to 75) years old at the time of the Screening visit. Page 42 of 160"

The CDLQI has been validated for use in subjects 4 - 16 years old. It consists of 10 questions assessing impact of skin diseases on different aspects of patient's QoL over the prior week. The CDLQI items include symptoms and feelings, dailyactivities, leisure, school, relationships, sleep, and treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale: 0 = not at all; 1 = only a little; 2 = quite a lot; and 3 = very much. Item scores (0 to 3) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater impairment of QoL. In this study, the CDLQI will be administered to subjects who are < 16 years old at the time of the Screening visit, and will continue to be administered to these subjects for the duration of this study. Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in both children and adults. Subjects respond to 7 items, including dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping, each scored on a 5-point scale based on frequency: 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days. Item scores (0 to 4) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease-related morbidity. A change in POEM score of 3.4 points is considered the MCID. The POEM will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. Hospital Anxiety and Depress Scale (HADS) The HADS is a 14-item questionnaire, with seven items related to anxiety (HADS-A) and seven items related to depression (HADS-D). Each item is scored from 0 to 3; scores for each subscale range from 0 to 21 and scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress. For each domain, scores 7 or lower are considered normal, 8 to 10 are borderline, and 11 or higher indicate clinical anxiety or depression. HADS will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Index: Atopic Dermatitis (WPAI:AD) The WPAI:AD is a validated instrument used to measure loss of productivity at work and impairment in daily activities over the past 7 days. The questionnaire includes four items: absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work impairment, and activity impairment, that range from 0% to 100%, with higher values indicating greater impairment. While absenteeism represents the percentage of work time missed due to AD, presenteeism represents the percentage of impairment while at work due to AD. Overall work impairment represents the total percentage of work time missed due to either absenteeism or presenteeism (since those are mutually exclusive). Activity impairment represents the percentage of impairment during daily activities other than work. The 4 items are all evaluated using an 11-point Likert-type scale from 0 (no effect) to 10 (completely prevented), and the scores are multiplied by ten to arrive at a percentage. The WPAI:AD will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. EuroQoL Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D-5L consists Page 43 of 160"

The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels of perceived problems: ""no problem"" (level 1), ""some problems"" (level 2), ""extreme problems"" (level 3). The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement (i.e., no problems, some problems, or severe problems) in each of the 5 dimensions; this results in a 1-digit number expressing the level for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state. The EQ-VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labeled ""best imaginable health state (100)"" and ""worst imaginable health state (0)."" This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents. The EQ-5D-5L will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) The PGIS asks subjects to describe the severity of their AD symptoms right now. Subjects rate their AD symptoms on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 = Absent (no symptoms) to 6 = Very Severe (cannot be ignored and markedly limits my daily activities). The PGIS will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) The PGIC asks subjects to rate the overall change in their AD symptoms by comparing the severity of their AD symptoms right now with the severity of their AD symptoms before they began study treatment. Subjects are asked: ""Compared to before your study treatment began, how would you rate the overall change in your atopic dermatitis symptoms?"" Responses range from 1 = ""Very much improved"" to 7 = ""Very much worse."" The PGIC will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. The PGIC will not be collected at Baseline. Patient Global Impression of Treatment (PGIT) The PGIT asks subjects to rate their level of satisfaction/dissatisfaction with their current treatment for AD. Subjects are asked: ""Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with your current treatment for atopic dermatitis?"" Responses range from 1 = ""Extremely dissatisfied"" to 7 = ""Extremely satisfied."" The PGIT will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) The SF-36 Health Survey is a generic assessment that measures general health status. The SF-36 includes eight domains rated over the prior four weeks: physical function, role limitations – physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social function, and role limitations with regard to emotional and mental health. Two component scores, the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) are calculated. The SF-36 domain and summary scores are Page 44 of 160"

The SF-36 will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) The SCORAD is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of AD. There are 3 components to the assessment: A = extent or affected body surface area, B = severity, and C = subjective symptoms. The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as ""A"" in the overall SCORAD calculation). The severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, dryness) is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as ""B"" in the overall SCORAD calculation). Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the subject or relative on a VAS on the tablet, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20. This parameter is assigned as ""C"" in the overall SCORAD calculation. The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C where the maximum is 103. The SCORAD subjective symptoms (component C) will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. SCORAD components A and B will not be on the tablet and performed on paper worksheets and entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF). The rule of 9's method should be used to assess the percentage of each defined body area on the paper worksheets for component A. Investigator Assessment The investigator assessments will be recorded on paper worksheets and entered into the eCRF and conducted at the study visits specified in Appendix D . If possible, the investigator assessments should be performed by an independent and blinded assessor who should not perform any other study related procedures. In order to minimize variability, the same independent assessor should evaluate the subject at each visit for the duration of the study. A back-up independent assessor should be identified. The independent assessor must be a qualified medical professional (e.g., nurse, physician's assistant, or physician). Any assessor must be trained and competent in performing such assessments. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained to perform assessments and that all training is documented. If the independent assessor is not available, the pre-identified back-up assessor should perform such assessments. Validated Investigator's Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) The vIGA-AD is a validated assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally, based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) will each be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of ""0"" Page 45 of 160"

In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk (including the genital area), upper extremities, and lower extremities (including the buttocks), and converted to a score of 0 to 6. In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%). Body Surface Area Involvement of Atopic Dermatitis (BSA, %) A qualified investigator or designee should select the subject's right or left hand as the measuring device. For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus five digits will be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1%. Measurement of the total area of involvement by the investigator is aided by imagining if scattered plaques were moved so that they were next to each other and then estimating the total area involved. The site should make every attempt to have the same qualified investigator or designee perform all BSA assessments on a given subject throughout the study. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) See description above in Patient-Report Outcomes. Hand eczema severity index (HECSI) Each hand is divided into five areas [fingertips, fingers (except the tips), palms, back of hands and wrists]. For each of these areas the intensity of the six following clinical signs: erythema, induration/papulation, vesicles, fissuring, scaling and edema is graded on the following scale: 0, no skin changes; 1, mild disease; 2, moderate and 3, severe. For each location (total of both hands) the affected area is given a score from 0 to 4 (0, 0%; 1, 1 – 25%; 2, 26 – 50%; 3, 51 – 75% and 4, 76 – 100%) for the extent of clinical symptoms. Finally, the score given for the extent at each location is multiplied by the total sum of the intensity of each clinical feature, and the total sum called the HECSI score is calculated, varying from 0 to a maximum severity score of 360 points. None of the investigator assessments described above (vIGA-AD, EASI, BSA, SCORAD and HECSI) can be performed remotely, as they require in-person evaluation of the skin. Vaccines Vaccines recommended by local guidelines should be considered. If the investigator chooses to administer a vaccine, this should be completed before first dose of study drug with appropriate precautions and time interval. It is recommended that subjects be up to date for recommended inactivated, toxoid, or biosynthetic vaccines, such as injectable flu vaccine, pneumococcal, and pertussis (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis). If the live herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered, and there is no known history of primary varicella (chicken pox), preexisting immunity to varicella should be confirmed with antibody testing at or prior to screening and prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine. If screening varicella antibody testing is negative the live herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered. In Japan, it is recommended that the live herpes zoster vaccine should be considered for administration at least 8 weeks before first dose of study drug or administered at least 30 days after last dose of study drug. See Section 5.3for a list of commonly used live vaccines that are prohibited during study participation. Page 46 of 160"

At Screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a risk assessment form (Operations Manual Section 3.18 [ Appendix F ]) and tested for TB infection (QuantiFERON TB Gold test [or IGRA equivalent such as T-SPOT test] and/or local PPD skin test, if required) as described below. The site staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate eCRF. The TB risk factor questionnaire will be done at Week 52 and annually after Week 52, regardless of TB test results. If a subject had a negative PPD test within 90 days prior to Screening and a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent such as T-SPOT test) cannot be performed at Screening and source documentation is available, TB testing by PPD skin test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. These cases may be discussed with the AbbVie TA SD. The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation. Subjects with a negative TB test and chest x-ray not suggestive of active TB or prior TB exposure may be enrolled. Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent TB, including signs and symptoms and chest x-ray. Subjects with no signs or symptoms and a chest x-ray not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see below). Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled. For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or the most recent evaluation, an annual TB follow-up test will be performed. In cases where the annual QuantiFERON-TB Gold test by the central laboratory is positive and the investigator considers the subject at low risk for TB (i.e., no risk factors identified using the TB risk assessment form) and has no clinical suspicion of TB, the investigator may perform a QuantiFERON TB gold test at a local lab (or through the central laboratory if not locally available) to confirm the positive test result: if repeat testing result is negative, then the investigator may consider the subject to be negative based on his/her clinical judgment; if repeat testing result is positive, then the subject is considered to be positive. The annual TB test can be completed at the earliest feasible opportunity if not able to be completed per protocol schedule due to a state of emergency or pandemic restrictions. If an annual TB test is newly positive (seroconversion), a chest x-ray needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus latent TB, and subsequent annual TB follow-up tests are not required. Any positive TB test after the subject has started the study, should be reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable). If the subject is experiencing signs or symptoms suspicious for TB or something has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test before the next scheduled annual TB re-test, the case (including the TB test results) must be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD.

If either PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) is positive, the TB test is considered positive. !The PPD Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test or Mantoux Test) should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines). !If only a PPD is placed at Screening, then the TB test to be used for the remainder of the study for that subject is the PPD. Similarly, if a subject enters the study with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) alone, then the subject should have their annual TB test performed with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test). !If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) and the PPD are required per local guidelines) the PPD will be performed. The PPD should be read by a licensed healthcare professional between 48 and 72 hours after administration. A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction. The absence of induration will be recorded as ""0 mm"" not ""negative."" Subjects who have an ulcerating reaction to the PPD in the past should not be re-exposed and the PPD should be considered positive. !If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator should perform a QuantiFERON TB gold test at a local lab (or through the central laboratory if not locally available) to rule out a positive test result. If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to be positive for the purpose of this study. If the testing result is negative, then the subject is considered to be negative. TB prophylaxis At Screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection, prophylactic treatment must be initiated at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer); at least 6 months of prophylaxis need to be completed, however, the full course of prophylaxis does not need to be completed prior to the first dose of study drug. Of note: Rifampicin or rifapentine is not allowed for TB prophylaxis.Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have documented completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy will be allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant repeat treatment. For subjects with completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy, but insufficient documentation, the investigator should consult with the AbbVie TA MD. Page 48 of 160"

Study drug(s) should not be withheld. Two to 4 weeks later, the subject should be re-evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and symptoms as well as laboratory assessment of toxicity to TB prophylaxis. Newly initiated prophylactic treatment and prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF. Chest X-Ray A chest x-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral views) is required: !For all subjects at Screening to rule out the presence of TB or other clinically relevant findings. The screening CXR will not be required if the subject had a previous normal CXR (posterior-anterior and lateral views) within 90 days of Screening, provided all source documentation is available at the site, as outlined below and provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. !At Week 52, and annually thereafter, for subjects with newly identified TB risk factors as identified by the TB risk assessment form (Operations Manual Section 3.18 [ Appendix F ]), or for subjects living in areas endemic for TB or for subjects with newly positive PPD and/or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test). The chest x-ray can be completed at the earliest feasible opportunity if not able to be completed per protocol schedule due to state of emergency or pandemic (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) restrictions. Subjects can have a repeat chest x-ray at any time during the study as warranted based on the opinion of the investigator. A radiologist or pulmonologist must perform and document an assessment of the chest x-ray. The Principal Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of any findings and will sign and date the report. In the assessment of the chest x-ray, the Principal Investigator or their delegate must indicate the presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB. If the chest x-ray demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, apical or basilar pleural thickening) or other findings that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator should contact the AbbVie TA MD before enrolling the subject. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram A 12-lead ECG will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Appendix D . The ECG should be performed prior to blood collection. The ECGs will be evaluated by an appropriately trained physician at the site (""local reader""). The local reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the following categories: !Normal ECG !Abnormal ECG – not clinically significant !Abnormal ECG – clinically significant Page 49 of 160"

The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine-generated measurements and interpretation that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected. Height and Body Weight Height and body weight will be measured without shoes at visits specified in Appendix D . Weight will be performed throughout the study for all subjects (both adults and adolescents). For adults, collection of height will be at the Baseline Visit only. For adolescent subjects (subjects who were 12 to 17 years of age at Screening Visit), collection of height will be at the Screening and Baseline Visits and designated visits thereafter. All measurements will be recorded in imperial or metric units where applicable. State of Emergency or Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications In the event this may not be performed due to study modifications related to a state of emergency orpandemic (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), perform the 12-lead ECG at the next earliest feasible visit. Vital Signs Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be obtained at visits as specified in Appendix D . Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 3 minutes. Physical Examination A complete physical examination will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Appendix D . The physical examination at the Baseline Visit will serve as the baseline physical examination for the entire study. Physical examination abnormalities noted by the investigator at baseline prior to the first dose of study drug will be recorded in the subject's medical history; abnormalities noted after the first dose of study drug will be evaluated and documented by the investigator as to whether or not the abnormality is an AE. All findings, whether related to an AE or part of each subject's medical history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page. At any time, a symptom-directed physical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by the investigator. Tanner Staging The Tanner Scale (also known as the Tanner Stages) is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess physical development (Operations Manual Section 3.19 [ Appendix F ]). The Scale defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitals, testicular volume and development of pubic hair. Throughout this study, Tanner Staging will be assessed at Baseline for subjects who are < 18 (12 to 17) years old at the time of the Screening Visit, and will continue to be assessed for these subjects for the duration of this study. Once a subject reaches stage 5 in both categories, Tanner Staging will no longer need to be assessed for that subject. Page 50 of 160"

Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to AbbVie. Product Complaint A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s). For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device damage or not working properly, or packaging issues. Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to AbbVie within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event. Product complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion. Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal Page 60 of 160"

Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study drug, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.2regarding toxicity management) and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs. The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis throughout the study. All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry. Elective surgery will not be allowed during the study until the primary endpoint has been assessed. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE. If any of the following events are reported, then the following supplemental form must be completed. Page 61 of 160"

If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie or CRO (as appropriate) as an SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE: Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject. Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle). Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 days after discontinuation of study drug administration will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.

No Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug will be considered ""associated."" Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered ""not associated."" In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated. If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the SAE. Pregnancy Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy.

For subjects who discontinued study drug but continued study participation and are on standard of care therapies, these toxicity management requirements do not apply (including alerts from the central lab) and any intolerability to standard of care therapies should be managed by the prescribing physician. Management of Serious Infections Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with study drug. Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection. A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergo prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject. As appropriate, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the subject should be closely monitored. Study drug may be restarted once the infection has been successfully treated. Subjects who develop active TB must be permanently discontinued from study drug. Management of Herpes Zoster If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting study drug until the episode resolves.

For subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespective of HBs Ab status) and negative HBV DNA at screening who develop the following should have HBV DNA by PCR testing performed within 1 week (based on initial elevated value): ! ALT > 5 × ULN OR; ! ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternate cause is not readily identified ! A separate blood sample for HBV DNA PCR testing will be needed at the time of repeat testing for ALT or AST. As with INR, a separate tube is needed. A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing will require immediate interruption of study drug (unless not acceptable by local practices) and a hepatologist consultation should occur within 1 week for recommendation regarding subsequent treatment. Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an alternative etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medically appropriate. If applicable, the alternative etiology should be documented in the eCRF. If ALT or AST values return to the normal reference range or its Baseline value, study drug may be restarted. If restarting study drug, documentation should include reason that rechallenge is expected to be safe. If after clinically appropriate evaluation, no alternative etiology for ALT or AST elevation is found or the ALT or AST elevation has not resolved or is not trending down toward normal, the subject should be discontinued from study drug.

The DMC members consist of two clinicians and one biostatistician with one clinician being an expert in the management of subjects with AD. The primary responsibility of the DMC will be to protect the safety of the subjects participating in this study. A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. Communications from the DMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments. An independent committee of physician experts in cardiovascular adjudication will be utilized to assess potential cardiovascular and thromboembolic AEs in a blinded manner as defined by the Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee charter. 6.4 Other Safety Data Collection Specific manifestations of AD (i.e., itching, excoriations, oozing, crusting, erythema, etc.) should not be reported as individual AEs if they are considered to be a worsening of the underlying disease; instead, worsening of atopic dermatitis should be reported as the AE.

The RSI in effect at the start of a Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) reporting period serves as the RSI during the reporting period. For follow-up reports, the RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the 'suspected' Serious Adverse Reaction will be used to assess expectedness. 7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans The objective of the statistical analyses is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib for the treatment of adolescent and adult subjects with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. For ease of description, the DB Period refers to Week 0 to 16, and the Blinded Extension Period refers to the rest of the study. The Primary Analysis of the main study for all efficacy endpoints pertaining to the DB Period (including the primary efficacy endpoints) will be conducted after all continuing subjects in the main study have completed the study activities up to Week 16 and all data pertaining to the DB Period are cleaned. This is the one and final efficacy analysis for the DB Period of the main study. After the Primary Analysis of the main study, an additional analysis of the main study will be conducted when the required safety exposure target is reached. In addition, a Week 52 analysis of the main study will be performed after all ongoing subjects complete the Week 52 visit. Furthermore, the Primary Analysis for the adolescent population (including the adolescent subjects from the main study and the adolescent sub-study) will be conducted after all ongoing adolescent subjects have completed Week 16, and all data pertaining to the DB Period are cleaned. An additional analysis of the adolescent population will be conducted after all ongoing adolescent subjects have provided at least 1 year of upadacitinib exposure. Interim database locks may be performed after all subjects (main study and adolescent sub-study) have completed the study activities up to the relevant timepoints after Week 140. The Type-I error control will be applied to the Primary Analysis of the main study. Study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the entire study. The statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized prior to the blind break and database lock for the Primary Analysis. The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). 7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Populations: !The ITT Population (ITT) consists of all subjects who are randomized in the overall study.

Subjects who are randomized to placebo in the DB Period and do not continue into the Blinded Extension Period will be excluded from the analysis in the Blinded Extension Period. The ITT populations will be used for efficacy analyses. Subjects will be analyzed according to treatment as randomized. Per Protocol Population: A Per-Protocol Population for the main study (PP_M) will be defined to exclude subjects with major protocol violations. The criteria to define the Per-protocol Population will be detailed in the SAP. Subjects to be excluded from the Per-Protocol Population will be finalized before database lock and blind break. The PP_M Population will be used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint. Safety Populations: !The Safety Population in the DB Period (Safety_DB) consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the overall study during the DB Period. !The Safety Population in the Blinded Extension Period (Safety_BE) consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the overall study during the Blinded Extension Period. !The Safety Population for the main study in the DB Period (Safety_DB_M) consists of allrandomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the main study during the DB Period. !The Safety Population for the main study in the Blinded Extension Period (Safety_BE_M) consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the main study during the Blinded Extension Period. !The Safety Population for adolescents in the DB Period (Safety_DB_A) consists of all randomized adolescent subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the main study or the adolescent sub-study during the DB Period. !The Safety Population for adolescents in the Blinded Extension Period (Safety_BE_A) consists of all randomized adolescent subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the main study or the adolescent sub-study during the Blinded Extension Period. In all safety analyses, subjects will be analyzed according to treatment received regardless of randomization. Cross-period summaries will be provided for subjects initially randomized to the two upadacitinib groups. In addition, the following populations will provide comprehensive summaries: Page 74 of 160"

The efficacy analysis for adolescents will be conducted in the ITT_A Population. In addition, the primary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the PP_M Population. Subjects will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized. In the DB Period, categorical variables will be analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by vIGA-AD categories and age (adolescent vs. adult) in the ITT_M Population, and stratified by vIGA-AD categories and study portion (main study vs. adolescent sub-study) in ITT_A Population. Continuous variables will be analyzed using mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM). In the DB Period, missing values and visits after the rescue will be handled by non-responder imputation (NRI) for categorical variables or MMRM for continuous variables. Assessments of long-term efficacy (across the DB and Blinded Extension Periods) for subjects who stay on treatment will be summarized by Observed Case approach at each visit. No missing data imputation will be applied, and all assessments prior to premature discontinuation from study drug will be used. For selected efficacy endpoints (e.g., EASI 75), long-term efficacy analysis will be performed using multiple imputation (MI). Primary Analysis of Efficacy The co-primary endpoints for the efficacy are: !Proportion of subjects achieving at least an EASI 75 from Baseline at Week 16; !Proportion of subjects achieving vIGA-AD of 0 or 1 with at least two grades of reduction from Baseline at Week 16. Comparison of the primary endpoints will be made between each upadacitinib group and the placebo group in ITT_M Population using the CMH test, adjusting for vIGA-AD categories and age (adolescent vs. adult). NRI will be the primary approach, with MI and tipping point analysis as the sensitivity approach to handle missing values. The primary endpoints will also be evaluated in the PP_M Population. Sample Size Estimation Approximately 810 adolescent and adult subjects will be randomized to upadacitinib 30 mg, upadacitinib 15 mg, or placebo in a ratio of 1:1:1 in the main study (270 subjects per treatment group). The sample Page 75 of 160"

Assuming an EASI 75 response rate of 15%, and vIGA-AD 0 or 1 with at least a 2-point reduction response rate of 10% in the placebo arm, this sample size will also provide more than 90% power to detect the treatment differences of 32% and 21%, respectively, for the above two endpoints simultaneously using two-sided test at a 0.05 significant level. The assumptions of placebo response rates for EASI 75 and IGA-AD 0/1 were based on the maximum placebo rate in upadacitinib AD Phase 2b study and dupilumab Phase 3 monotherapy studies (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2). The graphic approach for controlling multiplicity will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Additional adolescent subjects will be enrolled in the adolescent sub-study and randomized to upadacitinib 15 mg, upadacitinib 30 mg, or placebo in a ratio of 1:1:1 for a total of 180 adolescent subjects in the overall study (main study + adolescent sub-study). This sample size was determined to ensure a total of 225 subjects per dose across 3 pivotal studies will provide 1 year of data. 7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety The safety analyses will be carried out using the safety populations in the DB Period, the Blinded Extension Period, and across both periods, and will be based on treatments the subjects actually received. Safety will be assessed by AEs, physical examination, laboratory assessments, and vital signs. Note that missing safety data will not be imputed. Analysis details will be specified in the SAP. AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). TEAEs are defined as those that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug but within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using the MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), by severity, and by relationship to the study drug as assessed by the investigator. Summaries (including percentages and events per 100 patient-years) of SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation and AESIs will be provided as well. Pre-treatment AEs will be summarized separately. For laboratory and vital signs, mean change from Baseline and percentage of subjects with evaluations meeting criteria for pre-defined Potentially Clinically Significant values will be summarized. 7.5 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure-Response Analyses Individual upadacitinib plasma concentrations at each study visit will be tabulated and summarized with appropriate statistical methods. Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK and exposure-response analyses of only data from this study may not be conducted. The following general methodology will be used for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK analyses (using the available PK data from the subjects from whom the PK samples will be collected) will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing. PK models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach with non-linear mixed effects modeling software (Version 7, or a higher version). The structure of the starting PK model will be based on the PK analysis Page 76 of 160"
76,page_76,"STUDY M16-045 | Version 6.0 | EudraCT 2017-005125-20 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.of data from previous studies. The CL/F and V/F of upadacitinib will be the PK parameters of major interest in the analyses. If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis. The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models. 1. The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the alternative model(s). 2. The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity (a straight line with zero intercept and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s). 3. Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and change in inter-subject and intra-subject error. Once an appropriate base PK model (including inter- and intra-subject error structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated by the posterior conditional estimation technique using non-linear mixed effects modeling. The relationship between these conditional estimates CL/F and V/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic or renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.05. After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates from the full model will be employed to evaluate the significance (at P < 0.005, corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model. Linear or non-linear relationships of primary PK parameters with various covariates will be explored. For the same subjects from whom the PK samples will be collected, relationships between upadacitinib exposure and clinical observations (primary efficacy variable) will be explored. Exposure-response relationships for secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored. The relationship between exposure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model-predicted PK profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and drug effect will be explored. Several classes of models (e.g., linear, log-linear, exponential, E max, sigmoid E max, etc.) will be evaluated to characterize the exposure-response relationship based on observed data. Results of the pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses may be summarized in a separate report prior to regulatory filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of AD, rather than in the CSR. Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate. 7.6 Statistical Analysis of Immunophenotype Data and Optional Proteomic Biomarker Data For biomarkers in T-lymphocyte, B-lymphocyte, and natural killer cells (TBNK) immunophenotype data (natural killer cells, natural killer T cells [NKT], B cells, and T cells) or optional whole blood proteomic and targeted serum protein investigations, summary statistics at Baseline and post treatment time points, in addition to change from Baseline at each time point will be provided; this will include mean, standard Page 77 of 160"

The PD effect of each biomarker between the placebo and upadacitinib treatment groups will be evaluated via a mixed-effects modeling approach with change from Baseline of the biomarker score (after log transformation if appropriate) as response variable, Treatment, Time, and Treatment × Time interaction as fixed-effects, the corresponding Baseline biomarker score as a covariate, and ""subjects nested within the treatment group"" as a random-effect. Other Baseline covariates such as age, weight, etc., may be considered in the model if appropriate. Additional analysis may be conducted on TBNK immunophenotype and/or optional proteomic biomarker data for the purpose of identification of prognostic, predictive, surrogate and PD biomarkers associated with efficacy or safety. The association of biomarkers to the efficacy or safety endpoints may be explored for each biomarker one at a time, and also for combinations of biomarkers via some multivariate predictive modeling approaches. 7.7 Interim Analysis There will be no efficacy or futility interim analyses. Safety data will be reviewed by an external DMC as described in Section 6.3. 8 ETHICS 8.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all subject materials will be submitted to the IEC/IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the informed consent form(s) must be obtained before any subject is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by the IEC/IRB before the changes are implemented to the study. In addition, all changes to the consent form(s) will be IEC/IRB approved. In Japan, the investigator will prepare the consent form and explanatory material required to obtain subject's consent to participate in the study with the cooperation of the sponsor and will revise these documents as required. The prepared or revised consent forms and explanatory material will be submitted to the sponsor. Approval of the IRB will be obtained prior to use in the study. In Japan, when important new information related to the subject's consent becomes available, the investigator will revise the consent form and explanatory material based on the information without delay and will obtain the approval of the IRB prior to use in the study. The investigator will provide the information, without delay, to each subject already participating in the study, and will confirm the intention of each subject to continue the study or not. The investigator shall also provide a further explanation using the revised form and explanatory material and shall obtain written consent from each subject of their own free will to continue participating in the study.

EASI score does not include a grade for dryness or scaling. Assignments for the following body regions are as follows: !Head and Neck !Trunk: (including the genital area) !Upper extremities !Lower extremities (including the buttocks) Area Score Area score is recorded for each of the four regions of the body. The area score is the percentage of skin affected by eczema. Area score Percentage of skin affected by eczema in each region: !0 = no eczema in this region !1 = 1% – 9% !2 = 10% – 29% !3 = 30% – 49% !4 = 50% – 69% !5 = 70% – 89% !6 = 90% – 100%: the entire region is affected by eczema Severity Score Severity score is recorded for each of the four regions of the body. The severity score is the sum of the intensity scores for four signs. The four signs are: 1. Redness (erythema, inflammation) 2. Thickness (induration, papulation, swelling – acute eczema) 3. Scratching (excoriation) Page 154 of 160"

Lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules – chronic eczema) The average intensity of each sign in each body region is assessed as: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) and severe (3). Score Intensity of redness, thickness/swelling, scratching, lichenification: 0 = None, absent 1 = Mild 2 = Moderate 3 = Severe For each region, record the intensity for each of four signs and calculate the severity score.Severity score = redness intensity + thickness intensity + scratching intensity + lichenification intensityFor each region, multiply the severity score by the area score and by a multiplier. !Head and neck: severity score × area score × 0.1 !Trunk: severity score × area score × 0.3 !Upper limbs: severity score × area score × 0.2 !Lower limbs: severity score × area score × 0.4 Add up the total scores for each region to determine the final EASI score. The minimum EASI score is 0 and the maximum EASI score is 72. Page 155 of 160"
