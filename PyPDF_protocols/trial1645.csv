16,page_16,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 17Objective Endpoint  To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral GSK2330672 in PBC patients with moderate to sev ere pruritus at Baseline. Plasma concentrations of GSK2330672 after sparse sampling (PK parameters will be reported if data permit). 1. Mean Worst Daily Itch Score: participant’s itch severity is recorded on an electronic diary (eDiary) each morning and even ing using a 0 -10 numerical rating scale (NRS), the Worst Daily Itch Score is averaged over the 7 days preceding randomization at Visit 3 (Baseline) and over the 7 days preceding Visit 6 (Week 16). 2. A responder day is based on the Worst Daily Itch Score rec orded using the 0 -10 NRS for that day. When the responder day definition is relative to Baseline, the Worst Daily Itch Score is compared to the Mean Worst Itch Daily Score for Baseline (see 1 above). 3. Mean Daily Sleep Score: participant’s sleep quality is r ecorded on the eDiary each morning using a 0 -10 NRS and the Daily Sleep Score is averaged over the 7 days preceding randomization at Visit 3 (Baseline) and over the 7 days preceding Visit 6 (Week 16). 4. Mean Daily Fatigue Score: participants fatigue level is recorded on the eDiary each evening using a 0 -10 NRS and the Daily Fatigue Score is averaged over the 7 days preceding randomization at Visit 3 (Baseline) and over the 7 days preceding Visit 6 (Week 16). Note: For all other endpoints Baseline is defined as the Visit 3 assessment and Week 16 is defined as the Visit 6 assessment. In addition to Week 16, which is the primary time point of interest, other intermediate time points will also be assessed. Overall Design: This is a phase IIb, multicenter, rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, five arm dose -finding study in adults with moderate to severe pruritus associated with PBC . The study hasan adaptive design which aims to utilize interim data to further inform and potentially optimize the doses under investigation . Following the Screening Visit, there will be four study periods: Initial Study Period: Single -blind placebo treatment for 4weeks during which participant’s s ymptoms will be recorded in the electronic diary (eDiary ) to establish baseline s ymptoms and assess eligibility for randomization and compliance with study procedures. Main Study Period: Eligible participants will be randomized to receive 12 weeks double -blind treatment with either placebo or one of 4 doses of GSK 2330672 administered either once daily or twice dail y. Randomi zation will be stratified based on participant’s risk of PBC disease progression based on serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin concentrations at Day 1.Participants will attend study visits every 4 weeks. Final Study Period: Single -blind placebo treatment for 4 weeks to assess s ymptoms and safet y post -completion of double- blind treatment. Follow -up Period: to assess sy mptoms and use of anti -pruritus medications by telephone visit. 2020N437913_00"
17,page_17,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 18Eligible participants may continue to receive some therapies for the treatment of PBC provided these are maintained at stable doses and there is no plan to discontinue them during the stud y. Concomitant use of cholestyramine, colesevalem , colestimide or colestipol is not permitted until after completion of the Main Study Period. Obeticholic acid use is not permitted at an y time during the study. In addition, an exploratory Actigraph y Sub -study will be conducted in a sub- set of participants who give cons ent. Number of Participant s: Approximately 150 adult participants with PBC and moderate to severe pruritus will be screened to achieve approximately 118 randomized and approximately 100 evaluable participants overall. Should emerging data diverge significa ntly from protocol assumptions, the total sample size willbeadjusted to include up to 160 randomized participants, and approximately 200 screened participants. If during the study screen failure rates are higher than anticipated, the number of screened participants may be increased. Treatment Groups and Duration: Following the Screening Visit (Visit 1) eligible participants will enter the Initial Study Period within 45 day s. Initial Study Period: Single -blind placebo treatment for 4weeks. Participants w ill commence single -blind study treatment at Visit 2 (Day 1). Main Study Period: Eligible participants will be randomi zed to receive 12 weeks double -blind treatment with either placebo or one of 4 dose regimens of GSK2330672 (20 mg, 90 mgor 180 mg taken once daily or 90 mg twice daily ). Final Study Period: Single -blind placebo treatment for 4 weeks. Follow -up Period: 4 weeks. A participant’s total duration of study participation will be approximately 24weeks from Visit 2 ( Day 1)of the Initial Period tocompletion of the Follow -up Telephone Visit . All study treatment will be administered orally twice dail y, using placebo tablets as necessary to blind dose and regimen. During the Initial, Main and Final Study Periods it is important that participants remain blind to changes in study treatment e.g. from single - blind placebo to randomized double -blind treatment and subsequently to single -blind placebo. Investigator and study site staff communication with participants should ensure maintenance of each participant ’sblinding to treatment throughout the study . Based on interim data, the study may be adapted to remove or add dose regimens of GSK2330672 up to a maximum total daily dose of 360 mg . 2020N437913_00"

INTRODUCTION GSK2330672 is a selective inhibitor of the human ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) that is being develop edas a novel, oral treatment for pruritus associated with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC ). 3.1. Stud y Rationale This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy , safet y and tolerability of a range of doses of GSK2330672 for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe pruritus associated with PBC. A secondary objective is to evaluate the potent ial of GSK2330672 to improve markers of disease progression in PBC patients at increased risk of developing advanced disease. 3.2. Background Primary biliary cholangitis is a rare, chronic condition caused b y the inflammatory destruction of the intrahepatic bi le ducts giving rise to impaired bile acid flow and retention in the liver, leading to hepatic scarring, fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis and liver failure. A major s ymptom associated with PBC is pruritus, which is an intense itching that can occur anywhe re on the body , often resulting in disturbed sleep and having a significant impact on a patient’s qualit y of life. Currentl y there are few therapies that provide effective relief of pruritus. Located in the distal ileum of the gastrointestinal tract, IBAT is responsible for the active reuptake of bile acids from the gut lumen that are then returned to the liver via the portal vein, resulting in efficient enterohepatic conservation of bile acids, and negative feedback regulation of hepatic bile acid synthes is. For patients with PBC, inhibition ofIBAT by GSK2330672 is anticipated to increase excretion of bile acids andreduce bile acid concentrations in the liver and sy stemic circulation, resulting in reduced pruritus and associated s ymptoms. The associated alterations in hepatic bile acids have the potential to reduce liver damage and slow PBC disease progression . A previous study in 22 PBC patients with pruritus (GSK study BAT1172 13) demonstrated an improvement in patient -reported itch sy mptoms during 14 days treatment with GSK2330672 90mg twice daily compared to placebo . Where improvements in itch were observed , they were evident by 7 day s of treatment and continued through the treatment period. Most itch scores began to worsen following end of treatment with the majority not return ingto baseline within 2 weeks. The present study is designed to further assess the drug’s therapeutic potential in terms of efficacy , durability of effect, dose -response relationship, safety and tolerability . A detailed descr iption of the chemistry , pharmacology , efficacy , and safet y of GSK2330672 is provided in the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB). 2020N437913_00"

Overall Design Figure 1 Study Schematic This is a phase IIb, m ulticenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, dose -finding study in adults with moderate to severe pruritus associated with PBC. The study hasan adaptive design which aims to utilize interim data to further inform and potentia lly optimize the doses under investigation (see Section 10.3.4 ). Following the Screening Visit, there will be four study periods: Initial Study Period: Single -blind placebo treatment for 4 weeks during which participants’ symptoms will be recorded in the eDiary to establish baseline symptoms and assess eligibility for randomization and compliance with study procedures. Main Study Period: Eligible participants will be randomized to receive 12 weeks double -blind treatment with e ither placebo or one of 4 dose regimens of GSK2330672 (20 mg, 90 mg or 180 mg taken once daily or 90 mg twice daily ). Randomization will be stratified based on participant’s risk of PBC disease progression based on serum AL P and total bilirubin concentrat ions at Day 1 (see Section 7.3.1 ). Final Study Period: Single -blind placebo treatment for 4 weeks to assess s ymptoms and safet y post -completion of double- blind treatment. 2020N437913_00"
32,page_32,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 33Follow -up Period: to assess sy mptoms and use of anti -pruritus medications by telephone visit. Eligible participants may continue to receive some therapies for the treatment PBC provided these are maintained at stable doses and there is no plan to discontinue them during the stud y. Concomitant use of cholestyra mine, colesev elam , colestipol or colestimide is not permitted until after completion of the Main Study Period. Obeticholic acid use is not permitted at an y time during the study. All study treatment will be administered orally twice a day , using placebo t ablets as necessary to blind dose and regimen. Participant s will commence single -blinded study treatment at Visit 2 [Day1 ]. During the Initial, Main and Final Study Periods it is important that participants remain blind to changes in study treatment from single -blind placebo to randomized double -blind treatment and subsequently to single -blind placebo. Investigator and stud y site staff communication with participants should ensure maintenance of each participant ’sblinding to treatment throughout the study . A participant’s total duration in the study will be approximately 24weeks from Day 1 to completion of the Follow -up Telephone Visit . The study also includes an exploratory Actigraphy Sub -study which will be conducted at a limited number of study sites and in a sub -set of participants who give their consent. 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 150adult participants with PBC and moderate to severe pruritus will be screened to achieve 118randomized and 100 evaluable participants overall. Should emergi ng data diverge significantly from protocol assumptions, the total sample size will adjusted to include up to 160 randomized participants , and to approximately 200 screened participants (see Section 10.3.4 ). If during the stud y the screen failure rate is higher than anticipated, the number of screened participants may be increased. Participants are considered evaluable if they have taken at least one dose of double -blind study treatment and have both a Baseline and a Week 16assessment for itch (see Section 10.1). If participants discontinue single -blind study treatment during the Initial Study Period or do not meet the additional criteria for randomization (see Section 6.3), they will not be randomized or continue in the study and may be replaced. Participants who prematurely discontinue double -blind study treatment after randomization will stay in the study and complete the remaining scheduled visits, if possible. Any participant who withdraws from the study after randomization will not be replaced. 2020N437913_00"
33,page_33,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 345.3. Participant and Study Completion A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all periods of the stud y including the Follo w-up Telephone Visit .A participant is considered to have completed stud y treatment if he/she has taken study treatment through to the end of the Final Study Period (Visit 7). The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last Follow -up telephone cont act of the last participant in the study . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of different doses of GSK2330672 and includes placebo to support the evaluation of treatment response. During the Mai n Study Period study treatment will be provided using randomized , double -blind methodology . Previous studies have demonstrated that patient -reported itch may show some improvement on placebo treatment, so placebo control is used in this study to help dist inguish the effect of GSK2330672 relative to no treatment. The use of single -blind placebo in the Initial Study Period will establish each participant’s baseline level of itch, against which their response to GSK2330672 will be assessed. Participants whos e itch score at the end of single -blind placebo (i.e. baseline )is too low to reliably detect an improvement on blinded study treatment, or who do not complete sufficient daily eDiary entries, will be withdrawn from the study at the end of the Initial Stud y Period. The Final Study Period uses single -blind placebo to support the evaluation of the recurrence of s ymptoms upon cessation of blinded study treatment. Assignment of randomized study treatment will be stratified according to the participant’s risk of PBC progression at baseline, with the treatment allocation ratios varying across the two strata (see Section 7.3.1 ). This is intended to increase the ability of the study to detect any difference in change in markers of PBC progression between placebo and GSK2330672 in participants whose liver chemistry indicates an increased risk of disease progression. The study duration has been chosen to ensure adequate time to assess the effect of GSK2330672, whilst minimizing the perio d of restrictions on use of concomitant medications and the associated inconvenience to participants with troublesome symptoms. During the study , participants may continue to receive selected agents for the treatment of PBC (e.g. ursodeox ycholic acid [UDCA ]), provided the dosage prior to and during the study , is stable. Prohibited agents include those that bind bile acids (cholesty ramine, colesevelam, colestipol or colestimide) or that may exacerbate s ymptoms of pruritus (obeticholic acid), since their use during the study may compromise the efficacy and safet y evaluation of GSK2330672 (see also Section 6.2). However, during the Final Study Period whilst receiving single -blind placebo, and during the Follow Up Period, if 2020N437913_00"
34,page_34,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 35partic ipants report their itch has recurred or persists they may receive previous or new anti-prurit ustherapies as clinically indicated (see Section 7.7). The use of an adaptive design, with the evaluation of interim efficacy and safet y data, will facilitate characterisation of the dose -response relationship of GSK2330672 (see Section 10.3.4 ). 5.5. Dose Justification To date PBC patients have received GSK2330672 at a dose of 45 mg twice daily increased to 90 mg twice daily after 3 day sand continued for 14 day s in total . The dose range for the current study is based on responses observed in these PBC patients and in the biomarkers total serum bile acids and 7--hydroxy -4-cholesten -3-one(C4) measured in Ty pe II diabetic (T2DM) patients. The IB provides further details on the findings in these studies. The doses selected for the current study provide an initial range in order to characterize the effects of GSK2330672 on pruritus in PBC patient s. Since the ED50 was observed to be in the range of 30 to 60 mg for both biomarkers in T2DM, a lower, potentially minimally effective dose of 20 mg was selected to explore the GSK2330672 dose associated with a minimum effect on itch. A 90 mg twice dail ydose is included given its observed efficacy from the study in PBC patients. A 180 mg once daily dose is also included to determine if once dail ydosing would have a similar impact on itchas twice daily dosing. The study treatment arms planned for this study are: Placebo 20mg once daily (anticipated minimally effective dose) 90mg once daily 180mg once daily (anticipated to identify plateau of efficacy ) 90mg twice daily (demonstrated efficacy in previous study ) Following the interim analy sis,the GSK2330672 arms may be adapted up to a maximum total daily dose of 360mg (see Section 10.3.4 ).This dose has adequate nonclinical toxicology cover for local gastrointestinal tract exposure (based on administered oral dose, i.e., 7.2 mg/kg/day assuming 50 kg body weight): 139 -fold No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL )in the rat and 69- fold NOAEL in the dog for local gastrointestinal tract exposure (mg/kg/day dose). Further information on nonclinical toxicology studies can be foun d in the IB. 2020N437913_00"

STUDY POPULA TION Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. To qualify for screening and enrollment, the prospective participant must pres ent with pruritus associated with PBC. Prior to requesting informed consent, the investigator will review (where practical) a prospective participant’s case notes or medical history , to evaluate his/her experience of itch and medication s,to assess consis tency with the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following the investigator’s pre -screening assessment, potential participants will be asked to give their written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures being performed, and their eligibility assessed (see Section 6.1and Section 6.2). Screening procedures to be performed following completion of the informed consent process are listed in Table 2. 6.1. Inclusion Criter ia Participants are eligible to be included in the study onl y if all of the following criteria apply : Age 1.Participant must be 18 to 80 y ears of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics 2.Participants who have proven PBC, as demonstrated by having at least 2 of the following: History of sustained increased ALP levels >upper limit of normal (UL N) first recognized at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit (Note: Sustained AL P elevations at the time of Screening is not required, recognizing that the ALP may have decreased after institution of UDCA therapy as described in inclusion number 4). Documented positive anti -mitochondrial antibody (AMA) titer (>1:40 titer on immun ofluorescence or M2 positive by ELISA) or PBC -specific antinuclear antibodies (antinuclear dot and /ornuclear rim positive). Liver biopsy (at any time in the past) cons istent with PBC. 3.Participants must rate their itch severit yas being ≥4 on a0 to 10-point scale for the majority of time (at least half the day s, as recalled by the participant) during the 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. Periods of low itch or no itch are acceptable as long as the worst daily itch score is ≥4 on the majority of days. 4.Participants who are currently taking UDCA should be on stable doses of UDCA for >8 weeks at time of screening. Participants not taking UDCA due to 2020N437913_00"

Participants with history of cholecy stectomy ≥3 months before screening may be eligible for enrollment. 8.Any current medical condition ( e.g. psychiatric disorder, senility or dementia ), which may affect the parti cipant’s ability to comply with the protocol specified procedures. Prior/Concomitant Therapy 9.Initiation or increase in dose of colchicine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or systemic corticosteroids in the 2 months prior to screening. Note: If a change in d ose in any of these medications is anticipated during the course of the stud y, the participant should be excluded. [Rationale: Limited evidence indicates these drugs may alter disease progression in some PBC patients.] 10.Initiation or increase in dose of b ezafibrate or fenofibrate at any time during the 3 months prior to screening. Participants may join the study on stable doses of these medications , but no change or discontinuation is permitted until completion of the Main Study Period. [Rationale: limit ed evidence suggests fibrates may improve ALP and pruritus. ] 11.Initiation or increase in dose of an y of the following in the 8 weeks prior to screening: rifampicin, naltrexone, naloxone, nalfurafine, or sertraline. Participants may join the study on stable or decreased doses of these medications, but no change in dose is permitted until completion of the Main Study Period . [Rationale: There is limited evidence these drugs improve pruritus due to PBC.] 12. Bile acid binding resin use: a participant must discont inue use of cholesty ramine, colesevelam, colestipol or colestimide prior to the start of the Initial Study Period (no later than Day -2). Note: these drugs may be administered after completion of the Main Study Period , if clinically indicated . [Rationale: these resins may bind GSK2330672 and interfere with its effects.] 13.Obeticholic acid use: a participant must discontinue use of obeticholic acid at least 8 weeks prior to the start of the Initial Study Period and may not restart until after the end of the s tudy. [Rationale: obeticholic acid use can cause changes in ALP and pruritus which may confound evaluation of the effects of GSK2330672.] 14.Administration of any other IBAT inhibitor in the 3 months prior to screening [Rationale: Effects of another IBAT inh ibitor may influence pruritus. ] Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience 15.

One unit is equivalent to 8 g of alcohol: a ha lf-pint (~240 mL ) of beer, 1 glass (125 mL) of wine or 1 measure (25 mL) of spirits. 6.3. Criteria for Randomization Following completion of the I nitial Study Period, participants will be required to meet the following criteria for randomization at Visit 3 [Wee k 4]: Participants with a Worst Daily Itch Score on the 0 -10 numerical rating scale (NRS) which is ≥3 on at least 5 of the previous 7 day s. Participant has entered data into the eDiary on at least 10 of the 14 required occasions in the previous 7 day s. Otherwise, the participant will stop participation in the study without additional follow - up after Visit 3 and will be considered a baseline (run -in) failure. The Study Reference Manual will contain details on how to access this eligibility information. Re fer to Section 6.5.2 of the protocol for further information. 6.4. Lifest yle Restrictions 6.4.1. Meals and Dietary Restrictions Following screening, participants will be required to attend all study visits having fasted forat least 6 hours (water, study treatments and other medications are permitted). 6.4.2. Caffeine, A lcohol, and Tobacco There are no restrictions. 2020N437913_00"

Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as par ticipants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequentl y entered in the Initial Study Period of the study . A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demograph y, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious AEs (SAEs). Additionally , the PBC -40 Scale, current and previous treatments for pruritus associated with PBC, observed efficacy and side effects of those treatments and reasons for discontinuation will also be collected. Some i ndividuals who do not meet the criteria f or participation in Initial Study Period may be rescreened. The only criteria for which this is acceptable are those related to the use of PBC or anti -prurit usmedications (e.g., requirements on dose stability , minimum time since stopping therapy ), where a delay in rescreening would allow the participant to become eligible. Participants should continue to meet all other eligibility criteria at the time of rescreening. Participants may only be rescreened once. Additionally , participants who could become eli gible as a result of a protocol amendment may be rescreened. Rescreening is only permitted where the par ticipant would have met all the eligibility requirements of the amended protocol at the time of the first (original) screening visit. The rescreened p articipants must meet all the eligib ility requirements at the time of the rescreening (subsequent screening) visit to become eligible. Rescreening is only permitted once for each r elevant amendment. All rescreened participants will be reconsented and assi gned a new participant number. 6.5.2. Baseline (Run- In) Failures Participants who donot complete the Initial Study Period or who do not meet the criteria for randomization at the end of the Initial Study Period (see Section 6.1) are considered baseline (run-in)failures and may not be rescreened without prior discussion with the Medical Monitor . In the event of a confirmed baseline failure at Visit 3 , the blood, urine, ECG, and TrialMax Slate assessments for Visit 3 ar e not required, and no further study treatment will be dispensed. If the FOBT has been collected and returned b y the participant, it should be sent to the laboratory for evaluation. The Visit 3 activities in the event of a baseline failure are listed in Table 1. 2020N437913_00"

Participants should take their stud y treatment twice a day approximately 12 hours apart. Following aninterim analy sis the study design may be adapted to add or remove dose regimens of GSK2330672 up to a maximum total daily dose of 360 mg . Blinding of study treatment across all study periods will be maintained. Consequently , depending on the dose/regimen selected, participants enrolled into the study after the interim may be dispensed either up to 3 bottles of study treatment for morning dosing orup to 2 bottles of study treatment for evening dosing. The maximum of number bottles that will be given to an individual participant at each di spensing will be 4. Participants will be instructed to take 2 tablets from each bottle. Further details are provided in the Study Reference Manual ( SRM ). At the start of the Initial Study Period (Visit 2 [Day 1]) participants meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be dispensed study treatment and instructed on how to take their medication. Study treatment administration will start with the evening dose on the day of the stud y visit, but may be deferred to next morning if the participant prefers. Participants will continue taking stud y treatment twice a day as instructed and will return for their next study visit having fasted for at least 6 hours (water permitted) andhaving taken their morning dose of study treatment. At the start of the Main Study Period (Visit 3 [Week 4]) participants randomized to double -blind study treatment will commence taking treatment that evening. They should return for each study visit having taken their morning dose fasted as above. At the start of the F inal Study Period (Visit 6 [Week 16]) participants will commence study treatment that evening, returning for their final clinic visit (Visit 7 [Week 20]) having taken their morning dose fasted as above. At each stud y visit new bottles of study treatment wi ll be dispensed in accordance with the SoA (seeSection 2). 7.2. Dose Modification No modification of individual participant’s stud y treatment dose is permitted. 2020N437913_00"
42,page_42,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 437.3. Method of Treatment A ssignment During all study period s participants will be allocated study treatment using an Interactive Voice/Web Response Sy stem (IVRS/IWRS). Before the study is initiated, the telephone number and call-in directions for the IVRS and/or the log in information and directions for the IWRS will be provided to each site. At the start of the Main Study Period all participants will be centrall y randomized to double -blind study treatment using IVRS/I WRS, and randomization will be implemented based on a sequestered fixed randomization schedule, andwill be blocked at the overall study level. The randomization schedule will be computer generated by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) using the randomization sy stem Randall. Participant s will be stratified as outlined in Section 7.3.1 .Blinded study sitepersonnel will receive a randomi zation notification indicating the unique participant identifier (randomi zation number) and the date and time of randomi zation. Each randomization number will be a unique identifier. Once a randomi zation number has been assigned, the number will not be reused even if the participant is not administered any study treatment. Returned study treatment should not be re -dispensed to the participants. Details of the treatment assignment pro cess are contained in the SRM . 7.3.1. Treatment A ssignment in the Study Periods Initial Study Period At Visit 2 [Day 1] participants who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be allocated single blind placebo. Main Study Period At the Visit 3 [Week 4] participants meeting the randomization criteria will be allocated to double -blind study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule . Randomization will be stratified according to region (Europe, North America, Japan) and theparticipant’s risk of PBC progression at baseline based on serum AL P and total bilirubin concentrations obtained at Visit 2 [Day 1] as follows: ALP <1.67x ULN and total bilirubin ULN (estimated 60% of participants), or ALP ≥1.67x UL N and/or total bilirubin >UL N (est imated 40% of participants). Treatment allocation ratios will vary across these two strata (see Section 10.1). This is to increase the ability of the study to detect any difference in change in markers of PBC progression betwe en placebo and active treatment in participants whose liver chemistry indicates increased risk of disease progression. Final Study Period At Visit 6 [Week 16] participants will be allocated single blind placebo. 2020N437913_00"
43,page_43,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 447.4. Blinding During the Initial, Main and Fina l Study Periods it is important that participants remain blinded to changes in study treatment from single -blind placebo to randomized double - blind treatment and subsequently to single -blind placebo. Investigator and study site staff communication with pa rticipants during the informed consent procedure and all subsequent study procedures/visits should ensure maintenance of each participant’s blinding to treatment. The IVRS/I WRS will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions . The double -blind may be b roken if, in the opinion of the investigator, it is in the participant’s best interest for the investigator or treating phy sician, to know the study treatment assignment. GSK must be notified before the double -blind is broken unless identification of the study treatment is required for a medical emergency in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the participant’s condition. I n this case, GSK must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the b lind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and electronic case report form (e CRF ), as applicable. If the participant’s treatment code is unblinded b y the investigator or treating ph ysician, the partici pant must discontinue study treatment, but remain in the study and complete all remaining stud y visits (see Section 8.1). The primary reason for the discontinuation of study treatment (i.e. the event or conditi on that led to the unblinding) will be recorded in the eCRF. GSK’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any participant with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be se nt to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identify ing the participant’s treatment assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy. 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability The investigat or or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the stud y treatment. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentall y controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storag e conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for stud y treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenan ce (i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the SRM. 2020N437913_00"
44,page_44,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 45Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study treatment is not expected to pose significant safet y risks to site staff. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the investigator, where this is required b y local laws, or is available upon request from GSK. 7.6. Treatment Compliance Blinded study treatment will be dispensed to participants at each study visit with sufficient tablets until the next visit based on the visit windows (see SoA [Section 2]). At each visit the participants will be required to return all unused study treatment. When participants self -administer study treatment at home, they will be required to document missed doses of study treatment in their eDiary . Complian ce with study treatment will be assessed through review of the eDi ary and returned tablets, and by query ing the participant during the study visits. Compliance will be documented in the source documents and eCRF. A record of the number of stud y treatment tablets dispensed to and taken by each participant must be maintained and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates will also be recorded in the eCRF. 7.7. Concomitant Therapy Any medication or vaccine (including ov er-the-counter or prescription medicines, topical agents including topical corticosteroids, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant has taken in the 3 months prior to Screening, or is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded in the eCRF along with: reason for use dates of administration including start and end dates dosage information including dose and frequency Note: Anti -pruritus medications (including an y topical medications and rescue therap y) or other interventions during the Final Study Period and reported in the Follow -up Telephone Contact will be recorded in the eCRF.

During the Final Study Period and the Follow Up Period, use of these agents may be permitted (see Section 7.7.3). 7.7.2. Permitted Medications Other than the prohibite d medications (see Section 7.7.1), participants may take medications for concomitant conditions or inter- current illness as necessary . All use of any concomitant medications, including topical agents, must be r ecorded within the eCRF. Permitted agents for the treatment of PBC and its associated s ymptoms are as follows: UDCA: Participants may be enrolled in the study on UDCA provided the dose has been stable during the 8 weeks prior to screening. N o change or d iscontinuation is permitted until completion of the Main Study Period. Note participants not taking UDCA due to intolerance may be enrolled if their last dose was at least 8 weeks prior to screening (see Section 6.1).During the Final Study Period and the Follow Up Period UDCA may be permitted (see Section 7.7.3 ). Participants taking UDCA will be required to not administer their morning dose of UDCA (if applicable) before each of the PK sampling visits and to record the time of their last UDCA dose (see Section 9.5). Colchicine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or systemic corticosteroids: Use of these agents is permitted during the study as lon g as the dose has remained stable (i.e., unchanged) during the 2 months prior to the screening visit and the dose does not change throughout the stud y. If there is a clinical need to start one of these medications during the study , it should be discussed with the medical monitor wherever possible. During the Final Study Period and the Follow Up Period UDCA may be permitted (see Section 7.7.3 ). Rifampicin, naltrexone, naloxone, nalfurafine, or sertraline: Parti cipants may be enrolled into the study on stable or decreased doses of any of these agents. However, no dose increase is permitted until completion of the Main Study Period. Note: A participant is not eligible for the stud y if he/she started or had a dos e increase in an y of these agents during the 8 weeks prior to screening (see Section 6.2). During the Final Study Period and the Follow Up Period, use of these agents may be permitted (see Section 7.7.3 ). Bezafibrate or fenofibrate: Participants may be enrolled in the study on stable doses of these medications, but no change or discontinuation is permitted until completion of the Main Study Period. Note: A participant is not eligible for the study if he/she started or had a dose increase in either of these agents during the 3 months prior to screening (see Section 6.2). During the Final Study Period and the Follow Up Period, use of these agents may be permitted (see Section 7.7.3 ). 2020N437913_00"

Anti -diarrheals: Participants experiencing diarr hea may take anti -diarrheal treatments obtained over -the-counter or prescribed b y the investigator or another practitioner. Use of these treatments and their effect will be recorded at each review of concomitant medications. 7.7.3. Rescue Therapy During the Final Study Period and Follow Up Period only, if participants’ itching recurs or persists and they request additional therapy , they may resume their previous anti - pruritus medication if clinically indicated. If the participant’s itching warrants new or increas ed doses of anti- pruritus therap y, this can be administered if clinically indicated. Other non- pharmacologic interventions may also be used (e.g., nasobiliary drainage) if clinically indicated. Use of an y rescue therap y should be recorded within the eCRF . 7.8. Treatment after the End of the Study The Sponsor will not provide treatment after the end of the study ; participants should be managed according to their treating ph ysician. 8. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA 8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Participants may prematurely discontinue study treatment due to AEs or poor tolerance or for an y other reason including withdrawal of consent. I n all cases the participant should be encouraged to discuss any potential study treatment discontinuation with the investigator pr ior to stopping treatment. Premature discontinuation of study treatment due to lack of efficacy is discouraged; where possible participants should be encouraged to remain on study treatment until the end of Final Study Period. Participants who discontinu e study treatment following rand omizatio n and before the scheduled end of the Final Study Period will complete Early End of Treatment Assessments (see SoA [Section 2])before their last dose of study treatment , if possible. Participants will not be withdrawn from the stud y but should complete the remaining scheduled visits and assessments, in cluding the eDiary , up to and including the end of the Final Study Period (Visit 7 [Week 20])and undergo the End of Follow-up Telephone Visit (Visit 8 [Week 24]) . 8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Increased Monitoring and Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry increased monitoring and stopping criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinical liver safety guidance). 2020N437913_00"
47,page_47,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 48The study population will be recruited based on the presence of pre-existing hepatobiliary disease. Study specific withdrawal criteria have been instituted in consultation with internal GSK advi sors and external experts. Based upon screening lab results for serum ALT and total bilirubin, participants will be required to return to the clinic or local specialist/collaborator within one week or sooner for repeat testing (including AST, ALT, total bi lirubin, AL P and PT/I NR) as indicated below if any of the following liver chemistry criteria for increased monitoring or for stopping study treatment are met : Table 4 Liver Chemistry Criteria for Increased Monitoring Post -Screening Lab Result Actions ALT > 2x participant’s screening ALT AND >3x ULNRepeat liver chemistry testing within 1 week (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, ALP, and PT/INR). Inform Medical Monitor. Continue to monitor the above liver chemistries at least weekly until values stabilize or fall below the criteria for increased monitoring . Study treatment will be stopped for a participant if any of the following liver chemistry stopping criteria are met: Table 5 Liver Chemistry Criteria for Stopping Study Treatment Post -Screening Lab Result Actions Total bilirubin > 2x participant’s screening AND >1.5x ULN Stop study treatment immediately . Discuss with Medical Monitor within 24 hours . Repeat liver chemistry testing (including AST, AL T, total bilirubin, ALP, and PT/INR) within 24 -72 hours where possible but within 1 week, and thereafter at least weekly until values stabilize or fall below the criteria for increased monitoring. Refer to Protocol Appendix 4 for further follow -up and monitoring requirements.Total bilirubin >3x ULN ALT > 3x participant’s screening ALT result AND > 5x ULN ALT >8x ULN of ALT In addition, study treatment will be stopped for a participant if there are liver chemistry elevations which, in the op inion of the investigator, are not attributable to the participant’s underly ing PBC, or if there is worsening liver chemistry associated with appearance of new sy mptoms which may typically be associated with drug -induced liver injury (including fatigue, na usea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia [>5%]) . 2020N437913_00"
48,page_48,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 49NOTE: Refer to Section 12.4.1 fordetails of the required assessments if a participant meets the above stopping criteria .Section 12.4 also provides diagrams to facilitate implementation of the criteria for increased monitoring and forstopping study treatment . 8.1.2. QTc Stopping Criteria The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based o n QTcB, then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analy sis. Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc should be based on a single QTc value of an electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period. If an automated rea ding is not available the ECG should be manually over -read b y the investigator or adequatel y trained physician. A participant who meets either of the criteria based on the single ECG reading will be withdrawn from stud y treatment: QTc ≥530 msec AND/ ORchange from baseline of QTc >60 msec 8.1.3. Renal Stopping Criteria A serum creatinine stopping criterion has been included to support participant safet y. A participant’s study treatment will be interrupted if there is an increase from Baseline (Visit 3) in serum creatinine of >0.3 mg/dL (26.52 mol/L ). The investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor to determine the appropriate evaluation and guidance on whether stud y treatment may be re -started. 8.1.4. Other Stopping Criteria Female participants who become pr egnant during the study should discontinue study treatment immediatel y (see Section 9.2.6). 8.1.5. Temporary Discontinuation In cases where participants discontinue study treatment due to an AE the investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor to determine the appropriate evaluation and guidance on whether study treatment may be re -started. 2020N437913_00"

Study Treatment Restart or Rechallenge Study treatment restart or rechallenge after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met by any participant in this study is not allowed. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Study Participants should be encouraged to remain on study treatmen t and stay in the study completing stud y assessments (see Section 8.1).Where possible, the investigator should consider consultation with the Medical Monitor prior to withdrawing a participant from the study . A participant m ay withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioural, compliance or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must docu ment this in the site study records. Participants withdrawing from the study after ran domizatio n should undergo Study Withdrawal Assessments, if possible, andbe asked if they may be contacted for an End of Follow -up Telephone Visit (see the SoA [Section 2]). 8.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a pa rticipant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. 2020N437913_00"

STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (see Section 2). Protoc ol waivers or exemptions are not allowed . Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA (Table 1) , is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility crite ria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical manage ment (e .g., blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol- specified criteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA (Table 1). The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study , including an y extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 450mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for technic al issues with the samples. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. Electronic Data Collection An eDiary will be used to collect participant’s daily symptoms and the weekly assessment of participant’s gastrointestinal sy mptoms (GI) and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Sca le (GSRS) (see Section 9.1.2). Additionally , the eDiary will prompt participants to record aspects of their stud y treatment such as whether they have missed doses. At the start of the Initial Study Period (Vis it 2[Day 1]) each participant will be provided with the eDiary and will be trained on its correct use, including how to complete the GSRS. During the study investigators and stud y site staff will have on -line access to their individual participant’s eDia ry data in order to monitor compliance with the completion requirements and compliance with study treatment. At study visits participants will complete all Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) measures using an electronic device called a TrialMax Slate; all participants will be trained on the use of the TrialMax Slate and on completion of the PROs. 2020N437913_00"
51,page_51,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 52The SRM provides further details on the use of the eD iary and TrialMax Slate, and on the completion of the PROs. Participants will be provided with a simple user manual to support correct use of the eDiary at home. 9.1.2. Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) All PRO measure s will be completed b y the participant before an y other study procedures are performed, the onl y exception to this will be the collectio n of fasting labora tory tests (Note: P articipants may consume a light snack before completing the PROs). T he intent is to minimise the interaction with the investigator and study staff prior to completion of the PROs. 9.1.2.1. Patient Reported Sy mptom Questionnaire Using the eDiary participants will record details of their symptoms of itch, and its impact on their sleep and level of fatigue. The eDiary will be completed twice each day , in the morning and evening approximately at the time of study treatment dosing. Participants will score the severit y of their itching using a NRS from 0 to 10 where represents and . The NRS recorded in the morning will characterize the itch experienced during the night -time, whilst the NRS recorded in the evening will characterize the itch experienced during the day -time hours. The Worst Daily Itch Score is the most severe (highest) NRS recorded on a given day . Each morning participants will also score the interference of itch on their sleep using a NRS from 0 to 10 where represents and represents . Each evening participants will also score their level of fatigue using a NRS from 0 to 10 where represents and represents . Other aspects of s ymptoms associated with PBC and study treatment will also be collected, including weekly assessment of participant’s GI s ymptoms. 9.1.2.2. PBC- 40 Health- Related Quality of Life Scale The PBC -40 is a patient -derived, disease specific health-related quality of life measure with data to support its validity in PBC [Jacoby , 2005] .The PBC -40 was devised and validated with a 4 week recall period, which in this study will be modified to a recall period of ‘the past 7 day s’. The PBC -40 scale will be administered with a 7 day recall period at Visits 2 through 7 [Day 1 through Week 20] in the study , and if applicable at earl y stud y treatment discontinuation and at study withdrawal. In addition, the PBC -40 will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) in all enrolled participants in order to investigate the quality of life and previous treatment experience in the population being considered for inclusion in the study and to assess whether the study exclusion criteria preferentially include a sub- group distinct from the general patient population. 2020N437913_00 CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI"

I t has data to support it s validity in a population of patients with pruritus and covers five dimensions of itch experienced b y participants: duration, degree, direction, disability and distribution [Elman , 2010] . The distribution dimension is assessed by reference to a checklist of potential locations and can be summarized by counting the number of locations identified as itching. The 5 -D Itch scale will be administered at Visits 2 , 3, 6 and 7 [Day 1 and Weeks 4, 16 and20] in the study , and if applicable at earl y study treatment discontinuation and at study withdrawal. 9.1.2.4. Gastrointestinal Sy mptom Rating Scale (GSRS) The GSRS is a validated scale that will be used to assess gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by participants over the preceding 5 to 7 day s [Svedlund, 1988]. Participants will be asked to complete the GSRS every week starting at Visit 2 through to Visit 7 [Day 1 through Week 20] in the study . 9.1.2.5. Other PRO Measures EuroQOL 5D -5L (EQ5D -5L)will be used to assess patient health utility . Within the literature, there are few reported measures of health utility in the PBC patient population including those with pruritus. The measurements will be used to better understand change in participant’s s ymptoms, preference for treatment, and overall health utility for use in health economic evaluations. The EQ5D -5L will be completed at Visits 2, 3, and 6 [ Day 1 and Weeks 4 and 16] in the study , and if applicable at earl y stud y treatment discontinuation and at study withdrawal. Patient’s Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S)will be used to understand how participant’s dail y itch score using the 0 -10 NRS relates to overall participant -reported itch severit y. The PGI -S uses a 5- level response scale and will be collected at Visit 2 through to Visit 7 [Day 1 through Week 20] in the study , and if applicable at earl y stud y treatment discontinuation and at study withdrawal. Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGI- C)will be used to understand how participant’s daily itch score using the 0 -10 NRS relates to overall participant -reported change in itch severity. The PGI -C comprises a 7 -level response scale to evaluate the participant’s assessment of change since baseline and a dichotomous (Yes/No) question on whet her the change is considered meaningful by the participant. The PGI -C will be collected at Visit 3 through to Visit 7 [Week 4 through Week 20] in the study , and if applicable at earl y stud y treatment discontinuation and at study withdrawal. Beck Depressi on Inventory -II (BDI -II)is a 21 -item questionnaire that will be used to assess the effect of GSK2330672 on depression associated with pruritus in PBC participants. The questionnaire will be completed at Screening, Visits 3 and 6 2020N437913_00"

Participant Treatment Experience Assessment is a questionnaire that will evaluate participants’ experience of itch and their satisfaction (benefits and dis advantages) with treatment, which will be performed at the end of the Final Study Period (Visit 6[Week 16]), or at earl y stud y treatment discontinuation . 9.1.3. Actigraphy Sub- Study An Actigraph y Sub -study will be conducted and is optional for investigator sites and participants. Participants who give their informed consent will wear an activity monitor device (similar to a wristwatch) on each wrist during the period of measurement, which will be used to assess the frequency and duration of scratching events. Participating sites may offer the Sub- study to an y participant considering the main study , providing in the investigator’s option, he/she is capable of understanding and performing the sub- study procedures. Willingness to participate in the Sub- study will not influence a participant’s acceptance into the main study . Participants who do not complete all the requested periods of measurement may continue in the main study . Failure to complete the Sub- study measurements will not constitute a protocol devia tion. Participants will be trained on how and when to use the a ctigraphy monitor s, which will be given to them at Visit 2, Visit 4 and Visit 5, with activity measurements performed on three occasions, over at least 5 nights during a 7 -day period. In order to allow flexibility for participants each of the 7 -day measurement periods can occur during either Week 2 or Week 3 (for the first measurement), Week 9 or Week 10 (for the second measurement), and Week 13 or Week 14 (for the third measurement), respect ively. During the measurement period participants may keep the monitors on all the time, or may remove them in the morning and put them back on before going to bed. Participants will return the monitors to site staff at their next study visit when data w ill be downloaded and stored for anal ysis. 9.2. Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 5. The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be collected from time informed consent is signed until the e nd of the Final Study Period (Visit 7) at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). 2020N437913_00"
54,page_54,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 55All AEs will be collected from the start of stud y treatment in the Initial Study Period (Visit 2) until the e nd of the Final Study Period (Visit 7) at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF not the AE section. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately ,and under no circumstances should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 5. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the stud y, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the stud y treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 5. 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE sand/or SAE s. Open -ended and non- leading verbal question ing of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than t hose provided in this study , since y our last visit/contact?” 9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non- serious AEs of spec ial interest (as defined in Appendix 5),will be follow ed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 8.3).Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 5. 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical respon sibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a study treatment under clinical 2020N437913_00"
55,page_55,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 56investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for su spected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific sa fety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the IBand will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular (CV) even ts detailed in Appendix 5and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific CV and Death sections of the e CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding CV(including sudden cardiac death) and non -CVdeath. The CV e CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific CVsection of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 9.2.6. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancie s in female participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until the end of the Follow -up Period. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the proce dures outlined in Appendix 2. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e .g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE. Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participat ing in the study will discontinue study treatment immediately but will remain in the study and continue to undergo study assessments (see Section 8.1). 9.3. Treatment of Overdose For this study , any dose of GSK233067 2 greater than 360 mg within a 20-hour time period will be considered an overdose. GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose as there is no specific antidote for GSK2330672. I n the event of a suspected overdose ,it is recommended that 2020N437913_00"
56,page_56,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 57the appropriate supportive clinical care should be instituted, as dictated by the participant’s clinical status. In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately . 2.Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and labor atory abnormalities until any associated s ymptoms have resolved, and for at least 5 days. 3.Obtain a plasma sample for PK anal ysis within 24 - 72 hours from the date of the last dose of study treatment, if requested b y the Medical Monitor (determined on a case-by-case basis). 4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on th e clinical evaluation of the participant. 9.4. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (see Section 2). All safet y assessments should be performed b y the investigator or a suitabl y qualified designee. 9.4.1. Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination (Screening Visit only ) will include, at a minimum, assessments of the s kin, CV, respiratory , gastrointestinal and neurological sy stems. Height and weight will also be measured (wearin g indoor clothing without shoes) and recorded. A brief ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, CVsystem, and abdomen (liver and spleen). Weight will also be measured (wearing indoor clothing without shoes) and reco rded. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs (pulse rate and blood pressure) will be assessed as outlined in the SoA (Table 1). Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed in the sitting position with a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. 2020N437913_00"

The first reading should be rejected. The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded in the eCRF. 9.4.3. Electrocardiograms A single 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (Table 1) using preferabl y an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. If an automated reading is not available the ECG should be manually over -read b y the investigator or an adequatel y trained phy sician. Refer to Section 8.1.2 for QTc withdrawal criteria and additional QTc readings that may be necessary . ECGs will be reviewed locally by the investigator or a n adequatel y trained physician and an y clinicall y sig nificant abnormalities reported in the eCRF. 9.4.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Appendix 6for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA (Section 2) for the timing and frequency . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The laboratory reports must be fi led with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underly ing disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All labora tory tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or Medical M onitor . If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 6, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA (Table 1). 9.5.

STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS 10.1. Sample Size Determination Approximately 118 participants will be randomized to ensure that approximately 100 eligible participants have an evaluable Week 16 assessment of itch . Sample size calculations were made using simulation to assess the precision of the estimated difference in response between each dose of GSK2330672 and placebo from the Emax dose -response model (see Figure 2). 2020N437913_00"

Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description Enrolled All participants who sign the ICF Randomized All participants who were randomized to receive study treatment, regardless of whether they took st udy treatment, will be used i n the summaries of participant disposition ITT (Intent to Treat) PopulationThis population will comprise all randomized participants who receive at least one dose of study treatment, have a baseline and at least one on -treatment assessment. Participants in the ITT Population will be classified according to the treatment as randomized. The ITT population will be the primary population for the statistical assessment of efficacy. Per Protocol Population The Per Protocol (PP) P opulation is a subset of the ITT population who adhere to the major protocol requirements. Protocol violator criteria will be defined in the Reporting Analysis Plan (RAP), and participants to be excluded from the PP population will be identified prior to the unblinding of the data at the end of the study. The PP population will be used for analysis of the primary endpoint to assess the sensitivity of the ITT results. The PP population may not be analysed if it comprises 80% of the ITT population and is balanced across dose levels. Safety All randomized participants who take at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received. 2020N437913_00"

Efficacy Analyses Endpoint Statistical Analy sis Methods Primary The primary objective is to estimate the relationship between doses of GSK2330672 and itch response. The primary analysis will be a model -based dose -response analysis of the change from Baseline to Week 16 in the Mean Worst Daily Itch Score on the 0 -10 NRS. The primary null hypothesis (H0) assumes that there is no effect of the test drug at any dose level and therefore no evidence of dose response. The alternate hypothesis (H1) assumes that there is a monotonic Emax dose response with GSK2330672 on participant experience of itch. A four parameter Emax dose-response model, once fitted, will be used to estimate the minimally effective dose and 95% confidence interval of each dose level of GSK2330672 relative to placebo. If problems are e ncountered fitting a four parameter Emax model, the model selection approach described by Kirby et al ( Kirby, 2011) will be taken (fitting a 3- parameter Emax model and a power model and selecting the one that best fits the data (i.e. smallest Akaike’s Information Criterion statistic (AIC)). If both of these models poorly fit, then additional models will be investigated sequentially until an appropriate model can be chosen (i.e. linear, quadratic, log- transformed dose). Further details of the Emax model will be defined in the RAP. Secondary Analyses of the following secondary endpoints will be analyzed as the change from Baseline to Week 16 using similar methodology as for the primary endpoint (with an appropriate link -function for bina ry endpoints): Mean change from Baseline in PBC -40. Mean change from Baseline in markers of PBC disease progression including ALP, ALT, AST, GGT, total bilirubin, albumin and PT/INR. Proportion of participants responding to treatment defined as ALP reducti on to <1.6 7x ULN and total bilirubin ≤ULN at the end of treatment (in participants with ALP ≥ 1.67x ULN and /or total bilirubin >ULN at Day 1). Proportion of participants who are responders using 3 separate definitions (Mean Worst Daily Itch Score <4, 30% reduction in Mean Worst Daily Itch Score, 2-point reduction in Mean Worst Daily Itch Score). Mean number of responder days using 3 separate definitions (Worst Daily Itch Score <4, 30% reduction in Worst Daily Itch Score, 2-point reduction in Worst Daily Itch Sc ore). Change from Baseline in Mean Daily Sleep Score. 2020N437913_00"

Graphical and tabular displays will be presented to facilitate safety data review. AEs and SAEs will be summarised, sorted by system organ class and preferred term assigned by MedDRA, and presenting as number and percent by treatment group. Additional summaries of AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment and study treatment re lated AEs will also be generated. Secondary Change from baseline in GSRS score. Change from baseline and percentage change from baseline for laboratory values will be summarised by visit and treatment group. In addition, the number and percentage of part icipants with values outside the potential clinical importance range will also be summarized. All vital sign data and change from baseline will be summarized by visit and treatment group. For systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, the numb er and percentage of participants with values of potential clinical importance and separately, those meeting the pre -specified withdrawal criteria will be summarized by treatment group. Criteria for potential clinical importance will be specified in the R AP. Exploratory Will be described in the reporting and analysis plan 10.3.3. Other A nalyses Pharmacokinetic , PDand biomarker exploratory analy ses will be described in the RAP . Any other population analy ses (e.g., dose-response) conducted based on emerging da ta will be described in the CSR or a separate report as appropriate. 2020N437913_00"
65,page_65,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 6610.3.4. Interim A nalyses An interim anal ysis of efficacy and safety will be performed in order to determine whether the initial doses of GSK2330672 need to be modified. Once a participant is assigned to a treatment arm, their individual treatment assignment will not change as a result of the outcome of the interim anal ysis and their data will still contribute to the final dose response anal ysis. An interim analysis will allow for potential discon tinuation for futility , elimination of less informative doses (e .g.,those which are ineffective or poorl y tolerated), and/or addition of lower or higher doses to more fully describe the dose -response characteristics of GSK2330672. In order to minimise bias, a firewalled analy tical group will perform the interim anal yses to maintain the integrit y of the study blind within the study team. T he unblinded data will be reviewed b y limited members of the trial leadership, who will review the results and may then decide to: 1.Continue as planned. 2.Stop for futility : Proposed futility rule to be based on a low posterior predicted probability that at least one dose will achieve a clinically relevant treatment difference to placebo (based on dose- response model). 3.Amen d dose levels: Proposed if dose -response and/or tolerability profile dramaticall y different to pre -study assumptions. Allocation post -interim would be focused on most informative doses chosen from a set of possible dose levels that includes those used pre- interim (e.g., if larger responses are seen on the lower doses then the ED50 may be smaller than was assumed during design and hence lower dose levels could be included and higher levels dropped). 4. Amend sample size: Proposed if an additional dose is added , or if the observed variability is dramatically different to the assumptions from the initial sample size calculations. The results of the interim anal ysis could lead to changes to the randomization ratio and/or a change in the total number of participant s to be randomized in the study . The decision to adapt the study will be determined by posterior probability decision rules which will be pre-defined and documented prior to unblinding in the RAP. Based on the overall panned sample size, an interim analy sis will be ideally performed after approximately 40 participants have reached their Visit 5 [ Week 12] . However, should enrolment fail to occur as anticipated, the timing of the planned interim may be revised. Additional interim analy ses may be conducted based on the initial data . Details of the analy ses to support the interim and the decision rules will be documented in a separate Interim Analy sis Plan. The final timings of the interim anal yses will be documented in the clinical study report. 2020N437913_00"

Postmenopausal female A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Females on HRT and whose me nopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status befo re study enrollment.

Appendix 5: Adverse Eve nts: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e .g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, cons idered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (i .e., not related to progression of underl ying disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 2020N437913_00"
83,page_83,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 84the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (e .g., endoscopy , appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occ urrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e .g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e .g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 2020N437913_00"
84,page_84,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 85f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or resu lt in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such event s include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Adverse events of special interest include the following: Diarrhea reported as an AE Elevated ALT meeting stopping criteria Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event pa ge of the eCRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e .g., hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnosti cs reports) 2020N437913_00"
85,page_85,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 86related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF. It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/ SAE eCRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records befo re submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomf ort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are f acts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant the rapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her a ssessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . 2020N437913_00"
86,page_86,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 87There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal informati on to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of ca usality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The invest igator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additio nal laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Repor ting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section) ,in order to report the event within 24 hours. The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the relationship of each SAE to study treatment /study participation (causality ) within 72 hours of SAE entry into the eCRF. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the ele ctronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 2020N437913_00"
87,page_87,"2016N280566_ 02 CONFIDENTIA L 201000 88taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to the M edical M onitor by telephone. Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the SRM. SAE Reporting to GSK via Paper CRF Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the M edical M onitor. In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the SAE data co llection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SRM. 2020N437913_00"

Amendment 1 15-Nov-2016 Overall Rationale for the Amendment: Toclarify requirements for liver safet y monitoring and stopping criteria, as well as other administrative changes. Section # and NameDescription of Change Brief Rationale 8.1.1 Liver Chemistry Stopping CriteriaRepeat testing should include AST, ALT, total bilirubin, ALP and PT/INR (insertion of tests).Clarification on which liver tests are required. 12.4 Appendix 4: Liver SafetyInclusion of PT/INR as part of the liver s afety follow -up tests, which are required at least weekly. Following stopping of study treatment participants with liver safety findings should not be withdrawn but as well as liver safety follow -up should remain in the study undergoing study visits and a ssessments. Participants who stop study treatment for liver safety should not restart study treatment.Correction for missing test. Correction and alignment with Section 8.1 which states that participants who stop study treatment should remain in the study completing remaining study visits and assessments. Clarification and alignment with Section 8.1.6.1., which states that study treatment restart or rechallenge is not permitted. 2 Schedule of ActivitiesUpdate Footnote 1: Early End of Treatment an d Study Withdrawal Assessments are only performed post-randomization. If both are required at the same visit only the Early End of Treatment Assessments are performed.Clarification that the assessments are required only for randomized participants. As ass essments overlap, both are not required for the same visit. However, since the Participant Treatment Experience Assessment is required as part of the Early End of Treatment Assessments, these should be conducted. 8.1 Discontinuation of Study TreatmentEarly End of Treatment Assessments are only performed post-randomization. 8.2 Withdrawal from the StudyStudy Withdrawal Assessments are only performed post - randomization.
