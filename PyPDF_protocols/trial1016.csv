15,page_15,"2. Introduction 2.1 Incision al hernia incidence Incisiona l hernia (IH) is a common compl ication of abdom inal wall surgery. Its’ incidence varies greatly (2–30 %) amon g studies (1 -3) . The inc isional hern ia incidence is influenced by seve ral factors, such as clos ing techn ique (4,5) , follow-up time (6) and the moda lity of radiolo gical investigations,(7 ,8) , patient characteristics and co- morb idities as well as indication and type for sur gery(9). 2.2. Incisio nal hern ia etiolo gy The et iology of inc isiona l hernia is mu ltimodal. The si te and or ientation of the incision has an influence on the IH rates. Non-midline incisions—both paramed ian and transverse —carry a significantly reduced r isk of IHs compared to m idline inc isions (10 - 11) . Suturin g techn ique and the suture material used affect the hernia rate as well. Taking small bites of 5 mm with an intersuturing space of 5 mm with slowly absorbab le monof ilament suture results in a lower hern ia inc idence compared to large bite mass sutur ing (4-5, 12-14) . There is lack of evidence of basic biological pathogenes is of incisiona l hernias (IH). Spec ific features of connect ive tissue and the qua lity of fibrob lasts are proposed to have an influence on the risk for hernia formation (15). The inflamm atory response after an incision results in the f ibroprol iferative phase. Incisional hernia may be a result of disturbation in the fibroblast prol iferation in the laparoto my wound m atrix (16). Welch test will be used for continuous variable, the latter if assumpti on of homogenous variances does not hold. Linear mixed model (LMM) or generalized linear mi xed model (GLMM) will be used for repeatedly measured data, the pr evious for continuous data and latter for categorical data. Finance Materials and visits a re funded by hospital districts as part of treatment expenses. External funding will be applied to cover the co sts caused by imaging."
16,page_16,PREEMER TRIAL 8
17,page_17,"Fascial ischem ia is presumed to be one cruc ial factor in the development of an IH. The fascia is hypovascu lar and a wound experiences hypoxic stress immedi ately after surgical incision, which has been cons idered a major r isk factor for wound failure. Hypoxia interferes with angiogenes is and the healing process (17). The revascu larization at the wound site is critical to impro ve heal ing response (18). Good surgical sk ills and main taining sufficient perfusion in the wound area are impor tant issues to be no ted (19). Along with previous ly mentioned physiological alterations, patients’ comorbid ities and charac teristics can predispose them to deve lop of a hernia (9) . Connect ive tissue disorders increase the r isk for hern iation among various other patient-related factors (20, 21). One of the mo st common r isk factor, that increase the l ikelihood of deve lopment an IH is smok ing (75 %) ( 22). As a resu lt of an anal ysis of 14,618 p atients, Bosanquet in his rev iew and me ta-regression de termined the factors affectin g midline IH rates: diabetes mellitus, obes ity, cach exia, increasing age, male sex, chron ic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , a history of or ope ration for an abdomina l aortic aneur ysm (AAA), anaemia, smok ing, corticosteroids and sur gical site infection (SSI). Summar ising the resu lts of 56 publications , the prevalence of IHs after midline laparoto my was 12.8 % (range: 0 to 35.6 %) with a mean follow-up time 23.7 months (21) . 2.3 Incision al hernia de finition and e valuation Most commonl y, an IH is a bulge or a gap in the area of a postoper ative scar. It can be a symptomatic but is often associ ated with symptoms , such as pain, cosmet ic discomfort, bowel obstruction or even incarceration (23,24) . Valsal va’s manoeuvre is used to make the hernia more apparent clinically: the increase in intra-abdominal pressure causes the hernia sac to en large and protrude through the ana tomic defect. The c linical examination is recommended to be per formed in both s tanding and supine posit ions. The examination can be difficult in obese patients or in postope rative situations in which incisional hern ia may be difficult to distinguish from a postoperative compl ication, such as a hema toma, abscess or seroma. The radiolog ical imaging (ultrasound"
18,page_18,"(US) , compu ted tomography (CT) or ma gnetic resonance (MRI)) is useful in spec ifying the d iagnosis (8,25-27) . PREEMER TRIAL 9"
19,page_19,"A standard ised dynamic abdominal sonog raphy for hernias offers a safe and a low-cost diagnostic tool w ith great spec ificity and pos itive predict ive value (28) . A CT scan can also be an option in some cases like when planning operative treatment , although it induces a radiation load for p atients. When evaluating the IH rate, the difference between physical examin ation and imaging modal ities (u ltrasound or compu ter tomography) is impor tant in terms of accuracy (29 ,30) . A standard ised examin ation and dynamic evalu ation by ultrasound of the abdom inal wall is recommended in evalu ating a possible hernia (14,31). Incidence of IHs increases during a follow-up study t ime from 12.6 % at 12 months to 22.4 % at 36 months(6,32 ,33). There is a great diversity of abdominal wall IHs. During the early years of 2000 the first proposals for the classification of incisional ventral hernias were published. Throu gh 2009, there were seve ral proposa ls for classifyin g IHs accord ing to defect size, recurrence and topography to some extent, but none of these ach ieved w ide recogn ition or rout ine use(34 -36). In 2009, the European Hern ia Society (EHS) published a formula to classify primary and incisional abdom inal wall hernias (36). 2.4 Incision al hernia pre ventio n European Hernia Society ( EHS) guideline strongl y recommends to utilise a non -midline approach to a laparotomy whenever possible to decrease the inciden ce of incisional hernia (14). However, this is clearly not an opti on in an emergen cy laparotomy, as midline incision is the fastest and the best visualizing opening to explore the whole abdominal cavity in an emergen cy setting. For elective midline incisions, eviden ce-based recommendati on is to perform a continuous suturing technique with slowly absorbable monofila ment suture when closing the incision (14) Suturati on should be done performing a single layer aponeuroti c closure technique without separate closure of the perit oneum. A sma ll bites technique with a suture to wound length (SL/WL) rati o at leas t 4:1 is the current recommended method of fascial closure (12 - 14, 37,38). Prophylacti c mesh augmentati on in a non-emergency setting appears effective and safe and"
20,page_20,"can be suggested for high-risk patients (39-40). However , no recommendati ons can be given on the optimal PREEMER TRIAL 10"
21,page_21,"technique to close emergen cy laparotomy incisions because of lack of eviden ce (14) . This problem should be emphasized on due to high rates of IH after emergen cy laparotomy (41,42). All this makes the use of prophylacti c mesh in the emergen cy setting an interestin g proposition, as it may decreas e the rate of IHs . However, ther e are concerns over potential mesh related complications including infecti on, chronic pain, seromas and bowel fistulas especially in emergen cy situati ons like peritonitis and intestinal obstruction. There is preliminary evi dence published about the safety and efficiency of the prevention of IHs using meshes in the eme rgency laparotomy closure even in contaminated conditions (43,44). In the resent systemati c review and meta -analysis, only results of 2 studies and altogether 299 patients were eligible for the analysis (42) . Swiss case-control study reported an IH rate of 3,2% (2/63) in th e mesh group and 28,6% (20/70) in the control group (43) . Spanish study group had th e same kind of results in their retrospectiv e cohort; IH rate of 5,9% (3/50) in the mesh group and 33,3% (33/100) in the control group (44) . There was no statisti cally significant differen ce in the inciden ce of surgical site infecti on or other complicati ons when prophylacti c mesh group was compared to standard closure group. SSI rate in Swiss study was 60% and respectively only 17% in the Spanish study. This may reflect differen ces in the patient selecti on, therefore the safety profile of the prophylacti c mesh in the emergen cy setting has not been adequately described. Neither of the studies included in meta -analysis were not randomized controlled trials. There were also many methodological differen ces including patient selection, used mesh, and mesh placement. Thus, the conclusion of th e systemati c review paper was that there are li mited data to assess the effect o r safety of the use of prophylacti c mesh in the emergen cy laparotomy setting (42) . Randomized control trials are required to addr ess this important clinical questi on. EHS guideline group resulted the same conclusion in their recommendati on report (14). There are about 1650 p atients are oper ated in Fin land because of IH every year. Accord ing to the European study, the est imated co st for IH sur gery is 6450 euros (45). The correspond ing costs in Sweden were even higher reach ing 9060 euros per treatment (12). Extrapolated to Fin land, this means that oper ative treatment of IHs cause more than 10 million expenses to the Finn ish health care sector in a year. Some of these costs may be avoidable by using the prop hylactic mesh dur ing the"

Principal investigator may advice with mesh application technique if desired. Hospitals located in Finland are considered for parti cipation. 9. Risk Analysis 9.1. Potential Risks Surgeons performing emergen cy laparotomies will be trained and guided for the mesh placement. Based on previous studies, the use of the mesh is both safe and effective. Study patients will be followed very closely postoperatively. As the previous re search on synthetic mesh utilized as prophylaxis at emergen cy midline laparotomy is scarce, a n analysis of the complications and risks is done and evaluated for safety reasons after 30 patients have been randomized to each group and reached 30 days follow - up. For the same reason, there will be further analys is on the complications of the mesh after 30 patients randomized to each group have reached the 2 years follow -up. If there are significantly more serious complicati ons in either group compared to other at 30 days or 2 years control, the trial will be discontinued. 9.2. Potential Benefits There may be some benefit due to trial -related closer follow -up of patients. Patients with a prophylacti c mesh might have a lower incisional hernia rate."

In the mesh group, the posterior layer of rectus sh eath is opened as close to midline as possible without interrupting the midline. The space behind the rectus muscle is created mainly using blunt dissecti on. At each ends of the incision, opening of the retrorectus space is reached both cranial and caudal over the ends of the wound, if applicable. T he posterior layer is closed using 0 or 2-0 slowly absorbable monofila ment 4:1 small stitch techinique. The stitch bites are 5 mm with 5mm interstitch space. The length of the wound is measured, as well as the length of suturing material used. The ai m is to close using suture material at least four ti mes the length of the wound (4:1) by small stitch technique. After securing there will be no contact with the mesh and abdominal cavity, 8 cm wide self -gripping mesh (ProgripTM, Medtronic) is applied o n the posterior layer of the rectus sheath, reaching over the opening at each end. The anterior layer of rectus sheath is closed using slowly absorbable monofila ment USP 2 -0 or 0 suture by 4:1 small stitch technique. The length of the mesh and suture m aterial used are m easured.

The linear mixed model (LMM) or generalized linea r mixed model (GLMM) will be used for repeatedly measured data, the previous for continuous data and latter for categorical data. Multiple imputations of missing outcome data will be used for sensitivi ty analyses. Prospectively planned subgroup analyses are as follows: BMI>30, previous her nia and conta mination class 4. However, sample size calculation is done only for the primary end point and subgroup analyses ar e hypothesis generating only. The statisti cal program s SPSS (IBM Corp. Released 2016. IBM SPSS Statisti cs for Windows, Versi on 24. 0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp) and SAS (version 9. 4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, U SA) will be used for the anal yses. 20. Publicati on Policy The trial will be registered with an authorized regis try, according to the Internati onal Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJ E) Guidelines, prior to the start of recruit ment. The success of the trial depends upon the collaboration of all participants. For this reason, credit for the main results will be given to all those who have c ollaborated in the trial, through authorship and contributor -ship. Authorship decisions will be guided by standard requirements for authorship relating to submission of manuscripts to medical journals. These state that authorship credit should be based only on the following conditions being met ( http://www.i cmje.org ): • Substantial contribution to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or"
57,page_57,"analysis and interpretation of data • Substantial contribution to drafting the arti cle or revising it critically for important intellectual content • Substantial contribution to final approval of the version to be published.

In addition, all collaborators (surgeons as well as biostatisti cian) will be listed as contributors for the main trial publicati on, giving details of roles in planning, conducting and reporting the trial. It is planned that the recruiting surgeons will also be named as authors, if the set target of the number of randomiz ed patients is achieved. To maintain the scientific integrity of the trial, data will not be released prior to the first publication of the analysis of the primary endpoint, either for trial publicati on or oral presentati on purposes, without the permi ssion of the whole study group. In addition, individual collaborators must n ot publish data concerning their patients, which is directly relevant to the questi ons posed in the trial until the first publicati on of the analysis of the primary endpoint. 20.1.
