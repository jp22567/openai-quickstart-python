It is a parallel arms design pilot trial randomizing 40 subjects. 1.1 Study Objectives The primary objective of this pilot study is to collect preliminary data on the safety and ecacy of TXA in severely injured children. We will also assess the overall feasibility to potentially conduct a large, multi-center, clinical trial evaluating the bene t of TXA in children with signi cant hemorrhagic injuries. We will randomize subjects to one of three arms: 1) TXA dose A (low), 2) TXA dose B (high), or 3) placebo. (Figure 1 on the following page). Speci cally, the study objectives of this pilot and feasibility study are to: Provide preliminary data on the safety and ecacy of TXA in severely injured children with torso and/or head injuries; Evaluate the ability to eciently screen, identify, consent, randomize, and initiate study intervention within 3 hours of injury; Demonstrate the ability to measure and complete 48-hour (blood product transfusion requirements) and early and long-term (global neurocognitive functioning) outcomes; Evaluate the proportion of subjects with the outcomes of interest with the current inclusion/exclusion criteria; Assess protocol adherence and variability of care in randomized subjects; and Identify operational eciencies and ineciencies with the potential to enhance the success of the subsequent clinical trial 1.2 Outcome Measures This pilot study is not powered for a con rmatory test of ecacy or safety of TXA. To provide preliminary data on safety and ecacy and to evaluate our ability to reliably determine clinical outcomes, we will collect the following data in this pilot trial: 1.The total amount of blood products transfused (packed red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate in mL/kg) in the initial 48 hours following randomiza- tion, TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

Age will be determined from the patient, relative, friend or the EMS personnel. In cases where age is not known, an estimation of age by the treating clinician will be used to determine eligibility. Determination of time of injury Time of injury may be provided by the subject, relative, friend, witness, EMS personnel, or any other treating provider. An estimation of the time of injury is acceptable. If con icting reports on the time of injury exist, the time that may be viewed as the most reliable will be used. If the time of injury is unknown, the subject is not eligible for enrollment. Patients are excluded if the rst dose of the study drug will be unable to be administered within 3 hours of the traumatic event. Age-adjusted hypotension This will be determined by accepted guidelines for vital signs in children. Penetrating trauma This will include stab wounds, gunshot wounds, or other objects that have penetrated the dermis.

Intraperitoneal uid on abdominal ultrasound This is de ned as any uid identi ed in the right upper quadrant (Morisons pouch), left upper quadrant or pelvis on the FAST examination. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS score) Patients with GCS scores less than or equal to 13 and evidence of intracranial hemor- rhage on cranial CT scan will be eligible for enrollment. The GCS scoring scale has a high sensitivity and excellent inter-rater reliability among physicians of multiple disci- plines and nursing sta .1, 2In subjects who are preverbal (younger than 2 years), we will use the pediatric GCS score.3In subjects who are intubated and a verbal score cannot be assessed, we will use a predicted verbal score that has been previously validated.4 Intracranial hemorrhage on initial cranial CT This will include any of the following ndings: subdural hematoma, intraventricular hem- orrhage, or intraparenchymal (cerebral) hematoma/hemorrhage/contusion. Intracranial hemorrhage can be due to either blunt or penetrating trauma. 1.3.2 Exclusion Criteria Exclusion criteria include any of the below: 1. Unable to administer study drug within 3 hours of traumatic event 2. Known pregnancy 3. Known prisoners 4. Known wards of the state 5. Cardiac arrest prior to randomization 6. GCS score of 3 with bilateral unresponsive pupils 7. Isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hematoma, or di use axonal injury 8. Known bleeding/clotting disorders 9. Known seizure disorders 10.

Known venous or arterial thrombosis Known pregnancy This will be identi ed by history, physical examination or positive pregnancy test (if done prior to randomization) in females of child-bearing age. TXA is FDA pregnancy category B (Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women). Given the overall safety pro le of TXA in pregnancy, we will not mandate checking pregnancy testing prior to enrollment but will stop study drug if pregnancy is identi ed. Prior studies of TXA use in pregnancy have demonstrated no increase in thromboembolic complications.5{7 Known prisoners This will be identi ed by police or prison guards with patient. Known wards of the state These patients will be excluded per federal regulations (21 CFR 50.56). Cardiac arrest This will be de ned as loss of pulses requiring chest compressions prior to randomization. Patients believed to have inappropriately received chest compression (in the presence of cardiac activity) are still eligible. GCS score of 3 with bilateral non-reactive pupils Our pilot data suggests that these patients have a mortality rate close to 100% and thus are unlikely to bene t from TXA. Isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hematoma, or di use axonal injury Due to the clinical course of patients with these isolated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage subtypes, these patients are unlikely to bene t from administration of TXA. Bleeding/clotting disorders Patients will be excluded if they are known to have a bleeding or clotting disorder including hemophilia, prior episodes of DVT/PE or are on anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin).

Patients who have had a prior seizure but are not currently on long-term anti-seizure medication are eligible. Severe renal impairment Patients with impaired renal function may experience an increased elimination half-life for TXA. Thus patients with known severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 29 mL/min/1.73m2) will be excluded. Similarly, if severe renal impairment is noted on baseline or subsequent laboratory measurements then drug discontinuation rules will be initiated. Patients with hepatic impairment will not be excluded. TXA is excreted unchanged and thus dose adjustment due to hepatic impairment is not recommended. Additionally, any elevations of hepatic enzymes or coagulation pro le are more likely to be secondary to the patients traumatic injury and coagulopathy rather than due to the use of TXA. Repeat enrollment of subjects Although we anticipate subjects are unlikely to present with multiple episodes of severe trauma, a subject is only eligible to be enrolled into the study once. Already received TXA for current injury If the patient already received TXA for the current injury (pre- or in-hospital) they are not eligible for the study. Known venous or arterial thrombosis We will exclude patients with known venous or arterial thrombosis. 2 Rationale and Background 2.1 Traumatic coagulopathy and hyper brinolysis increases mor- bidity and mortality after pediatric trauma Trauma is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children in the United States.8 Deaths in children with trauma are primarily from direct injury to critical organs (brain, heart, lungs) or hemorrhage into the thoracic and/or abdominal cavities. In the initial 24 hours after injury, hemorrhage is the leading cause of death.9The degree of hemor- rhage is in uenced by both the extent of injury to the structures and the occurrence of trauma-induced coagulopathy. Traumatic coagulopathy is common after severe injury, particularly in patients with brain injuries, acidosis, and/or shock and independently TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"
15,page_15,"Page 16 of 74 Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) increases morbidity and mortality.10{13Nearly 30% of injured children admitted to the hospital have abnormalities of routine clotting parameters (INR and PTT) and 6% have markedly abnormal values.14 Hyper brinolysis, or the premature and excessive breakdown of blood clots, is a major component of traumatic coagulopathy.15As measured by thromboelastography (TEG) testing, hyper brinolysis has been shown to be present in 24% of severely injured children and increases the risk for death six-fold compared to children without hyper brinolysis.16 Hyper brinolysis is also associated with the need for life-saving interventions and the need for blood product transfusions in severely injured children.17 2.2 Targeting brinolysis may attenuate post-traumatic hemor- rhage and decrease blood product transfusion requirements Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti brinolytic lysine analogue that blocks the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin is central to brinolysis as it is the enzyme catalyzing the dissolution of brin clots. Thus, the administration of TXA prevents the formation of plasmin thereby preventing brin clot breakdown. Premature and excessive brinolysis is a primary component of traumatic coagulopathy and hemorrhage progression due to elevated levels of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) commonly seen after traumatic injuries, particularly TBI.18 Recent evidence in injured adults indicates that treatment with TXA decreases mortality and blood-transfusion requirements following traumatic hemorrhage.19The Clinical Randomization of an Anti brinolytic in Signi cant Haemorrhage-2 (CRASH-2) trial randomized 20,211 adult trauma patients at risk for signi cant hemorrhage to TXA or placebo. If administered within 3 hours of injury, TXA reduced the risk of death from bleeding by approximately one-third.20Furthermore, TXA had an excellent safety pro le and was found to be cost-e ective for use in these injured adult trauma patients.21Based on the results of the CRASH-2 trial, administration of TXA is considered standard-of-care for severely-injured adults with hemorrhagic trauma and is included on the World Health Organizations list of essential drugs. Because TXA attenuates hemorrhage, it has the potential to improve clinically- important outcomes after TBI. Two phase-II clinical trials in adults with TBIs demon- strated a trend towards decreased intracranial hemorrhage progression with TXA use, and decreased mortality and improved functional outcomes.22{24The promising results of these trials led to the start of two large-scale, phase III trials, evaluating the use of TXA for adults with TBI.25, 26 TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"
16,page_16,"Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) Page 17 of 74 2.3 TXA has not been appropriately studied in children with hemorrhagic injuries Unfortunately, applying results of adult studies to children is inappropriate for several reasons. Children di er from adults with regards to anatomy, physiology, psychological development, mechanisms of injury and outcomes. Data regarding TXA use in children is mostly limited to those undergoing certain elective surgeries, speci cally cardiac surgery,27{29with some small studies in children undergoing spinal and craniofacial surgeries.30These data suggest that perioperative administration of TXA decreases blood transfusion requirements in children.27{30Furthermore, these studies suggest an excellent safety pro le for TXA use in children. The type of traumatic insult and degree of in ammation and its impact on coagulation in these elective surgeries, however, is likely di erent than that following hemorrhage from multisystem trauma. One retrospective study evaluated the impact of TXA administration in children injured in Afghanistan. After controlling for injury severity, TXA substantially reduced mortality (odds ratio = 0.28, 95% CI 0.09, 0.89).31Unfortunately, only 66 (9%) of the 766 children in the database actually received TXA. Of note, there were no di erences in venothromboembolic events between those who did and did not receive TXA. Based on the TXA studies in injured adults, the evidence of safety and e ectiveness in children undergoing non-traumatic surgical procedures and the limited study of TXA in injured children, there is great potential that TXA may safely reduce blood transfusion requirements (and morbidities) in injured children. Not surprisingly, determining if TXA is bene cial and safe in injured children is a top priority for numerous stakeholders.32{34 3 Study Design and Data Collection 3.1 Study Design Overview This pilot study is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of children younger than 18 years old with hemorrhagic injuries to the torso or brain. Children will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) TXA dose A (15 mg/kg bolus dose over 20 minutes, followed by 2 mg/kg/hr infusion over 8 hours), 2) TXA dose B (30 mg/kg bolus dose over 20 minutes, followed by 4 mg/kg/hr infusion over 8 hours), and 3) normal saline placebo. The pilot study will be conducted at 4 sites. This pilot study will be conducted in preparation for a subsequent phase II/III seamless clinical trial of TXA administration for children with hemorrhagic torso or brain injuries. We plan to enroll 40 subjects (approximately 1.25 subjects per month at each of the 4 participating sites). The participating sites evaluate up to 10 subjects with signi cant TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

Potentially eligible subjects will be screened by the clinical research coordinators. Subjects believed to be eligible will be discussed with the treating physicians and the study site investigative team (clinician determined by each site and may include Site PI or Co-Investigators) to con rm eligibility. See section 7.2 and 7.3 for details of the consent process. 3.2.1 Missed Eligible Subjects To assure that trauma patients recruited into this study are representative of the overall trauma population a review of the trauma admission log/trauma database may be conducted routinely during the screening and enrollment period of the trial. If a potential study participant met eligibility criteria but was not approached, the research coordinator will retrospectively complete a form with some basic demographic and clinical information on these patients. This will help assess potential enrollment bias. The Site PI will then discuss these cases with the nursing sta , as well as both the attending trauma and emergency physicians who failed to identify the patient as eligible for the study, as an opportunity to improve future enrollment. 3.3 Baseline Data Collection Baseline data recorded for all children will include age, sex, race and ethnicity, and any other chronic medical conditions. At presentation to the ED we will also record vital signs and physical examination ndings. We will also collect baseline laboratory values that are routinely collected as standard of care. To obtain information on brinolysis, we will also perform viscoelastic coagulation testing using thromboelastography (TEG). TEG testing is the only research-related lab testing per study procedures. Demographics and injury characteristics will be collected (e.g., mechanism of injury, subject demographics, clinical information, and outcome).

The results of the biomarker testing will be used for research purposes only and not be available to clinicians. The amount of blood drawn at each blood draw will be no more than 5-10 mls, or approximately one to two teaspoons of blood per blood draw. This is well below the maximum allowable volume (ml) of blood drawn for research purposes in children (5% of total blood volume). Thromboelastography (TEG) testing Fibrinolysis is evaluated based on the percentage of clot lysis at 30 minutes post-maximum clot strength (LY-30) (Figure 2). The TEG testing will also provide information on coagulation factor function (clot time [r-value] and rate [k-time and alpha-angle]), and platelet function (maximum clot strength [maximum amplitude]). The TEG testing will be completed as soon as possible after enrollment into the study by the trained site-speci c sta . All sites have veri ed TEG testing availability and processing time. Although no studies have demonstrated an association between TEG directed man- agement in injured patients and improved patient outcomes, TEG testing is emerging as an ecient method for the rapid diagnosis of post-traumatic coagulopathy. It is widely used in the operating room to direct transfusion protocols and many authors feel that it may have a similar role in the trauma setting.35{37Hyper brinolysis de ned as a LY30 of 3% is an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio 6.2, 95% CI 2.47 to 16.27) in severely injured pediatric trauma patients.16This increase in mortality with LY30 threshold of 3% is consistent with similar studies of adult trauma patients.38, 39This same pediatric trauma study also found hyper brinolysis occurred more frequently in TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

Potential issues such as timing of blood collection and blood processing have not been evaluated in a multicenter pediatric trauma trial. We will not analyze the association with TEG results and outcomes in the pilot study due to the small number of subjects enrolled, however we anticipate this analysis for the subsequent phase II/III trial. Figure 3: TEG parameters Other biomarkers In addition to TEG, we will also measure other biomarkers that directly or indirectly measure brinolysis. Examples of these plasma biomarkers include: plasmin and d-dimer levels. 3.4 Data Collection During Hospitalization Data collection during the ED stay and hospitalization is summarized in the Schedule of Evaluations (Figure 4 on page 23).

In addition to these two blood samples, we will collect blood samples from routine blood draws during the rst 24 hours after the start of study drug administration to measure serum TXA concentrations. In addition to these two blood samples, we will also collect blood samples during routine blood draws during the rst 24 hours after ED arrival. The results from the TXA level measurements will be used for research purposes only and not be available to clinicians. 3.4.2 GCS score assessment and pupillary examination GCS score assessment and pupillary exam will be collected at baseline.

Heterogeneity of care such as di ering transfusion practices or use of intracranial pressure monitoring devices may confound any potential ecacy or harm of TXA. However e orts to standardize general management principles must be balanced with the overall lack of de nitive evidence on pediatric transfusion practices and TBI management. Each site will have an emergency physician, a trauma surgeon, a pediatric neurosurgeon, and a blood transfusion medicine physician included as co-investigators to assist in overseeing general management principles for this trial. 4 Study Procedures 4.1 Randomization (Enrollment) Due to the narrow time window of study intervention, randomization must not delay treat- ment. To complete the randomization quickly, the study intervention will be preassigned using a central randomization process.

Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of the three arms in a 1:1:1 ratio (TXA dose A, TXA dose B, or placebo). We will perform block randomization across types of injuries (i.e., torso or, brain or both torso and brain). To ensure sucient number of injury types, we will limit the enrollment of subjects meeting the inclusion criteria for isolated brain injury (i.e., GCS less than or equal to 13 with associated intracranial hemorrhage) to a total of 20 subjects (as it is anticipated these will be the most common eligible subjects evaluated at the participating sites). Randomization will occur when drug infusion starts. 4.2 Study Drug Administration 4.2.1 Rationale for Study Doses Enrolled subjects will be randomized to one of three study arms: TXA dose A, TXA dose B, or placebo. A systematic review demonstrated substantial variability in TXA dosing for pediatric surgical subjects, ranging from initial loading doses from 2 to 100 mg/kg IV, and a continuous infusion ranging from 3 to 10 mg/kg/hr.30Doses selected for this study and rationale are as follows: TXA dose A arm: Subjects will receive a 15 mg/kg bolus of TXA over 20 minutes followed by a 2mg/kg/hr infusion over 8 hours. The maximum bolus dose is 1000 mg, the maximum rate of infusion is 50 mg/min, and the maximum total maintenance dose is 1000 mg. This represents 31mg/kg total dose of TXA. This dosage is based on the dose studied in the CRASH-2 trial and has been recommended by a prior evidence statement (see Royal College of Paediatrics).?This dose is estimated to inhibit approximately 80% of brinolysis based on prior studies (Figure 5 on the facing page).47 TXA dose B arm: Subjects will receive a 30 mg/kg bolus of TXA over 20 minutes followed by a 4 mg/kg/hr infusion over 8 hours. The maximum bolus dose is 2000 mg, the maximum rate of infusion is 100 mg/min, and the maximum total maintenance dose is 2000 mg. This represents 62 mg/kg total dose of TXA. This dosage represents approximately the 75th percentile dosage for children receiving TXA for non-traumatic surgical procedures in the PHIS database48and is estimated to inhibit 100% of brinolysis.47This dose is within the range recommended by the WHO49and has not demonstrated an increase in adverse events.30 Placebo arm: Subjects in the placebo group will receive a bolus dose of normal saline over 20 minutes followed by a normal saline infusion over 8 hours (in the same weight-based volume as the other study arms).

A TXA plasma concentration of 20 mcg/ml inhibits approximately 80% of brinolysis and a concentration of 100 mcg/ml inhibits 100% of brinolysis.52 The UC Davis Good Manufacturing Practice Laboratory (Sacramento, CA) will prepare, package and store the investigational drug products (2 TXA arms) and the placebo arm at 2-8C. Both TXA infusions and the placebo infusion will be identical in color, volume, and packaging. The study drugs will be packaged in 100 ml glass infusion vials and will be clear and colorless. The concentration of TXA dose A will be 20 mg/ml of TXA in normal saline, TXA dose B will be 40 mg/ml of TXA in normal saline, and placebo will be 100 ml of normal saline. Each drug vial will have: 1) a numeric identi cation code that corresponds to the treatment assignment, 2) a label reminding clinical sta and study team members that weight-based dosing will be used, 3) a colored sticker identifying study vial by strati cation, and 4) a hanger loop that can be peeled o to create a hanger. 4.2.2 Manufacturing and Distribution of the Study Drug Example of study labelThe study kits will be shipped to the clinical sites from the UC Davis GMP facility at 2-8C.

The study team will obtain a backup study vial from the IDS Pharmacy, corresponding to the recently used study vial (e.g., torso study vial will replace torso study vial). The backup study vial will then be placed in the corresponding Use Next Box that will be stored in a secure automated medication dispensing system in the ED. There will be Use Next Boxes for each study arm in the ED. Each Use Next Box will contain a corresponding study vial and a weight-based dosing chart described below. All individuals providing clinical care at the study sites (physicians, nurses, laboratory technicians, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, etc.) and the study team (research coordinators, research assistants, and site investigators) will be blinded to allocation and dosing, as will the subjects. 4.2.3 Study Drug Administration The study box will be stored in a secure automated medication dispensing system in the ED at temperatures 2-8C. When a subject is ready to be enrolled into the study (Figure 8 on page 33), a member of the clinical sta will remove the \Use Next Box"" from the secure automated medication dispensing machine in the ED and follow the weight-based dosing chart provided in the box. An infusion pump will be programmed with the determined rate and volume of the bolus and maintenance dose. All doses of study drug will be administered intravenously. An initial bolus dose will be given to the subject over 20 minutes, immediately followed by the maintenance infusion over 8 hours. Rates are provided on the dosing chart. Each 100 ml vial of study drug will have sucient volume of study drug for both the bolus and infusion doses. After enrollment, the study team will load the study site's back-up vial into the \Use Next Box"". There will be three \Use Next Boxes"" one for torso injuries, one for brain injuries and one for both torso and brain injuries, each with a corresponding study vial. For children weighing less than 35 kg, a syringe pump with a volume of 60 ml will typically be used. If a syringe pump is used, the total volume for both the bolus and maintenance infusion will be withdrawn (plus an additional 2 ml to account for priming of the syringe pump tubing) from the 100 ml study vial and loaded into the syringe pump. The infusion line will be primed with study drug (typically 2 ml) prior to infusion. At the end of the maintenance infusion, the syringe pump tubing will be disconnected and discarded. The infusion line will not be ushed. For children weighing 35 kg or more, it is recommended that the 100 ml study vial will be directly spiked with a standard vented IV administration set. The vial will be inverted and hung from the attached plastic loop. The infusion line will be primed with study drug (typically 10-14 ml).

A sucient amount of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride may be used to ensure that all remaining study drug is infused from the line and administered to the subject. The study arms will be blinded. Therefore, the same weight-based volume will be infused for each arm. The volume for the infusion will be determined by the estimated or calculated weight of the child. The weight-based dosing for all arms are described in Figure 6 on the facing page. The weight-based dosing in Figure 6 on the next page corresponds to the total doses of TXA dose A and TXA dose B displayed in Figure 7 on page 32. For children with moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular ltration rates 30-59 mL/min/1.732 [as calculated by the bedside Schwartz method]) we will reduce the dose by 50%. This will be accomplished by reducing the rate of study drug administration by 50%. For example, if the child weighs more than 60 kg, the maintenance infusion rate should be 6.25 ml/hr over 8 hours. If moderate renal impairment is identi ed, the rate will be reduced to 3.125 ml/hr over 8 hours. This rate adjustment will occur as soon as moderate renal impairment is identi ed. If severe renal impairment is identi ed, the study drug will be discontinued. 4.2.4 Discontinuation of Study Drug The study drug will be discontinued if any of the following occur: Suspected anaphylactic reaction Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 29 mL/min/1.73m2) is identi ed on baseline or subsequent laboratory measurements Withdrawal of consent by the subject's legal guardian or legally authorized repre- sentative Discovery of new information which makes the subject ineligible to continue partici- pation in the study (e.g.,exclusion criteria such as pregnancy, prisoner, history of seizures or clotting disorders) 4.3 Blinding and Unblinding Both subjects and study team members are blinded to the interventional arm. Blinding is provided by the use of identical study drugs, packaging, volume, and rate of infusion. Unblinding is not allowed. Clinicians should assume that the subject has received TXA and treat accordingly.

Blood products used in the calculation will include packed red blood cells (PRBC), platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and cryoprecipitate. Rationale: Management of children with signi cant traumatic hemorrhage involves both the cessation of active bleeding and administration of blood products to correct for hemorrhage-induced anemia and coagulopathy. Most of the initial and ongoing hemorrhage occurs in the rst 48 hours after injury.53While patients with substantial blood loss and/or trauma-induced coagulopathy can bene t from blood product transfusion, it is not without substantial risk. Transfusion of PRBCs after trauma is independently associated with increased risk of death and adverse events.54, 55Transfusion of blood products is associated with the transmission of infectious diseases, immune sensitization, post-operative infectious complications, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), renal dysfunction, multiple organ failure, increased intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and increased short- and long-term mortality.56, 57Surgical data suggests that with each unit of PRBC transfused, the risk for an adverse outcome is incrementally increased. It is estimated that 0.5 to 3% of all transfusions result in some adverse event.57 Transfusion of blood products is also costly. Based on a study published in 2006, the cost of transfusing a single unit of PRBCs is between 1,600 US dollars and 2,400.58US dollars. Blood transfusion costs are also steadily increasing and will continue to increase over time as additional blood product safety and screening measures are implemented.59 Additionally, blood transfusion related adverse events account for increased costs, largely the result of increased hospital length of stay.59 Prior to the start of the study, the collaborating trauma surgeons and collaborating transfusion medicine physicians (1 from each site), as well as other collaborators including EM and ICU physicians, will establish general guidelines for indications for blood product transfusion. 5.1.2 Intracranial Hemorrhage Progression at 24 hours (plus or minus 6 hours) We will measure intracranial hemorrhage progression at 24 hours in all subjects with intracranial hemorrhage on the initial clinical CT scan (excluding those who received a neurosurgical intervention). We will perform a second non-contrast head CT scan 24 (plus or minus 6) hours after randomization, for research, to assess intracranial hemorrhage progression (for those who have not received a second head CT scan in the speci ed time frame in the course of clinical care). Additional brain-imaging studies may be performed at the discretion of the treating physician as a part of routine care.

Rationale: The PedsQL measures health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents as well as those with acute and chronic health conditions.66The PedsQL generic core scales are comprised of 23 questions that measure the core dimensions of health as delineated by the World Health Organization. The four multidimensional scales include: physical functioning (8 items), emotional functioning (5 items), social functioning (5 items), and school functioning (5 items). These four scales produce three summary scores: total scale score (23 items), physical health score (8 items), and psychosocial health score (15 items). The PedsQL is practical (less than 4 minutes to complete), developmentally appropriate, reliable (excellent correlation between child self-report and parent proxy-report), valid (distinguishes between healthy children and children with acute and chronic health conditions), and has been translated into multiple languages. There are more than 850 publications reporting research that has used the PedsQL measure. For TBI, PedsQL is reliable in di erentiating between moderate and severe TBI.67The PedsQL has been recommended by the Common Data Elements (CDE) TBI Outcomes Workgroup (in conjunction with NINDS) as a core quality-of-life measure post-TBI and a primary measure of global outcome.68The PedsQL is a continuous score that ranges from 0-100. A clinically meaningful di erence has previously been shown to be 4.5 points on the PedsQL scale (minimum di erence that subjects and their parents perceive to be important).69The PedsQL will be administered to subjects over the telephone. 5.1.4 Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOS-E) Peds We will assess GOS-E Peds at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months for all enrolled children.

The GOS-E Peds has been demonstrated discriminant validity for mild, moderate, and severe TBI and is associated with changes in TBI sequelae over time.66The GOS-E has been recommended as a core measure global outcome in TBI studies.68For this proposal, the PedsQL and GOS-E Peds assessments will be administered to all enrolled subjects over the telephone. 5.1.5 Digit Span Recall Test (working memory) We will assess working memory using the digit span recall test at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months for all enrolled children 3 years and older. Rationale: The digit span recall test evaluates working memory.70{72Participants are asked to repeat a series of numbers heard aloud, in the same order as spoken (forward digit span), and then are asked to do the same backwards. The forward task measures the ability to maintain information in line, whereas the backward task measures the ability to mentally manipulate information.73The examiner increases the numbers of digits by one unit on each successive trial as long as the child repeats them correctly. The test ends when the child makes a mistake in two sequences in the same span in a row. 5.1.6 Biomarkers For each candidate biomarker, we will compute the within-person time 1 to time 2 change score and then estimate between-group (high-dose vs. low-dose TXA) di erences in mean changes, along with 95% con dence intervals. 5.1.7 Safety Outcomes Safety outcomes will be assessed at Day 7 or at hospital discharge (whichever comes rst) via review of the electronic medical record and include: Thromboembolic disease: any venous or arterial thrombosis on standard diagnostic imaging post-randomization (including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, sinus thrombosis, myocardial infraction, ischemic stroke) Seizures occurring within the initial 24 hours of drug: clinical or electroencephalogram- documented (seizures are a possible side e ect of TXA) TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

Subjects will undergo block randomization to ensure equal distribution of types of injuries across the three arms Figure 10. To ensure sucient number of injury types, we will limit the enrollment of subjects meeting the inclusion criteria of GCS score less than or equal to 13 with intracranial hemorrhage (Isolated TBI) to a total of 20 subjects (as these are the most common subjects evaluated at the participating sites).

Data will be entered via the Web into the EDC. Worksheets and study documents will be maintained in locked ling cabinets in locked oces at each site. 6.2 Electronic Data Capture System The Data Coordinating Center currently uses OpenClinica, REDCap, and XNAT as its data capture systems; this may be changed at any time without requiring a protocol amendment. 6.3 Study Monitoring The investigators recognize the importance of ensuring data of excellent quality. Site monitoring is critical to this process. Site monitoring has been a very e ective tool for maintaining data quality in previous PECARN studies, and we will utilize this process to ensure excellent quality data in the proposed study. Our site monitoring plan is designed to identify problems with sites and methods for handling problems that arise. Site monitors must be provided with full access to study materials and the medical records for study subjects. If the medical records are in electronic form, the clinical investigator or an authorized individual must provide any assistance necessary to facilitate the site monitor's review of data in the electronic medical record. 6.3.1 Site Monitoring Plan A supplemental study-speci c monitoring plan, separate from the protocol will be com- pleted which outlines speci c criteria for monitoring. This plan will include the number of planned site visits, criteria for focused visits, or additional visits, a plan for chart review and a follow up plan for non-compliant sites. The monitoring plan also describes the type of monitoring that will take place (e.g. sample of all subjects within a site; key data or all data), the schedule of visits, how they are reported and a time frame to resolve any issues found. Remote site monitoring schedules will be determined by the Data Coordinating Center in coordination with the study principal investigators.

39,page_39,"Page 40 of 74 Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) 6.3.2 Clinical Site Monitoring Site monitoring visits will be performed by a trained site monitor during the study period to ensure regulatory compliance, patient safety, and to monitor the quality of data collected. Essential document binders, regulatory documents and data collection forms may be reviewed. Interim visits will take place depending on grant budget, site enrollment, and compliance issues identi ed. The site monitor will provide each site with a written report, and sites will be required to follow up on any de ciencies. It is anticipated that the study monitoring visits for this protocol will consist of a site initiation visit (prior to patient enrollment), interim visits, and a close out visit. The site initiation may take place as group training made up of site investigators and research assistants. 6.3.3 Remote Monitoring The Data Coordinating Center may supplement on-site monitoring with remote monitoring activities. Remote monitoring involves detailed review of the data entered by the Clinical Center and consultations with the Clinical Center investigator and/or research coordinator to review safety and data quality. This may require uploading de-identi ed copies of speci c parts of the medical record, subject study le, regulatory documentation, or other source documents to the Data Coordinating Center sta , who review those materials against the data recorded in the electronic data capture system. This helps assure protocol compliance and accurate data collection. The Data Coordinating Center may conduct more remote monitoring activities early in the trial to assure protocol compliance and identify any training issues that may exist. Remote monitoring the documents will be retained in accordance with federal requirements. Safety of subjects will be monitored and ensured in accordance with the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) plan. 6.3.4 Pharmacy Monitoring The Clinical Center pharmacy must maintain adequate records of all dispensed study drug. Each pharmacy will be monitored and may be requested to send copies of these documents to the Data Coordinating Center. Since this study will use a central pharmacy, that pharmacy must also maintain adequate records and will also be monitored. 6.4 Data Coordinating Center 6.4.1 Data Center Description The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Utah School of Medicine provides data coordination and management services for a TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

Anchoring these services is a new state-of-the- art, energy ecient data center completed in 2013. The data center facility supports more than 1400 users around the world and provides a secure, reliable, enterprise-wide infrastructure for delivering critical DCC systems and services. The new data center was built using high industry standards and energy ecient cooling solutions. The data center is cooled by Rittal's LCP inline cooling technology, providing eciency, redundancy and modularity. Cooling is based upon a hot/cold aisle design that allows for even air distribution with minimal hot spots. The data center electrical power system contains a redundant Mitsubishi uninterruptible power system (UPS) with a diesel backup generator. The data center is protected with a FM200 re suppression system, early warning smoke detectors and a heat detection warning system to act as a secondary system to the smoke detectors. Security guards are on-site conducting access control and rounds 24/7/365. Entry into the data center is restricted by card access and layered security measures and controls. The data center and external building access points are monitored with video surveillance. In 2011 the data center began a large scale VMware server virtualization deployment. Currently, the data center has virtualized about 99% of its environment. The virtual environment consists of more than 200 virtual servers. The data center's virtualization solution provides key advantages: high availability { in the event of hardware failure, virtual servers automatically go back online in a seamless process.  exible infrastructure { disk storage, memory and processor capacity can be increased or reallocated at any time. rapid deployment { servers can be provisioned on-demand with minimal waiting on hardware of software. The data center also enhanced its storage resources by implementing a networked storage system to support its virtualized environment. The data center currently manages over 50 terabytes of data. The storage solution consists of Dell's EqualLogic PS Series Storage system for providing a virtualized storage area network (SAN). Some of the bene ts that are realized through this technology are: storage architecture is no longer be a bottleneck for IT services; performance is better than with the previous architecture; tiered storage is now possible; provisioning and reclamation of SAN disk will be much easier; and most important, TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"
41,page_41,"Page 42 of 74 Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) the new architecture includes a redesign of the SAN fabric to include complete redundancy. Production servers running critical applications are clustered and con gured for failover events. Servers are backed up with encryption through a dedicated backup server that connects across an internal 10 gigabit network to a tape drive. DCC storage area net- working (SAN) applications, clusters, and switch-to-switch links are also on a 10 gigabit network. Incremental backups occur hourly Monday through Friday from 6 am to 6 pm. Incremental backups also are performed each night with full system backups occurring every Friday. Tapes are stored in a reproof safe inside the data center facility, and full backups are taken o site on a weekly basis to an o -site commercial storage facility. In the event of catastrophic failure, such as a re in the server facility, daily backups would probably survive because of the re suppression system and reproof safe, but there would be obvious delay in re-establishing data center function because the servers will not survive such a disaster. Total destruction of the data center facility could cause the loss of up to one week's data. In future investments, the data center is making co-location, disaster recovery and business continuity solutions a top priority. DCC information systems are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to all users unless a scheduled maintenance interruption is required. If this occurs, we notify all users of the relevant systems, and data entry can be deferred until after the interruption is over. Critical systems availability has exceeded 99.9% for the past two years, and there has been no unscheduled downtime in over ve years. 6.4.2 Security and Con dentiality The data center coordinates the network infrastructure and security with the Health Sciences Campus (HSC) information systems at the University of Utah. This provides us with e ective rewall hardware, automatic network intrusion detection, and the expertise of dedicated security experts working at the University. Network equipment includes four high-speed switches. User authentication is centralized with two Windows 2012 domain servers. Communication over public networks is encrypted with virtual point-to-point sessions using transport layer security (TLS) or virtual private network (VPN) technolo- gies, both of which provide at least 128 bit encryption. All of our Web-based systems use the TLS protocol to transmit data securely over the Internet. Direct access to data cen- ter machines is only available while physically located inside our oces, or via a VPN client.

42,page_42,"Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) Page 43 of 74 All network trac is monitored for intrusion attempts, security scans are regularly run against our servers, and our IT sta is noti ed of intrusion alerts. Security is maintained with Windows 2012 user/group domain-level security. Users are required to change their passwords every 90 days, and workstations time out after 5 minutes of inactivity. All les are protected at group and user levels; database security is handled in a similar manner with group-level access to databases, tables, and views in Microsoft SQL Server. Finally, all laptop computers in use in the DCC or in the Department of Pediatrics are whole-disk encrypted. The data center uses control center tools to continuously monitor systems and failure alerts. Environmental and network systems are also monitored to ensure up time. Highly trained system administrators on sta are available to respond in high risk emergency events. All personnel involved with the DCC have signed con dentiality agreements concerning data encountered in the course of their daily work. All personnel (including administrative sta ) have received Human Subjects Protection and Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) education. We require all users to sign speci c agreements concerning security, con dentiality, and use of our information systems, before access is provided. 6.5 Record Access The medical record and study les (including informed consent, permission, and assent documents) must be made available to authorized representatives of the Data Coordinating Center, upon request, for source veri cation of study documentation. In addition, medical information and data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by representatives (when applicable) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), NIH, other Federal funders, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each study site. 7 Protection of Human Subjects 7.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval The Data Coordinating Center and each clinical center must obtain approval from their respective IRB prior to participating in the study. A central IRB (cIRB) at the University of Utah will be used for this clinical trial.

43,page_43,"Page 44 of 74 Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) The Data Coordinating Center will track IRB approval status at all participating centers and will not permit subject enrollment without documentation of initial IRB approval and maintenance of that approval throughout subsequent years of the project. 7.1.1 Reporting of IRB Actions Protocol Amendments Changes in the protocol which have been approved by the Central IRB will be submitted upon IRB approval to the FDA, as required under 21 CFR 312.30(b), and NHLBI prior to implementation. Upon notice that the protocol amendment has been received at the FDA and NHLBI, the protocol amendment will be distributed to sites. Sites will be instructed that they must follow local policies in implementing the protocol amendment including obtaining local IRB approval, if required. 7.2 Informed Consent We will enroll eligible patients who are younger than 18 years of age. Because eligible patients are severely injured and will frequently arrive to the emergency department (ED) without their parents or guardians, we will have a multifaceted approach to consent (Figure 11 on the next page). We will attempt to obtain written informed consent at the time of patient eligibility if the parent or guardian is available and able to provide informed consent. However, because the therapeutic window of TXA is narrow, and the parent or guardian will frequently be unavailable or unable to provide consent (e.g., severely injured or emotionally incapacitated) at the time that the patient is determined to be eligible, we will also use federal Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) procedures as described below. Parental Permission (when present and reasonable time to obtain informed consent) After determining that a subject is eligible, and the parent or guardian is present in the ED and able to provide informed consent, the site investigator or designee will approach the parent or guardian to o er participation for their child in the study (Figure 12 on page 46). The parent or guardian will be informed about the objectives of the study, the study procedures, and the potential risks and bene ts of participation. If the parent or guardian refuses permission for their child to participate, then all clinical management will be provided by the clinical sta in accordance with institutional practice and judgment. We will seek written documentation of parental permission from the subject's parent or guardian as soon as possible. Under FDA Regulation 21 CFR 50.55(e)(1), where clinical investigations are more than minimal risk but presenting the prospect of direct TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

Under FDA Regulation 21 CFR 50.55(c)(2), because the intervention holds out a prospect of direct bene t that is important to the health or well-being of the child and is available only in the context of the clinical investigation, assent of the child is not a necessary condition for enrollment in the study. Subject Consent Subjects who are eligible for this study must be younger than 18 years of age at the time of enrollment. If a subject reaches the age of 18 years after enrollment but during the study period, then informed consent of the patient becomes applicable. If this occurs, 18 year-old subjects who are alert and competent and capable of giving consent will be asked, following an appropriate discussion of risks and bene ts, to give consent to the TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

We will obtain informed consent from these subjects for continuation in the study. Continued participation will consist of a telephone follow up call, considered to be minimal risk. Subject consent will be waived if the subject has a severely reduced mental age, decreased level of consciousness, psychological problems, or other legitimate reasons as judged by the Institutional Review Board. 7.3 Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) We will use EFIC procedures when the parent or guardian is not present or unable to provide written informed consent. See Section 7.3 for justi cation of EFIC procedures. TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"
46,page_46,"Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) Page 47 of 74 EFIC when the parent/guardian is not present or is unable to provide written informed consent We will enroll patients using EFIC procedures if the parent or guardian is not present or is unable to provide written informed consent (e.g., parent is also severely injured or is emotionally incapacitated) at the time eligibility is determined (Figure 13 on the next page). If the parent or guardian is not present at the time eligibility is con rmed or is unable to provide written informed consent, a family member who is present will be provided the opportunity to object to the enrollment. In this scenario, the family member(s) will be provided a brief overview of the study and an explanation on why we are unable to obtain written informed consent due to the absence of the parent/guardian and the narrow therapeutic time window. If the family member present objects to the patient's enrollment into the study, the patient will not be enrolled under EFIC procedures. If no objections are made to the patient's enrollment into the study, the patient will be enrolled using EFIC procedures. EFIC when the parent/guardian is present but there is not sucient time to obtain informed consent We will enroll patients using EFIC procedures if the parent or guardian is present and there is not sucient time, at the time eligibility is con rmed, to obtain written informed consent and complete randomization. The parent and the guardian, however, will be provided the opportunity to decline enrollment (Figure 14 on page 49). In this scenario, the parent or guardian will be provided a brief overview of the study and an explanation on why we are unable to obtain written informed consent due to the narrow therapeutic time window. If the parent or legal guardian objects to the patient's enrollment into the study, the patient will not be enrolled under EFIC procedures. If the parent or guardian agrees to the patient's enrollment into the study, the patient will be enrolled using EFIC procedures. Obtaining informed consent after the use of EFIC The use of EFIC does not obviate the need for parent or guardian consent. If EFIC procedures are used, once the patient has been randomized and administration of study drug has been initiated, the investigative team will attempt to obtain written informed consent from the parent or guardian. The parent or guardian will be informed of the patient's inclusion into the study and informed of the bene ts and risks of the study. At that time, the parent or guardian TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

49,page_49,"Page 50 of 74 Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) Thus, TXA has the potential to be the rst therapeutic medication in children with hemorrhagic injuries. Collection of valid scienti c evidence is necessary to determine the safety and ecacy of the intervention; Scienti c evaluation through a randomized clinical trial is necessary to further test the ecacy and safety of the proposed intervention. Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because the subjects are not able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition; Parents are frequently absent because either their children arrive in ambulances without them or the parents are victims of the traumatic events that involve the patients. The intervention must be administered before consent can be obtained from the subjects parent/ guardian; Obtaining informed consent from the patients parent/guardian is not feasible due to the narrow therapeutic window of TXA. The greatest bene t of TXA for adults with hemorrhagic trauma is within one hour from the time of injury, and the total therapeutic window is only up to 3 hours after injury. After 3 hours, there is suggestion of harm from TXA infusion based on a large adult randomized control trial of injured adults (Figure 15 on page 52).20 We have previously shown that 45% of children with head trauma present to the ED without their parent or guardians.74More importantly, more severely injured children are more likely to present without a parent or guardian. Sixty-six percent of children with GCS scores of 3 to 13 presented without a parent or guardian while in children with GCS scores 8, none had a parent or guardian present at the time of ED presentation.74Our second study on the topic demonstrated across multiple centers that among children with GCS scores of 3 to 12 following injury, the parent or guardians for one-half of the patients do not present to the ED within the initial 3 hours of their child's care.75 From a safety perspective, in the CRASH-2 trial evaluating TXA in adults with hemorrhagic trauma, hospitals that waived the requirement for informed consent started treatment 1.2 hours earlier (95% CI 0.7-1.8) compared to hospitals where written consent was required from relatives (Figure 16 on page 53).76Because the bene t of TXA is better the earlier it is administered, it was estimated that this 1.2 hour delay reduced the proportion of patients who would have bene tted from the drug by 14%. Moreover, from a feasibility perspective, if all the sites TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"
50,page_50,"Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) Page 51 of 74 required written informed consent for enrollment, the study would have likely been a negative trial. A separate trial of adults with TBI evaluating the use of progesterone, estimated the requirement for informed consent delayed enrollment by 4 hours based on hypothetical modeling.77 There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively individuals likely to become eligible for participation; There is no reasonable way to prospectively identify potential patients because our patient population consists of trauma patients. Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct bene t to the subjects; Pursuant to 21 CFR 50.24(a)(3): i) the proposed subjects are in life-threatening situations requiring intervention, ii) prior pediatric and adult clinical data have demonstrated clinical bene ts of TXA use suggesting the potential for direct bene t to the proposed subjects, and iii) these data have demonstrated no increase in adverse events with the use of TXA, suggesting a reasonable risk-bene t tradeo for this condition. Thus, the potential bene t of improved hemostasis, decreased blood product requirements, hemorrhage attenuation/mitigation, and improved functional outcomes substantially outweigh the risks, under FDA EFIC guidance. The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver; Enrolling only patients that have their parent or guardians present within the treatment window to consent would not be feasible and also create signi cant enrollment bias, thereby limiting the scienti c validity of such a study design. 7.4 Waiver of Informed Consent Waiver of consent is requested for observational data collection for each subject eligible for this study. The justi cation for waiver of consent for the observational data collection in this study is based on the following factors: 1.The scienti c validity of the study is dependent on capturing all eligible subjects during the period of study, as one of the major goals is to accurately describe the characteristics of the entire eligible population. 2.This part of the study involves no intervention and collection of observational data will not require any subject or parent contact. 3.The minimal risk of loss of privacy is mitigated by secure data management at the DCC, and analysis datasets will be de-identi ed.

51,page_51,"Page 52 of 74 Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) Figure 15: Mortality by time to treatment 7.5 Potential Risks A systematic review of children undergoing non-traumatic surgery suggests no increased risk of complications following TXA treatment.30However, injured children were not included in that systematic review and the authors acknowledge that none of the trials included were powered to assess safety.30The CRASH-2 trial, a large trial of TXA in injured adults, also suggested no increased complications in the TXA group.19Thus, we do not anticipate an increased risk of complications in injured children receiving TXA compared to placebo. The study, however, will monitor for speci c potential risks as described below. The most important theoretical side e ect of TXA is acute thrombosis, either arterial or venous.78, 79Acute thrombotic events are de ned as vascular thrombosis resulting in any of the following: cardiac ischemia, cerebral thrombosis, bowel infarction, deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. Seizures have been reported in cardiac surgery patients receiving very high doses of TXA (61 to 259 mg/kg) with most receiving greater than 100 mg/kg.80{84Although, the seizures were believed to be related to cerebral ischemia associated with the cardiopulmonary bypass rather than TXA,80others have suggested the seizures may be secondary to TXA inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors in neurons.81Furthermore, the reported doses of TXA are substantially higher than planned in this study. In addition, seizures are a complication of severe trauma, especially in patients with traumatic brain injuries and those with episodes of hypoxia. Thus, we will evaluate for these potential complications but do not anticipate that seizure events are secondary to the doses of TXA planned for use in this study. Lastly, cerebral TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

53,page_53,"Page 54 of 74 Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) infarction may occur in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhages.78, 85Thus, we will speci cally assess for cases of cerebral infarction. In addition to the above, subjects presenting with gross hematuria or renal injury who do not meet exclusion criteria may still be at risk for ureteral obstructions. Investigators should consider this possibility when enrolling subjects and should closely monitor urine output and evaluate for ureteral thrombosis/obstruction in subjects with renal/bladder injuries. Other side e ects of TXA that we will monitor include symptoms listed in the package insert such as gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) and allergic dermatitis. These may occur at rate of 1-10%. In addition to TXA administration, there may be added discomfort to the participant with the additional blood collection. However, research samples will be collected at the same time as a standard of care samples whenever possible to minimize extra needle pokes to the participant. This research study may also involve one head CT scan for head injury patients. This scan is not standard of care and study participant would be receiving it only because they are enrolled in this research study. These procedures will expose the participant to radiation. The risk from this radiation exposure is considered to be small and comparable to other every day risks. To give an example of how much radiation the participant will receive, we will compare this radiation to the radiation that the participant receives from natural sources. Everyone receives a small amount of unavoidable radiation every day. Some of this radiation comes from space while some comes from radiation that is naturally occurring in water, soil, rocks and minerals found in plants and animals. The excess radiation that the participant will be exposed to in this research study is equivalent to about 9 months of natural background radiation. This amount does not include any radiation exposures that the participant may receive from other types of tests. Radiation exposure has the potential to lead to cancer later in life. The exact risk is not known, but the risk is believed to be 2-5 times higher in children than in adults exposed to the same radiation dose. The risks to subjects in this proposal are reasonable in relation to the potential bene ts of participation. The study risks will be minimized by very careful monitoring of neurological, hemodynamic, and renal function status of study participants. 7.6 Protections Against Potential Risks Subjects enrolled in the study will be monitored carefully for the development of any potential complications as described above. Subjects will be evaluated frequently by the treating team and at 24 (plus or minus 6) hours by the site investigator. If thrombosis or seizure is suspected, prompt treatment will be administered per the routine of the TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

All subjects discontinued early from the study protocol will have a reason for the early discontinuation recorded on the appropriate case report form, and the circumstances leading to discontinuation will be brie y described. All adverse events (as described) leading to discontinuation of study interventions will be fully documented and followed up as appropriate. Subjects who are discontinued early from the study protocol are not considered to be withdrawn from the study, and will be included in the intention-to-treat analyses. 7.7 Potential Bene ts Future patients with signi cant traumatic injuries will bene t from the study if the results determine that TXA decreases complications from bleeding including the need for blood transfusions and improves the patients quality of life. 7.8 Withdrawal from Study For participants who withdraw from the study, the date and reason for consent withdrawal must be documented. Otherwise, all subjects are followed for 180 days or death, whichever comes rst, regardless of whether or not a subject has completed the study intervention. It is important for safety to follow all subjects. Therefore, research sta will con rm participants/parents wishes if they express the desire to withdrawal. 8 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 8.1 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) The study will have a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) approved by the funding agency. The DSMB will be composed of a minimum of 5 members. The membership will include representation from experts in the elds of pediatric trauma care, biostatistics, bioethics, emergency medicine, and pediatric neurosurgery. The DSMB will have a charter, will approve the protocol prior to implementation, and will review interim analyses as applicable. The purpose of the DSMB is to advise the sponsors and principal investigator(s) regarding the continuing safety of study subjects and the continuing validity and sci- TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"
55,page_55,"Page 56 of 74 Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) enti c merit of the study. The DSMB is responsible for monitoring accrual of study subjects, adherence to the study protocol, assessments of data quality, performance of individual Clinical Centers, review of serious adverse events and other subject safety issues. The DCC will send reports relating to these topics to DSMB members prior to each DSMB meeting. The DCC will sta the DSMB meetings and produce minutes of open sessions. Minutes of closed or executive sessions of the DSMB will be produced and retained by the DSMB Chairperson. These closed minutes will not be available outside the DSMB prior to the end of the study. The DSMB Chairperson will prepare a summary of each DSMB meeting that conveys the public conclusions of the DSMB, with respect to protocol alterations and recommendations concerning continuation of the study. When applicable, this will be sent directly to the study sponsor for approval before it is provided to the DCC and sites. When the summary is provided to the DCC, the DCC will send the summary to all Clinical Center investigators for submission to their respective Institutional Review Boards/Research Ethics Board(s). 8.2 Frequency of Interim Analysis The DSMB will be expected to meet every six months, including an initial meeting prior to the start of subject enrollment and then after enrollment of the 10th subject (anticipated 2-3 months after onset of subject enrollment). The DSMB, however, will have the discretion to alter meeting timing and frequency. 8.3 Con ict of Interest As described in the DSMB charter, DSMB members should be independent of all entities sponsoring, organizing, conducting, or regulating the TIC-TOC study. Speci cally, DSMB members should not have any signi cant nancial interest in the studys conduct or outcome, nor be involved in the design of this study. Additionally, members must disclose any actual or potential con icts of interest involving pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and contract research organizations. This includes any nancial arrangement, consultancy agreement (direct or via third party), research support, or any other relationship that could be construed as introducing potential bias to their role as a DSMB member. The DSMB and NHLBI Program Ocer will be responsible for determining whether any consultancies or nancial interests of a member may be viewed as potentially materially impacting their objectivity. This decision is to be based on the reasonable belief that objectivity is in doubt. Each DSMB member is responsible for informing the NHLBI Program Ocer and DSMB Chairperson if any relevant changes in nancial interest or TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

Each participating site investigator will have primary responsibility for the safety of the individual subjects under his or her care. All adverse events occurring after study randomization through Day 7 or hospital discharge (whichever comes rst) will be recorded and entered into the electronic data entry system provided by the DCC. In accordance with local IRB requirements, the site investigator may be required to report such events to the IRB in addition to notifying the DCC. 8.4.1 De nitions, Relatedness, Severity and Expectedness De nition: An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a subject. An event constitutes a disease, a set of related signs or symptoms, or a single sign or symptom. The site investigators will evaluate for adverse events throughout the study period. Adverse events not previously documented in the study will be recorded on the adverse event record form. The nature of each experience, date and time (where appropriate) of onset, outcome, course, and relationship to treatment should be established. Relatedness: The suspected relationship between study interventions and any adverse event will be determined by the site investigator using the following criteria. Relatedness may not be assessed by a research coordinator, and must be assessed by an investigator. Not Related: The event is clearly related to other factors, such as the subject's clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs administered to the subject. Possibly Related: The event follows compatible temporal sequence from the time of beginning the assigned study intervention, but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject's clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs administered to the subject. Probably Related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of beginning the assigned study intervention, and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the subject's clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs administered to the subject.

Seriousness: The severity of clinical adverse events and laboratory abnormalities will be recorded by the site investigator and categorized. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that: results in death; or is life-threatening (the subject was, in the view of the site investigator, in immediate danger of death from the event as it occurred); or requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization; or results in persistent or signi cant disability or incapacity; or results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; or any other event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject's health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this de nition. Expectedness of the Event: All adverse events, including serious adverse events, will be evaluated as to whether their occurrence was expected or unexpected. An adverse event is considered expected if it is known to be associated with TXA, other underlying medical conditions of the subject, is known to occur with trauma, is directly related to study outcome, or is otherwise mentioned in the protocol, informed consent, or other study documents. An adverse event is unexpected when it is not expected as above or occurs in a di ering severity or frequency than is described above. Expected complications of traumatic injuries include all of the following: seizures, venous thromboses (including pulmonary emboli), acute kidney injuries (including kidney failure), pneumonia, acute lung injury, sepsis, and death. In addition, all items in the drug insert and all events associated with transfusion. Treatment or Action Taken: For each adverse event, the site investigator will record whether an intervention was required: Intervention: Surgery or procedure Other Treatment: Medication initiation, change, or discontinuation None: No action taken TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"
58,page_58,"Protocol 036 (Nishijima, Kuppermann) Page 59 of 74 Outcome of Event: Finally, the site investigator will record the clinical outcome of each adverse event as follows: Death Recovered and the subject returned to baseline status Recovered with permanent sequelae Symptoms continue 8.4.2 Time Period for Adverse Events For purposes of this study, adverse events will be recorded for the period following randomization through hospital discharge or 7 days (whichever comes rst). Events that occur prior to onset of study drug administration will not be considered adverse events. These events will be recorded as baseline conditions. Events that occur following hospital discharge will not be recorded. Adverse events will be followed until resolution or hospital discharge, whichever is earlier. 8.4.3 Data Collection Procedures for Adverse Events After subject randomization, all adverse events (including serious adverse events), whether anticipated or unanticipated, will be recorded according to the date of rst occurrence, severity, and their duration, as well as any treatment prescribed. Any medical condition present at the time of randomization, recorded in the subject's baseline history at study entry, which remains unchanged or improves, will not be recorded as an adverse event at subsequent evaluations. However, worsening of a medical condition that was present at the time of randomization will be considered a new adverse event and reported. Abnormal laboratory values that are clinically signi cant will be recorded as adverse events and the site investigator will assess the severity and relationship to the study. Laboratory values that are abnormal at the time of randomization and that do not worsen will not be recorded as adverse events. Because severe trauma is associated with a large number of laboratory abnormali- ties, for purposes of this study, abnormal laboratory values will be recorded as adverse events when the severity grade is grade 2 or higher on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE). Grade 1 laboratory abnormalities, if expected as described earlier, do not need to be recorded as adverse events. It is not necessary to record abnormal laboratory results for those tests included in the Schedule of Evaluations because all values for these parameters will be collected.

Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding vocabulary. Coding will be done centrally at the Data Coordinating Center because this requires speci c training. 8.4.4 Unanticipated Problems (UP) Unanticipated problems (UP) are de ned as incidents, experiences, or outcomes that are unexpected, related to participation in the study, and suggest that the research places subjects at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized. The site investigator will report unanticipated problems to the Data Coordinating Center within 24 hours. A detailed completed report will be required to be sent to the Data Coordinating Center within 3 working days of the event. After receipt of the complete report, the Data Coordinating Center will report these unanticipated problems to the NHLBI Program Ocial or Project Ocer in an expedited manner (within 24 hours). In accordance with local IRB requirements, the site investigator may be required to report such unanticipated problems to the IRB in addition to notifying the Data Coordinating Center. In the event that the medical monitor believes that such an event warrants emergent suspension of enrollment in the trial, and NHLBI sta cannot be reached expeditiously, the Data Coordinating Center will notify the principal investigators (Drs. Nishijima, Kuppermann) and all site investigators to cease enrollment in the trial. Resumption of enrollment will not occur without consent of the NHLBI sta after discussion with the DSMB. 8.4.5 Monitoring Serious Adverse Events The Principal Investigator of the Data Coordinating Center (Dr. Dean) will act as the medical monitor for this study. If Dr. Dean is unavailable, a quali ed physician will be designated to ful ll this function. Site investigators and/or research coordinators will report serious adverse events to the Data Coordinating Center within 24 hours. A detailed completed report will be required to be sent to the Data Coordinating Center within 3 working days of the event, and the medical monitor will assess all serious adverse events reported from site investigators. For each of these serious adverse events, the site investigator will provide sucient medical history and clinical details for a safety assessment to be made with regard to continuation of the trial. The medical monitor will sign each SAE report after review. TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

In the unlikely event that the medical monitor believes an unexpected and study- related SAE warrants emergent cessation of enrollment in the trial, NHLBI sta and the DSMB chairperson will be immediately consulted. If these individuals concur with the judgment of the medical monitor, or if the NHLBI sta and the DSMB chairperson cannot be reached expeditiously, the Data Coordinating Center will notify the principal investigators (Drs.Nishijima, Kuppermann) and all site investigators to cease enrollment in the trial. Resumption of enrollment will not occur without consent of the NHLBI sta after discussion with the DSMB. In accordance with local IRB requirements, the site investigator may be required to report such events to the IRB in addition to notifying the Data Coordinating Center. After noti cation of the NHLBI Program Ocial or Project Ocer, and the DSMB chairperson, of serious, unexpected, and study-related adverse events or unanticipated problems (UP), decisions will be made whether to continue the study without change, and whether to convene the entire DSMB for an emergent meeting. If a decision is made to suspend enrollment in the trial, this will be reported to the principle investigators (Drs. Nishijima, Kuppermann) and all clinical investigators, who will be instructed to report this to their local IRB. The DSMB will review all adverse events (not necessarily serious, unexpected, and study-related) during scheduled DSMB meetings. The Data Coordinating Center will prepare a Summary Report of Adverse Events for the DSMB meetings, classi ed with the MedDRA coding system. 8.4.6 Follow-up of Serious, Unexpected and Related Adverse Events All serious, unexpected and related adverse events that are unresolved at the time of the subject's termination from the study or discharge from the hospital will be followed by the Clinical Center investigators until the events are resolved, subject is lost to follow-up, the adverse event is otherwise explained, or has stabilized. 9 Study Training 9.1 Study Training A formal training program for investigators and research sta will be held prior to the start of enrollment. The training program will cover regulatory topics and Good Clinical Practice. The training will also provide in depth explanations regarding study TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

A manual of operations will be provided to each investigator prior to the start of enrollment. The manual will detail speci c information about the study procedures, regulatory information, safety reporting, and other necessary information. Updates and revisions to the manual will be made available electronically. The Data Coordinating Center, in collaboration with the principal investigators (Drs. Nishijima, Kuppermann), will be the main contact for study questions. Follow-up assessments including PedsQL and GOS-E Peds, as well as digit span testing, will be performed by quali ed sta at the University of California, Davis. An in-person meeting will be held to review study activities, study work ow, and data entry procedures. Each site investigator should instruct the group of ED physicians at their home institutions about the study, and serve as local advocates and champions for the study and answer questions as they arise. Throughout the study, the study team will also have telephone conference calls, webinars, and in-person meetings to update on study progress and provide on-going training. 9.2 PECARN Network Involvement This proposed pilot study of TXA for children with hemorrhagic torso injuries and traumatic intracranial hemorrhage will be completed within PECARN.86 PECARN is the rst and only federally-funded pediatric emergency medicine research network in the United States, initially funded in 2001 through cooperative agreements between academic medical centers and the Health Resources Services Administration / Maternal and Child Health Bureau / Emergency Medical Services for Children Program (HRSA / MCHB / EMSC). PECARN was created to address barriers to research in emergency medical services for children (EMSC), including the lack of an infrastructure. PECARN conducts high-priority, multi-institutional research on the prevention and management of acute illnesses and injuries in children. Currently PECARN is comprised of 6 research nodes, an EMS research node containing 3 EMS aliates, and a DCC. Each of the 6 research nodes has 3 hospital ED aliates and one EMS aliate. Overall, the PECARN EDs serve approximately 1.1 million acutely ill and injured children annually in the US. The PECARN network is governed by a Steering Committee that formulates and monitors policies and procedures guiding all research activities and reviews and approves research proposals. All major scienti c decisions are made by majority vote. Subcommit- tees, including the Protocol Review and Development Subcommittee (PRADs), the Grant Writing and Publications Subcommittee (GAPS), the Feasibility and Budget Subcom- mittee (FAB), and the Quality, Safety, and Regulatory A airs Subcommittee (QUASI) TIC-TOC Trial Protocol Version 2.03 Protocol Version Date: October 24, 2018 The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network"

The clinical investigator at each participating site will complete a Form FDA 1572, \Statement of Investigator."" 10.2 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Data elements collected include the date of birth and date of admission. Prior to statistical analyses, dates will be used to calculate subject age at the time of the study events. The nal data sets (used for study analyses and archived at the end of the study) will be de{identi ed, and will exclude these speci c dates. Data elements for race, ethnicity, and gender are also being collected. These demo- graphic data are required for Federal reporting purposes to delineate subject accrual by race, ethnicity, and gender. For purposes of the DCC handling potential protected health information (PHI) and producing the de{identi ed research data sets that will be used for analyses, all study sites have been o ered a Business Associate Agreement with the University of Utah. Copies of executed Business Associate Agreements are maintained at the DCC. 10.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities There will be no exclusion of subjects based on gender, race, or ethnicity. 10.4 ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements This trial will be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov in accordance with Federal regulations.
