AD, also known as atopic eczema, is one of the most common chronic skin diseases, affecting 1 - 3% of adults worldwide.1 Data from the National Health Interview Survey, a United States (US) population- based household survey, indicate that the prevalence of childhood AD steadily increased from approximately 8% in 1997 to more than 12% in 2010 and 2011.2 AD is often characterized by pruritus, erythema, edema, xerosis, erosions/excoriations, oozing, crusting, and lichenification. In addition, sleep disturbance commonly occurs with AD, due in large part to the significant itching associated with the disease. 3,4 AD is also associated with multiple other comorbid conditions, including a higher prevalence of other atopic diseases such as rhinitis, food allergies, and asthma, with the severity of AD directly related to the severity of the comorbidities. 5 The pathophysiology of AD is influenced by a complex interplay between inflammation, environmental factors, genetics, and skin barrier dysfunction. AD is driven by multiple immune pathways that create different disease features. 6-11 Two T-cell subsets, Th2 and Th22, are commonly present and activated across major subtypes of AD. Specific subtypes of AD, including Asian-origin, pediatric, and intrinsic AD, have a prominent interleukin (IL)-17 component, as well as tissue patterning that overlaps with distinctive psoriasis histopathology. 12 There is also evidence that the Th17/IL-23 axis is up-regulated in patients with AD and that it might have a role in AD development.13,14 Further, it has been shown that IL-23 is released in human skin after scratching, which polarizes human skin dendritic cells to drive an IL-22 response of epidermal thickening, supporting the utility of IL-23 and IL-22 blockade in AD.15 Hence, AD might best be considered a multi-axis immune disease with involvement of the Th2, Th22, and potentially Th17 pathways. The goal of AD treatment is to reduce skin inflammation, and the treatment options depend on the extent and severity of disease. Topical agents, such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and moisturizers, are commonly used alone for mild to moderate cases. When topical therapies are insufficient for treating the signs and symptoms of AD, systemic therapy or phototherapy are generally added. 16 Oral immunosuppressants17like methotrexate or cyclosporin and glucocorticoids can be effective, but are frequently associated with severe toxicity and side effects, thus limiting their use to short courses and/or intermittent therapy. Several biological agents, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α (e.g., infliximab, etanercept), anti- immunoglobin (Ig)E (omalizumab), anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab), and anti-CD11a (efalizumab), have not shown efficacy in AD clinical studies. In a small Phase 2 study, ustekinumab, an IL-12/IL-23 blocking agent, showed a numerical improvement in clinical AD endpoints when compared to the placebo arm. Nonetheless, the study failed to achieve its primary endpoint as the difference was not statistically significant. The study used the same dosing regimen approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for psoriasis. 18 On the other hand, dupilumab, an antibody directed to block both IL-4 and IL-13 Page 8 of 116"
8,page_8,"STUDY M16-813 | Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.signal transduction and therefore inhibiting the Th2 inflammatory pathway, was approved by the US FDA in March 2017 and the European Commission in September 2017. In two Phase 3 studies, dupilumab significantly improved the signs and symptoms of AD compared with placebo,19with injection site reactions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and oral herpes reported as the most common adverse reactions in the studies.20 Although dupilumab addresses the needs of some patients with moderate to severe AD, a large unmet need for short- and long-term efficacious treatments still exists in this population. Despite the availability of various topical AD therapies, many patients still do not respond adequately to these treatments, and there are limited systemic treatment options available. Since the IL-23/Th17 axis is overexpressed in AD, this target may have therapeutic potential. Among AD patients, IL-23/Th17 expression has been shown to be higher in various AD subpopulations (i.e., Asian population, pediatric population, intrinsic/non-allergic subtype [normal levels of IgE]). 8 Risankizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG1 subclass directed towards IL-23 p19. The antibody has been engineered to reduce Fc γ receptor and complement binding and potential charge heterogeneity. Risankizumab binds with high affinity to human IL-23. Risankizumab is currently being developed for the treatment of psoriasis (Phase 3 studies concluded) and Crohn's disease (currently in Phase 3 studies), as well as the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and psoriatic arthritis (in Phase 2 studies), and may address the current needs for subjects with AD. The current study compares the safety and efficacy of risankizumab versus placebo for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in adult and adolescent subjects. For a more detailed description of the risankizumab drug profile, refer to the latest version of the Investigator's Brochure (IB). 21 Clinical Hypothesis Risankizumab will provide superior efficacy compared to placebo and will be well tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe AD. 2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects This proof-of-concept (POC) study is required to learn more about the potential treatment effect of risankizumab in AD. While IL-23/Th17 has been identified as a potential target in AD, the pathway is predominantly overexpressed in subsets of AD patients and has not been definitively confirmed as a viable target in clinical studies. With minimal clinical data on IL-23 in AD, a robust POC study is needed to learn about the safety and efficacy of risankizumab in the general AD patient population and at different doses. As with many immune modulating agents, risankizumab may impair immune function, resulting in a risk of infection. This will be monitored by collection of all adverse events (AEs) during the treatment and observation periods. In addition, subjects with active infection will not be included in the study. Subjects with a positive QuantiFERON®-TB (or interferon gamma release assay [IGRA] equivalent)/tuberculosis (TB) skin test result for TB must fulfill entry criteria as specified in Section 5.1of this protocol. IL-23 inhibition is not known to increase the risk of TB infection or impair the response to TB infection in animal models. 22,23 No cases of active TB have been reported across all risankizumab studies to date. Across the Phase 3 psoriasis clinical studies, of the 72 subjects with latent TB who were Page 9 of 116"

Of the 31 subjects from Study M15-992 (IMMhance) with latent TB who did not receive prophylaxis during the study, none developed active TB during the mean follow-up of 55 weeks on risankizumab. Thus, low-risk subjects with positive QuantiFERON-TB testing (or IGRA equivalent)/TB skin test do not need to be treated with anti-TB therapy prior to receiving risankizumab, but should be carefully monitored for any sign of TB reactivation. Published literature indicates that inhibition of IL-23 is unlikely to increase the risk for cancer. Expression of IL-23 is increased in human tumors. 24-26 Moreover, preclinical data have demonstrated a beneficial effect of IL-23 p19 inhibition in animal models, both for pre-existing and tumor-induction models. However, while there is not enough clinical information at this time to rule out a risk of cancer with risankizumab, this risk is considered small. Although rare, a potential for hepatic AEs is under constant surveillance by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects' safety. Increases in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and cardiovascular death, reported initially with anti-IL-12/23 agents, such as ustekinumab, have not been observed in longer term studies. While the likelihood of increased MACE is small, all suspected cardiovascular events (serious or nonserious) observed in this study will be adjudicated by an independent committee. An independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC) will adjudicate all observed cardio- and cerebro-vascular events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.3). Local reactions to subcutaneously-administered biologic therapies are usually limited to redness, swelling, or induration at the injection site. Manifestations of systemic hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis, pruritus, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Both local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions are readily detectable, transient in nature, and manageable with standard medical treatment. Subjects will be closely monitored during study drug administration. An independent Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee (AAC) will adjudicate observed systemic hypersensitivity and anaphylactic events. The AAC will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.4). In conclusion, the benefit-risk profile of risankizumab is considered appropriate for this stage of clinical development. 27 Based on data from the integrated safety analyses, risankizumab is safe and well- tolerated and demonstrates a favorable benefit-risk profile. For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data, in the risankizumab IB.21 In view of the Coronavirus Disease – 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic, the benefit-risk profile of various immunomodulatory therapies on COVID-19 is being evaluated based on real world and clinical trial data. At this time, the effects of risankizumab on the course of COVID-19 are not well defined. Page 10 of 116"

Prognostic and predictive biomarker signatures may be evaluated. Biomarker assessments may include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, or lipids. The objective of biomarker research is to analyze samples that will help to understand AD, related conditions, and the subject's response to risankizumab. Genes of interest may include (but are not limited to) those associated with pharmacokinetics (PK), genes within the target pathway (IL-23, Janus kinase [JAK]/signal transduction activators of transcription [STAT], tyrosine kinase [TYK]2), or other genes believed to be related to AD and other inflammatory diseases (caspase recruitment domain [CARD]-containing), 11filaggrin, human leukocyte antigen [HLA], IL). Blood and skin samples may be used to investigate genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic, phenotypic, functional, and targeted investigations related to AD, related conditions, and response to risankizumab. AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the biomarker exploratory research/validation studies samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples will be retained while research on risankizumab (or drugs of this class) or this disease and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion.

The duration of the study will be up to 65 weeks and will include a screening period of up to 35 days, a 16-week double-blind treatment period (Period A), and a 36-week double-blind treatment period (Period B). In addition, subjects will have a telephone follow-up call 20 weeks after their last dose of risankizumab to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/serious adverse events (SAEs) or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs. This study plans to enroll approximately 155 subjects from up to 75 sites in the US, Canada, Japan, and Australia, although the number, allocation, and location of sites may vary depending on operational aspects of the study. Approximately 20% of subjects will come from sites in Japan. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria (see Section 5.1) will be randomized at Baseline in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of 3 treatment groups: (1) risankizumab 150 mg (62 subjects), (2) risankizumab 300 mg (62 subjects), or (3) matching placebo (31 subjects). In Period A, subjects will receive their randomized treatment as subcutaneous (SC) injections at Week 0 and Week 4. Once a sufficient number of subjects to fulfill the enrollment target have entered the screening process, no further subjects will be screened. Once 155 subjects have been randomized, subjects who have started screening but have not yet been randomized will be allowed to enroll in the study if eligible. The primary analysis will be performed when all subjects complete Week 16. The Week 16 evaluation is the final analysis for the primary endpoint of EASI 75 and key secondary endpoints of vIGA-AD response and pruritus NRS reduction. At the Week 16 analysis, the sponsor will be unblinded, although study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the study. In Period B, subjects in the placebo group will be re-randomized at Week 16 in a 1:1 ratio to receive either risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg for the remainder of the study. Subjects originally randomized to the risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg arms will stay on their previously-assigned treatment through the end of the study. Subjects will receive their randomized treatment as SC injections at Week 16, Week 28, and Week 40. During Period B, subjects with < EASI 50 response, as compared to Baseline, at the most recent prior and current scheduled visits will be allowed to begin approved concomitant rescue treatment after the assessments at the Week 24 visit and at any visit thereafter (see Section 5.4). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should complete a Premature Discontinuation (PD) Visit as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of discontinuation. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should continue to be followed for safety and efficacy assessments at all regularly scheduled visits unless they have decided to discontinue study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent). See Section 5.6for information regarding early discontinuation. The schematic of the study is shown in Figure 1 . Further details regarding study procedures are located in the Operations Manual.

Study Schematic EASI = Eczema Area and Severity Index; PBO = placebo; RZB = risankizumab; W = week 4.2 Discussion of Study Design Choice of Control Group A placebo control has been selected as the appropriate control group for this study to establish an unbiased efficacy and safety profile of risankizumab in subjects with AD. Appropriateness of Measurements Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study. All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with AD. All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted. Suitability of Subject Population Adult and adolescent subjects who have moderate to severe AD (defined as an EASI ≥ 16, BSA ≥ 10%, and vIGA-AD score ≥ 3 at the Baseline Visit), with onset of symptoms at least 2 years prior to Baseline, Page 15 of 116"

The criteria relating to safety have been selected to allow subjects to be safely enrolled and treated with risankizumab based on the current knowledge of this drug. Selection of Doses in the Study Two dose levels of risankizumab have been selected for evaluation in this study. The risankizumab 150 mg SC dose has demonstrated efficacy in Phase 3 clinical trials for psoriasis and could be efficacious in subjects with AD. The additional higher dose of risankizumab 300 mg SC was selected since AD is a disease with a high inflammatory burden. The risankizumab 300 mg dose, along with the 150 mg dose, is expected to provide dose/exposure-response data to allow for evaluation of the efficacy plateau. Both doses are within the range of doses safely administered in previous risankizumab clinical studies. 5 STUDY ACTIVITIES 5.1 Eligibility Criteria Subjects must meet all of the following criteria in order to be included in the study. Anything other than a positive response to the questions below will result in exclusion from study participation. Consent 1.

All concomitant medications should be carefully evaluated by the investigator, and the clinical monitor should be contacted when there are questions regarding concomitant medications. Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the subject has received from 4 weeks prior to screening or receives during the study must be recorded along with the reason for use; date(s) of administration, including start and end dates; and dosage information including dose, route, and frequency on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF). Any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy should be raised to the AbbVie emergency contact. Information regarding potential drug interactions with risankizumab can be located in the risankizumab IB. Subjects must be able to safely discontinue any prohibited medications as specified in the eligibility criteria; where not specified, discontinuation must occur 5 half-lives or 4 weeks, whichever is longer, prior to initial study drug administration. Subjects must be consented for the study prior to discontinuing any prohibited medications for the purpose of meeting study eligibility. Rescue Therapy Topical rescue treatment is allowed only after the assessments at the Week 24 visit and at any visit thereafter in subjects with < EASI 50 response, as compared to Baseline, at the most recent prior and current scheduled visits (e.g., < EASI 50 at Week 20 and Week 24 OR at Week 24 and Week 28, etc.). Rescue treatment is limited to up to twice-daily application of topical corticosteroids (TCS). (Note: Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) may be applied as rescue treatment to sensitive areas [e.g., facial, genital, and intertriginous areas]). Use of TCS and/or TCI as rescue treatment should be recorded on the appropriate concomitant medication eCRF. Subjects who receive prohibited topical treatment prior to Week 24 assessment will be considered treatment failures; however, they will remain on the study treatment assigned at randomization. Subjects who receive other systemic therapy for AD will be discontinued from study drug.To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should continue to be followed for all regularly scheduled visits, unless subjects have decided to discontinue the study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent). 5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects and Discontinuation of Study A subject will be discontinued from study drug at any time for reasons including but not limited to the following: !Clinically significant abnormal laboratory result(s) or AEs that preclude continuation of the study medication, as determined by the investigator and the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) (as applicable).

For subjects to be considered lost to follow-up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain information on the subject's final status. At a minimum, 2 telephone calls must be made and 1 certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source documentation. AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site. The investigator may also stop the study at his/her site if he/she has safety concerns. If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will promptly notify the investigator. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modification During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been necessary to employ mitigation strategies to enable the investigator to ensure subject safety and continuity of care. Acceptable mitigation strategies are identified and included in the Operations Manual in Appendix F . The investigator should contact the sponsor medical contact before discontinuing a subject from the study for a reason other than ""planned per protocol,"" to ensure all acceptable mitigation steps have been explored. Refer to the Operations Manual in Appendix F for details on how to handle study activities/procedures. Page 23 of 116"

Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if they discontinue treatment with study drug early. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should complete a PD Visit as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of discontinuation. Samples for PK and immunogenicity will be collected during the PD Visit. Afterwards, subjects should follow the regular visit schedule as outlined in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix D ) and adhere to all study procedures except for dispensing study drug, PK sample collection and blood sample collection for optional exploratory research. Once the subject has discontinued study drug, all rescue- and efficacy-driven discontinuation criteria no longer apply. If at any point a subject no longer wants to provide assessments (withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study drug, a second PD visit is not required. In addition, if subject is willing and has not withdrawn consent, a follow-up phone call 20 weeks after the last dose of study drug may be completed to ensure all treatment-emergent AEs/SAEs have been resolved. All attempts must be made to determine the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug or study participation. The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition. Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue participation in the study. 5.7 Study Drug Information about the study drug and placebo used in this study is presented in ( Table 1 ).

During Period B, study site staff will administer either risankizumab 150 mg or risankizumab 300 mg subcutaneously as described above. AbbVie will not supply drug other than risankizumab and matching placebo. If a subject is unable to come to the study site for a study visit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, study drug can be taken to the subject's house and administered by trained site personnel under appropriate conditions. Risankizumab and matching placebo will be packaged in quantities sufficient to accommodate study design. Each kit will be labeled per local requirements, and this label must remain affixed to the kit. Upon receipt, study drug must be kept in the original packaging in a secured limited access storage area. Study drug must be kept refrigerated between 2°to 8°C (36°to 46°F), and a temperature log must be maintained for documentation. Each kit will contain a unique kit number. This kit number is assigned to a subject via interactive response technology (IRT) and encodes the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at the subject's corresponding study visit. Site staff will complete all blank spaces on the label before dispensing to subjects. Study drug will only be used for the conduct of this study. Interruption/Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to COVID-19 Delays in study drug dosing due to a subject with COVID-19 must be discussed with the AbbVie medical contact, along with the possibility of premature discontinuation from the study drug dosing period. Follow protocol Section 5.6for subjects who discontinued study drug. 5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment Each subject will be assigned a unique identification number by the IRT at the screening visit. For subjects who rescreen, the identification number assigned by the IRT at the initial screening visit should be used. In addition, the IRT will assign a unique randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment group assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by the statistics department at AbbVie. At Baseline (Study Day 0), subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to risankizumab 150 mg (N = 62), risankizumab 300 mg (N = 62), or matching placebo (N = 31). Randomization will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [vIGA-AD 3] versus severe [vIGA-AD 4]) and geographic region (Japan versus rest of world). At Week 16, subjects in the placebo group will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg for the remainder of the study. Subjects originally randomized to the risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg arms will stay on their previously-assigned treatment through the end of the study. While the sponsor will be unblinded as part of the Week 16 analysis, the investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment for the duration of the study.

In the event of a medical emergency in which the investigator believes that knowledge of study drug treatment is required, reasonable efforts must be made to contact the AbbVie Emergency Contact prior to breaking the blind, as long as it does not compromise subject safety. However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary that warrants breaking the blind prior to contacting the AbbVie Emergency Contact, the investigator can directly access the IRT system to break the blind without AbbVie agreement. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF, as applicable. 5.9 Protocol Deviations The investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations. Protocol deviations are prohibited except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified, including those that may be due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the investigator is responsible for notifying the IEC/IRB, regulatory authorities (as applicable), and AbbVie. 6 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Complaints and Adverse Events Complaints A complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to thephysical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device. Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to AbbVie. Product Complaint A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s). For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, or packaging issues. Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to AbbVie within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event. Product complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion. Page 26 of 116"
26,page_26,"STUDY M16-813 | Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Medical Complaints/AEs and SAEs An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. An AE can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be an AE only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol-specific criteria, and/or the investigator considers it to be an AE. The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis throughout the study. All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE. If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie clinical pharmacovigilance as a SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.3 of the Operations Manual for reporting details and contact information): Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject. Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).

Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 140 days after discontinuation of study drug administration will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject. In addition, SAEs and protocol-related nonserious AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the study-specific informed consent. AbbVie will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) reporting for the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local requirements. AEs will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may indicate a trend or risk to subjects. In the event that an enrolled subject experiences an AE related to asthma, additional information will be collected utilizing a supplemental asthma CRF. Areas of Safety Interest Infections, especially opportunistic infections, are a potential risk with immunomodulators. Subjects will be screened and monitored throughout the study for infections and other areas of safety interest (ASI) (Table 2 ). Screening procedures are outlined in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix D ). If any of the following AEs are reported, then the following supplemental report must be completed. Page 28 of 116"

The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study drug: Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. No Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. Pregnancy While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day after the site becomes aware of the pregnancy. Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued (Section 5.5). Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected. The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly is considered a SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the event. 6.2 Independent Data Monitoring Committee An external independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will review unblinded safety data on a cohort level throughout the course of the study. !A separate IDMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the IDMC members, frequency and triggers of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. Unblinded adjudicated cardio-cerebrovascular events per the CAC charter and anaphylaxis events per the AAC charter will be presented to the IDMC for review on a periodic basis. !Communications from the IDMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments. 6.3 Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee An independent adjudication committee will be adjudicating all observed cardio- and cerebro-vascular events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation. The events that are adjudicated and the adjudication process will be detailed in the CAC Adjudication Committee Charter. Dedicated eCRFs will be used as outlined in Table 2 . Page 30 of 116"

This independent external AAC will adjudicate observed suspected anaphylactic reactions and will remain blinded to treatment allocation. The events that are adjudicated and the adjudication process will be detailed in the AAC Charter. A supplemental Hypersensitivity Reactions eCRF will be used to collect information pertinent to the events. In addition, the site may be contacted for additional source documentation for relevant events. If a systemic hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis is suspected while the subject is not on site, every effort should be made to obtain tryptase and histamine levels from the treating facility to help better understand and characterize the diagnosis. If a suspected systemic hypersensitivity reaction occurs on site, in addition to testing tryptase and histamine levels, PK and ADA/nAb samples will also be collected. 7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans The objective of the statistical analysis is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risankizumab in comparison with the placebo group for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in adult and adolescent subjects. The primary analysis will be performed when all subjects complete Week 16. This analysis is the final and only analysis for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the SAP. The SAP will be finalized prior to the blind break and database lock for the primary analysis. The statistical analyses will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, US). 7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Population includes all randomized subjects and will be used for efficacy analyses. Subjects will be analyzed according to treatment as randomized. Subjects who are randomized to placebo in Period A and do not continue into Period B will be excluded from the analysis in Period B. The Safety Population consists of all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. The safety analyses for each treatment period include subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug during that treatment period. Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment they actually receive, regardless of the treatment to which they are randomized. Page 31 of 116"
31,page_31,"STUDY M16-813 | Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.An ""All Risankizumab"" Treated Population (ALL_RISA) will consist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of risankizumab in the study. This population will be used to provide a comprehensive summary of safety. 7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy Pairwise comparison of the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints will be conducted between each risankizumab group (risankizumab 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively) versus the placebo group using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [vIGA-AD 3] versus severe [vIGA-AD 4]). For the analysis of the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints, non-responder imputation (NRI) with multiple imputation (MI) to handle missing data due to COVID-19 (NRI-C) will be used as the primary approach. The non-responder imputation with no special data handling for missing data due to COVID-19 (NRI-NC) approach, observed cases (OC) approach, and MI may be conducted as appropriate sensitivity analyses to handle missing values. Efficacy data for subjects who switch to rescue medications will be imputed from the point of rescue using an NRI approach for the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. Sample Size Estimation Approximately 155 subjects will be randomized to risankizumab 150 mg, risankizumab 300 mg, or placebo in a ratio of 2:2:1 at Baseline (62 subjects each for the risankizumab 150 mg and 300 mg groups and 31 subjects for the placebo group). Assuming a maximum EASI 75 response rate of 15% in the placebo group, this sample size will provide at least 90% power to detect the treatment difference of at least 36% between each risankizumab group and placebo group using a two-sided test at a 0.025 significance level. The graphic approach for controlling multiplicity will be outlined in the SAP. 7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population for both treatment periods, respectively, based on the treatment subjects actually receive. Safety will be assessed by AEs, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG variables. Missing safety data will not be imputed for safety analysis. Analysis details will be specified in the SAP. AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with onset or worsening on or after the first dose of study drug and within 140 days (20 weeks) after the last dose of study treatment injection. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), as well as by severity and by relationship to the study drug as assessed by the investigator. Summaries (i.e., number, percentages, and events per 100 patient-years) of TEAEs, SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation, and ASI will be provided. Pre-treatment AEs will be summarized separately. For laboratory test and vital signs variables, mean change from baseline and percentage of subjects with evaluations meeting criteria for pre-defined Potentially Clinically Significant (PCS) values will be summarized.

Population PK analyses combining data from this study and other studies of risankizumab may be performed and reported separately. The relationship between risankizumab concentrations and certain efficacy and/or safety variables of interest may be explored. ADA titers will be tabulated for each subject at the respective study visits. The number and percentage of subjects with ADA and nAb will be calculated by dose group. As appropriate, the effect of ADAs on risankizumab PK, efficacy, and/or safety variable(s), and/or any additional analyses may be explored. 8 ETHICS 8.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all subject materials will be submitted to the IEC/IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the informed consent form(s) must be obtained before any subject is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by the IEC/IRB before the changes are implemented to the study. In addition, all changes to the consent form(s) will be IEC/IRB approved. 8.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, Operations Manual, International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations, and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Responsibilities of the investigator are specified in Appendix B . In the event of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to difficulties in performing protocol-specified procedures, AbbVie will engage with study site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity of the study while trying to best manage subject continuity of care. This may include alternative methods of assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection (e.g., use of a local laboratory instead of a central laboratory), study visit schedule modification, and home IP administration by trained site personnel to ensure continuity of treatment, where allowed. Refer to the Operations Manual in Appendix F for additional details. In all cases, these alternative measures must be allowed by local regulations and permitted by IRB/IEC. Investigators should notify AbbVie if any urgent safety measures are taken to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. 8.3 Subject Confidentiality To protect subjects' confidentiality, all subjects and their associated samples will be assigned numerical study identifiers or ""codes."" No identifiable information will be provided to AbbVie. Page 33 of 116"

The written consent may be part of the main consent form. If the subject or their legally authorized representative does not consent to providing optional samples, the subject will still be allowed to participate in the study. A subject may withdraw consent for optional biomarker research at any time and remain in the clinical study. Data generated before subject withdrawal of consent will remain part of the study results. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that additional protocol modifications not outlined in this protocol may become necessary. If this situation arises, in addition to the study informed consent, additional verbal consent may be obtained prior to these adaptations or substantial changes in study conduct in accordance with local regulations. 3.2 Medical History A complete medical history including demographics; history of AD; previous Hepatitis B vaccination; and history of tobacco (including e-cigarettes), alcohol, and drug use will be taken at Screening. The subject's medical history will be updated at the Baseline/Study Day 0 visit, including asthma symptoms (if applicable, using the ACQ-5, see Appendix B ), prior to administration of the first dose of study drug. This updated medical history will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment. 3.3 Adverse Event Assessment Please refer to Section 4.2. In the event that an enrolled subject experiences an AE related to asthma, additional information will be collected utilizing a supplemental asthma CRF. 3.4 Patient-Reported Outcomes Data Collection Subjects will complete self-administered patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments. Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the instrument(s) and to provide the best possible response to each item. Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks. Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument(s) at all specified visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items. PRO instruments that are administered at the site should be completed prior to drug administration and prior to any discussion of adverse events or any review of laboratory findings. The subject should Page 65 of 116"

Daily Worst Pruritus NRS, daily and weekly ADerm-SS, and daily and weekly ADerm-IS ePROs will be collected from subjects electronically every evening using a handheld device provided to the subject at Screening (see Section 3.10 ). The handheld electronic device will be programmed to allow data entry only once per day. All data entered on the device will be immediately stored to the device itself, as well as automatically uploaded to a central server. Data from the DLQI, CDLQI, POEM, PGIS, PGIC, SCORAD (subject-reported items), and EQ-5D-5L assessments will be collected electronically at the visits specified in Section 2.1. Subjects will use a tablet device at the site to enter the required pieces of information. Starting at the Week 16 visit, Daily Worst Pruritus NRS, ADerm-SS, and ADerm-IS ePROs will also be collected electronically at the prescribed visits. The electronic tablet device will be programmed to allow data entry for only the visits specified in the protocol and will not allow subjects to complete more than one of the same assessment at any one visit. All data entered on the handheld and electronic tablet devices will be immediately stored to the devices themselves and automatically uploaded to a central server. Data stored on the central server will be considered source. The investigator and delegated staff will be able to access uploaded subject-entered data via a password protected website until the generation, receipt, and confirmation of the study archive. Data from the ePRO system will be archived and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's ePRO data. Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale The Worst Pruritus NRS ( Appendix C ) is an assessment tool used by subjects to report the intensity of pruritus during a 24-hour recall period. Subjects are asked to rate their pruritus at its worst during the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no itch and 10 being the worst imaginable itch. Atopic Dermatitis Symptoms Scale The ADerm-SS ( Appendix D ) is an 11-item questionnaire that assesses signs and symptoms subjects may experience due to AD. The ADerm-SS includes 3 items that subjects complete daily and 8 items that subjects complete each week, both using a 24-hour recall period. The 3 daily items include worst itch during sleep hours, worst itch during waking hours, and worst skin pain. The 8 weekly items include worst skin cracking, worst pain caused by skin cracking, worst dry skin, worst skin flaking, worst rash (i.e., redness, blisters, bumpy skin), worst skin thickening, worst bleeding, and worst skin oozing. All items of the ADerm-SS are scored on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no [sign/symptom concept]) to 10 (worst possible [sign/symptom concept]). The psychometric properties of the ADerm-SS are being evaluated to establish its validity in assessing AD symptoms. Page 66 of 116"

Items assessed daily include difficulty falling asleep, impact on sleep, and waking at night. Weekly items include household activities (e.g., washing dishes, sweeping, doing laundry), physical activities (e.g., walking, exercising), social activities, concentration, self-consciousness, embarrassment, and sadness. All items of the ADerm-IS are scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (no impact) to 10 (extreme impact). The psychometric properties of the ADerm-IS are being evaluated to assess its validity in assessing the impact of AD to subjects. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis – Subject-Reported Items The SCORAD©(Appendix F ) is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of AD. The assessment consists of 3 components: A = extent or affected body surface area, B = severity, and C = subjective symptoms. Component C will be completed by subjects in this study. Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the subject or relative on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) on the electronic tablet, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20. Dermatology Life Quality Index The DLQI ( Appendix G ) is a 10-item validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QoL). It consists of 10 questions evaluating impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a subject's QoL over the prior week, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the side effects of treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much). Item scores are added to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment of QoL. For general inflammatory skin conditions, a change in DLQI score of at least 4 points is considered the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). In this study, the DLQI will be administered to subjects who are ≥ 16 years old at the Baseline visit. Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index The CDLQI ( Appendix H ) is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QoL. The CDLQI has been validated for use in subjects 4-16 years old. It consists of 10 questions assessing impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a patient's QoL over the prior week. The CDLQI items include symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, school, relationships, sleep, and treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all; 1 = only a little; 2 = quite a lot; and 3 = very much). Item scores (0 to 3) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater impairment of QoL. In this study, Page 67 of 116"

Patient Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM ( Appendix I ) is a 7-item validated questionnaire used to assess disease symptoms in both children and adults. Subjects respond to 7 items, including dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping, with each item scored on a 5-point scale based on frequency (0 = no days; 1 = 1 to 2 days; 2 = 3 to 4 days; 3 = 5 to 6 days; and 4 = all days). Item scores (0 to 4) are added to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 28, with the total score reflecting disease-related morbidity. A change in POEM score of 3.4 points is considered the MCID. Patient Global Impression of Severity The PGIS ( Appendix J) is a single-question assessment in which subjects describe the severity of their AD symptoms at the present moment. Subjects rate their AD symptoms on a 7-point scale, ranging from 0 (Absent, no symptoms) to 6 (Very Severe, cannot be ignored and markedly limits daily activities). Patient Global Impression of Change The PGIC ( Appendix K ) is a single-question assessment in which subjects rate the overall change in their AD symptoms by comparing the severity of their symptoms at the present moment with the severity of their symptoms before they began study treatment. Subjects are asked to rate the overall change in their AD symptoms, with responses ranging from 1 (""Very much improved"") to 7 (""Very much worse""). EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L The EQ-5D-5L ( Appendix L ) is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status (utility). The 5 items in the EQ-5D-5L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 5 levels of severity. Responses to the 5 items encode a discrete health state which is mapped to a preference (utility) specific for different societies. Subjects also rate their perception of their overall health on a separate VAS. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications If electronic PRO instruments (ePROs) cannot be completed on the tablet, they are permitted to be completed via phone or video interview. Site staff will record the subject's responses on the screen shot of the PRO in the subject's language. The date, time, and interviewer name should be recorded in the source document. The investigator or study coordinator must transcribe the PRO responses into the TrialManager website. No other site roles will receive access to enter data into TrialManager. Training will be required for investigator data entry into TrialManager and will be provided upon request of the sponsor. Page 68 of 116"

All ePROs should be completed for the assigned visit. 3.5 Investigator Assessments Investigator assessments will be recorded on source documents and then entered into the eCRF andconducted at the study visits specified in Section 2 . Assessments should be performed by the investigator or qualified site personnel. To minimize variability, the same assessor should evaluate the subject at each visit for the duration of the study. Any assessor must be competent in performing such assessments. It is the responsibility of the site primary investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained to perform assessments and that all training is documented. If the same assessor is not available, the pre-identified back-up assessor should perform such assessments. Eczema Area and Severity Index The EASI ( Appendix M ) is a tool used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema in 4 regions of the body (head and neck; trunk, including lower extremities; upper limbs; and lower limbs). An area score and a severity score are determined for each of the 4 regions. Each region's area score and severity score are multiplied together and then by a multiplier. The total scores from each region are added together to determine the final EASI score. Grades for dryness or scaling are not assessed by the EASI score. Body Surface Area A clinical estimation is made of the total BSA affected by AD. The surface area of the subject's right or left hand is designated as the measuring device, with the total surface of the palm and 5 digits assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1% of the subject's total BSA. Validated Investigator Global Assessment Scale for Atopic Dermatitis The vIGA-AD ( Appendix N ) is a validated assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally, based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). SCORing Atopic Dermatitis Study investigators will complete Components A and B of the SCORAD assessment ( Appendix F ) previously described. The extent of AD (Component A) is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100%. Component B is the assessment of the severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, dryness) using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points). The SCORAD is calculated using the formula A/5 + 7B/2 + C (from the subject assessment), and the maximum score is 103. SCORAD Components A and B will not be on the electronic tablet; instead, they will be performed on paper worksheets and manually entered Page 69 of 116"

The rule of 9's method should be used to assess the percentage of each defined body area on the paper worksheets for Component A. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications Collection of investigator assessment data is not permitted by remote or virtual visits. 3.6 12-Lead Electrocardiogram A 12-lead ECG will be performed at designated study visits specified in Section 2. The ECG should be performed prior to blood collection. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required, provided all protocol-required documentation is available and nothing has changed in the subject's health status since the time of the test that warrants a repeat test. The ECGs will be evaluated by an appropriately trained physician at the site (""local reader""). The local reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the following categories: !Normal ECG !Abnormal ECG – not clinically significant !Abnormal ECG – clinically significant Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source folder. The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine-generated measurements and interpretation that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected. 3.7 Height, Weight, and Waist Circumference For the adult population, height will be measured at Screening only with shoes off. Body weight will be measured at scheduled visits specified in Section 2. The subject should wear lightweight clothing and no shoes during weighing. Waist circumference should be measured at Screening and Week 52; however, if missed at Screening it can be recorded at the Baseline (Study Day 0) visit. For the adolescent population (as defined at Baseline), height, body weight, and waist circumference will be measured at Screening (however, if missed at Screening it can be recorded at the Baseline [Study Day 0]), Week 10, Week 28, and Week 52 with shoes off. The subject should wear lightweight clothing and no shoes during weighing. Page 70 of 116"

BP and pulse rate should be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 3 minutes and before blood draws are performed. 3.9 Physical Examination A complete physical examination will be performed at the designated study visits specified in Section 2. The physical examination performed on Study Day 0 will serve as the baseline physical examination for the entire study. If appropriate, a targeted physical exam should be performed at any other visit (e.g., to evaluate a reported adverse event). Any significant physical examination findings after the first dose will be recorded as AEs, while any findings prior to the first dose will be recorded as medical history. All findings, whether related to an AE or part of each subject's medical history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page. 3.10 Handheld ePRO Device During the Screening Visit, subjects will be dispensed a handheld ePRO device to collect daily Worst Pruritus NRS, daily and weekly ADerm-SS, and daily and weekly ADerm-IS information. At each visit, site representatives should check to see that subjects have performed the required assessments between study visits. Data will be collected from the day of the Screening visit through the Week 16 visit. 3.11 Study Drug Administration Study drug will be administered to subjects beginning at Baseline (Study Day 0) and as specified in Section 2.1. All subcutaneous (SC) doses of risankizumab and placebo will be administered by study site personnel under the direction of the investigator. The date and time (to the nearest minute) of onset of study drug administration will be recorded in the subject's medical record. The first dose of study drug will be administered after all other Baseline (Study Day 0) procedures are completed. Study drug administration instructions for risankizumab pre-filled syringes will be provided for use by site staff. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications If a subject cannot travel to the site for a visit when study drug administration is planned, site personnel may travel to the subject's home to conduct an at-home visit. Study drug may be transported under Page 71 of 116"

The site must contact the sponsor to obtain instructions on how to dispense drug in the IRT system for at-home visits. If an at-home visit is scheduled, site staff should also bring the ePRO tablet to the home for the subject to complete those assessments, see Section 3.4for more details. Monitoring for Hypersensitivity Reactions Therapeutic protein products, such as biologics, may elicit a range of acute effects, from symptomatic discomfort to sudden, fatal reactions that have often been grouped as ""infusion or injection reactions""in the past. Although the term implies a certain temporal relationship, infusion or injection reactions are otherwise not well defined and may encompass a wide range of clinical events, including anaphylaxis and other events that may not be directly related to antibody responses, such as cytokine release syndrome. In the event of a suspected systemic hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction, in addition to the standard AE eCRF, a supplemental Hypersensitivity Reactions eCRF should also be completed by the site. The clinical criterion for diagnosing anaphylaxis is provided in Appendix O for reference; symptoms of anaphylactic reaction usually occur within 24 hours after exposure to an allergen. These are guidelines that are used to help diagnose anaphylaxis. The investigator is encouraged to report any suspected reactions. Subjects should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, including allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, for approximately 2 hours after study drug administration at the Baseline/Study Day 0 and Week 16 visits, and 1 hour after all other doses of study drug (dosing visits other than the Study Day 0 and Week 16 visits). A medical person qualified in the treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions must be present during the injections. All appropriate medical support measures (e.g., diphenhydramine, steroids, epinephrine, oxygen) for the treatment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions should be available for immediate use in the event that a suspected hypersensitivity reaction occurs. Subjects who manifest any new signs or symptoms during the injection should be monitored for appropriate resolution prior to leaving the site. Subjects are encouraged to report any symptoms related to a possible injection-related reactions or local injection site reaction or late phase reactions to the site any time during the study. A patient information card listing the symptoms of these reactions will be provided to the participants. In the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction, blood and serum samples should also be collected as described in Section 3.12 . Page 72 of 116"

Laboratory reference ranges will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study. The baseline laboratory test results for clinical assessment for a particular test will be defined as the last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug. Instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shipping of these samples will be provided by the central laboratory. If a laboratory test value is outside the reference range and the investigator considers the laboratory result to be clinically significant, the investigator will: !repeat the test to verify the out-of-range value; !follow the out-of-range value to a satisfactory clinical resolution; or !discontinue the subject from the study or require the subject to receive treatment; in this case, the laboratory result will be recorded as an adverse event.

Pregnancy testing should not be performed for postmenopausal women.A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and a urine pregnancy test will be performed at Baseline for all female subjects. The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory. If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the subject is considered a screen failure. If the serum pregnancy test is borderline, it should be repeated to determine eligibility. If the repeat serum pregnancy test is: !Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure; !Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the study; !Still borderline ≥ 3 days later, this will be considered documentation of continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the study in the absence of clinical suspicion of pregnancy and other pathological causes of borderline results. Additional urine pregnancy tests for female subjects of childbearing potential will be performed at visits indicated in Section 2. More frequent pregnancy tests can be performed throughout the study at the investigator's discretion or if required per local/country requirements. If the urine pregnancy test (which is performed at the site) is negative, begin or continue dosing. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing and perform a serum pregnancy test. Pregnant subjects must discontinue from the study. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) should be tested at Screening if the female subject is ≤55 years of age AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization. Clinical Chemistry Blood samples will be collected following a minimum 8-hour fast for the Baseline visit (i.e., for lipid testing). If a subject is not able to fast at this visit, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non-fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation and lab requisition. Blood samples at other visits can be drawn without prior fast. Urinalysis Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at the Screening visit. Specified abnormal macroscopic urinalyses, defined as leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, blood greater than negative, or glucose greater than normal, will be followed-up with a microscopic analysis at the central laboratory.

Subjects with Hepatitis B (HBs Ag positive [+] or detected sensitivity on the HBV DNA PCR qualitative test) or Hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable in any subject with anti-HCV Ab) will be excluded. Subjects who have been vaccinated against Hepatitis B and are HBs Ab positive may be enrolled. If HBs Ag is negative but Hepatitis B core antibodies total is positive, Hepatitis B virus DNA will be quantified. If Hepatitis B virus DNA level is undetectable at Screening, the subject can participate in this study. If Hepatitis C virus antibodies level is positive, Hepatitis C virus RNA will be quantified. If Hepatitis C RNA level is undetectable at Screening, the subject can participate in this study. Where mandated by local requirements; subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at screening should have HBV DNA PCR testing performed every 12 weeks (q12w). HBV DNA PCR testing q12w is not necessary when the subject has a history of HBV vaccine and is HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab–. Figure 1. Interpretation and Management of HBV Serologic Test Results DNA = deoxyribonucleic acid; HBs Ag = hepatitis B surface antigen; HBs Ag = hepatitis B surface antigen; HBV = hepatitis C viru s; PCR = polymerase chain reaction * A positive test result for HBs Ab is expected for subjects who have had a HBV vaccination. For subjects without a history of HBV vaccination (and where mandated by local requirements), a positive result for HBs Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing. HIV Testing HIV testing will be performed at Screening. The investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject. The site will report confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary. If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the subject's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly. A subject will not be eligible for study Page 76 of 116"

AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result. TB Screening Subjects will be tested for TB by either the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or IGRA equivalent) or a TB Skin Test (PPD) at the Screening visit and at Week 52, as specified in the study activity table. At Screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of TB, and if positive, additional risk factors will be evaluated. If a subject had a negative PPD test or QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or IGRA equivalent) within 90 days prior to Screening and all protocol-required documentation is available, the test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. Subjects who have tested positive will not have another test performed. At Week 52, subjects with no prior positive TB test will be tested for TB by either the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or IGRA equivalent) or a TB Skin Test (PPD). The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold assay test will be supplied and analyzed by the central laboratory. (QuantiFERON-TB test is preferred over TB Skin Test.) Details on the collection, shipment of samples and reporting of results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the laboratory manual. !If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or IGRA equivalent) is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test [or IGRA equivalent] and the PPD Skin Test are required per local guidelines), the PPD Skin Test will be performed according to standard clinical practice. !The PPD Skin Test should be read by a licensed healthcare professional between 48 and 72 hours after administration. A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. !The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction. The absence of induration will be recorded as ""0 mm,"" not ""negative."" !If subject had a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold (or IGRA equivalent) or PPD test at Screening, the test should not be repeated. Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to the TB Skin Test in the past should not be re-exposed and should not be tested by a PPD skin test. !If the TB screening test (either PPD or the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test [or IGRA equivalent]) is positive, or if there is a repeat indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) upon retesting, subjects may participate in the study if further work-up (according to local practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the patient has no evidence of active TB. !If the subject is diagnosed with active TB , the subject should not be randomized in the study and should not receive study drug. Subject will be considered as a screening failure . Page 77 of 116"
77,page_77,"p. 28 of 64 OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL M16-813 Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.!If presence of latent TB is established, subjects are not required to be treated with prophylactic anti-TB therapy prior to or during the study, if considered low risk for reactivation per investigator judgment. !If the subject is diagnosed with active TB after being randomized, the subject should not receive any further study drug and follow the PD Visit procedure (Section 2.2). !If TB (latent or active) is diagnosed during the study, it is also necessary to report it as an AE in the source documents and eCRFs. In the case of a TB-related AE, a TB supplemental form that provides additional information will be completed by the investigator or designee. Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis Testing Anaphylaxis testing is only performed in case of a suspected anaphylactic reaction. Samples should be collected as follows: Plasma tryptase: Optimally, measurement needs to be obtained from 15 minutes to 3 hours of symptom onset, but no later than 6 hours after (tryptase may remain elevated for 6 or more hours after the onset and therefore may still be informative if obtained after 3 hours); a follow-up tryptase level should be collected a minimum of 2 weeks after any suspected anaphylaxis event. Plasma histamine: Blood samples for measurement of histamine levels are optimally obtained 5 - 15 minutes after symptom onset and no later than 1 hour. If a suspected systemic hypersensitivity reaction occurs on site, in addition to tryptase and histamine levels, PK and ADA/nAb samples will also be collected. In the event that a serious systemic hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis occurs while the subject is not on site at the study clinic, please advise the treating facility to obtain tryptase and histamine levels to help better understand and characterize the diagnosis. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic prevent the subject from having blood drawn for laboratory testing at the study site, if possible, arrange for subjects to have laboratory work done at a local lab, hospital, or other facility. Local lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges. Local lab results and reference ranges need to be entered into the EDC system and also kept with the subjects' source documentation. Local lab results should be reviewed by the investigator as soon as possible. If laboratory samples cannot be obtained, study drug administration may be continued provided the investigator has reviewed all prior laboratory results and confirms and discusses with the subject that there is no safety concern for the subject to continue use of the study drug in the absence of current labs. The subject should be scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as feasible. Page 78 of 116"

For subjects who prematurely discontinue from study drug treatment, PK and ADA samples will be collected at any time during the PD Visit. Collection of Blood Samples for Risankizumab Analysis, ADA Assay, and nAb Assay Blood samples for analysis of risankizumab serum concentrations, ADA assay, and nAB assay will be collected throughout the treatment period on the study days specified in the protocol. Samples will be collected by venipuncture into appropriately-labeled, evacuated serum collection tubes. The time that each blood sample (PK and ADA/nAb) is collected will be recorded to the nearest minute in the source document. Measurement Methods Serum concentrations of risankizumab and ADA and nAb assessments will be done using validated methods at or under the supervision of the Bioanalysis Department at AbbVie. The presence of ADA to risankizumab will be assessed via a tiered approach with an electrochemiluminescence assay using screening, confirmatory, and titration analyses. Samples that are confirmed positive may be further characterized in a validated nAb assay. Any additional analytes may be analyzed using nonvalidated methods. Serum samples collected for risankizumab PK and ADA analysis may be used for future assay development or validation activities. Disposition of Samples The frozen serum samples for risankizumab analysis and ADA and nAb assays will be packed in dry ice sufficient to last during transportation and shipped from the study site to the central lab according to instructions from AbbVie. 3.14 Biomarker and/or Exploratory Research Sampling Optional whole blood, biopsy, and skin tape samples will be collected for biomarker research at study visits outlined in Section 2above. All biomarker samples should be collected, labeled, and shipped as outlined in the study-specific laboratory manual. AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the samples and data in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples may be retained while research on risankizumab (or drugs of this class) or AD and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion, or per local requirement.

For subjects who consent, both lesional and non-lesional skin punch biopsies and tape strip samples will be collected during the study. Lesional skin punch biopsies and tape strip samples should be collected at the Baseline, Week 4, Week 16, and Week 52/PD visits. In addition, non-lesional skin punch biopsies and tape strip samples should also be collected at the Baseline and Week 16 visits. Suitable sites for skin biopsy will include any cutaneous surface except the head and neck, genitals, hands, feet, elbows, lower leg, or knees. The lesional biopsy should be taken from a target lesion initially and always taken from the same lesion or comparable lesion thereafter. The non-lesional sample should be collected from the most normal appearing skin in a relative proximity to the lesional skin biopsy site (i.e., same anatomical area), at least 5 cm away from the lesion. It is recommended to photograph the location from which the biopsies will be collected and document it on a diagram. These photographs are to be used only by the sites to identify biopsy location for subsequent visits. Skin tape harvest samples will be taken prior to the punch biopsy and from a site adjacent to the site used for skin punch biopsies. Sites should not biopsy over the taping site. Patches will be applied to the skin briefly and then removed. Each sample will consist of 20 discs applied to the same exact area in succession. Skin tape harvest samples should be taken from the same lesional and non-lesional areas for each visit. 3.15 Subject Withdrawal from Study All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug or study participation. The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition. Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue participation in the study. 3.16 Unscheduled Visits An unscheduled visit should be performed when the subjects comes in for a medical visit for safety evaluation and assessment. During Unscheduled Visits, blood and urine samples may be obtained for the laboratory tests listed in Section 3.12 , or for other tests, at the investigator's discretion. No efficacy assessments and no drug administration should be performed at this visit. Page 80 of 116"

All follow-up information is to be reported to the sponsor (or an authorized representative) and documented in source as required by the sponsor. Product complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in the study summary. All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Product complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint condition. In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the investigator to return the product within 30 days. If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an estimated date of return. 5 COUNTRY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS 5.1 SUSAR Reporting AbbVie will be responsible for SUSAR reporting for the IMP in accordance with global and local guidelines, and Appendix A of the Investigator's Brochure will serve as the Reference Safety Information (RSI). The RSI in effect at the start of a Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) reporting period serves as the RSI during the reporting period. For follow-up reports, the RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the 'suspected' Serious Adverse Reaction will be used to assess expectedness. 5.2 Additional Country-Specific Requirements – Japan For Japanese sites, the following country-specific requirements are applicable: !Protocol Section 5.1, Eligibility Criterion 2: Subjects under 20 years of age must voluntarily sign and date an informed consent, in addition to their parent or legal guardian. !Protocol Section 5.9: In addition to the other responsibilities listed, investigators are also responsible for recording protocol deviations in the appropriate source records.

For additional details on dispensing study drug in the event of home administration due to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Section 3.11 . Risankizumab and matching placebo will be provided by AbbVie as a solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe (PFS). Study site staff will administer study drug as follows: !Risankizumab 150 mg: Two SC injections of 75 mg and 2 SC injections of placebo at Baseline (Study Day 0), Week 4, Week 16, Week 28, and Week 40. !Risankizumab 300 mg: Four SC injections of 75 mg at Baseline (Study Day 0), Week 4, Week 16, Week 28, and Week 40. !Placebo: Four SC injections at Baseline (Study Day 0) and at Week 4. At Week 16, subjects are re-randomized to receive either risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg for the remainder of the study at Week 16, Week 28, and Week 40. Study drug will be administered as described above. Study drug must not be dispensed without contacting the interactive response technology (IRT) system. Study drug may only be dispensed to subjects enrolled in the study through the IRT system. Visit date information and study drug return information for each kit will be available through the IRT system. 6.2 Packaging and Labeling Study drug packaged in 75 mg PFS will be provided in a blinded fashion and packaged in cartons containing 1 syringe per carton. Each kit will be labeled as required per local requirements. Each kit label will contain a unique kit number. This kit number is assigned to a subject via the IRT and encodes the appropriate study drug to be administered at the subjects corresponding study visit. All labels must remain affixed to the study drug at all times and should never be removed for any reason. All blank spaces should be completed by site staff prior to dispensing to subject. Storage and Disposition of Study Drug Risankizumab and matching placebo kits must be kept protected from light in the original packaging, in a refrigerator between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).

The refrigerator temperature must be recorded each business day. Malfunctions or temperature excursions must be reported to the sponsor immediately upon notice. Study drug should be quarantined and not dispensed until AbbVie (or the AbbVie Temperature Excursion Management System) deems the drug as acceptable. All clinical supplies must be stored and locked in a secure place until they are dispensed for subject use or are returned to AbbVie. Investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this study. 6.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risankizumab in adult and adolescent subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of moderate to severe AD and onset of symptoms at least 2 years before the Baseline Visit. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of 3 treatment groups: (1) risankizumab 150 mg (62 subjects), (2) risankizumab 300 mg (62 subjects), or (3) matching placebo (31 subjects). Subjects in the placebo group will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg at Week 16. At the Screening visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number through the use of the IRT. For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, the site personnel must contact the IRT system and identify the subject as a screen failure. Subjects who are enrolled will retain their subject number assigned at the Screening visit throughout the study. Upon receipt of study drug, the site will acknowledge receipt in the IRT system. Contact information and user guidelines for IRT use will be provided to each site. 6.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject During Period A, study site staff will administer study drug (risankizumab 150 mg, risankizumab 300 mg, or matching placebo) subcutaneously at the Baseline (Study Day 0) and Week 4 visits. During Period B, study site staff will administer either risankizumab 150 mg or risankizumab 300 mg at the Week 16, Week 28, and Week 40 visits. Page 86 of 116"

SCORAD EXAMPLE The SCORAD1is a tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of AD. Body Area Affected:The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area. To help in determining this extent, the sites affected by eczema are shaded on a drawing of a body. The rule of 9 is used to calculate the affected area as a percentage of the whole body: !Head and neck 9% !Upper limbs 9% each !Lower limbs 18% each !Anterior trunk 18% !Back 18% !Genitals 1% The score for each area is added up. The total area is 'A,' which has a possible maximum of 100%. Symptom Severity:A representative area of eczema is selected. In this area, the intensity of each of the following 6 specific symptoms is assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). !Redness !Swelling !Oozing/crusting !Scratch marks !Skin thickening (lichenification) !Dryness (this is assessed in an area where there is no inflammation) The scores for these 6 specific symptoms should be added, for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as ""B"" in the overall SCORAD calculation.

EASI SCORING EXAMPLE An EASI2score is a tool used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema (Eczema Area and Severity Index). EASI score does not include a grade for dryness or scaling. Assignments for the following body regions are as follows: !Head and Neck !Trunk: include with the lower extremities !Upper limbs !Lower limbs Area Score Area score is recorded for each of the four regions of the body. The area score is the percentage of skin affected by eczema. Area score Percentage of skin affected by eczema in each region: !0 = no eczema in this region !1 = 1% – 9% !2 = 10% – 29% !3 = 30% – 49% !4 = 50% – 69% !5 = 70% – 89% !6 = 90% – 100%: the entire region is affected by eczema Severity Score Severity score is recorded for each of the four regions of the body. The severity score is the sum of the intensity scores for four signs. The four signs are: 1. Redness (erythema, inflammation) 2. Thickness (induration, papulation, swelling – acute eczema) 3. Scratching (excoriation) Page 111 of 116"

CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSING ANAPHYLAXIS Anaphylaxis3is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: 1) Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWINGa) Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow [PEF], hypoxemia) b) Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 2) Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours):a) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen lips-tongue- uvula) b) Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 3) Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours): a) Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP* b) Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person's baseline. * Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg + [2 × age]) from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mg Hg from 11 to 17 years. Serious Systemic Hypersensitivity Reaction: A hypersensitivity reaction is a clinical sign or symptom, or constellation of signs or symptoms, caused by an inappropriate and excessive immunologic reaction to study drug administration. A systemic hypersensitivity reaction is a hypersensitivity reaction that does not occur at the local site of study drug administration (e.g., not an injection site reaction). A serious systemic hypersensitivity reaction is a systemic hypersensitivity reaction that fulfills criteria for a SAE. In the event of an anaphylactic reaction, blood samples will be drawn per Section 3.12 after the onset of the reaction. Separate instructions for the collection, handling, storage, and shipping of these labs will be provided outside of the study protocol. Page 114 of 116"
