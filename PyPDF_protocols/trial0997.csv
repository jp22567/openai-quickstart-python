Number of Participants Approximately 600 participants Study Design Randomized (2:2:1) , double -blind , 8-week VC period followed by a randomized , double -blind, 44-week LTS extension period . In the LTS period, participants initially randomized to vehicle will receive either ruxolitinib 0.75% or 1.5 % cream . Estimated Duration of Study Participation Screening: up to 28 days Vehicle -control led period: 8 weeks Double -blind , randomized LTS period: 44 weeks Follow -up: 30 (+ 7) days after last application of study drug or last visit Total: u p to 60 weeks DSMB/DMC No Treatment Groups and Duration: Adolescents aged ≥ 12 to 17 years, inclusive, and men and women aged ≥ 18 years who meet the inclusion crite ria and have been diagnosed with AD of at least 2 years duration, an IGA score of 2 to 3, and % BSA involvement of 3% to 20% (excluding scalp) will be enrolled and receive treatment with rux olitinib 0.75% cream BID, ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID, or vehicle cream in a 2:2:1 randomi zation for a total duration of 8 weeks (with a screening period of approximately 28 days) during the VC period of the study. Adolescents will make up approximately 20% of the ove rall study population. At Wee k 8, all participants who successfully complete the VC period of the study and all Week 8 assessments will be offered participation in the LTS treatment period with ruxolitinib 0.75% or 1.5% cre am BID. The required %BSA range and IGA score entry into the LTS period is 0% to 20% and 0 to 4 gra de, respectively. Participants who were initially treated with either ruxolitinib 0.75% or 1.5% c ream will remain in their respective treatment regimen, while those participants who were initially treated with vehicle will be randomized to either ruxolitinib 0.75% or 1.5% cream BID. During this LTS period, participants will have study visits every 4 weeks until the end of the study (52 weeks total). After the Week 8 visit, during the LTS period, participants will self-evaluate recurrence of AD and will tre at those areas of the skin with active AD changes (not to exceed up to 20% BSA). If lesions clear between study visits, participants will stop treatment application 3 days after they have disappeared. In the event that the new lesions are significantly more extensive than from the previous visit, the participant should call the study site to discuss with the investigator whether additional evaluation at the clinic is required. The investigator, if needed, will have the option of ha ving the participant return for an unscheduled visit. The study schema is shown below in Figure 1. All participants will have follow-up assessments 30 (+ 7) day s after the last application of study drug."

INTRODUCTION Ruxolitinib cream is a topical formulation of ruxolitinib phosphate under development for the treatment of participants with AD, AA, vitiligo, and plaque psoriasis. Ruxolitinib phosphate is an inhibitor of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases. Isogenic and inflammatory cytokines are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, AA, and AD. Because JAKs serve to translate extracellular signals from a number of relevant cytokines and growth factors upregulated in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, AA, and AD, JAK inhibitors represent potential therapeutic agents for these disease states. 2.1. Background 2.1.1. Atopic Dermatitis Atopic derma titis is a chronic, recurring, inflammatory, and itchy skin condition that affects worldwide up to 25% of children and up to 12% of adults ( Eichenfi eld et al 2014 , Hanifin et al 2007, Harrop et al 2007 , Rönmark et al 2012 , Vinding et al 2014). Its incidence in the industriali zed countries appears to be increasing, and it is associated with substantial cost ($3.8 billion per year in direct medical costs alone; Ellis et al 2002). Although AD is not li fe-threatening, patients with AD are at a higher risk for the development of other potentially life-threatening disorders such as asthma and/or food allergy ( Spergel 2010 ). This disease evolution leading to the possible development of other atopic conditions, including food allergy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, is often termed as ""atopic march."" According to the recent Global Burden of Disease project, worldwide AD is one of the 50 most prevalent diseases, and it has the second highest disability ranking of all nonmalignant skin diseases ( Hay et al 2014 ). 2.1.2. Diagnosis of Atopic Dermatitis One of the earliest and most recognized sets of diagnostic criteria is the Hanifin and Rajka criteria, which requires that 3 of 4 criteria and 3 of 23 minor criteria be met ( Purvis 2014 ). Essential features that are present in this disease are pruritus, eczema (acute, subacute, chronic), chronic or relapsing history, and typical morphology and age-specific patterns, including the following: 1) facial, neck, and extensor involvement in infants and children; 2) current or previous flexural lesions in any age group; 3) sparing of the groin and axillary regions. The clinical pattern of AD varies with age. Infants usually show acute erythematous and often develop exudative papules on the face or scalp. The childhood (age 2 years to puberty) and adult phases of AD tend to have less acute or exudative lesions but instead typically present with more lichenified and localized lesions (flexural folds, the face and neck, the upper arms and back, and the dorsa of the hands, feet, fingers, and toes) that represent a more chronic stage of the condition (Akdis et al 2006). The unifying and cardinal feature of all presentations of AD is the pronounced and often unbearable itching."

22,page_22,"Incyte Corporation Page 22 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL There are also additional systemic drugs being developed for more severe AD, including biologic agents against IL-31 and IL-13. Recent studies with oral JAK inhibitors indicated that these drugs may be effective in the treatment of AD ( Levy et al 2015 ) and have triggered further interest in their use as topical agents for this skin condition. A clinical study with topical tofacitinib confirmed that JAK inhibitors can be effective in AD also when used topically (Bissonnette et al 2016). 2.1.4. Role of Janus Kinases in Atopic Dermatitis R uxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAKs, which play an important role in signal transduction following cytokine and growth factor binding to their receptors. Excessive production of cytokines and growth factors has been associated with a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, including psoriasis, AA, AD, vitiligo, and other potential autoimmune diseases of the skin. Th2 cytokines (interleukins IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and epithelial cytokines TSLP play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD by activating inflammatory pathways in multiple cell types, impairing epidermal barrier structure and function, and inducing allergen sensitization (Moreno et al 2016 ). A number of drugs currently being developed for AD are designed to block these cytokines and are highly promising new biologic agents; in addition to the recently approved dupilumab, lebriki zumab and tezepelumab are both being clinically tested ( Beck et al 2014 ). However, these new drugs cannot be used topically and will likely be limited in use in patients with more severe AD. The type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 signal through JAK1. Taken together, simultaneous disruption of multiple type 2 inflammatory cytokine–associated pathways via JAK inhibition may serve as a novel therapeutic modality of a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory agent in AD. To date, a topi cal JAK inhibitor with sufficient skin penetration has not yet been approved in AD. 2.2. Ruxolitinib 2.2.1. Oral Ruxolitin ib A Phase 1 study of oral ruxolitinib was conducted in 49 children with various malignancies (28 with solid tumors and 21 with hematological neoplasms; ADVL1011). Five dose levels were tested (15, 21, 29, 39, and 50 mg/m2 per dose BID) in participants aged 2.4 to 21.4 years. All doses evaluated were tolerated. The safety profile in these pediatric participants was consistent with tha t seen in adults and did not disclose any abnormalities limited to these age groups only. A thorough QT study was conducted in 50 healthy participants. There was no indication of a QT/QTc-prolonging effect of ruxolitinib in single doses up to a supratherapeutic dose of 200 mg, indicating that ruxolitinib has no effect on cardiac repolarization."
23,page_23,"Incyte Corporation Page 23 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL The AE profile of ruxolitinib was also assessed in 198 healthy participants, participants with various degrees of renal (n = 32) or hepatic (n = 24) impairment, and participants with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 59). Adverse events were, in general, mild and resolved without interventions. Ruxolitinib is approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate- or high-risk my elofibrosis and for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. In the randomized period of the 2 pivotal studies in myelofibrosis, COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II, discontinuation because of AEs regardless of causality was observed in 11.3% of participants. The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were thrombocytopenia and anemia. Hematological adverse reactions (any CTCAE grade) included anemia (82.4%), thrombocytopenia (69.8%), and neutropenia (16.6%). Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia are dose-related effects. The 3 most frequent nonhematological adverse reactions were bruising (21.6%), dizziness (15.3%), and headache (14.0%). The 3 most frequent nonhematological laboratory abnormalities were increased ALT (27.2%), increased AST (18.6 %), and hypercholesterolemia (16.9%). Lon g-term follow-up in participants with myelofibrosis has shown that, as expected, the numbers and pr oportions of AEs and SAEs has increased; however, no new safety signals have emerged (median duration of exposure for this population is 27.6 months, with 1345.78 patient-years of ex posure). In Study INCB 18424-258, in participants with myelofibrosis with a platelet count between 50 and 100 × 109/L , beginning treatment with 5 mg BID was well-tolerated, avoided levels of thrombocytopeni a associated with a high risk of significant bleeding, and provided an opportunity to increase the dose of ruxolitinib in a safe manner. Overall, the safety profile of ruxolitinib in the polycythemia vera population is generally consistent with that observed in the myelofibrosis population. Ruxolitinib was generally well-tolerated in participants with polycythemia vera, and only a small proportion of participants discontinued ruxolitinib because of AEs (3.6%). Most of the AEs were managed by dose modifications. Hematological toxicities were less frequent and less severe in participants with polycythemia vera as compared with those observed in participants with myelofibrosis. No new safety signals emerged from a study in pancreatic cancer in combination with capecitabine. Please refer to the ruxolitinib cream IB for more details. 2.2.2. Ruxolitinib Cream 2.2.2.1. Preclinical Drug Disposition Summa ry The relative bioavailability of topical ruxolitinib cream was markedly lower than after oral admini stration. The primary clearance pathway is via metabolism CYP3A4 is the predominant CYP isozyme responsible for the metabolism of ruxolitinib. Several metabolites of ruxolitinib retain JAK-related pharmacological activity."

Preclinical Safety In animal studies, ruxolitinib cream was not a contact sensitizer and did not produce significant derma l or ocular irritation, acute phototoxicity, or photoallergic potential. Ruxolitinib cream (up to 1.5%) a pplied BID for up to 9 months in the Gottingen minipig was not associated with any adverse effects. In a 2-year dermal carcinogenicity study in mice, ruxolitinib was not associated with any macroscopic, neoplastic, or nonneoplastic findings. The toxicity of ruxolitinib has been evaluated following oral administration to mice, rats, and dogs. Findings in these studies were primarily those associated with the mechanism of action of ruxolitinib, including decreases in red blood cells, reticulocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes have been observed along with lymphoid depletion in bone marrow and lymphoid organs. Opportunistic infections considered secondary to immune suppression, were noted in dogs. Systemic exposures in these studies exceeded those anticipated with topical application. Ruxolitinib was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant rats or rabbits; there were no adverse developmental effects at doses below those associated with maternal toxicity. Ruxolitinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames test) or clastogenic in in vitro chromosomal aberration assay (cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes) or in vivo in a ra t bone marrow micronucleus assay. In a toxicity study of orally administered ruxolitinib in juvenile rats beginning on Days 7, 14, or 21 postpartum, dose-related effects on body weight gain and decrements in various bone measures were observed in all cohorts. Hematology and other microscopic findings were similar to those previously observed in general toxicology studies. Other than the bone findings, there were no other novel toxicities in juvenile animals. In animals administered ruxolitinib beginning on Day 21 postpartum (considered approximately equivalent to a 2 year old human), bone findings oc curred at exposures higher than those anticipated with topical application. The cli nical relevance of this study in humans is not clear. Please refer to the ruxolitinib cream IB for more details. 2.2.2.3. Clin ical Safety Ruxolitinib is a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the JAKs, specifically JAK1 and JAK2 with modest to marked selectivity against TYK2 and JAK3. Ruxolitinib potently (IC 50 < 5 nM) inhibit s JAKs, yet it does not significantly inhibit (< 30% inhibition) a broad panel of 26 kinases when tested at 200 nM (approximately 100 times the average IC 50 value for JAK enzyme inhibit ion). Ruxolitinib also potently inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT proteins and the production of proinflammatory factors induced by cytokines such as IL-23 and interferon γ. Topica l application of ruxolitinib demonstrated excellent efficacy in an in vivo model of immune-based skin inflammation, the delayed-type hypersensitivity model in mice, including reduced ear swelling, reduced immune cell infiltrates, and normalization of tissue histology. Furthermore, ruxolitinib was also efficacious in the inflammatory phase of the dorsal delayed-type hypersensitivity model when applied in a clinically relevant cream formulation."

Systemic Bioavailability The PK analysis was performed in 3 clinical studies in psoriasis: INCB 18424-201, -202, and -203. In summary, the PK of ruxolitinib following topical administration in participants with psoriasis was characterized by low systemic bioavailability in the range of and consequently plasma concentrations that represent only a fraction of that observed following oral administration. Preliminary PK information from Part A of INCB 18424-204 in participants with AA reveals generally comparably low levels of systemic bioavailability when ruxolitinib cream is applied to the scalp. Pediatric participants are currently being evaluated in a pilot 4-week safety and PK study (INCB 18424-102) and, to date, the efficacy, safety, and PK outcomes have been generally simil ar to those seen in adult participants (Study INCB 18424-206). Such similarities, particularly for therapeutic responses, are in line with the anticipation based on the fact that the skin of children ≥ 2 years old is fully matured and functional and not materially different from that of adults ( Michel et al 1997 ). In general, while the disease presentation may show some age-related differences in terms of distribution and chronicity of skin lesions, these tend to be minor in nature and do not warrant a different therapeutic approach, particularly for pediatric patients above 2 years of age ( Akdis et al 2006 , Eichenfield et al 2014 ). 2.2.2.4. E fficac y of Ruxolitinib Cream 2.2.2.4.1. Atopic Dermatitis INCB 18424-206 (see Figure 3) was a Phase 2, randomized, vehicle- and active ( TC 0.1% cre am)-controlled dose-ranging study in participants with AD. The study was double-blinded for vehicle, ruxolitinib doses, and active control. A total of 307 participants were randomized equally to ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID, 1.5% QD, 0.5% QD, and 0.15% QD; vehicle BID; and active control ( TC 0.1% cream BID) and stratified by EASI score (≤ 7 and > 7). Participants rec eived blinded study drug for 8 weeks, and those who were randomized to TC applied triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID for 4 weeks and vehicle cream for the following 4 weeks, so as to not exceed the allowable triamcinolone application duration. Participants then were permitted to enter an open-label extension and apply ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID for an additional 4 weeks."

The for mer was the only treatment group demonstrating a statistically significant difference. Additional detail s regarding this study can be found in the ruxolitinib cream IB. 2.2.2.4.2. Psoriasis The 3 clinical studies in participants with plaque psoriasis, ruxolitinib cream (0.5%, 1.0%, or 1.5%) was evaluated in over 200 participants with application of 4 to 12 weeks duration. Observed AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and most judged unrelated to study medication, with no associated SAEs or withdrawals. Overall, ruxolitinib cream was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated when applied QD or BID for 28 days to plaque psoriasis affecting 2% to 20% of the BSA. Additiona l details regarding this study can be found in the ruxolitinib cream IB. 2.2.2.4.3. Alopecia Areata and Vitiligo Study INCB 18424-204 is a study in AA wh ere ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID was also well-tolerated, with the majority of participants treated for 48 weeks. The study was conducted in 2015 throug h 2017 but terminated early in OCT 2017 owing to lack of efficacy in the primary Week 24 analysis after all participants completed the Week 48 visit or discontinued. Study INCB 18424-211 is an ongoing, 3-part, randomized, double-blind and vehicle-controlled study in vitiligo. Enrollment into the study was completed by 21 MAR 2018 with 157 participants randomized to treatment groups. As of 15 JUN 2018, few and only minor appli cation site reactions have been observed across treatment groups (study data is blinded). Moreover, most of them related to all treated body locations of vitiligo and did not indicate that the tolerability of the study drug was any different on the face versus on other body areas. Additional details may be found in the ruxolitinib cream IB."
28,page_28,"Incyte Corporation Page 28 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL 2.3. Study Rationale Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory, and itchy skin condition that affect up to 15% to 20% of children and 5% to 10% of adults. The clinical pattern of AD varies with age. Infants usually show acute erythematous and often develop exudative papules on the face or scalp. The childhood (2 years of age to puberty) and adult phases of AD tend to have less acute or exudative lesions but instead typically present with more lichenified and localized lesions (flexural folds, the face and neck, the upper arms and back, and the dorsa of the hands, feet, fingers, and toes) that represent a more chronic stage of the condition ( Akdis e t al 2006 ). The unifying and cardinal feature of all presentations of AD is the pronounced and often unbearable itching. Since the early 2000s, only 2 new classes of nonsteroid al topical therapies, topical calcineurin inhibit ors (with a boxed warning for serious infections and potential for skin carcinogenicity) and PDE4 inhibitors, have been introduced and provide a safe treatment alternative ( Papier and Strowd 2018). In addition to these 2 therapies, a PDE4 inhibitor ointment was approved at the end of 2016 in the United States for patients with AD 2 years and older (crisaborole ointment; Eucrisa). While not associated with any notable safety concerns when used on larger %BSA, it showed relatively limited efficacy over its vehicle (approximately 10%; Eucrisa 2016 ). These therapies are limited options; therefore, there is still a significant medical need for topical treatments for AD that are both effective and safe, particularly in children. Janus kinases are intracellular signaling enzymes that act downstream of key proinflammatory cytokines known to promote AD pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that JAK inhibition may have antipruritic effects by acting directly on sensory nerve fibers ( Oetjen et al 2017 ). Ruxolitinib cream is a potent, selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 and may offer a novel therapeutic approach with dual anti-inflammatory and antipruritic properties. Ruxolitinib cream is being developed for topical application for AD, a route of administration that should achieve high local concentrations of ruxolitinib in the skin while limiting systemic exposure. 2.3.1. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This i s a confirmatory study in a larger participant population with AD with the objective to further evaluate and confirm the prior findings with regard to the efficacy and safety of the proposed treatment regimens. The population to be studied comprises participants amenable to topical therapy of their AD, ≥ 12 years of age with AD lesions covering between 3% to 20% of the total BSA, and IGA of 2 to 3. Ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID up to 20% BSA has been well-tolerated in participants with psoriasis, AA, AD and vitiligo clinical studies with few AEs reported and no evidence of sy stemic effects. In the dose-range finding study in AD, 1.5% ruxolitinib cream BID for 8 weeks was found to be the most efficacious among investigated study arms with acceptable safety and tolerability profile (see Section 2.2.2.4.1 for more details). The maximum clinical effect with this treatment reg imen was achieved by Week 8 and did not change significantly thereafter."
29,page_29,"Incyte Corporation Page 29 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL The randomiz ed LTS period of the study will provide additional safety information when drug is used intermittently for a longer period (up to 44 weeks in total). It will also provide data about the duration of treatment effect after stopping therapy and the nature and number of disease ex acerbation (flare) episodes. 2.3.2. Justification for Selected Treatment Regimen The dose-range finding study, INCB 18424-206, investigated 6 treatment groups (ruxolitinib 0.15% cream QD, 0.5% QD, 1.5% QD, and 1.5% BID; TC 0.1% BID for 4 weeks then vehicle BI D for 4 weeks; and vehicle BID) over 8 weeks in a double-blind fashion followed by an open- label treatment with ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID for another 4 weeks. All ruxolitinib cre am treatment groups were found to be effective and statistically superior against the vehicle with a robust dose response (in mean EASI change and IGA response over baseline). By Week 8, 1.5% BID showed the highest and clearly demarcated efficacy versus other strengths with levelling of response thereafter and a prompt and most pronounced decrease on itch versus other rux olitinib cream treatment groups. Moreover, it demonstrated non-inferiority and numerically better efficacy compared with a topical mid-potent corticosteroid (TC 0.1% cream) at W eek 4. Application of ruxolitinib 0.15% cream QD, 0.5% QD, 1.5% QD, and 1.5% BID resulted in mean total trough plasma concentrations of , respective ly, after 4 weeks of treatment. These mean values are at least the approximate IC 50 for JAK1/2 inhibition in whole blood assays of with about 6% of partic ipants receiving 1.5% QD or BID exceeding (half the approximate IC 50). Trough plasma concentrations increased as dose strength and frequency of dosing were increased. All ruxolitinib cream treatment arms were well-tolerated on application sites and were found to have no notable AEs, and vital signs or physical examinations were unremarkable throughout the study. In the laboratory assessments, no changes in chemistry or leukocytes, neutrophils or ly mphocytes were observed. Minor changes in hemoglobin and plate lets were observed primarily in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID reg imen during the double-blind period, which continued in the open-label extension. These cha nges were mostly within the limits of normal, transient (platelets), and asymptomatic and were not clinically meaningful. The proposed treatment regimens of ruxolitinib cream for this study are 0.75% BID and 1.5% BID. All study active treatments demonstrated clear and well-demarcated dose responses. Although rux olitinib 0.75% cream BID was not tested, the distinctive dose responses seen allowed the projection of its efficacy level to be between 1.5% BID and 0.5% QD."

Benefit/Risk Assessment Ruxolitinib presents a low risk of cutaneous toxicity both in animals and clinical studies. Rux olitinib cream tested positive in a photoclastogenicity assay; hence, there may be a risk of skin rea ction to the combined exposure of ruxolitinib and sunlight. Ruxolitinib cream did not act as a contact sensitizer nor did it produce significant dermal irritation or demonstrate phototoxicity or photoallergenic potential. This lack of adverse cutaneous effects has been supported b y clinical studies to date, where cutaneous AEs have been infrequent and of similar frequency and severity as with vehicle control treatment. Participants should be cautioned to avoid ex cessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc). The primary clinical risks noted with orally administered ruxolitinib treatment for polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis are the potential sequelae of decreased hematopoietic proliferation sec ondary to the inhibition of growth factor pathways by JAK2 antagonism. Dose-dependent, reversible thrombocytopenia has been observed in participants with myelofibrosis, as well as anemia and less frequently neutropenia. An increased rate of infection is an additional potential risk of immunomodulation. In healthy participants and rheumatoid arthritis participants with greater bone marrow reserve, the effects on hematopoietic proliferation appear to be less pronounced. Ruxolitinib cream has of the relative systemic availability of oral trea tment, which was studied in participants with psoriasis. Owing to its low systemic bioavailability, ruxolitinib cream is not expected to bring about clinically significant changes in hematology laboratory investigations. The results of the INCB 18424-206 dose range-finding study in adults with AD are provided and discussed in more detail in Section 2.2.2.4.1. The efficacy outcomes for all treatment groups can be sum marized as follows:  IGA response and EASI50/75/90 response rates showed all ruxolitinib cream tre atment regimens to be efficacious and statistically superior to its vehicle.  Efficacy was ti me- and regimen-related, with 1.5% cream QD and 1.5% cream BID numerically greater than the other treatment groups, including the active control ( TC 0.1% c ream BID).  All ruxolitinib cream strengths continued to demonstrate improvement through W eek 8.  P romp t effect on itch was observed with all active treatment groups within 24 hours after study baseline.  The therapeutic response to 1.5% ruxolitinib cream BID plateaued after Week 8 (in IGA response and mean EASI change; note: this was the only treatment applied continuously for 12 weeks). All active treatment groups were found to have no notable AEs and were well-tolerated on application sites. They were also unremarkable for laboratory values, vital signs, or physical ex aminations."
31,page_31,"Incyte Corporation Page 31 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL While minor changes in select hematology parameters (red blood cells and platelet counts) were noted in the laboratory assessments (primarily on 1.5% cream BID regimen), they were mostly within the limits of normal range of values, transient (platelets), asymptomatic, and clinically insignificant and did not necessitate any remedial action. Based on the above information, ruxolitinib up to 1.5% cream BID can be safely used as a topical medication for AD and represents the treatment regimen with the best benefit- to-risk ratio from among those investigated. More detailed information can be found in the ruxolitinib cream IB."

Overall Design This is a randomized, VC study in adolescent and adult (≥ 12 years old) participants with AD eli gible for topical therapy. Approximately 600 participants will be randomized 2:2:1 to ruxoli tinib 0.75% cream BID, ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID, or vehicle cream. In addition, approx imately 20% of the overall study population will consist of adolescents. Participants with base line IGA score of 2 will constitute up to approximately 25% of the overall study population. Pa rticipants with AD involvement of 3% to 20% BSA and IGA score of 2 to 3 will receive blinded study treatment for 8 weeks. For participants who have met all study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, study drug assignment will be obtained. Key entry criteria for participants to be eligible for the 8-week VC treatment period is a diagnosis of AD (as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka criteria) with a dura tion of disease for at least 2 years, IGA score of 2 to 3, and a %BSA involvement of 3% to 20% (ex cluding scalp) at screening and baseline. Pa rticipants who develop additional areas of AD may treat these additional areas with approval by the investigator as long as the total treated BSA does not exceed 20%, and there are no safety conc erns regarding the additional application of study drug. Approval to treat additional areas may occur via telephone during the VC period, although the investigator, at his/her discretion, may ask the participant to return for an unscheduled visit. Through Week 8, participants should continue to treat areas identified for treatment at baseline even if the areas begin to improve. At We ek 8, the study's primary endpoint, participants will be assessed for efficacy with a percentage of participants achieving a treatment response in IGA score. Participants will also be assesse d for safety and tolerability by monitoring the frequency, duration, and severity of AEs; performing physical examinations; and collecting vital signs and clinical/laboratory assessments at var ious timepoints during the study. Participants who complete Week 8 assessments with no additional safety concerns will be offered to continue into the LTS period with the same treatment regimen, except for those initiall y on vehicle, who will be equally assigned at Week 8 to 1 of the 2 active treatment groups. At that time, the IGA score required for the participants to enter the LTS period is 0 to 4. With reg ard to %BSA, there is no required lower limit; participants may have BSA in the range of 0% to 20% . In the LTS period, participants will have study visits every 4 weeks until the end of the study (52 we eks total). At those visits, AD lesions will be evaluated by the investigator to confirm if the partic ipant still requires continuation of therapy (IGA ≥ 1) or can otherwise (re)enter th e observa tion/no treatment cycle (IGA = 0)."
35,page_35,"Incyte Corporation Page 35 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL During the LTS period (ie, after the Week 8 visit), participants will self-evaluate recurrence of AD and will treat areas of the skin with active AD changes (not to exceed 20% BSA). If lesions clea r between study visits, participants will stop treatment applications 3 days after they have disappeared. Participants will restart treatment of their AD at the first sign of recurrence. In the eve nt that new lesions are outside of the usual location and/or are more wide spread than at base line, the participant is required to contact the site for approval. Approval to treat additional are as may occur via telephone during the LTS period, although the investigator, at his/her discretion, may ask the participant to return for an unscheduled visit. This is a close reflection of the cli nical practice of managing AD in the outpatient setting. 4.2. Ov erall Study Duration Participants will be on study for a duration of up to 60 weeks (28 days screening, 8 weeks of trea tment in the VC period, 44 weeks of treatment in the LTS period, and a 30 (+ 7)-day safety follow- up; see Figure 1). The stud y will begin when the first participant (or parent or guardian) signs the ICF (and if nee ded, an assent form). The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study or discontinued study drug and have completed applicable follow-up assess ments. A partic ipant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all study visits, including the follow-up visit. The investigator will be expected to monitor for and report any SAEs and pregnancies, as detailed in S ection 9. The remaining participants are considered to be on study until a discontinua tion criterion is met and written notification is provided to the sponsor. 4.3. Study Termination The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the terms specified in the study contract. The investigator is to notify the IRB/IEC in writing of the study's completion or early termination, send a copy of the notification to the sponsor or sponsor's designee, and retain 1 copy for the site study regulatory file. The sponsor may terminate the study electively, or if required by regulatory agency. In the event of significant safety findings, the study will be terminated. If the study is terminated prematurely, the sponsor will notify the investigators, the IRBs and IECs, and regulatory bodies of the decision and reason for termination of the study."

Study Treatment Administered In this study, ruxolitinib cream or matching vehicle will be applied as a thin film BID, with a pplications at least 8 hours apart in the morning and in the evening at least 1 hour before bedti me. The strengths for ruxolitinib cream are 0.75% and 1.5% in a cream formulation and the matching vehicle cream formulation that does not contain active drug. On the f irst clinic visit day and subsequent study visits, the participant or guardian applies a thin film of stud y drug by applying small amounts of study drug until all the affected areas to be trea ted are covered. The amount of study drug used per application will be determined by weig hing a tube before and after the participant or guardian applies study drug to the affected areas. On subsequent study visit days, participants should not apply the study drug at home (morning appli cation). The first application of the day will be done at the clinic. In ge neral, the amount of study drug used per day (BID application) should not exceed one-fourth (1/4) of the 60 g tube per day. One 60 g tube should be sufficient for approximately 4 days of applications for those participants who have approximately 20% BSA of lesions on their bod y. At the baseline visit , an estimate of the %BSA to be treated will be used by the IRT system to ca lculate the number of tubes of study drug to be dispensed. All areas identified at baseline should c ontinue to be treated through the end of the VC period (Week 8) unless the participant meets cr iteria for stopping study drug. If there are new areas to be treated, including expansion of existing areas or development of new areas, after consultation with the investigator, study drug should be applied to these areas in addition to the areas treated at baseline (up to 20% BSA), and the percentage of BSA to be treated will be recalculated and increased. This new estimate will be entered into the IRT system to calculate the number of tubes of study drug to be dispensed. During the LTS period starting at the Week 8 visit, participants will have study visits every 4 weeks until the end of the study (52 weeks total). At those visits, AD lesions will be evaluated by the investigator to confirm whether the participant still requires continuation of therapy (I GA ≥ 1) or can otherwise (re)enter the observation/no treatment cycle (I GA = 0). At Week 8, a partic ipant will receive a prespecified number of tubes with study medication corresponding to a lower % BSA affected (up to 5%) or higher number of tubes corresponding to their affected %BSA (> 5%). This new estimate will be entered into the IRT system to calculate the number of tubes of study drug to be dispensed. In-between study visits, the participant will self-evaluate recurrence of AD and will treat all are as identified with active AD changes (not to exceed 20% BSA). If lesions clear between study visits, participants will stop treatment applications 3 days after they have disappeared. Participants will restart treatment of their AD at the first sign of recurrence. In the event that new lesions are outside of the usual location and/or are more widespread than at baseline, the participant is required to contact the site for approval.

Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by the study monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities. The investig ator or designee must maintain records that document:  Delivery of study drug(s) to the study site.  Inventory of study drug(s) at the site.  Participant use of the study drug(s) including tube counts from each supply dispense d.  Return of study drug(s) to the investigator or designee by participants. The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol. The investigator will a lso maintain records adequately documenting that the participants were provided the specified study drug. These records should include dates, quantities, and any available batch or seria l numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study participants. Completed accountability records will be archived by the site. The investigator or designee will be e xpected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug until verified by the study monitor (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor). At the conc lusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard operating procedures. If local procedures mandate on-site destruction of investigational supply, the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of accountability by the investigative site. At sites where the study drug is destroyed before monitor inspec tion, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatments are provided in the study materials provided to sites. 6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding All participants will be centrally assigned to study treatment using an IRT system. The system will assign in a 2:2 :1 ratio, stratified by baseline IGA (2, 3) and region (North America or other), the pa rticipant study number, track participant visits, randomize according to the defined para meters, maintain the blinding, and manage study drug inventory. Full details will be provided in the IRT Manual. Study treatment will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the SoAs (se e Table 3 and Table 4). 6 .4. Study Treatment Compliance Compliance with all study-related treatments must be emphasized to the participant by the site personnel, and appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance during the study. Compliance with ruxolitinib cream will be evaluated by participants' adherence to the application re gimen and drug accountability documented by the site staff and monitored by the sponsor/designee (tube counts)."
43,page_43,"Incyte Corporation Page 43 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL In general, the application compliance will be determined by the number of actual versus anticipated number of applications, which should be within 80% to 120% of the prescribed number of applications during the VC period, unless otherwise discussed/approved by the sponsor. P articipants will be instructed to bring all study drugs with them to the study visits in order f or site personnel to conduct tube counts to assess study drug accountability. The drug accountability documentation will be used by the sponsor to calculate treatment compliance. 6.5. Modifications to Treatment Regimen Through Week 8, participants should continue to treat areas identified for treatment at baseline even if the area begins to improve. Participants who develop new AD lesions during the course of the study may treat these additional areas, with approval by the investigator, as long as the total treated BSA does not exceed 20% and there are no safety concerns. Approval to treat additional areas may occur via telephone during the VC period, although the investigator may reque st to have the participant come in to have an unscheduled visit, if needed. After Week 8, for participants enrolled in the LTS period, only areas with active disease should be treated. Once the lesions are cleared, participants should continue to apply study drug for an additional 3 days on the areas of the body where lesions were last present before discontinuing the treatment. In the event that the new lesions are significantly more extensive than from the previous visit, the participant should call the study site to discuss with the investigator whether addit ional evaluation at the clinic is required. 6.5.1. Criteria and Procedures for Application Interruptions of Study Drug S afety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine whether the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment with ruxolitinib cream. Except in cases of emergency, it is recommended that any findings of concern (eg, AE) be confirmed and that the investigator consult with the sponsor medical monitor (or other representative of the sponsor) before interrupting study drug. Additionally, the investigator must obtain approval from the sponsor before restarting study drug. Participants who experience a recurrence of the initial AEs upon restarting the study drug may need the study drug to be permanently discontinued. Instructions for application interruptions for ruxolitinib cream are outlined in Table 7. Individual decisi ons regarding interruptions should be made using clinical judgment in consultation with the medical monitor (whenever possible), taking into account relatedness of the AE to the study treatment and the participant's underlying condition."

Discontinuation of Study Treatment 7.1.1. Reasons for Discontinuation P articipants must be discontinued from study treatment for the following reasons:  Due to lack of efficacy response during the LTS (defined as no change/improvement in either %BSA or IGA when treated continuously for 8 weeks).  The participant becomes pregnant.  Consent is withdrawn. N ote: Consent withdrawn means that the participant has explicitly indicated that they do not want t o be followed any longer; in this case no further data, except data in public domain, may be solicited from or collected on the participant. Participants may choose to discontinue study treatment and remain in the study to be followed for progression and survival.  Further participation would be injurious to the participant's health or well-being, in the inve stigator's medical judgment.  Any adverse event of unacceptable severity as noted in Section 6.5.2.  The study is terminated by the sponsor.  The study is terminated by the local health authority, IRB, or IEC. A participant may be discontinued from study treatment as follows:  If, at 2 consecutive study visits, a participant' s dru g usage exceeds one 60 g tube pe r 4 days. The medical monitor should be consulted for instruction on handling the partic ipant.  If, during the course of the study, a participant is found not to have met eligibility c riteria, the medical monitor, in collaboration with the investigator, will determine whether the participant should be withdrawn from study treatment.  If a participant is noncompliant with study procedures or study drug/treatment administration in the investigator's opinion, the medical monitor should be consulted for inst ruction on handling the participant. 7.1.2. Discontinuation Procedures I n the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study treatment, the EOT visit should be conducted. Reasonable efforts should be made to have the participant return for a follow-up visit. The last date of the last dose of study drug(s)/treatment and the reason for discontinuation of study treatment will be recorded in the eCRF."
48,page_48,"Incyte Corporation Page 48 of 88 Protocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL If a participant is discontinued from study treatment:  The study monitor or sponsor must be notified.  The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the participant's medical record a nd the primary reason for withdrawal must be included in the eCRF.  The EOT visit should be performed.  The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the eCRF.  Participants must be followed for safety until the time of the follow-up visit or until stud y drug/treatment–related AEs resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irre versible, whichever is longest. If the participant discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of follow-up data (safety follow-up), then no additional data collection should occur; however, partic ipants will have the option of withdrawing consent for study treatment but continuing in the follow-up period of the study for safety assessments. 7.2. Participant Withdrawal From the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations should conform to the requirements of the ET/EOT visit (see Table 3 and Table 4). 7.3. Lo st to Follow-Up A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon a s possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make reasonable effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if unsuccessful, a certified letter to the participant's last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant's medical record.  Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn f rom the study."

Screening Procedures S creening is the interval between signing the ICF/assent and the day the participant is enrolled in the study (Day 1). Informed consent (or assent) must be obtained before performing any study -specific procedures. Screening may not exceed 28 days. Assessments that are required to demons trate eligibility may be performed over the course of 1 or more days during the screening proce ss. Procedures conducted as part of the participant's routine clinical management by their healthcare provider (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of informed consent/assent may be used for sc reening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the Protocol-defined criteria and has been performed in the timeframe of the study (ie, within 28 days of Day 1). For participants who are enrolled in the study, information associated with eligibility requirements must be entered into the appropriate eCRF pages. Results from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed to confirm eligibility before enrollment or the administration of study drug. Tests with results that fail eligibility requirements may be repeated once during screening if the investigator believes the results to be in error. For screening assessments that are repeated, the most recent available result before randomization/treatment assignment will be used to determine eligibility. See Section 5.4 for information regarding screen failures and the rescreening procedure for partic ipants. 8.1.3. Interactive Response Technology Procedure Ea ch participant will be identified in the study by a participant ID number, which is a combination of the site ID and participant number. Site staff should contact the IRT system to obtain the participant ID number during screening. Upon determining that the participant is eligible for study entry, the IRT system will be contacted to obtain the study medication kit assi gnment. Additionally, the IRT sy stem will be contacted at each regular study visit during both t he VC period and the LTS period to update the study drug supply.

Investigator's Global Assessment The IGA is an overall eczema severity rating on a 0 to 4 scale that will be assessed during site visits. The g rades for the IGA are shown in Table 8. Tab le 8: Investigator's Global Assessment Grade Severity Status 0 Clear No erythema or induration/papulation, no oozing/crusting; there may be minor residual discoloration . 1 Almost clear There may be trace faint pink eryth ema, with almost no induration/papulation, and no oozing/crusting . 2 Mild There may be faint pink erythema, with mild induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting . 3 Moderate There may be pink -red erythema with moderate induration/papulation and there may be some oozing/crusting . 4 Severe There may be deep or bright red erythema with severe induration/papulation and with oozing/crusting . Source: www.homeforeczema.org. The IGA- TS is defined as an IGA score of 0 or 1 with ≥ 2 grade improvement from baseline. 8.2.2. Eczema Area and Severity Index Score Atopic de rmatitis will be assessed as outlined in the SoA (see Table 3) using EASI scoring sy stem (refer to Study Manual), which is a validated disease measurement for clinical studies (Hanifin et al 2001) that examines 4 areas of the body and weights them for participants of at least 8 years of age. Each of the 4 body regions is assessed separately for erythema (E), induration/papulation/edema (I), excoriations (Ex), and lichenification (l) for an average degree of severity of each sign in each region. The severity strata for the EASI are as follows: 0 = clear; 0.1 to 1.0 = almost clear; 1.1 to 7.0 = mild; 7.1 to 21.0 = moderate; 21.1 to 50.0 = severe; 50.1 to 72.0 = very severe (Le shem et al 2015 )."

SCORing Atopic Dermatitis S CORAD is a tool to assess the extent and severity (ie, intensity) of eczema and will be compl eted before, during, and after treatment has begun to determine whether the treatment has bee n effective ( Oakley 2009 ) . This will be performed during all VC study visits (see Table 3), starti ng at baseline.  To determine extent, the rule of 9 or handprint method is used to calculate the eczema a ffected area (A) as a percentage of the whole body. Scores are added up to give a possible ma ximum of 100%.  To determine intensity, a representative area of eczema is selected (see below for targe t lesion). The intensity of each of the following signs of redness, swelling, oozing /crusting, scratch marks, skin thickening (lichenification), dryness (this is assesse d in an area where there is no inflammation) is assessed as follows:  None (0)  Mild (1)  Moderate (2)  Severe (3) Intensity scores are added together to give “B” (maximum score of 18).  Subjective symptoms, that is, itch and sleeplessness, are scored by the participant using a visual analogue scale where “0” is no itch (or no sleeplessness) and “10” is the worst im aginable itch (or sleeplessness). These scores are added to give “C” (maximum score of 20). Total scor e gives approximate weights of 60% to intensity and 20% each to extent and subjective signs (ie, insomnia, etc) for the participan t and will be calculated as follows : A/5 + 7B/2 + C. 8.2.4. Target Lesion Assessment At ba seline, a lesion that is representative of the participant's overall disease and is to be treated with stud y drug will be selected as the target lesion. This lesion will be identified, measured, and documente d in the participant's medical record at each subsequent visit during the VC period (see Table 3). A note should be made in the ir medical record, and baseline photographs can be marke d with the location of the target lesion. The target lesion should not be on the hands, feet, or genit alia. The target lesion should have an area of approximately 10 cm2 or more in size. The longe st diameter and the measurement perpendicular to the longest diameter will be measured in millimeters."

Body surface area assessment will be approximated to the nea rest 0.1% using the Palmar Method as guides, the palm plus 5 digits, with fingers tucked toge ther and thumb tucked to the side (handprint), as 1% BSA and the thumb as 0.1% BSA. 8.2.6. Photography At se lected sites, for each visit with photography (baseline and Weeks 2, 4, and 8), photography of the tar get lesion will be conducted via 2 views (close-up and regional body area). Ad ho c photogra phy of skin-related AEs is recommended at selected sites to provide additional photographic documentation. 8.2.7. Patient-Reported Outcomes Qua lity of life (QoL) will be assessed (see SoAs Table 3 and Table 4) using the following tools: DQLI , PGIC, POEM, EQ-5D-5L, WPAI:SHP, Itch NRS, Skin Pain NRS, PROMIS Short Form – Sleep-Related Impairment (8a), and PROMIS Short Form – Sleep Disturbance (8b). In o rder to avoid bias in the participants' responses to the questionnaires, all these assessments should be c ompleted before any other evaluations or study procedures on the day of the study visit and prior to discussions with the investigator or study site staff. At the baseline visit, all patient-reported outcomes must be completed before the participant' s first s tudy drug application. Participants will be issued a paper questionnaire or hand-held device (eDiary) for daily assessments. The participant will be instructed to complete the diary during specific timepoints nee ded for each assessment beginning on the day of screening through Week 8 or treatment discontinuation. Detailed directions for the administration of an eDiary will be provided in the Stud y Manual. Daily assessments will be performed by participants via a diary starting at the screening visit and a ll visits during the VC period:  The participant will rate (during the past 24 hours) the following:  Itch NRS – the worst level of itch will be recorded in the evening.  Skin Pain NRS – the worst level of pain will be recorded in the evening.  PR OMIS questionnaires:  Short Form – Sleep-Related Impairment (8a) will be completed in the eve ning.  Short F orm – Sleep-Disturbance (8b) will be assessed in the morning.

Patient Global Impression of Change The PGIC is a participants' self-reporting measure that reflects their belief about the efficacy of treatment. The PGIC is a 7-point scale depicting a participant's rating of overall improvement and will be captured during site visits during the VC period ( Hurst and Bolton 2004 ). The pa rticipant will answer the following: ""Since the start of the treatment you've received in this study, your atopic dermatitis in areas treated with the study drug is: (1) very much improved, (2) much improved, (3) minimally improved, (4) no change, (5) minimally worse, (6) much worse, and (7) very much worse."" 8.2.7.3. Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM is a 7-question quality-of-life assessment that asks how many days the participant has be en bothered by various aspects of their skin condition during the past 7 days obtained as outlined in the SoAs (se e Table 3 and Table 4; Charman et al 2004 ). 8.2.7.4. EQ-5D-5L The EQ-5D is a validated, self-administered, generic utility questionnaire wherein participants (adolescents and adults) rate their current health state based on the following criteria (dimensions): mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The 5L indicates that for each dimension, there are 5 levels, which are as follows: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. During all VC period study visits (starting at screening ) and at specific LTS visits (Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, and follow-up visit), the participant will be asked to indicate his/her health state over the past 7 days, by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dime nsions.

PROMIS Short Form – Sleep-Related Impairment (8a) The P ROMIS Short Form – Sleep-Related Impairment (8a) questionnaire, is to be completed in the eve ning during the VC period. This assessment focuses on self-reported perceptions of aler tness, sleepiness, and tiredness during usual waking hours and the perceived functional impa irments during wakefulness associated with sleep problems or impaired alertness (Buysse et al 2010 ). The que stionnaire has 8 simple questions with a 5-point scale with a range in score from 8 to 40, with hig her scores indicating greater severity of sleep-related impairment. Each item asks the participant to rate the severity of the participant's sleep impairment. The recall period will be the past 24 hours for the VC period and the past 7 days for the LTS period. 8.2.7.8.2. P ROMIS Short Form – Sleep Disturbance (8b) The P ROMIS Short Form – Sleep Disturbance ( 8b) questionnaire is to be completed in the morning durin g the VC period. This assessment is self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep de pth, and restoration associated with sleep. Sleep disturbance does not focus on s ymptoms of specific sleep disorders and does not provide subjective estimates of sleep quanti ties (eg, total amount of sleep, time to fall asleep, amount of wakefulness during sleep; Buysse et al 2010 ). The sleep disturbance short form is generic rather than disease-specific. The que stionnaire is also 5-point scale with a range in score from 8 to 40, with higher scores indica ting greater severity of sleep disturbance.

Adverse Events Adve rse events will be monitored from the time the participant signs the ICF/assent until at least 30 (+ 7) days after the last dose of study drug. Adverse events that begin or worsen after infor med consent /assent should be recorded on the Adverse Events Form in the eCRF regardless of the assumption of a causal relationship with the study drug. Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent/assent should be recorded on the Medical History Form in the eCRF. Adverse events (including laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than by individual underlying signs and symptoms. Adverse events will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative). The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following-up on AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment/procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study drug. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant, such as ""How are you fee ling?"" is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. Adverse events may also be detec ted when they are volunteered by the participant during the screening process or between visits, or through physical examinations, laboratory tests, or other assessments. The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs are described in Section 9. All SAE s will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3). 8.3.2. Physical Examinations At the screening visit and at Weeks 8 and 52/EOT, a comprehensive physical examination should be conducted. The comprehensive physical examination will include assessment(s) of the following or gan or body systems: skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities; and lymph nodes; as well as a brief neurological examination. During the study, participants will be assessed by the investigator or medically qualified designee per institutional standard of care. These assessments should be an evaluation as indic ated by participant symptoms, AEs, or other findings and documented on the AE eCRF. Physical examinations will be conducted at the timepoints listed in Table 3 and Table 4."

Vital Sign s Vital sign measurements (to be taken before blood collection for laboratory tests), include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the participant in the sitting position after 5 minutes of rest. Height and weight will also be assesse d at screening, Weeks 8, 24 and 52/EOT. Abnormal vital sign results identified after the first dos e of study treatment constitute an AE if they are considered clinically meaningful, induce cli nical signs or symptoms, or require concomitant therapy. 8.3.4. Electrocardiograms A s ingle 12-lead ECG will be obtained at screening (12-lead ECG performed within 2 months befor e baseline is acceptable ) usin g an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. All 12-lead ECGs will be performed with the participant in a recumbent or semirecumbent position after 5 minutes of rest. The de cision to include or exclude a participant or withdraw a participant from the study treatment based on an ECG flagged as ""Abnormal, Clinically Significant"" is the responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor's medical monitor, as appropriate. Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs. 8.3.5. Laboratory Assessments S ee Table 9 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoAs (see Table 3 and Table 4) for the timing and frequency. A central laboratory will perform all clinical labora tory assessments for safety (ie, blood chemistries, hematology assessments, coagulation tests, endocrine function, and urinalysis), and will store the samples for PK and PD. Additional testing may be required by the sponsor based on emerging safety data. All Protocol-required laboratory assessments must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoAs (see Table 3 and Table 4). Information regarding collection, processing, and shipping of labora tory assessments is provided in the Laboratory Manual. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those that are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study, or within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer consi dered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. See Section 9.1 for information regarding laboratory abnormalities that should be recorded as an AE in t he eCRF."

Urine pregnancy tests will be pe rformed locally, as outlined in the SoAs (see Table 3 and Table 4), and as medica lly indicated (eg, in case of loss of menstrual cycle, when pregnancy is suspected). If a urine pregnancy test is positive, the results must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test. If the serum pregnancy test is negative after a urine test was positive, the investigator will assess the potential benefit/risk to the participant and determine whether it is in the participant's best interest to resume study drug/treatment and continue participation in the study. If a pregnancy is confirmed by a serum pregnancy test, see Section 9.6 for reporting require ments. 8.3.5.2. Serology HIV assessments will be performed at the screening visit to rule out HIV infection; required analytes are shown in Table 9. Serology and virology tests should be performed early in the scre ening process due to the length of time needed to obtain the results. Additional tests may be performed if clinically indicated."

Safety Follow-Up The safety follow-up period is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up visit, which should occ ur 30 (+ 7) days after the EOT visit (or after the last dose of study drug/t reatment if the EOT visit was not performed. Adverse events and SAEs must be reported up until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug/treatment, the date of the follow-up visit, or until toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are dee med irreversible, whichever is longer. Reasonable efforts should be made to have the participant return for the follow-up visit and report any AEs that may occur during this period. 9. ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, EVALUATING, FOLLOW-UP, AND REPORTING 9.1. Definition of Adverse Event Adverse Event Definitio n  An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug -related.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study treatment. Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  Any safety assessments (eg, ECG, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease).  Abnormal laboratory test results constitute an AE if they are considered clinically meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require co ncomitant therapy, or require changes in study drug. Whenever possible, a diagnosis (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia) should be recorded in the eCRF rather than the abnormal lab result (eg, low hemoglobin, platelet count decreased).  Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though they may have been present before the start of the st udy.  Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action "" per se will not be reported as an AE or SA E. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an AE or SAE."
65,page_65,"Incyte Corporation Page 65 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL Events NOT Meeting th e Adverse Event Definition  Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant 's condition.  The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant 's condition or considered to be treatment -related by the investigator.  Efficacy endpoints as outlined in Section 2 will not be reported as AE/SAEs, specifically, any event that is related to disease progression. Unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data will be m onitored to ensure the safety of the participant s in the study. Any suspected endpoint that upon review is not progression of the disease under study will be forwarded to Incyte Pharmacovigilance as a SAE within 24 hours of determination that the event is not progression of the disease under study.  Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE if it occurred after signing informed consent /assent . If present before entering the study, the condition should be captured as medical history.  Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital).  Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 9.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death b. Is life -threatening The term 'life-threatening ' in the definition of 'serious ' refers to an adve rse drug experience that places the participant, in the opinion of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. This does not include an adverse drug experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death . c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergenc y ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician 's office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other seriou s criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether ""hospitalization "" occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE."
66,page_66,"Incyte Corporation Page 66 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively mino r medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), that may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a con genital anomaly/birth defect f. Other situations (Important Medical Event) An event that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the even t may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers (excluding the disease[s] under study in oncolog y protocols), intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 9.3. Recording and Follow-Up of Adverse Events and/or Serious Adverse Events Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording  An AE/SAE that begins or worsens after informed consent /assent is signed should be recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the eCRF. Conditions that were present at the time informed consent /assent was given should be recorded on the Medical History Form in the eCRF.  When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnos tics reports) related to the event.  The investigator (or delegate) will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant 's medical records in lieu of completing the AE eCRF page.  There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submis sion.  The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. When a clear dia gnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE/SAE. To the extent possible, each AE/SAE should be evaluated to determine:  The severity grade (CTCAE v4.03 Grade 1 to 5). See below for further instructions on the asses sment of intensity.  Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study treatment: suspected (yes) or not suspected (no). See below for further instructions on the assessment of causality.  The start and end dates, unles s unresolved at final follow -up.  The action taken with regard to study drug as a result of the AE/SAE(s).  The event outcome (eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown)."
67,page_67,"Incyte Corporation Page 67 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL  The se riousness, as per the SAE definition provided in Section 9.2.  The action taken with regard to the event. Note: If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or nondrug therapy, this action should be recorde d on Adverse Event Form and the treatment should be specified on the appropriate eCRF (eg, Prior/Concomitant Medications, Procedures and Non -Drug Therapy). Assessment of Intensity The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v4.03 Grades 1 through 5. If an event is not classified by CTCAE, the severity of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to estimate the grade of severity: The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign i t to 1 of the following categories:  Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; treatment not indicated.  Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive treatment indicated; limiting age appropriate activitie s of daily living.  Grade 3: Severe or medical significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living.  Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences ; urgent treatment indicated.  Grade 5: Fatal. Assessment of Causality  The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than that a relationship cannot be ruled out.  The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  The investigator will also consult the RSI in the IB and /or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration, will be considered and investigated.  For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  With regard to assessing causality of SAEs:  There may be situations in wh ich an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Therefore, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE.  The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a follow -up SAE report with the updated causality assessment."
68,page_68,"Incyte Corporation Page 68 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor to eluc idate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  If a participant dies during par ticipation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the investigator will provide the sponsor with a copy of any postmortem findings including histopathology.  New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.  Any updated SAE data will be submitted to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of receipt of the information.  Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it has resolved or until it is judged to be permanent; assessment should be made at each visi t (or more frequently if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat the event, and the outcome.  When the severity of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between v isits), each change in severity will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves. 9.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug or study procedure[s]), occurring after the participant has signed the ICF/assent through the last study visit or 30 (+ 7) days after the last dose of study drug, whichever occurs later, must be reported to the sponsor (or de signee) within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE information after conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must notify the sponsor (or de signee) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3). Prompt not ification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. If the SAE is not documented in the ruxolitinib cream IB for the study drug (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the sponsor's study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently require further information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities. The sponsor or its designee may need to issue an Investigator Notification to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC, or as per national regulatory requirements in parti cipating countries."
69,page_69,"Incyte Corporation Page 69 of 88 Pr otocol INCB 18424-303 Am 2 Version 2 13 FEB 2019 CONFIDENTIAL The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (eg summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator's Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  Information about all SAEs i s collected and recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the eCRF.  The investigator must also complete the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English. Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  Facsimi le or email transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form is the preferred method to transmit this information to the PhV/designee (eg, C3i/Telerx). The contact information of the sponsor 's study -specific representatives is listed in the investiga tor manual provided to each site. The original copy of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form and the confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  Follow -up information is recorded on an amended or new Serious Adverse Event Report Form, with an indic ation that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original report. The follow -up report should include information that was not provided on the previous Serious Adverse Event Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, r esolved or ongoing), treatment provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or discontinued), or participant disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation). Each recurrence, complication, or p rogression of the original event should be reported as follow -up to that event, regardless of when it occurs.  In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile or computer equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a copy of the Incyte Ser ious Adverse Event Report Form sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the Serious Adverse Event Report Form within the designated reporting time fra mes.  Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Study Manual. 9.5. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment In a medical emergency during the study, if the investigator deems it necessary to determine optimal medic al management of the participant, emergency unblinding will be performed ex clusively by the Principal Investigator and subinvestigator as described in the IRT Study Manua l. The IRT system has an option to select for ""Emergency Code Break"" action for a given partic ipant. After entering the 6-digit study drug tube number and verification of the unmasking information, the investigator/subinvestigator will proceed to either final confirmation or cancellation of the code break procedure."

If a n investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or participant is unblinded, the participant must be withdrawn from the study treatment, unless there are ethical reasons to have the participant remain on the study treatment. In these cases, the investigator must obtain specific approval from the sponsor's (or its designee's) medical monitor for the participant to continue in the study. 9.6. Pregnancy Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method. When a pregnancy has been confirmed in a participant during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, the following procedures should be followed in order to ensure safety:  The study drug must be discontinued immediately.  The investigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form to t he sponsor or its designee within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. Data on f etal outcome are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation. Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following until the first well-baby visit. Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee. Pregnancy follow-up information should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal relationship to the sponsor's study drug to any pregnancy outcome, as well as follow-up to the first well-baby visit or the dura tion specified in local regulations, whichever is later. Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. Any SAE occurring during pregnancy of a study participant must be recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form and submitted to the sponsor or designee. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, or ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs (if occurring in the study participant) and must be reported as described in Section 9.4. If an abnormal pregnancy outcome is reported in a study participant's partner, the event should be reported to the sponsor on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. 9.7. Warnings and Precautions Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by the sponsor or its designee, are presented in the IB. Additional safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator Notifications. Any important new safety information should be discussed with the participant during the study, as necessary. If new significant risks are identified, they will be added to the ICF/assent.

Product Complaints The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate process and product improvements. All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the sponsor or its designee will be reported to the sponsor. All product complaints associated with other study material will be reported directly to the respective manufacturer. The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the product complaint via email or other written communication to the sponsor contact or respective manufacturer as noted in the packaging information. Any AE associated with a product complaint should be recorded as described in Section 9.3 . If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the product complaint communication with the product. 10. STATISTICS 10.1. Sample Size Determination Approximately 600 participants will be randomized 2:2:1 to ruxolitinib 0.75% BID, 1.5% BID, or vehicle and stratified by baseline IGA (2, 3) and region (North America or other). The sample size calculation is based on the Fisher exact test for the statistical comparison on the primary efficacy endpoint. The Fisher exact test is used to provide a conservative evaluation of statistical power, a nd it is accurate when there is a small expected number of responders in the vehicle group. Based on the results from a Phase 2, randomized, dose-ranging study (INCB 18424-206), the IGA-TS at Week 8 is assumed to be 45% and 30% for active arms (1.5% BID and 0.75% BI D, respectively) versus 10% for placebo. Using a 2-sided alpha of 0.025, the sample size will have > 95% power to detect a difference between each of the 2 active treatment groups versus vehicle. In addition to provide adequate power for efficacy variables, the sample size is determined to provide an adequate database for safety evaluation. 10.2. Populations for Analysis Table 10 presents the populations for analysis."

PP The PP population includes randomized participants who are considered to be sufficiently compliant with the Protocol. Safety The safety population includes all participants who applied at least 1 dose of study drug. Treatment groups for this population will be determined according to the actual treatment the participant received on Day 1. LTS evaluable The LTS evaluable population includes all participants who applied at least 1 dose of ruxolitinib 0.75% or 1.5 % cream during the LTS pe riod. All analyses for the LTS period will be conducted with the LTS evaluable population. PK/ pharmacodynamic evaluable The PK/pharmacodynamic evaluable population includes participants who applied at least 1 dose of ruxolitinib cream and provided at le ast 1 postdose blood sample for PK. The study pharmacokineticist will review data listings of participant administration and sample records to identify participants to be excluded from the analysis. 10.3. Type I Error Control A graphical procedure with gatekeeping testing strategy for the primary and key secondary analyses will be implemented. The underlying procedure is derived using the methodology developed in Bretz et al ( 2009 ). This method will guarantee a strong control of the family-wise err or rate. Two families of 8 elementary hypotheses tests are grouped according to treatment comparison between each active dose group to vehicle, where  Family 1 (1.5% BID vs vehicle):  H11: pr oportion of participants who achieve IGA-TS;  H12: proportion of participants who achieve EASI-75;  H13: proportion of participants with a ≥ 4-grade improvement in Itch NRS over baseline;  H14: proportion of participants with a clinically meaningful improvement in the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance score.  F amily 2 (0.75% BID vs vehicle):  H21: proportion of participants who achieve IGA-TS;  H22: proportion of participants who achieve EASI-75;  H23: proportion of participants with a ≥ 4-grade improvement in Itch NRS over baseline;  H24: proportion of participants with a clinically meaningful improvement in the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance score."

In addition, a tipping point ana lysis will be conducted to examine the potential effects of missing data. Subgroup analysis by baseline characteristic ( eg, IGA, region, and age) will be performed. Details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 10.4.2. S econdary Analysis Secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted in the ITT population. If the primary objective is achieved, the statistical comparisons for key secondary endpoints will be tested with the procedures specified in Figure 4. The endpoints will be analyzed using the similar method as spec ified in the primary analysis. All other secondary and exploratory efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For categorical measurements, summary statistics will include sample size, frequency, and percentages. Similar logistic regression models as specified in the primary and key secondary analysis will be used if applicable. For continuous measurements, summary statistics will include sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, minimum, and maximum. Continuous efficacy endpoints, including the actual measurement, change from baseline, and percentage change from baseline may also be analyzed by the mixed-effect model with repeat measurement. 10.4.3. Safety Analyses A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug. Analysis of AEs will be limited to TEAEs, but data listings will include all AEs regardless of their timing to study drug administration. Adverse events will be tabulated by the MedDRA preferred term and system organ class. Severity of AEs will be based on the National Cancer Institute CTCAE v4.03 using Grades 1 through 5. The subset of AEs considered by the investigator to have a relationship to study drug will be considered to be treatment-related AEs. If the investigator does not specify the relationship of the AE to study drug, then the AE will be considered treatment-related. The incidence of AEs and treatment-related AEs will be tabulated. The clinical laboratory data will be analyzed using summary statistics; no formal treatment group comparisons are planned. Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal ranges for the clinical reference laboratory. The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and shift tables relative to baseline will be tabulated. Desc riptive statistics and mean change from baseline will be determined for vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature) at each assessment time."

INFORMATION REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS For male participants in the study: Male participants should use a condom from screening through 90 days after the end of systemic exposure. If the male participant has a partner that is of chi ld-bearing potential, the partner should also use contraception through 90 days after the end of relevant systemic exposure. In addition, male participants must refrain from donating sperm from screening through 90 days after the end of relevant systemic exposure. Males who have had a vasectomy qualify as having met the requirement for a highly effective birth control method. For female participants in the study: Precautions to avoid pregnancy should be followed until the end of safety follow -up period (30 [+7] days after EOT) . The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods:  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  oral  intravaginal  transdermal  Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  oral  injectable  implantablea  Intrauterine devicea  Intrauterine hormone -releasing systema  Bilateral tubal occlusiona  Vasect omized partnerab  Sexual abstinencec a Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user dependency. b Vasectomized partner is a highly effective method of avoiding pregnancy provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential study participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. c In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
