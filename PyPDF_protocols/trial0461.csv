BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 5.1. H IGH COSTS H alf to two - thirds of healthcare costs in Canada and the U.S. are incurred by 5% of the population . 1 - 7 As an example, the average annual healthcare cost for Ontario residents in 2009 – 10 was approximately $3,600, while costs for the top 5% of users averaged $44,300. 8 Medical appointments may be relatively brief 9 and care can occur in multiple settings and through different health care providers . In this context, the management of complex patients may result in less than optimal care and patient experiences. Stra tegies to improve the care of these patients are needed. 5.2. O UR STUDY The intent of this study is to  focus on patient managed in the community with chronically elevated costs, reflecting complexity and persistent unmet needs. 7,10,11"
7,page_7,"7 | P a g e  focus on primary health care , which is longitudinal and relationship based 12 as an ideal setting to improve the care of persistently complex patients living in the community. 5.3. T HE IHI MODEL Improving patient care involves changing the way care is provided. We propose to address these challenges using Quality Improvement (QI) Collaboratives that build on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Breakthrough model. 13 The IHI model has four steps: (1) bringing together practices committed to QI to identify a care gap that they agree to be a priority; (2) en gaging content experts and developing a learning information package that highlights the importance of the care gap and the opportunities for change; (3) conducting a learning session during which the practices learn about the challenges and select the cha nge(s) best suited for their context; and (4) implementing the selected changes with ongoing Plan - Do - Study - Act (PDSA) cycles and regular communication. C omplex high cost patients are heterogeneous in their healthcare trajectory ; o nly 15% of individuals i ncurring costs in the top 5% will remain in that category for three consecutive years . 7 Many have transient elevated costs related to end - of - life care . 14,15 Others, such as accident victims and transplant recipients, have an acute event requiring intensive resources for a limited time . 14 These groups represent different population segments and require approaches that focus on targeted needs. A member of our team (SD) led the development and validation of an algorithm to allow community - dwelling individuals aged 65 years and older with “chronically complex needs” to be readily identified by their practice. Patients with chronically complex nee ds were defined as being at the top quartile of costs for three or more consecutive years. The study was population based and used Ontario health care data housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Studies (ICES). The number of prescription medicati ons proved to be the most reliable index of"
8,page_8,"8 | P a g e persistent complexity . 16 The study showed a nearly linear relationship between number of medications and the likelihood of being identified as having “chronically complex needs”. Establishing a cut - off of 10 or more medication for individuals 65 yea rs of age and older would allow care providers to identify 23% of that population; virtually all (95.3%) of those identified in practice using this method fall into the “chronically complex needs” category. This is excellent specificity and would allow app ropriate care to be directed to a primary care practice population based on overall complexity and costs rather than through targeting single health conditions. 5.4. P OLYPHARMACY IS IN IT SELF A PROBLEM While the relationship between a high number of prescribed medications and persistent complexity is not necessarily causal, polypharmacy itself is problematic. Polypharmacy in the elderly contributes to an elevated risk of adverse drug reactions, 17 falls , 18 drug - dis ease interactions 19 , and drug interactions 20 and contributes to frailty and negative outcomes . 21 P olypharmacy also increases hea lthcare, drug, and hospitalization costs. 22 - 24 While many medications that are beneficial and clinically indicated, some are unnecessary or can cause harm; these are termed Potentially Inappropriate Prescriptions (PIPs). The qualifier “potentially” is included to reflect the fact that the medication itself is not necessarily harmful to all patients, but can be under specific conditions or in prolonged usage. The Canadian Deprescribing Network (CaDeN) 25 and Choosing Wisely Canada 26 have identified the following classes as targets for decreased prescribing: proton pump inhibitors (PPI nhs), sedative - hypnotics, medication associated with hypoglycemia in elders, and antipsychotics in elders . Some PIPs may be appropriate during periods of time but continue to be prescribed because of clinical inertia. 27 For example PPInhs are often prescribed beyond the recommended short courses of treatment, with no defined benefit to patients and a t significant cost and potential for harm (pneumonia, hip fractures, diarrhea), especially in elders. 28,29 Other medications are contra - indicated; these include benzodiazepines and other sedative - hypnotics, which increase the risk of falls, confusion, and hospital admissions, 30,31 and antipsychotics, which increase the risk of stroke and mortality in elders. 32,33 Such medications need to be dis continued or “deprescribed . ” Deprescribing is gaining increasing importance in the management of complex patients: s everal trials and systematic reviews have shown that structured deprescribing is a promising approach to reducing PIPs, including PPInh s and benzodiazepines. 34 35 - 37 R eview s have also reported some reductions in mortality 38 and improvement in quality of life . 39 Deprescribing is a complex process that requires a multi - pronged approach. 30,35,40,41 Evidence based guidelines and tools are available. 28,42 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that an interprofessional approach, including evaluation by a pharmacist, ha s improved the appropriateness of medications. 43,44 The use of benzodiazepines in elders has been reduced through direct education. 35 P atient involvement in a shared decision - making process is essential 40 and is likely to enhance the impact on survival . 38 Communication between clinicians and patients"
9,page_9,"9 | P a g e should evolve from discussions about compliance to dialogues focusing on en suring that risks and benefit are appropriately communicated and that the patient’s decisions are aligned with their care goals . 45,46 Involving a pharmacist in the process improves effectiveness and increases patient empowerment and understanding. 47 Appropriately informed c ommunity - dwelling seniors in Canada have expressed a preference for reducin g the number of medications they take. 48 Finally, e nsuring appropriate communication with other prescribers will be important to ensure that patients do not get confusing or contradictory messages about their medications from differen t providers. 48 We have therefore chosen to focus our efforts on the four classes of medications discussed above for elders with polypha rmacy. They have been targeted as being appropriate for deprescribing discussions and evidence - based tools and guidelines on deprescribing have been published. Thus, evidence exists on “what to deprescribe” and “how to deprescribe”. 5.5. SPIDER We will enhan ce the Collaboratives through the use of validated EMR data provided by a national organization, the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) 49 and by leveraging collaborations between primary care QI programs and Practice Based Research Networks (PBRNs) 50 in each region. QI programs will oversee QI activities and PBRNs will manage the analyses. The S tructured P rocess I nformed by D ata, E vidence and R esearch ( SPIDER ) will help primary care practices to optimize the ir management of patients with complex needs by combining a number of proven methods and leveraging existing QI capacity, partnerships in primary care and EMR evaluation capacity. We will apply SPIDER to address polypharmacy . 6. OBJECTIVES The main objective of the study is to assess the impact of SPIDER compared to usual care in reducing PIPs prescribed to patients aged 65 and older on ten or more medications Secondary objectives include measuring the impact of SPIDER on patient health - related quality of life, on costs and on provider satisfaction. 7. TRIAL DESIGN There are two phases to SPIDER: 1. Feasibility 2. Cluster randomized trial The feasibility of SPIDER will be studied in three regions (Toronto, Edmonton, Montreal) using a single arm, prospective, explana tory mixed method approach."
10,page_10,"10 | P a g e We will then apply what we learn from the first phase to a pragmatic cluster RCT 51 with two parallel arms (usual care control, intervention) stratified by region and involving five regional networks (Winnipeg, Halifax, Calgary, Ottawa, Montreal). By pragmatic, we mean effec tiveness in usual practice with broad criteria for eligibility to reflect usual care. 52, 53 The pragmatic design (minimal patient selection criteria, use of existing primary care practices, and tailoring of th e intervention to the setting) enhances generalizability to other patients in diverse primary care practices. As such, the study will investigate the “real world” impact of the intervention. That is to say, generalizability will be enhanced by tailoring th e intervention to the variable circumstances in the practices 53,54 . The clusters that will be randomized will be practices where several physicians may be co - located; this will avoid contamination where two physicians practicing in the same location are randomized to different arms. Each practice will have at least one phy sician participating. Patient - level data will be analyzed. The trial will be reported using the CONSORT guidelines. 55,56 A senior statistician at the Department of Family Medicine, University of Toronto, will generate the allocation sequence. Randomization will be stratified by region. The allocation ratio will be 1 to 1. Analysis of covariance will be used to control for baseline imbalance . We will test for superiority of the SPI DER approach compared with usual care."
11,page_11,"11 | P a g e METHODS: STUDY SETTI NGS, PARTICIPANTS AN D OUTCOMES 8. STUDY SETTINGS Seven Canadian regional networks across five provinces are involved in the study . The Canadian healthcare system includes the following aspects : o Universal coverage for all medically necessary procedures and visits provided by physicians or in hospital under the Canada Health Act. 57"
12,page_12,"12 | P a g e o Health care is largely manage d within each provinc e. This results in differences in primary care models including availability of interprofessional care and differences in physician remuneration The study settings are primary care practices, either in the community or academic family practices affiliated with a hospital. 9. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA The study will be open to practices using any funding model, including fee for service, capitation or salaried; it will also be open to family physicians practicing in either interprofessional or non - interprofessional models. Eligible practices are required to provide comprehensive primary care, be a member of the network in their region and have at least one Primary Care Provider (PCP) in the practice who contributes data to the CPCSSN and cons ents to participate in this study. Consent will be obtained prior to randomization for centres participating in the cluster RCT. Each practice will select a practice champion among those physicians participating. The practice champion will build a team to participate in the Collaborative and support the initiative. They will be encouraged to invite a practice administrator/ staff, a nurse, and a pharmacist (where available in the practice) to participate in their practice team. Where the practice team does not include a pharmacist, they will be encouraged to engage at least one community pharmacist All community - dwelling patients aged 65 years and older having had at least one visit in the past two years in the practice of a participating PCP and having had > 10 medication prescriptions in the previous 12 months will have their de - identified EMR data included in the outcome measurement. A medication is defined as any unique prescription generated at least once in the EMR during the 12 months period preceding study initiation or in the 12 months following the study . Patients with at least one PIP at baseline may be invited to participate in the assessment of patient experience and self - reported outcomes. 10. INTERVENTION As part of the SPIDER intervention, primary care practice teams, policy - makers, and patient partners will form a Collaborative group in each participating region. The PBRN in each region will supply the Collaborative with local EMR data cleaned by CPCSSN and will supply confidential reports identif ying eligible patients to their practices . CPCSSN data are de - identified; a file allowing re - identification at the site of care is left at the practice site. Audit and Feedback on their own patients and comparisons with other participants will be provided to family physicians and their teams, using best practices. 58 QI Programs in each region will manage the QI aspects of the project. All Collaborative group members will attend a one - day workshop (or equivalent, as locally appropriate) on polypharmacy and PIPs to discuss options to address this issue using their EMR data. Practice coaches will help each SPIDER Collaborative group s establish priorities for QI, choose practice changes, and set goals. With the support of practice coaches, each practice participating in SPIDER will then implement the"
13,page_13,"13 | P a g e changes, adapting them according to the local context. A second workshop will be held at six months, and a summative congress will occur at one year. Monthly teleconferenc es will be available to participants. Criteria for discontinuing the intervention include: practice no longer eligible (left practice, not practicing comprehensive care) or withdrawal of consent. C omparator practices will continue with usual care. Routin ely collected EMR data will be used to measure the primary outcome in both groups . 11. OUTCOMES The primary outcome is the number of PIPs per patient . The PIPs are those identified by CaDeN 25 and by Choosing Wisely Canada 26 as appropriate for deprescribing : PPInhs, sedative - hypnotics, medication associated with hypoglycemia in elders, and antipsychotics. 11.1. F EASIBILITY EVALUATION W e will first evaluate the feasibility of SPIDER across seven dimensions: A cceptability to stakeholders, demand , implementation , adaptation , integration , practicality , and efficacy (s ee Table 1).

C LUSTER RCT OUTCOMES In the randomized controlled trial we will assess the cost - utility of SPIDER as the incremental gain in quality of life between the two arms in relation to intervention costs and by comparing the differences in investments and healthcare costs captured thr ough EMR data and emergency room use and hospitalization. We will capture the costs of medication, delivering the enhanced QI program (materials, management costs for the program, EMR data extraction and analysis), and practice facilitation . In Ontario, w e will determine the annual healthcare costs using a person - centred costing methodology developed by Wodchis et a l 65 - 67 that captures all costs covered by the provincial insurance plan, including costs incurred in acute, home, rehabilitation and complex care settings, and costs of physician outpatient visit s, medical tests, and medication (for the subset of patients > 65 years). We will determine costs per provider in the year prior to the project and for the year following the project, and compare the change. We will adapt existing tools to assess all prov iders’ experience in the Collaborative, 68 and their experience and confidence in deprescribing PIPs. 69 We will conduct PCP focus groups in each region to explore: experience in the C ollaborative, appropriateness of guidelines provided, time required and burden, c ommunication and shared decisions with patients and other providers, and confidence in deprescribing .

PARTICIPANT TIMELINE The preparatory work for SPIDER, including establishing the central research team and regional partnerships , developing the protocol for the process underpinning SPIDER, and seeking initial REB approvals, began in the third quarter of 2017. Dissemination of information about SPIDER to PCPs via the PBRNs and QI Programs and preparation for recruitment in the tw o feasibility sites has begun. The 3 - year demonstration project (reducing the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication prescriptions) will be conducted from June 2018 to March 2020; final analysis of results and work to ensure the sustainability of the SPIDER approach and facilitate dissemination of the regional networks’ successful interventions will continue through 2021. In the feasibility phase of the project, two of the regional networks will work with facilitators from September 2018 to Sep tember 2019 to establish their Collaboratives and select and implement QI interventions to reduce inappropriate prescribing. The networks’ ability to maintain their Collaborative and QI interventions without the assistance of facilitators will then be moni tored until the end of 2020. Interviews, surveys and focus groups with patients, providers and policy makers will be conducted in 2018 and 2019; data collected in 2018 will be used to improve SPIDER in preparation for the RCT. REB approvals and Recruitment for the RCT phase will begin during the feasibility phase in 2018. In the RCT phase , the remaining five regional networks will establish their Collaboratives and select and implement QI interventions with the help of facilitators from December 2018 to March 2020. Outcomes will be assessed for the year prior to each Collaborative and for the year after each Collaborative. Interviews, surveys and focus groups with patients, providers and policy makers will be conducted in 2019 and 2020. Qualitat ive analyses will be ongoing through the project as data are available. Quantitative analyses will be conducted in 2019 and 2020 for the feasibility phase and 2021 for the cluster RCT phase."
17,page_17,"17 | P a g e Preparation Feasiblity Cluster RCT 13. SAMPLE SIZE Planning analyses conducted on 86 practice sites of the University of Toronto PBRN (UTOPIAN) involving 334 PCP showed the following: (1) an average of 24 patients per PCP had at least one PIP; (2) the prevalence of PIPs was PPInh: 58%, benzodiazepine: 33%, hypoglycemics: 1%, antipsychotics: 7%; (3) 73% of patients had at least one PIP (24% had two or more); (4) the mean number of PIPs was 0.987/ patient (standard deviation: 0.747 ) ; and (5) the intra cluster (practic e) correlation (ICC) was 0.017."
18,page_18,"18 | P a g e 13.1. D ETAILS OF PLANNING ANALYSES The ability to identify older patients on 10 or more medications was tested using the UTOPIAN (University of Toronto Practice - Based Research Network) database. Data were extracted as of 1 April 1 2017. Patients included in the cohort had at least one encounter in the two years before the date of extraction. Patients labeled as deceased were removed from the dataset. Complex patients were defined as those with 10 or more unique drugs prescribed at least once in the 12 months before th e date of data extraction. All duplicate prescriptions were removed. We identified prescriptions for the four drug classes of interest using the World Health Organization’s ATC codes. 70 The UTOPIAN database collects information from 503,806 patients and 347 providers. We identi ﬁed 8,121 patients who are 65 years of age or older (as of 31 March 2016) and had 10 or more drug prescrip tions in the last 12 months (1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017). These 8,121 patients belonged to 334 family providers (clusters). On average, there are 24 patients for each family provider (mean = 24; median = 18; min = 1; max = 140 cluster size). We assessed the baseline prescription rates for four potentially inappropriate drugs (PIPs) in this cohort.  Proton pump inhibitors: A02BC  Benzodiazepines or Z drugs: N05BA or N05BE or N05CD or N05CF  Hypoglycemic sulfonylureas: A10BB, exclude A10BB09  Antipsychotics: N05A, exclude N05AN  Proton pump inhibitors: baseline prescription rate: 4716/8121 = 58.1%  Benzodiazepines or Z drugs: baseline prescription rate: 2677/8121 = 33.0%  Hypoglycemics: baseline prescription rate: 99/8121 = 1.2%  Antipsychotic drugs: baseline prescription rate: 576/8121= 6.9% Estimating Intraclass correlation coefficient Covariance Parameter Estimates Cov Parm Subject Estimate Standard Error Z Value Pr > Z Intercept Site_ID 0.05806 0.01887 3.08 0.0010 ICC = 0.05806/ (0.05806 + 3.29) = 0.0173 link: https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings15/3430 - 2015.pdf W e will recruit eight to twelve practices in each of the three PBRNs participating in the feasibility component of this study; allowing us to understand various facets of implementing the approach in three geographical regions, across at least 24 practices, including at least 24 PCPs, and over 400 patients. These numbers ar e sufficient to meet the six objectives that inform how"
19,page_19,"19 | P a g e the approach might need to be tailored to optimize its implementation in the RCT phase. These will also allow us to estimate anticipated patient participation within 5% (assuming 50% participation [hi ghest standard deviation]), 95% confidence intervals +/ - 5.2%) and determine with 99% confidence whether a 15% reduction in PIPs is possible. For the RCT portion, assuming a conservative ICC of 0.05 and one participating provider per practice (24 patients) , 35 practices in each arm are required to detect a mean difference of 15% (from 0.987 - 0.837) in PIPs, allowing for  = 0.05 and  = 20 %. We will recruit 16 practices per region (total 80) to allow for attrition. The unit of randomization will be the prima ry care practice, and analyses will be conducted at the patient level. 14. RECRUITMENT The Leads of the seven PBRNs participating in this study (each is a principal investigator on this study) will recruit the required number of practices for this study. As part of their infrastructure, PBRNs hold regular meetings and communicate with members. 71 The study will be promoted through email communications and at face - to - face meetings. Several practices have expressed an interest in participating. PBRN members h ave a strong history of engagement in innovations. 72 73 For a practice to participate, at least one family physician from that pract ice must be willing to be involved participate. Each practice will select a practice champion among those physicians participating. The practice champion will build a team to participate in the Collaborative and support the initiative. They will be encoura ged to invite a practice administrator/ staff, a nurse, and a pharmacist (where available in the practice) to participate in their practice team. Where the practice team does not include a pharmacist, they will be encouraged to engage at least one communit y pharmacist. All CPSSN members have an existing ethics approval that allows de - identified patient data to be used for research. All patients identified to have 10 or more medication at baseline will be included as participants for assessing polypharmacy a nd PIPs. Six months after study start, a PBRN practice facilitator will ask practices in both arms for permission to contact a randomly selected 10% sample of patients that were on PIPs at baseline. This method has been used successfully in previous PBRN studies. 74 After the family physicians have granted permission, patients will be contacted by a member of the research team and, aft er providing consent, will complete a questionnaire on experiences and self - reported outcomes. METHODS: ASSIGNMENT OF INTERVENTIONS 15. ALLOCATION: SEQUENCE GENERATION AND CONCEALMENT MECHANISM"
20,page_20,"20 | P a g e Treatment allocation (control or intervention) will occur in each region after recruitment is completed in that region. A computer - generated blocked (region) concealed randomization sequence will be used for practice treatment allocation. PBRN leads will s end a list of participating practices, identified only by study codes, to the central statistician who will link the list to the appropriate randomization block to reveal the allocation for each practice. 16. BLINDING Blinding of participants cannot be achieve d in pragmatic trials of QI interventions in primary care. 75 The identification of PIPs and medication count (at baseline and end of study) will take place centrally by a data manager blinded to the arm attribution to avoid potential biases in cases where ambiguity about the presence of the drug requires their assessment of additional patient data. Similarly, data cleaning and imputation will be performed centrally by a staff member blinded to the arm attribution. METHODS: DATA COLLEC TION, MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS 17. DATA COLLECTION METH ODS All participating physicians in the RCT are required to be existing members of the CPCSSN initiative and would therefore have already contribute d de - identified EMR data to regional network repositories. The method of EMR data extraction and the approach to processing the data (coding and standardizing) have been previously described. 49 CPCSSN has experience obtaining data elements required for this initiative 76 - 78 and generating lists of prescribed medication by time period, including attribution to the class of drug. 79 80 81 A patient survey for patients with PIPs will be delivered to stu dy participants in both arms by a research staff member at 12 months. A short survey will be administered to both arms at baseline asking about PCPs and their staff about their practices. PCPs and staff of practices participating in each Collaborative wil l be asked to complete an online survey of their experience with the SPIDER process and its impact on their ability to care for patients with complex needs at 12 months and again at 24 months after baseline. Interviews of patients and focus groups with pr oviders and policy - makers will be conducted only for the SPIDER arm at 12 months after baseline. These will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. 18. DATA MANAGEMENT Data management will be as per secure CPCSSN processes. 49 Practices identified as participating in SPIDER will have de - identified data on prescribing collected and compared as"
21,page_21,"21 | P a g e part of routine CPCSSN data collection. No data identifying patients or physicians will be released as part of study reports. Survey data for patient reported outcome and experience measures will be collected using study numbers, and will be entered in a secure, password - protected database at the University of Toronto. Administrative data for hospital admissions, emergency department visits and system cost will be managed as per standard operating procedure s at ICES. No information identifying patients or physicians will be released. Centrally located data management and analytic staff will be overseen by the senior biostatistician at the University of Toronto’s Department of Family and Community Medicine ( DFCM), Dr Rahim Moineddin. 19. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT A central project manager will be hired at UTOPIAN. The manager will be tasked with overseeing resources and budgets as well as ensuring that appropriate actions and timelines are followed. Th is will include communication and liaison with each regional network and ongoing teleconferences as required. A steering committee composed of the principal investigators will be formed; committee members will meet by teleconference bimonthly. An operati onal group will meet by teleconference every two weeks or more often as needed. 19.1. P ROJECT M ANAGEMENT TASKS  Actively manage the operations of the project for partners across Canada to ensure milestones and targets are met  G uid e decisions made by the steering committee and ensur e decision outcomes are executed accordingly  Acquir e , analy ze, and report information necessary for budgeting and assessment of project activities  Respond to all enquires, collaborating as required with committees  Troubleshoot problems at all stages, making modifications to address challenges  Report on the activities and objectives set by the s teering c ommittee  Articulate progress reports to the steering c ommittee, demonstrating the status of the project Finance  Create financial projections and make adjustments to budgets throughout the life of the project  Provide reports and analysis  Creat e and maintain contracts and agreements between partners; negotiate contract terms with partner institutions/organizations  Develop reports on milestones for funding purposes  Monitor and maintain contractual obligations with stakeholders and partners"
22,page_22,"22 | P a g e  Establish policies around fiscal management  Collaborate with the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Toronto to provid e timely reporting to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ( CIHR ) around financial status through regular reporting mechanisms as per CIHR Partnerships/Collaborations/Communications  Develop and lead the communication strategy, promoting the project to the research community, partners, patients, and the academic sector  Engage in building the project profile with regular proactive communications by designing promotional strategies and related material for improved outcomes throughout written announceme nts, website, and other modes of communication Staff Management  Supervise, coordinate , and evaluate support staff (data management staff , research assistant , etc.) 20. STATISTICAL METHODS Descriptive statistics will be used to provide information about physician and patient characteristics, participation rates, polypharmacy and PIPs. The analysis will be on an intention to treat basis; it will therefore include physicians who have agreed t o participate but discontinue their engagement at any point during the study. Outcomes are at the patient level; we will use hierarchical modeling and generalized estimating equations with random effect variables to account for clustering; intracluster co rrelation coefficients will be reported. All patients of participating physicians who had been identified at baseline as eligible, regardless of whether they had or not a PIP at baseline will be included in the analysis. The number of PIPs prescribed per patient in the control and intervention arms over a 12 - month period following the SPIDER intervention in each regional network will be compared. Analysis of covariance 82 will be used to adjust for potenti al confounders such as age, sex, comorbidity, and outcomes at baseline. Qualitative methods will be used to explore and evaluate the processes associated with SPIDER, so that its effects can be better understood. 83 We will use purposeful sampling to invite participants (family physicians, interprofessional team members, staff members) in each centre to participate in interviews and focus groups . We will use a semi - structured guide based on the dimensions measured, asking about their experiences with SPIDER, acceptability of the process, ability to implement the changes and what barriers they encountered. Focus groups will also be conducted with policy makers. We will use grou nded theory to code and analyze the data. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation research will be used to frame the results. 84 Participating PCPs are required to agree to share information about the study with their patients. A randomly selected 10% sample of patients identified at baseline as having PIPs will receive a"
23,page_23,"23 | P a g e study information sheet at six months asking for their permission to be contacted later by a member of the research team to participate in a study to understand their experience w ith medication. Individuals will be told that this will include a survey about their medication (both arms) and potentially an interview (intervention arm). Interviews will be conducted with patients to explore satisfaction with care. T he interviews w ill be audio - taped and transcribed verbatim . We will use the constant comparative method 85 to check and compar e data to identify categories , key words and themes . 86 ETHICS AND DISSEMINA TION 21. RESEARCH ETHICS APPR OVAL We will obtain ethics approvals from the institution at each regional Network, followed by signed, informed consent from each participating physician. C PCSSN has received REB approval from each host university for all participating PBRNs . All participating primary care providers have provided written informed consent for the collection and analysis of their EMR data . Patients and primary care team membe rs will provide informed consent prior to survey completion and/ or interviews /focus groups . 22. DISSEMINATION POLICY AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSL ATION SPIDER is itself an approach to mobilization knowledge to action. 87 Within these activities that aim to encourage adoption of best practices in care delivery, we have adopted an integrated knowledge translation (IKT) strategy to inform implementation and to support the eventual scale up of the SPIDER approach. We have engaged several KUs as team members at the onset of the development of this proposal, including PCPs, other health professionals, health planners, and individuals with lived experience (5 covering 3 regions). All seven regions will have a full complement of these individual s as team members. We have also engaged health authorities from four regions (in addition to the PIHCI policy Leads), provincial Health Councils (2), and the CFPC. These members have contributed to identifying the health care priority being addressed, key issues to be considered during implementation (e.g. patient - provider communication, interprofessional collaboration, the feasibility of the approach across regions, scalability of the approach), the outcomes that should be evaluated, and other aspects of the proposed study. These members form an integral part of our research team, and we will ensure that their engagement is fostered throughout the study implementation phase. Their contribution will continue to inform the deployment of the intervention and its adaption across regions; this will ensure that the approach implemented in each region is best suited for that context, and that the analysis and interpretation of the data is appropriately informed by the various perspectives. All members of the team will also be involved in disseminating knowledge, throughout of the"
24,page_24,"24 | P a g e study, as appropriate, and when the findings emerge. This IKT approach is a fundamental guiding principle of our work. This is especially important in this knowledge - to - action proposal be cause we are testing a promising process in a pragmatic manner and real - world settings. Evidence of effectiveness is now needed and is the final step before broader adoption and scale up of the innovation. Our approach to ensure authentic engagement is de scribed with some details in the three - page addendum. When PCPs/other health professionals and patient partners have had some experience working on this project, we will elicit their input in elaborating a more detailed study dissemination plan to reach va rious audiences. For now, we have made budgetary provisions for researchers, patients, health professionals and policy makers from each region to attend annual team meetings that will be held around scientific conferences. These will allow us to dissemina te knowledge to researchers, and to some extent policy makers. We will rely on our health planner/policy makers partners and participating health providers to support the transfer of knowledge to their peers regionally, and across jurisdictions. PBRNs have set up infrastructure and models to promote increased participation in academic activities; one example is the UTOPIAN i2p (Insights to Proposals) course, which has provided training for 45 primary care clinicians in grant development. 88"

Deciding not to take part or deciding to leave the study later will not result in any penalty or affect your current or future work or prac tices. CONFLICT OF INTEREST : There are no conflicts of interest to declare related to this study. BACKGROUND :"
26,page_26,"26 | P a g e Elderly patients living with multiple chronic conditions often take many medications (polypharmacy); some of them may not be beneficial. While m any medications can be problematic, the following four classes of medications have been recommended by Choosing Wisely Canada and the Canadian Deprescribing Network as targets for wiser uses in elders: proton pump inhibitors (PPInhs), benzodiazepines, anti psychotics and long - acting sulfonylureas. Polypharmacy is associated with poor patient health and reduced quality of life, high care costs and, often, care providers’ frustration. PURPOSE : This study aims to assess whether a Structured Process Informed b y Data, Evidence and Research (SPIDER) will help family practices improve care for patients 65 years or older who are taking 10 or more different drugs by reducing potentially inappropriate prescriptions . The study will also evaluate whether patients and t heir primary care teams are satisfied with the SPIDER process and whether SPIDER reduces care costs. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS : The study will recruit a total of 104 – 156 family practices, including at least 104 family physicians and 250 patients, in 7 regi ons (Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg and Halifax). This consent pertains to the feasibility phase ; we will recruit about ten practices in each region (Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton) STUDY PROCEDURES AND INTERVENTIONS : The study w ill first be tested for feasibility in Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton . Here is what the intervention involves:  Quality Improvement (QI) o For practice teams:  Select one physician as the practice champion and team up with other members of the practice (including, if feasible a nurse, a pharmacist and a front desk staff )  P articipate in a Learning Collaborative with 3 - 4 workshops over a period of 12 months  Review data from your patients’ electronic medical records (EMRs) with comparisons to colleagues , identify care gaps and possible ways to decrease those gaps  Work with a QI coach to implement practice changes and share best practices and challenges encountered via emails and occasional teleconferences  Research o Provide s ome basic information about you and a survey about your practice team (half hour) o C omplete an online survey (15 to 20 minutes) o You may be asked to p articipate in a n interview at 6 to 12 months (30 - 40 minutes) o Participate in a focus group at about 12 month s (1 hour) Ten percent of your eligible patients will be invited to complete a paper - based survey and a short interview at 12 month s . If you agree, these patients will be invited through your office by mail."
27,page_27,"27 | P a g e The focus group and interview will be audio r ecorded. The information collected from the surveys, the interview and the focus group are for research purpose s only. There is no right or wrong answers. Some of the questions may be personal. You can choose not to answer any questions you may not be comf ortable with. If you are a physician, we request your permission to identify your practice as participating in SPIDER in the EMR database of the research Network you are part of by assigning a study number in the database ; this will not identify you or yo ur patients. What we learn from the feasibility study will then be used to guide a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 5 regions (Ottawa, Calgary, Winnipeg, Montreal and Halifax). PARTICIPANTS’ RESPONSIBILITIES : If you choose to participate i n this study, you will be expected to participate in activities described above, including the completion of an online survey , potentially participation in an interview and a focus group .

CONFLICT OF INTEREST : There are no conflicts of interest to declare related to this study. BACKGROUND : Elderly patients living with multiple chronic conditions often take many medi cations (polypharmacy); some of them may not be beneficial. While many medications can be problematic, the following four classes of medications have been recommended by Choosing Wisely Canada and the Canadian Deprescribing Network as targets for wiser use s in elders: proton pump inhibitors (PPInhs), benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and long - acting sulfonylureas. Polypharmacy is associated with poor patient health and reduced quality of life, high care costs and, often, care providers’ frustration."
37,page_37,"37 | P a g e PURPOSE : This study aims to assess whether a Structured Process Informed by Data, Evidence and Research (SPIDER) will help family practices improve care for patients 65 years or older who are taking 10 or more different drugs by reducing potentially inappropriate prescriptions. The study will also evaluate whether patients and their primary care teams are satisfied with the SPIDER process and whether SPIDER reduces care costs. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS : The study will recruit a total of 104 – 156 family practices, i ncluding at least 104 family physicians and 250 patients, in 7 regions (Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg and Halifax). STUDY PROCEDURES AND INTERVENTIONS : The study will first be tested for feasibility in Toronto, Montreal and Edmon ton, followed by a cluster Randomized Controlled study . Here is what the intervention involves for participating practices:  Quality Improvement (QI) o For practice teams:  Select one physician as the practice champion and team up with other members of the p ractice (including, if feasible a nurse, a pharmacist and a front desk staff) ;  P articipate in a Learning Collaborative with 3 - 4 workshops over a period of 12 months;  Review de - identified patients’ electronic medical records (EMRs), identify care gaps and possible ways to decrease those gaps ;  Work with a QI coach to implement practice changes and share best practices and challenges encountered via emails and occasional teleconferences.  What we are requesting from you : o Participate in an interview regarding your views on this process (30 - 40 minutes) The interview will be audio recorded. The information collected from the interview is for research purposes only. There are no right or wrong answers. Some of the questions may be personal. You can cho ose not to answer any questions you may not be comfortable with. PARTICIPANTS’ RESPONSIBILITIES : If you choose to participate in this study, you will be expected to participate in the interview . DURATION OF THE STUDY : The entire project lasts for about 4 years.

You may find it helpful to discuss it with your friends and family. The study staff will tell you about the study timelines for making your decision. Taking part in this study is voluntary. Deciding not to take part or deciding to leave the study later will not affect yo ur current or future health care. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: There are no conflicts of interest to declare related to this study. BACKGROUND: Elderly patients living with multiple chronic diseases often take many drugs (polypharmacy), some of which may not be helpful. While many drugs can be problematic, the following four groups of drugs have been recommended by Choosing Wisely Canada and the Canadian Deprescribing Network as"
51,page_51,"51 | P a g e targets for wiser uses in elders: drugs that reduce stomach acid production; reduce anxiety and induce sleep; treat agitation; and treat type 2 diabetes but have a high risk of low blood sugar. Polypharmacy often leads to poor patient health and poor quality of life, high care costs and doctor’s frustration. PURPOSE: This study aims to assess whether a Structured Process Informed by Data, Evidence and Research (SPIDER) will help family practices improve care for patients 65 years or older who are taking 10 or more different drugs. The study will also evaluate whether patients and their p rimary care teams are satisfied with the SPIDER process and whether SPIDER reduces care costs. We are conducting a survey as part of the study to better understand what patients think and you are being invited to participate. ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS: You do not have to take part in the study in order to receive care. Your family doctor will provide care as usual; this will not change whether you participate or not. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS: The study will enroll a total of 104 – 156 family practices, including at least 104 family doctors and 250 patients, in 7 regions (Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg and Halifax). STUDY PROCEDURES AND INTERVENTIONS: Your family physician is participating in the study and has agreed for you to be contact ed. We are asking you to c omplete a survey to help us better understand care (15 to 20 minutes) The information you provide in the survey is for research purpose only. There will be no right or wrong answers. You can choose to answer any questions you are comfortable with. It is completely your choice whether you participate or not. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY: You can withdraw from this research at any time without having to provide a reason. Your withdrawal will not have any negative impact on your care. If you decide to terminate participation, the study will stop collecting your data. However, previously col lected data such as the survey data cannot be separated nor removed as these data are de - identified. POTENTIAL RISKS: Taking part in this study has some risks. You might feel uncomfortable, embarrassed or upset when sharing personal experiences and opin ions with the research staff in the interview. We will make every effort to minimize any impact. POTENTIAL BENEFITS :"
