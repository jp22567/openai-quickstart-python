Clinical Trial Protocol: APD334 -006 11 April 2017 Confidential Page 19of 711INTRODUCTION Etrasimod ( APD334) is an orally available, selective, sphingosine 1 -phosphate receptor (S1P) agonist. The S1P 1receptor is a ph ysiological mediator which has been shown to regulate l ymphocy te recirculation between ly mphoid tissue and blood. Binding and internalization of t he S1P 1receptor may result in ly mphocy te retention within ly mphoid tissue, with subsequent reduction in peripheral lymphocy te count and l ymphocy te availability for recruitment to sites of inflammation. S1P 1receptor surface expression is required for S1P gradient -mediated ly mphocy te migration out of lymphoid tissue into the circulation.1 Etrasimod is being developed to treat autoimmune diseases. Initial investigations will focus onInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) ,which is a broad term that describes conditions with chronic or recurring immune response and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.2There are two major t ypes of IBD: Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) . These are chronic remittent or progressive inflammatory conditions that may affect the entire gastrointestinal tract (CD) and the colonic mucosa (UC), and are associated wi th an increased risk for colon cancer.11 Collectively , patients with IBD suffer from a multitude of GI symptoms, including diarrhea, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. The causes of these IBDs are not completel y understood, but 3 characteristics define their etiology : (1) genetic predisposition; (2) an altered, dy sregulated immune response; and (3) an altered response to gut microorganisms.2The triggering event for the activation of the immune respon se in IBD has y et to be identified, but possible factors related to this event include a pathogenic organism (as yet unidentified) or an inappropriate response to a normally innocuous microbial or other antigen (perhaps due to failure to downgrade the inflammatory response, and/or to repeated exposure to such antigen from an alteration in barrier function).2 Once the inflammation has been triggered, it may be difficult for the IBD patient’s immune sy stem to turn off the response.3 The number of patients diagnosed with IBD has dramatically increased worldwide over the past 50 y ears.5In 2014, The Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of American estimated that approximately 1.6 million people are affected by IBD in the United States (US) alone,6with as many as 70,000 new cases diagnosed in the US each y ear7.In Europe, an estimated 2.5 – 3 million people are affected by IBD,8and as man y as 5 million may be affected worldwide .9 Universally, incidence rates for both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis were highest among individuals between 20 and 40 years old. Thus, IBD affects individuals in the most healthy and productive years of life, resulting in long -term cost to the pati ent, health -care system and society .10 Treatment for patients with IBD is generall y for s ymptomatic c are (relief of sy mptoms) and mucosal healing and includes 5 major classes of medications: aminosalicylates (5 -ASA), antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologic therapies. These drugs are generall y prescribed in a “step -up” approach, with e scalation of the medical regimen until a response is achieved .14"

Clinical Trial Protocol: APD334 -006 11 April 2017 Confidential Page 20of 71A single ascending dose study (APD33 4-001) and a multiple ascending dose study (APD334- 002), conducted in healthy subjects, have demonstrate dthe lymphocy te lowering capabilities of etrasimod (see Section 1.1.3). Lymphocy te trafficking agents such as natalizumab and vedolizumab, both injectable or infused therapies, have demonstrated efficacy in IBD indications. More recently , ozanimod , an S1P 1oralreceptor modulator showed promising results in a Phase 2 study for UC. The availability of oral l ymphocy te trafficking agents such asetrasimod would offer patients a n additional, more convenient treatment for IBD. 1.1 Background Information 1.1.1 Rationale for Proposed Clinical Study Inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with various extra - intestinal manifestations (EIMs). The prevalence of IBD patients with EIMs as co -morbidities varies from 25% t o 40% depending on the clinical presentation.15. Specificall y, IBD patients with EIMscould have a negative impact on disease prognosis and quality of life, and in most cases their clinical cou rse becomes independent of gut disease activity . IBD patients with skin EIMs are common, occurring in 2% to 34% of the IBD population.15 Specificall y, erythema nodosum and py oderma gangrenosum are the most common skin manifestations of IBD, while psoriasis is the active dermatological comorbidity disease observed most often, affecting 7% -11% of the IBD population .16IBD and these major skin EIMs in IBD share some common pathogenic mechanisms including neutrophil and lymphocy te infiltration.17To this point, targeted immunosuppressive therapies have demonstrated efficacy in IBD patients with skin EIMs. For example, TNF- alpha inhibitors are known to reduce intestinal inflammation and induce clinical remission in IBD patients , and are also known to reduce EIMs of IBD. However a small percentage of IBD patients taking TNF -alpha inhibitors experience de novo paradoxical psoriasis (reporting a rate ranging from 1.6 to 8.8%) despite beneficial intestinal effects while on treatment.18The pathophy siology of the paradoxical disease is not understood, but the leading hy pothesis is that decreased TNF - alpha induces the activation of autoreactive T cells and an increased interferon activity as well as other pro- inflammatory cytokines, such as IL -12, IL -17, IL -23. Recently , interferon -alpha (IFN -alpha) production by dermal plasmacy toid dendritic cells (DCs) has been identified as a key element in the ear ly phase of psoriatic skin lesion induction. Plasmacy toid DCs, the natural IFN-alpha producing cells, have recentl y been shown to infiltrate the skin of patients with psoriasis and to produce IFN-alpha . IFN-alpha induces the expression of CXCR3 on T cells, facilitating homing to the skin .19 It is clear that existing treatments for IBD, and IBD skin EI Ms, including TNF -alpha inhibitors, have limitati ons and a need remains for therapies with sustained efficacy, improved safet y, and convenient administration .20 Spingosine -1-phosphate (S1P) is a spingolipid required by lymphocy tes to exit the ly mphoid tissue and enter the bloodstream via a chemotactic gradient. Agonists of the S1P receptor -1 (S1P 1) block ly mphocy te migration out of the l ymph tissue through internalization of the receptor, resultin g in a sequestration of lymphocy tes.21Recent clinical development of S1P 1"

Fingolimod was the first drug in this class to be approved the treatment of multiple sclerosis.22More recently the S1P 1receptor agonist ponesimod was observed to reduce the severit y of chronic plaque psoriasis after chronic oral administration in a phase 2 randomized clinical trial .23In this study , ponesimod was associated with dy spnea, elevated liver enzy mes, bradycardia, headache and dizziness. Furthermore, S1P 1agonists (FTY720, SE W2871) have been observed to have an anti- inflammatory impact on the production of IL -12 family cytokines, indicating therapeutic potential for S1P treatment of several inflammatory diseases like psoriasis.24Importantly , a recent report demonstrating S1P 4agonists inhibit plasmacy toid dendritic cell activation and interferon -alpha production suggest a potential therapeutic role for S1P 1/S1P 4agonists like etrasimod in paradoxical psoriasis .25 In addition to the potential anti -inflammatory benefits of sy stemic ly mphocy te immunomodulatio n, S1P is known to exert anti -proliferative effects in human keratinocy tes,26and inhibits dendritic cell migration.27Thus, the potential role of S1P receptor modulation in skin EI Ms of IBD might involve both sy stemic and local epidermal mechanisms. The aim of the proposed clinical studies is to evaluate the role of S1Pmodulation in the setting of IBD with skin EI Ms. Next generation S1P modulators such as etrasimod with improved side effect profiles may represent a novel therapy for IBD patients with skin EI Ms. 1.1.2 Summary of Preclinical Data"

43,page_43,"APD334 Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol: APD334 -006 11April 2017 Confidential Page 44of 716.11.1 Adverse Event Reporting Patients will be instructed that they may report AEs at any time. AEs that occur from ICF signature until the time of administration of the first dose of etrasimod will be regarded as ‘pre-treatment’ and recorded as an AE. All events reported following study medication administration up to 30 day s after the last medication intake will be presented as treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs). Monitoring ofongoing AEs will be continued up to 2 weeks after study medication administration. I n the event that an AE is not resolved or stabilized by this time, the s ponsor in consultation with the investigator will decide whether to continue to monitor the AE or close -out the event in the database if no further follow -up is necessary . For this study , an AE is defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient administered etrasimod which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with thistreatment.” An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the product. AEs can be an y of t he following: •Unfavorable changes in general condition •Subjective or objective signs/s ymptoms •Concomitant disease or accidents •Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a patient in the course of a clinical study •Pre-existing conditions which worsen in severity or frequency or which have new signs/sy mptoms associated with them Lym phopenia will not be captured as an AEbecause it is an expected pharmacologic effect of the drug. AEs will be elicited at the time indicated in the schedule b y asking the question: “Since you were last asked, have you felt unwell or different from usual in an y wa y?” Any adverse or unexpected events, signs and sy mptoms, will be fully recorded on the Adver se Event Form including details of intensity , onset, duration, outcome and relationship to the drug as determined b y the PI. Whenever possible, a constellation of signs and s ymptoms should be recorded as a unify ing diagnosis (e.g., self -limited fever, run ny nose, cough, and scratch y throat should be captured as an upper respiratory infection rather than b y the individual signs and sy mptoms). AEs may also be reported at any time. The ty pe and duration of follow -up of patient s after AEs will be documented. 6.11.1.1 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) A patient with multiple sclerosis developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y (PML ) after nearl y 8 months of treatment with another S1P 1agonist38, and enablement of the John Cunningham (JC) virus is therefore a potential adverse effect of this therapeutic class."

Signs and sy mptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over day s to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disabilit y over weeks or months. If PML is suspected, withhold dosing and refer to a neurologist; if confirmed, discontinue dosing permanentl y. The investigator or subinvestigator will administer the subjective PML checklist during screening to exclude patients with positive responses from enrolling into the study . The subjective PML checklist will be administered at each site visit (except Day - 1) to probe for symptoms suggestive of PML . Any patients reporting signs and/or s ymptoms of PML will undergo objective testing and may be referred to a neurologist for a full evaluation. A cop y of the PML checklist is provided in Appendix 1 . 6.11.2 Serious Adverse Events and Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an y untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose results in the following outcomes: •Death •Is Life -Threatening •Required/Prolonged Hospitalization •Disability /Incapacit y •Congenital Anomal y/Birth Defect •Important Medical Event SAEs will be captured from the time of I CF signature to 30 day s after the last dose of study drug, and will be monitored until resolution or stabilization. An important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such a medical event includes allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Elective hospitalization and/or surgery for clearl y pre-existing conditions (for example a surgery that has been scheduled prior to the patient’s entry into the study ) will not be reported as a SAE. All other hospitalizations, including elective hospitalizations for any condition that was not pre -existing, will be reported as a SAE. Any AE considered serious by the investigator or which meets SAE criteria must be reported to PPD Pharmacovigilance (PVG) using the remote data capture (RDC) s ystem within 24hours from the time study site personnel first learn about the event. The follow ing contact information is to be used for SAE reporting:"

The RDC s ystem should be updated as soon as it is available. A full description of every SAE will need to be provided to PPD PVG (this may be supported by source documentation such as laboratory reports or a discharge summary should the patient be hospitalized). Other safety issues as defined in I CH Topic E2A, 21 code of federal regulations (CFR) §312.32, and EU Volume 10 also qualif y for expedited reporting. In these situations the process will be as detailed for SAEs above: •SAEs which could be associated with the trial procedures; •SAEs and AEs of special interest that could materially influence the benefit-risk assessment of a medicinal product, such as: a clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the investigator brochure. 6.11.2.1 Patient and Patient -partner Pregnancy Patients who become pregnant during the stud y will be dis continued immediately . Although not considered a nSAE or AE, pregnancies occurring during the period of study drug administration (Day 1 to Week 12) until 30 day s after the last dose of study drug should be reported to the sponsor contact and IRB /IECin the same manner as a nSAE.

Related : a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality , with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikel y to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge inf ormation is not required to fulfill this definition; or an event that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals where information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. Not related : a clinical event, including labora tory test abnormality , with sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship to drug administration (e.g., no temporal relationship to drug administration, because the drug was administered after onset of event; investigation shows that t he drug was not administered; proof of other cause; etc.); or an event with a temporal relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underl ying disease provide plausible explanation s. 6.11.5 Assessment of Adverse Event Outcome Outcome of AEs will be defined according to ICH Topic E2B, ICH Guideline. •Recovered/Resolved •Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae"

Whenever possible, a constellation of signs and sy mptoms should be recorded as a unify ing diagnosis (e.g., self- limited fever, runn y nose, cough, and scratch y throat should be captured as an upper respiratory infection rather than by the individua l signs and s ymptoms). AEs will be regarded as ‘pre -treatment’ if they occur between screening and the time of administration of the first dose of etrasimod. All other AEs that occur after the first dose of study medication will be considered to be ‘treatment -emergent’. 8.2.2 Concomitant Medications and Non -drug Treatments Due to the variabilit y in how medications are recorded, a standar d naming convention is required in order to t abulate this data effectivel y. A common method of standardization is to categorize medica tions by their Preferred Term. In order to do this, medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dic tionary (WHO DD), Format C. 8.2.3 Medical History Medical history will be coded using the most current MedDRA -version ."
