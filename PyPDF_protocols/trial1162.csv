The ‘Safety Analysis Set for Treatment Period II ’ is defined as all patients who enroll into Treatment Period II and who receive at least one dose of the study drug. Analysis of effectiveness: Primary endpoint For the analysis of the ‘Full Analysis Set’ , a binomial test is conducted on the null hypothesis that PFS rate at 12 months after the start of study Treatment Period I is less than or equal to 36 %. The one-sided si gnificance level is 5%. The two -sided 90% confidence intervals based on exact binomial distribution will be calculated . Secondary endpoint For the ‘Full analysis Set ’, exact two -sided 95% confidence intervals based on the ratio and binomial distribution, a nalysis by Kaplan- Meier method and summary statistics are calculated. Safety analysis For the ‘Full Safety Analysis Set ’ and ‘ Safety Analysis Set for Treatment Period II ’, data on the frequency of AEs will be collected. Determination of sample size: The purpose of this clinical study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of long- term administration of PI -based therapy with IRd in RRMM patients who are unable to continue treatment with injectable PI -based therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the 12- month PFS rate. The sample size was estimated using the results of a preceding overseas (i.e. non-Japanese) clinical trial, and was set so the expected 12 -month PFS rate exceeds the threshold 12-month PFS rate. In a clinical trial of patients with RRMM treated with VRd therapy, the 12- month PFS rate was 36%; this value was set as the threshold PFS rate. Assuming that the hazard rate follows a constant exponential distribution, the hazard rate was estimated to be 0.085. To calculate the expected PFS rate at 12 months, it is assumed that injectable PI -based therapy will be continued up to 3 cycles, and that the PFS rate 9 months after changing to IRd therapy can be based on the PFS distribution in the IRd arm of the C16010 study, an international, double - blind, randomized, placebo- controlled phase 3 study conducted in patients with RRMM with 1-3 prior therapies. In the C16010 study, the median PFS of the IRd group was 20.6 months; assuming that the hazard rate for PFS in the IRd group has a constant exponential distribution, the hazard rate with IRd was 0.034. For the present study, assuming that the hazard rate for the first 3 months is 0.085, and assuming that from month 4 – after changing treatment to IRd therapy – the hazard rate is 0.034, the PFS rate at 9 months after switching to IRd therapy is estimated to be 57%, and this is therefore the expected 12- month PFS rate.

Based on the considerations above, the minimum number of patients required to be administered IRd in this clinical study is 39 .

MM may result in bone marrow failure, bone destruction, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. MM constit utes approximately 1% of all reported neoplasms and approximately 13% of hematologic cancers worldwide [2]. In the United States in 2017 , an estimated 30,280 cases of MM we re diagnosed and 12,590 deaths occurred due to the disease [3]. In Europe in 2012 , an estimated 38,900 cases of MM we re diagnosed and 24,300 deaths occurred due to the disease [4]. In Asian countries, the incidence rate of MM is approaching that seen in Western countries [5 ,6]. According to the National Cancer Center, the number of new cases of MM in Japan in 2015 wa s estimated to be approximately 8,600, with approximately 4,200 deaths due to the disease [7]. MM is predominant ly a disease of the elderly, and it is estimated that the median age at the time of diagnosis is 65 to 70 years [10] . MM is generally considered incurable with current therapy. Treatment of MM has undergone major changes in recent years due to the increased understanding of the pathology of disease and improvements in therapeutic strategy. Previously, conventional therapeutic approaches focused on the use of cytotoxic drugs (e.g. alkylating agents, anthracyclines, etc.) and corticosteroids , which show ed efficacy as front -line and subsequent therapies . However, proteasome inhibitors (PIs) such as bortezomib and immunomodulator y drugs such as thalidomide and lenali domide resulted in improved treatment outcome s. Currently, three drug combinations of a PI, an immunomodulatory drug and an antibody formulation are recommended as treatment options for MM. In addition, two drug combination regimens, mainly carfilzomib and dexamethasone , are recommended [8,9]. In recent years, the overall survival (OS) of patients with MM has been extended , associated with the introduction of novel therapeutic agent s [11,12]. In a retrospective analysis by the Japanese Myeloma Society, the median OS for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2012 was 60.6 months, compared with 38.9 months for patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2000 [13]. A separate retrospective study by the Japanese Myeloma Society and the European Myeloma Network showed that the use of new drugs was an independent prognostic factor improving OS for newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory patients with MM [14]. Regarding the prognostic factors for Japanese patien ts with MM, retrospective studies suggest that long- term prognosis is poorer with increasing numbers of prior lines of therapy [15]. Currently, a large -scale prospective observational study (JSH -MM-15) on the prognosis of myeloma -related diseases is being conducted by the Japan Society of Hematology. The number of treatment options using new therapeutic agents is increasing, and studies on prognostic factors are progressing. However, MM remains incurable; ultimately, almost all patients will relapse and require further treatment, and so additional novel treatment options are needed. Ixazomib is a boronic acid compound and the biologically active form of ixazomib citrate. Ixazomib is an oral, small molecule PI developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company that selectively targets the 20S proteasome which is activated in MM and other cancers.

Inhibition of the 20S proteasome system has been shown to be feasible in the treatment of MM and mantle cell lymphoma. Ixazomib selectively binds to the β5 subunit of the 20S proteasome , prevent ing its chymotrypsin- like activity, and inhibits degradation of misfolded proteins [16]. In addition, at higher concentrations , ixazomib also inhibit s the activity of the β1 and β2 subunits. Furthermore, ixazomib has a shorter dissociation half -life compared to bortezomib; it has been shown to be widely distributed in tumor tissue , with more sustained proteasome inhibition, and to exert greater anti -tumor effects in various tumor xenografts [17]. Results of two clinical trials of ixazomib in Japane se patients have been reported. One was a domestic phase 1 trial of patients with re lapsed/r efractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), which was conducted following the availability of data from non- Japanese phase 1 clinical trial in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. The domestic phase 1 trial was an open -label, non- comparative study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of ixazomib 4.0 mg , alone or in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd), admi nistered orally once a day on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day- cycle. Ixazomib was administered to 14 patients (7 patients each in the monotherapy and combination therapy arms). No deaths w ere observed in this study; in the first cycle, which was considered as the evaluation period for dose- limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT was observed in 1 of 6 patients in the monotherapy arm (diarrhea, nausea, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypertension [all Grade 3], and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia), and 1 of 6 patients in the combination therapy arm (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, both Grade 4). Japanese patients were also treated with ixazomib in another clinical trial – the international, double- blind, randomized, placebo- controlled phase 3 TOURMALINE -MM1 trial (C16010 study) in patients with RRMM . The study compar ed the efficacy and safety of ixazomib administered with Rd (IRd; ixazomib group) with placebo administered with Rd (placebo group). Ixazomib 4.0 mg or placebo was administered orally on days 1, 8 , and 15 of a 28- day cycle. Lenalidomide 25 mg was administered orally on days 1 to 21, and dexamethasone 40 mg was administered orally on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment was continued until the health condition of the patient met the discontinuation criteria. The intent- to-treat (ITT) population consisted of 722 randomized patients, which included 41 Japanese patients. At the first planned interim analysis , at which the median follo w-up was approximately 15 months , IRd was associated with a significant benefit compared to placebo -Rd in the primary endpoint of progression -free survival ( PFS) by independent review committee assessment . Median PFS was 20.6 months in the ixazomib group and 14.7 months in the placebo group, a difference of approximately 6 months. The hazard ratio for progression or death was 0.74 (p=0.01), representing a 35% improvement in PFS in the ixaz omib group compared with the placebo group [18]. OS was a secondary endpoint; median OS was not reached in either group at a subsequent analysis (median follow- up of approximately 23 months with data cut -off on July 12, 2015 ), and so the trial is continuing in a double-blind fashion to the next planned interim analysis for OS. The proportion of patients with very good partial response (VGPR) or better (i.e. sCR, CR, or VGPR) was significantly higher in the ixazomib group (48.1% ) compared with the placebo group (39.0%).

The mortality rate during treatment or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug was 4% (15/361) in the ixazomib group and 6% (23/359) in the placebo group. The incidence of all adverse events (AEs) was 98% (355/361) and 99% (357/359) in the ixazomib and placebo groups, respectively, and the LQFLGHQFHRI*UDGH$(V was 74% (267/361) and 69% (247/359), respectively. AEs for which the incidence in the ixazomib group was 10 percentage points higher than in the placebo group were thrombocytopenia (31% and 16%, respectively) and vomiting (23% and 12%, re spectively). The QOL evaluation results were comparable in both groups. Ixazomib was approved in the United States in November 2015 and in Europe in November 2016, in combination with Rd, for the treatment of MM patients who have received at least one prior treatment. In Japan, ixazomib was approved for the treatment of patients with RRMM in March 2017. 4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study In the international, double-blind, randomized, pl acebo-controlled phase 3 trial of ixazomib in patients with RRMM, 70% of the patients had pr ior treatment with a PI, and 69% had prior treatment with bortezomib. Furthermore, carfilz omib has been approved in Japan for use in patients with RRMM since August 2016. The primary endpoint of this study is PFS rate at 12 months from the start of study treatment. In order to investigate the influence on physical, social , and emotional functioning by the continued administration of oral PIs after treatment with inject able PIs, QOL will be evaluated in this study as secondary endpoint.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug. Adverse event is a disease or the like in the clinical research method 10.1.2 Adverse Event Definition Generally , undesirable AEs include: • Newly diagnosed disease or deterioration of an existing condition (Intermittent events of existing disease are not considered as AEs) • Any event requiring treatment or medical treatment • AEs r equiring invasive diagnostic procedures • AEs r equiring discontinuation of study drug or dose change • AEs that the p rincipal investigators or investigators regarded as undesirable Diagnosis name and signs/ symptoms: • AEs are recorded by diagnosis name. Any accompanying signs (i ncluding abnormal laboratory test values or abnormal ECG) or symptoms are not considered AEs. In case of an AE without a diagnosis, signs and symptoms are considered AEs . Laboratory test values and ECG findings: • For clinical laboratory test values or ECG, it is considered as an AE only when the responsible the principal investigator or investigator determines that there is a clinical problem from the transition (i .e., when a treatment or medical treatment is required, or if the principal investigator or the investigator deems a change beyond the normal physiological variation range for the patient). Reexamination and/or ongoing monitoring of abnormal values are not considered as medical treatment. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive examination for verification, evaluation or monitoring is not considered to be a medical treatment. However, if the clinical laboratory test value or ECG is accompanied by a diagnosis of an AE (e .g. creatinine increase due to impaired renal function), its diagnosis nam e is regarded as an AE.

If the complication worsens, the deterioration is recognized as an AE, and the principal investigator or investigator records the name of AE name as a worsening of complications (e.g. ‘worsening hypertension’ ) in the case report • If the patient has a temporary existing disease (e.g. , asthma, epilepsy), if the frequency of its symptoms increases, or an increase in severity or advancement of disease is observed, the existing disease is recorded as an AE. If the patient has a chronic disease (e.g. cataract, rheumatoid arthritis), the chronic disease is recorded as an AE if the symptoms worsen more than expected. The p rincipal investigator or investigator should record the reported AE name as a change in existing chronic disease symptoms (e .g. worsening of ...) from the start of the study treatment. • Deterioration of AE: If the AE worsens after a change in the study medication, or if secondary signs and symptoms of the adverse event are observed, these secondary changes are regarded as new AEs, a nd recorded in the case report The principal investigator or investigator should record the reported AE name to clearly show that the symptom change (e .g. worsening of …). Changes in the severity of AE: • If there is a change in the severity of the AE, the principal investigator or investig ator records only the instance when the maximum severity is observed. Pre-planned surgery or treatment: • The surgery or treatment planned before the start of study drug administration is not considered an AE. However, if the patient's existing symptoms deteriorate markedly and surgery or treatment needs to be performed urgently, that condition or event is considered an AE. Complications due to pre -planned surgical procedures are recorded as AEs . Surgery or treatment requiring no urgency: • Surgery or treatment which does not suddenly affect the patient’s symptoms, such as cosmetic surgery, is not considered an AE. However, the investigator records this case in the case report. Complications due to surgery that require no urgenc y are reported as AEs. Progressive disease: • PD is not regarded as an AE as it is a result of lack of efficacy of pharmaceuticals. Also, symptoms that are merely for PD need not be considered serious AEs.

Overdose of study drug: • Overdose of drugs without any event expression is not considered an AE. However, investigators record overdose in the case report. When an event occurs due to overdose of the drug, the investigator records the symptom as an AE in the case report. 10.1.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition Serious AE means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 1.

The SAP will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives. 13.1.1 Analysis Sets In this clinical study, the following two analysis sets are defined: • Full Analysis Set (FAS) : all patients who enroll in Treatment Period I and who receive at least one dose of any therapy during the Treatment Period • Safety Analysis Set for Treatment Period II: all patients who enroll into Treatment Period II and who receive at least one dose of the study drug 13.1.2 Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics The key demographics and other baseline characteristics will be summarized for the FAS. 13.1.3 Efficacy Analysis (1) Primary Endpoint and Analytical Methods [Primary endpoint] PFS rate at 12 months from the start of study Treatment Period I. The primary endpoint of PFS rate at 12 months from the start of study T reatment Period I is defined as the proportion of patients who are alive and have not had disease progression at 12 months after the start date. The start date is defined as the date of fir st dose of treatment in Treatment Period I. Patients without 12 -month imag ing data for determining PD, or patients lost to follow -up, are included in the denominator; however, they are not treated as patients who have not had disease progression. [Primary analysis] For the primary endpoint analysis, the null hypothesis will be that the proportion of patients in the FAS who are alive and progression- free at 12 months after the start of Treatment Period I is ≤36%.The one -sided significance level will be 5%.

The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the 12- month PFS rate. The sample size was estimated using the results of a preceding overseas (i.e. non-Japanese) clinical trial, and was set so the expected 12 -month PFS rate exceeds the threshold 12-month PFS rate. In a clinical trial of patients with RRMM treated with VRd therapy, the 12- month PFS rate was 36%; this value was set as the threshold PFS rate. Assuming that the hazard rate follows a constant exponential distribution, the hazard rate was estimated to be 0.085 [30]. To calculate the expected PFS r ate at 12 months, it is assumed that injectable PI -based therapy will be continued up to 3 cycles, and that the PFS rate 9 months after switching to IRd therapy can be based on the PFS distribution in the IRd arm of the C16010 study, an international, double -blind, randomized, placebo- controlled phase 3 study conducted in patients with RRMM with 1 -3 prior therapies. In the C16010 study, the median PFS of the IRd group was 20.6 months; assuming that the hazard rate for PFS in the IRd group has a constant exponential distribution, the hazard rate with IRd was 0.034. For the present study, assuming that the hazard rate for the first 3 months is 0.085, and assuming that from month 4 – after switching treatment to IRd therapy – the hazard rate is 0.034, the PFS rate at 9 months after switching to IRd therapy is estimated to be 57%, and this is therefore the expected 12- month PFS rate. With a threshold 12- month PFS rate of 36%, an expected 12-month PFS rate of 57%, a one-sided significance level of 5%, and 80% powe r, the number of study subjects required is 39 . Based on the considerations above, the minimum number of patients required to be administered IRd in this clinical study is 39 . However, estimating that approximately 20% of patients may not meet the inclusio n criteria or may discontinue the trial, the number of patients enrolled in Treatment Period I will be 47.
