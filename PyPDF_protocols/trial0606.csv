Abstract a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research hypothesis, and the importance of the research. This st udy seeks to define longitudinal one year costs of delivery of care for patients who undergo care for complex aortic aneurysm disease. While surgery remains a standard treatment for complex abdominal and thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAA) , the tolerance of the older patient to recover such extensive and brutally invasive open aortic reconstructions is poor. Endovascular may offer the opportunity to reduce patient risk with less invasive approaches, improve quality of life, and serve to reduce the cost burden to payors which encumbers such difficult surgeries. In this study, we will compare the one year costs of inpatient and outpatient care associated with complex aortic repairs, comparing both the open surgical and endovascular approach with a TAAA debranching technology to solve this difficult clinical scenario, in our hospital wherein we have established expertise in management of patients with aortic diseases and it protean manifestations. The results of this study will serve to identify safety endpoints of endovascular technology of a TAAA debranching system , provide transparent data concerning both inpatient and outpatient costs of open and endovascular surgery in the older patient group, and patient perceptions about their care and its impact on their quality of life. Commensurate with goals of the Affordable Care Act provisions to examine clinical effectiveness and cost containment, this study may form the basis for refinement of technology used in aortic care which can motivat e episode -based payment methods and further develop proper risk adjustment assessments for open and endovascular surgery considerations in the future. 2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives) Primary The primary safety endpoint is freed om from major adverse events (MAE) at 30 days or during hospitalization if this exceeds 30 days. Major adverse events include death, bowel ischemia, myocardial infarction, paraplegia, renal failure, respiratory failure, and stroke . The primary effectivene ss endpoint is the proportion of study subjects wit h treatment success at 1 year. Treatment success is defined as a composite of technical success and freedom from the following: • Aneurysm enlargement i.e., >5mm as compared to any previous CT measure using orthogonal (i.e, perpendicular to the centerline) measurements • Aneurysm rupture • Aneurysm -related mortality • Conversion to open repair"
2,page_2,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 2 of 54 • Secondary intervention for migration, Type I and III endoleaks, device integrity failure (e.g., fracture), an d patency -related events (i.e., device component stenosis or occlusion and embolic events) The primary non -technical endpoint is improvement in quality -of-life scores (by SF36) and reduced 1 year costs for patients who undergo endovascular repair vs open surgery. Secondary Secondary endpoints include: • Technical success and the individual components of technical success: o Successful delivery o Deployment at the intended implantation site o Patency of all endovascular graft and stent components o Absence of device deformations requiring unplanned placement of an additional device o Absence of inadvertent covering of aortic branch vessels o Successful withdrawal • Freedom from t he individual components of the primary safety endpoint at 30 days. o Death o Bowel ischemia o Myoc ardial infarction o Paraplegia o Renal failure o Respiratory failure o Stroke • Freedom from p araparesis at 30 days • Treatment success and the individual components of treatment success including freedom from the following at each follow -up interval: o Aneurysm enlarge ment o Aneurysm -related mortality o Aneurysm rupture o Conversion to open repair o Secondary intervention for: o Migration o Type I endoleak o Type III endoleak o Device integrity failure (e.g., fracture) o Patency -related events (i.e., device stenosis or occlusion and embolic events) o Renal failure o All-cause mortality o Endoleaks o Device integrity failure (e.g., fracture) o Patency –related events (i.e., endovascular graft or stent component stenosis or occlusion and embolic events) o Other device -related events 3.

The study titled : A study of the Safety, Efficacy, Longitudinal Costs and Patient -Centered Outcomes using a TAAA Debranching Device . Within this objective is the p rimary technical intent of the study is to assess safety acutely (i.e. freedom from major adverse events (MAE) at 30 days) and preliminary effectiveness (i.e., treatment success and technical success) of the device (i.e., the proportion of treatment group subjects that achieve and maintain treatment success at one year). Additionally, the study will assess technical success and treatment success at each follow -up interval. The primary non -technical endpoint of the study will also measure patient quality of life by validated SF36 surveys at treatment and each follow -up interval and the cost to deliver the care of aortic surgery. Report of Prior Investigations. Anatomy The aorta is the main artery that originates in the left heart chamber, ascends to the arch, and descends through the thoracic cavity and diaphragmatic muscle into the abdomen. The aorta gives a number of side branches throughout its trajectory from the mediastinum to the chest and abdomen. These branches include the coronary arteries, innom inate artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, celiac axis (CA), superior mesenteric artery (SMA), renal arteries and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and various lumbar arteries. The aorta terminates at the aortic bifurcation where it d ivides into the common iliac arteries. Several smaller parietal side branches originate throughout the length of the aorta and include bronchial, intercostal, phrenic and lumbar arteries. A number of anatomical variants and accessory branches have been des cribed. Approximately 15% to 30% of individuals have one or more accessory renal arteries. The hepatic arteries can originate as a separate branch from the aorta, or as replaced branches from the left gastric or SMA in 5% to 15% of individuals1. In addition to accessory or replaced anatomy, the diameter, location and angle of the visceral arteries have significant variation, which may have implications with respect to arterial hemodynamics. Pathophysiology Aortic aneurysm is a progressive disea se characterized by structural deterioration, gradual expansion, and eventual potential for rupture of the aorta if left untreated. The definition of aortic aneurysm is a localized or diffuse dilatation encompassing all three layers of the aorta with diame ter >50% larger than the expected normal aortic diameter. An aneurysm which spans both the thoracic and abdominal cavities defines a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. The expansion rate of thoracoabdominal aneurysms ranges from 2 -4mm per year and is not influenced by the size of the aneurysm at the time of diagnosis2,3. The expansion rate of thoracoabdominal aneurysms does not appear to increase as individual aneurysms enlarge. The presence of COPD and hypertension are factors associated with a n increased rate of enlargement4,5. Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms become a risk for rupture if they are above 5.5-cm in diameter or if they are less than 5.5- cm in diameter and are growing more rapidly than 0.5-mm in 6 months. The 5 -year survival of thoracoabdominal aneurysm patients ranges from 7 -20% depending on the percentage of aneurysms secondary to aortic dissection3,6. Half of the thoracoabdominal aneurysm deaths are attributed to rup ture"
4,page_4,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 4 of 54 and the other half are due to some sort of comorbidity such as myocardial infarction. The overall survival of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm patients is often overestimated, because the patients with advanced comorbid medical illness are not includ ed and account for 46 -68% of the patients reported in past natural history studies3,6-9. Dissecting aneurysms have a higher rate of rupture and have a worse prognosis without intervention. Most patients with a descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal a neurysm do not hav e symptoms when first diagnosed7,10. They are likely diagnosed with a CT scan for another disease. Some patients have vague chest, back, flank, or abdominal pain. The pain may increase in severity as the aneurysm enlarges, or it may be sudden due to rapid expansion and impending rupture. Sym ptoms can result from compression of or erosion into adjacent intra -thoracic structures or bony thorax7,11,12. Hoarseness from stretching or compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, tracheal deviation, persistent cough, or other respiratory symptoms are sometime seen. Patients with a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm may have a palpable pulsatile mass i n the upper abdomen. Emergent/Urgent/Ruptured Aneurysms A ruptured aneurysm is either an emergent or urgent situation and many times is fatal carrying an overall mortality rate of 90%. Ruptures present in many different ways. One study states that 80% of ruptures present as a retroperitoneal rupture13. A retroperitoneal rupture can lead to slow progressive bleeding which forms a large hematoma that is contained by the periaortic tissues. Approximately 4% of ruptured aneurysms are contained ruptures. Surgical treatment is recommended within 24 hours of presentation of a contained rupture. An acute ruptured aneurysm requires imme diate intervention and it is said that endovascular techniques may improve the survival for patients with ruptured aneurysms13. In a combination of retrospective and prospective IDE data from other sites (G140207) , there have been 3/33 subjects treated emergently and 3/33 subjects treated urgently. Of the three treated emergently, there were no intraoperative deaths. All of the eme rgent subjects had prior open repair that failed and were left with at least one major complication from prior open surgery. One died on day 14, one was discharged and presented with an acute onset of paraplegia and passed away at 30 days, and one survive d to 3 months. Recent results have reported the mortality rate of emergent/urgent open repair to be 43% with the average visceral ischemic time of 36 minutes with average blood loss of 2875cc14. Another center reported a 36.8% 30-day mortality in patient s treated with a hybrid approach15. Comparison of this study with prior results of open repair and the fact that there was no ischemic time and an average blood loss of 1250 cc in emergent cases from prospective IDE data , the probable risk of the using the investigational device is no greater than the probable risk of open repair or from the disease. Three subjects were treated urgently requiring repair within one week of presentation. One subject treated urgently was doing well at his 30 day visit and succumbed to a hemorrhagic stroke at 35 days, one died of leukemia at 14 months, and one is nearing her three year visit and is doing well. Of the subjects treated urgently, none of them died of aneurysm or device relate d deaths and all but one survived past one year. Presentation of a subject requiring emergent treatment needs to be treated immediately while urgent treatment needs to be completed within a week of presentation. Due to the many comorbidities of these subjects, an open repair is not recommended for the same reasons as an elective open procedure. Therefore, we feel that treatment with this investigational device is warranted to minimize the risks associated with open repair. This device is an endovascu lar option that can be used off the shelf and delivered quickly to treat an emergent case while reducing the procedure time and overall blood loss. Due"
5,page_5,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 5 of 54 to the high overall mortality of open repair, the probable risk of the investigational device is no gre ater than the probable risk from the subject’s condition. While these subjects would benefit from the investigational device, these subjects should not be included in the primary study arm as the expanded selection criteria could present confounding resul ts making it challenging to separate the safety and effectiveness of the device from the underlying disease process. Type B Dissections A Stanford type B dissection begins distal to the brachiocephalic artery. We plan on treating both type B dissections that are subacute and chronic with aneurysmal changes. Treating dissection subjects involves determining the true and false lumens and which lumen feeds the visceral vessels. The visceral manifold device design does not mimic natural anatomy and has the ability to cross between true and false lumen to treat the dissection, feed the visceral vessels, and accommodate the device even in a small true lumen by utilizing both the true and false lumen as conduits to complete the case. Our device can cross betw een naturally occurring fenestrations or a laser may be used to create a fenestration between the true and false lumen. The risks of using a laser to create fenestrations include perforating the aorta or branch vessels, extension of the dissection, vascul ar trauma, embolism, pseudoaneurysm, and bleeding. These risks will be mitigated by utilizing the smallest possible laser and using fluoroscopic guidance to locate and create the area for the fenestration. The risk of potential dissection extension in ch ronic type B dissections is very low. The risk of potential dissection extension is higher in subacute type B dissections and would be mitigated by controlling blood pressure while deploying, conservative oversizing of the stent graft, and having a cardio thoracic surgeon available if there is a retrograde dissection. A large number of these patients have been excluded from th at study for dissection. 15% (5/33) of subjects were treated electively for TAAA with a dissection (G140207) . A laser was used to p erforate the aortic wall between the lumens to allow for placement of the graft and limbs when a natural fenestration is not found. All of the procedures were successful and there were no device related events or disease related mortalities. Type II endol eaks were observed in 2 of the 5 subjects, but have not required intervention or lead to aneurysm enlargement. 60% (3/5) of these subjects are doing well at two years post procedure. Of the two that are deceased, one died of a CVA at four months while the other death was self -induced due to alcohol abuse post procedure. Literature cites an in -hospital mortality rate of 29% for open surgical repair of type B dissection. Given the small population treated with the branched endograft to date with no mortalit ies related to the device or the dissection, we believe the patient population presenting with type B aortic dissection involving the visceral segment could benefit from the use of this device over currently available options. These subjects should be inc luded in the expanded selection arm rather than the primary study arm due to presentation with a concomitant disease process that falls outside the study’s intended use. Aneurysm with Renal Insufficiency Subjects with known renal insufficiency and renal failure are excluded from the primary study arm due to underlying renal insufficiency that increases their risk of peri -operative renal failure confounding the differences between the efficacy of the device and the underlying disease process. This device would still be beneficial for this subject population because it allows for continued perfusion of the renal arteries and may in some instances treat underlying causes for renal insufficiency. A 2004 report that evaluated the outcomes of aneurysm repair in patients with established renal failure reported that subjects presenting with chronic renal impairment have a high incidence of concurrent cardiovascular morbidity and are at high risk for aneurysm disease. They also reported that aneurysm subjects wi th renal dysfunction that were non -operative had a 20% 5 -year survival rate, with 39% of subjects dying from rupture of their aneurysm. One study cited a 25% mortality in subjects on"

Several precautions are put in to place to protect renal function during the procedure including hydration, a minimal volume of nonionic contrast agent, and continual monitoring of post procedure creatinine levels. Subjects undergoing dialysis at the time of procedure will be dialyzed before and after the procedure to protect any remaining renal function. One research study indicates that elevated creatinine levels don’t indicate post -op renal failure and that the creatinine level may not be a contraindication for EVAR treatment if prop er precautions are used17. Aneurysms with Small Branch Vessels <5 mm Small branch vessels less than 5 mm are excluded from the primary study arm due to an increased risk of increased intimal hyperplasia , branch occlusion, and potential end organ failure. These same principles are true even in open bypass surgery. These subjects would still benefit from the use of this device due to the gradual sweeping endobypasses that deliver more developed flows to reduce the risk of branch vessel occlusion. Additionally, it is extremely rare to see a SMA with a diameter less than 5 mm therefore reducing the risk of fatal branch occlusion. These subjects will still benefit from exclusion of the aneurysm and reduced risk of aortic rupture. Due to the significant mortality associated with rupture or open repair, this patient population is willing to assume a higher risk of renal insufficiency or renal failure. When treating subjects with impaired renal function, t here is an increased probability of subjects having renal arteries < 5 mm or underlying significant stenosis. While this is our current requirement, there have been eight subjects treated with a renal artery less than 5 mm at other sites and one subject with a celiac artery measuring less than 5 mm . These subject s had no adverse events related to the treatment of a smaller vessel. As we open the criteria to increased comorbidities, there will be more subjects presenting will smaller vessels. Current te chnologies, including T -branch and fenestrated stent grafts, treat vessels with diameters ranging from 4 -8 mm. Aneurysms with Prior Repair The need for a redo procedures in TAAA repair is common and is primarily due to extension of the aneurysmal disease18. Other causes for a late redo procedur e include including para -anastomic aneurysms, pseudo -aneurysms, stent graft migration, type I endoleaks, graft infection, or fistulas19. Natural history studies and literature reviews cite an incidence rate of 25 -60% for patients developing further aneurysmal changes after aortic repair. O ne center reported the rate of redo operations on TAAA repair to be 14%18. Aneurysms with Obstructive Stenting Patients suffering from thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms can benefit from the proven safety and efficacy of open surgical and endovascular stent grafting. However, the repair does not halt disease progression and may lead to future aneurysmal formation in adjacent segments of the aorta. The continued expansion necessitates revision to mitigate the risk of pending rupture. The incidence of revision following aneurysm repair is b etween 2.4 -5.2%20 in abdominal aortic aneurysms and 14% in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA)18. Treatment Options Medical Management"
7,page_7,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 7 of 54 Medical management of both fusiform thoracoabdominal aneurysms and type B aortic dissections includes normalizing blood pressure to prevent further dilation or dissection. Close monitoring should be performed. Operation should be limited to patients w hose aneurysms are at least 5.5 -cm in diameter, whose symptoms persist, whose aneurysms enlarge and are at least 4.5 -cm in diameter, or who develop evidence of bleeding. But if any of those conditions are observed (persistent symptoms, aneurysm enlargemen t, and evidence of bleeding), the patient should be offered repair. For dissections operation is suggested for symptomatic patients and those with complications including malperfusion syndrome or active hemorrhage. For prior repair, if there are persiste nt endoleaks, loss of seal, or device integrity issues of previously placed graft material repair should be offered. Open Surgical Repair Open repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms, especially in patients with preexisting comorbidities, is fraught with complications. A meta -analysis of 7,833 open repairs of thoracoabdominal aneurysm repairs from 2000 to 2010 found a 30 day mortality rate of 7%, in -hospital mortality of 10%, spinal cord ischemia rates of 7.5%, renal failure rates of 19%, and pulmonary dys function rates of 36%21. Predictors of adverse events after elective open repair based on pre -existing comorbidities have been established. Advanced age (>70 years)22-25, respiratory disease24, renal insufficiency26, coronary artery disease22,25, symptomatic aneurysms, extent 1 and 2 aneurysms27-30, and diabetes31 are reported to be a predictor of 30 -day mortality. Cardiac function32, extent 1 and 2 aneurysms28,33 -35, symptomatic cases35, and diabetes31 are reported to be predictors of paraplegia. The outcomes reported above are in a low - to moderate - risk patient popu lation. It is a logical extension to assume the outcomes in moderate - to high - risk patients would be worse. Open Surgical Repair of Ruptured, Urgent, and Emergent TAAAs Open repair of any thoracoabdominal aneurysms, especially in patients with preexisti ng comorbidities, is fraught with complications. A recent review of emergent patients with a ruptured TAAA looked at the overall mortality of 51 emergently treated patients with TAAA between 1994 and 2014. The study evaluated Crawford Type I, II, III, and IV presenting hemodynamically unstable (94%) and hemodynamically stable (3%). In this study 54.9% (28/51) had true aneurysms and 45% (23/51) had dissecting aneurysms. These were further broken into 94% (48/51) that presented emergently requiring treatme nt in 2 -6 hours and 6% (3/51) that presented urgently and required treatment within 24 hours. The overall mortality in this study was 43% (23/51); 15% (8/51) of these occurring during the procedure and 27% (14/51) occurred post -operatively. Of the 84% (4 3/51) that survived the initial procedure, 16% (6/42) developed paraplegia/paraparesis, 18.6% (8/43) had acute renal failure, 35% (15/43) had pulmonary insufficiency, and 18.6% (8/43) with post -operative bleeding. The average visceral ischemic time was 36 minutes and the average blood loss was 2875cc14. Open Surgical Repair of Chron ic Type B Dissections Open repair of chronic type B dissections is known to have a higher mortality and morbidity rate. A 2014 review of open and endovascular outcomes for patients with chronic type B dissections cited an operative mortality of 6%, stroke rate of 16%, and paraplegia of 9%. The one year major morbidity or mortality in these open repair patients was 25%36. Another large st udy evaluating open repair results in 1542 subjects reported a 30 -day mortality of 17.8% 37. One advantage of open repair compared to endovascular repair of type B dissections is a lower re -intervention rate36. Open Surgical Repair o f TAAAs with prior repair"
8,page_8,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 8 of 54 Open repair of any thoracoabdominal aneurysm, especially in patients with preexisting repair , is fraught with complications. The outcomes of redo open repair are typically worse compared to the index procedure. If the open repa ir requires a redo left side thoracotomy this is associated with an increased risk of post -operative respiratory failure, longer operation time, and reduced long -term survival. Additionally, if retroperitoneal redissection is required it increases the ris k of major bleeding and damage to abdominal organs. In a literature review of open repair of visceral aortic patch aneurysms with reinclusion technique on the redo open procedure, centers reporting more than one case had a mortality rate ranging from 20 -40% and a renal failure rate ranging from 0 -50%19. Another site evaluating 266 redo open TAAA repair procedures cited a 30 -day mortality rate of 23%, post -operative coagulopathy 23%, stroke 6%, respiratory failure 44%, and renal failure 37%. The 5 year mortality was also determined to be 58 .1% in redo patients, which is significantly higher than non -redo TAAA patients18. Open Surgical Repair of TAAAs with prior repair and obstructive stenting While revision with open surgical techniques can be an option in certain cases, the outcomes are poor in most patients given the advanced nature of their disease and associated comorbidities. 38,39 Given the extensiveness of these secondary repairs, most patients are either deemed not a surgical candidate or their repair is postponed longer than recommended by the Society of Vascular Surgeons. Others have demonstrated the use of fenestrated and branched stent grafts to revise previous open and endovascular surgery. 40 Endovascular Repair Parallel Grafts Parallel grafts (often referred to as snorkels, chimneys, periscopes, or CHIMPs) are combinations of aortic and branch stent grafts deployed simultaneously. They are typically all straight -tube grafts where the open end is either on the proximal or distal extent (and sometimes both) of the aortic component. The combination of straight tube stent grafts allows for the physician to treat emergent patients beings the assembly does not need to be custom made. There are some criticisms though about the lack o f circumferential seal and fixation though with parallel grafts. This lack of circumferential seal and fixation may leave the patient vulnerable to endoleak. There have been case reports which describe two parallel stent graft techniques used to repair thoracoabdominal aneurysms. The first ‘terrace technique’ has two chimney stents in contact with a more proximal thoracic graft and two chimney stents in contact with a more distal thoracic graft41. The second has two chimney stents going to the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. Then there are two snorkel stents pulling retrograde flow and going to the renal arteries42-44. Snorkel and chimney grafts can be implanted with good technical success rates if care is taken, but long term rena l function is in question. S eal and f ixation are also in question, s o the parallel graft techniques should be avoided in elective settings and reserved for emergent settings45. A recent review found that 10.7% of patients in the literature treated for thoracoabdominal aneurysm with parallel grafts experienced type 1 endoleak . The investigator thought the approach would be useful for a recovery maneuver or for emergent cases where fenestrated graf ts are not readily available, b ut long term durability and proximal fixation remain in question46. Sandwich Techniques"
9,page_9,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 9 of 54 Two sandwich techniques have been proposed in order to care for patien ts with an off -the-shelf approach. The first used dual bifurcated infrarenal grafts in the descending thoracic aorta47. The second used 3 -4 bridging stents sandwiched with a th oracic graft in the descending thoracic aorta48. While these sandwich techniques can be used off -the-shelf, they do not provid e for circumferential seal and fixation, and long term durability is in question. Fenestrated Stent Grafts While combinations of branched and fenestrated endografts can be specified and ordered from manufacturers to be customized for the patient in Europe, there are few studies of purely fenestrated endografts used in the repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. A study showed the technique by which endografts can be modified in order to treat urgent cases of thoracoabdominal aneurysms49. These authors recently published a case where this technique was used to repair a thoracoabdominal aneurysm in a 74 year old male patient with very asymmetric visceral and renal vessels. The repair was done by sewing Gore Viabahns to the fenestrations as ‘mini cuffs’ which helped to increase the amount of seal obtained. The patient had been followed for two months50. Also a retrospective study in 2011 which r eviewed the cases done in Paris, France and Cleveland, Ohio for type 4 thoracoabdomin al aneurysms with custom manufactured fenestrated grafts was reported. All patients were considered high risk for open repair. Over a six year period, 231 patients were treated. Thirty day mortality was 2.6% and 2 year survival was 83%. Freedom from se condary intervention was 93% at 30 days and 73% at 2 years51. Cook t -Branch Stent Grafts Branched stent grafts have been used for juxtarenal and pararenal aneurysms. Modified branched stent grafts have only been reported to be used with thoracoabdominal aneu rysms to date50,52. There are no large scale studies of unibody axially -oriented multi -branched grafts for pararenal aneurysms as they are more frequently used for thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Branches have been attached to the aortic component to provide for bridgin g stent overlap, increased overl ap encouraged seal and fixation. It also allowed for the use of self -expanding stent grafts which help accommodate tortuosity. Several variations of branch orientation exist including axial, helical, antegrade, and retrograde. Axial branches were deploy ed proximal to the target vessels. The branches were cannulated from an arm approach, and mating stents were deployed. Bard Fluencies were commonly used and t he length of overlap was typically 10 -mm. These were sometimes lined with balloon -expandable stents to prevent component separation. Alignment between the axial branch stent and target vessel was noted as a problem if it caused angulation in the bridging stent, potentially leading to bridge stent kink. To increase durability, self -expandable bare metal stents such as Boston Scientific Wallstents were occasionally used. The helical branches exit the aortic component posteriorly and wrap around the main body. The distal end landed 10 -mm from the ostium of the target vessel. The longer overlap and gentle sweeping centerline made lining the stents less critical. The branch stent curved to become in -line with the target vessel. The drawback was that the helical stents make for a bulky construct requiring a large diameter delivery system. Flow Divert ing Devices Flow diverting stents are used in limited applications for repairing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in Europe. They provide for more simplified implant in that the branch vessels do not need to be stented. Instead the three layer micro -wove n nitinol mesh significantly slows and alters the flow of blood into the aneurysm sac encouraging thrombus formation. All the while, flow channels are developing to the branch vessels53-55. The IFU must be followed very closely so that the stents do not overlap graft cloth, that"
10,page_10,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 10 of 54 20-25% oversizing is followed, and so that larger stents are always deployed within smaller stents. If these instruc tions are not followed, devastating ruptures may follow56-58. Data is limited and largely retrospective in nature59. The one registry reported had 380 patients but showed a technical success rate of 0% when the IFU was not adhered to (n=38/38)60. Endovascular Repair of Ruptured, Urgent, and Emergent TAAAs There are no reports we found describing branched grafts being used for TAAA repair in a ruptured or emergent setting. This is likely due to either manufacturer contro l of the use of the devices or control of the publication of information. However there are several studies of parallel grafts being used in this setting. A meta -analysis published revealed 15 reports of 93 such patients. 24.7% were operated on in an urgent setting, but the results were not compared to results of patients treated in a non -urgent setting. Because of this we cannot draw any conclusions46. A further study examined parallel grafts used in ruptured thoracoabadominal aortic aneurysms and pararenal aneurysms used in 9 patients (6 thoracoabadominal aortic aneurysms, 2 pararenal aortic aneurysms, and 1 short neck infrarenal aneurysm). The study mentions stable renal function in all patients and a very low 30 -day mortality rate44. Yet another study examined 29 patients treated with the parallel graft te chnique of these14 patients were ruptures and 15 patients were symptomatic. Nine lesions were in the aortic arch, ten were in the descending aorta, and ten were in the branched visceral segment. Twenty two were treated in the first 24 hours and 7 were tr eated in the first 3 days. Median follow -up was 2 years. There were four 30 day deaths (1 cerebral infarct, 1 visceral ischemia, 1 multiple organ failure, and 1 heart failure). The authors remarked that this technique is promising with low rates of earl y mortality when considering that the patients were emergent61. Three additional cases were reported but the cases focused mainly on technical feasibility and endoleaks, as a means of demonstrating the technique with little focus on the clinical sequelae that may develop during urgent repair of thoracoabadominal aor tic aneurysms with endovascular techniques62-64. From this limited data set coupled with our current understanding of the outcomes of patients treated with open repair in the urgent setting, it appears that the benefit of endovascular repair may outweigh the risks. Endovascular Repair of Chronic Type B Dissections Incidence rates of aortic dissection is estimated to be roughly 3 per 100,000 people per year65,66. Until recently acute Stanford type B aortic dissections were managed with blood pressure control67,68. If endovascular intervention is offered in acute dissections the goal is typically to cover the proximal entry tear in order to block antegrade flow to the false lumen. This starts the process of aortic remodeling by depressurizing the false lumen69. If only the thoracic aorta is to be tre ated, growth of the true lumen and shrinking of the false lumen are generally not associated with distal reperfusion or endoleak – meaning there is a lower rate of reintervention70. As endovascular repair is becoming more prevalent, we are learning that chronic dissections tend to have a thicker fixed septum which leaves the aorta less susceptible to remodeling after repair71. Therefore, treating acute Type B dissections with blood pressure management may not be the best approach, because if endovascular repair is needed later the process of remodeling may not happen. If the aneurysm and dissection extend distally beyond the diaphragm, the types of fenestrations that are found in extensive Stanford type B dissections leave the patient prone to dist al reperfusion of the false lumen even after cover of the proximal entry tear 72,73. These patients will require some sort of branched or fenestrated repair. If the patient h as an aneurysm complicated by type B dissection where visceral branches arise from both true and false lumen the treatment options are even further limited, and bridging stents will have t o cross the septum increasing the technical difficulty of completing the case. Small true lumens and visceral arteries arising from either true - or false - lumen and dissection extending to branches have made endovascular repair sometimes near impossible."

Numerous single site articles have been published regarding branched or fenestrated aneurysm repair following a prior aortic repair. The prior repairs documented include endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, aorto -bifemoral bypass, and open repair with a tube prosthesis for post -operative complications including Type I endoleak, suprarenal extension of the aneurysm, and anastamotic aneurysms 20. The most common risks and complications documented in the endovascular repair of a previous intervention include Type III endoleaks at the modular joint and the increased graft on graft friction making graft maneuverability and repositioning difficult. Despite the risks, it was determined that the option of endovascular repair may be advantageous to this group of patients with a hist ory of multiple abdominal operations or with serious cardiopulmonary risk factors as compared with the more invasive open surgical repair74. Endovascular Repair of TAAA s with prior repair and obstructive stenting While revision with open surgical techniques can be an option in certain cases, the outcomes are poor in most patients given the advanced nature of their disease and associated comorbidities. 38,39 Given the extensiveness of these secondary repairs, most patients are either deemed not a surgical candidate or their repair is postponed longer than recommended by the Society of Vascular Surgeons. Others have demonstrated the use of fenestrated and branched stent grafts to revise previous open and endovascular surgery. 40 Staged Endovascular Repair Planned Staged Procedures Staged procedures have been used in endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in an effort to limit the incident and severity of spinal cord ischemia. The hypothesis behind this is the staging of procedures allows for the development of a collateral network. The collatera ls would maintain some perfusion and allow other vessels to compensate reducing the overall impact of spinal cord ischemia. One center studying 87 Type II subjects found that staging reduced the overall SCI rates significantly 57.75. The SCI rate in single stage procedures was 37. 5% (12/32) and 11% (3/27) in two -stage procedures. The rate was slightly higher in unintentionally staged procedures at 14% (4/28). Unintentional staging was defined as prior aortic repair, 21% (6/28) had prior thoracic repair and the remainder were abd ominal aortic repair. In the staged procedures, the two -stage repair SCI events were all temporary and resolved by discharge and the unintentional staging had 10% (3/28) that resulted in permanent SCI. This study had a median time between stages of 5 mon ths (range 1 -60 months), but the investigators believe 2 -3 weeks to be optimum57.optimum75. The investigators also noted that symptomatic patients should be monitored and considered for earlier repair. While there is no specific length of aortic coverage to determine the threshold where one should consider staging, this study cites that aortic coverage of 200 cm or greater may indicate the threshold where subjects would benefit from staging. There are several techniques used for staging endovascular TAAA repair. Techniques include coverage of the proximal thoracic aorta up to the celiac arte ry in a staged procedure with visceral stenting performed at the completion procedure. Other techniques reference placing the main aortic stents, but allowing perfusion from an open celiac branch, perfusion branches, or unstented contralateral iliac limb5 8.limb76. The use of perfusion branches may be preferred to allow for better hemodynamics and avoid excessive pressurization of the aneurysm sac."

Several sites and investigators discuss alternative techniques such as chimney and snorkels as alternative techniques to be used in technically challenging cases complicated by anatomy59anatomy77, but fail to reference the use of staging and outcomes. Literature also cites several intra -operative tec hniques for bail -out maneuvers in the operating room60room78, but currently available TAAA technologies do not allow for staging of the aortic components and limited data is available on the o utcomes of these cases. Summary of Alternative Treatments A few endovascular options are available for treating thoracoabdominal aneurysms. A limited number of centers have access to commercially avail able branch -fenestrated devices, b ut they typically require customization. This customization has an associated lead time of several weeks. The endovascular options present a real problem of patients not being able to either travel to the select sites or being emergent and not having the time to wait for a custom graft. In these instances it may appropriate for the patients to be treated either with off -label devices (sandwich approach) or with physician -modified endografts. Sandwich configurations tend to have excellent patency rates but lack circumferential seal and fixation. Branch -fenestrated grafts have good seal and fixation but tend to have high frequency of reintervention and can be limited by patient anatomy. In all instances careful case planning is in order and all aspects of parallel grafts as well as branch -fenestrated grafts should be carefully considered relative to individual patient anatomy. Summary of Treatments for Staged Procedure or Staged Bail -out Procedure Due to the proximal seal zone of this device, several opt ions are available to stage patients with either a planned procedure or as a bail -out procedure. Literature supports the hypothesis that a controlled endoleak or perfusion branch can be protective for SCI events by helping create a protective collateral network. When planned visceral artery bridge endoleak can be provided via a low -risk staged procedure that does not put the patient at significant risk from the intervention. The use and experience with staged procedures as a bail -out method is not widely understood, but still allows the patient to maintain perfusion to the visceral vessels and lower extremities while they recover and prepare for completion of the procedure. The bail -out staging method is only intended to be used in extreme circumstances when patient status declines intraoperatively or unforeseen technical challenges are encountered. Benefits and Risks of Treatment Options Open Surgical Repair Contemporary series have shown that open repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms, is associated with a significant mortality risk and increase in major complications . One report describes 7,833 open TAAA repairs from 2000 to 2010 found a 30 day mortality rate of 7%, in -hospital mortality of 10%, spinal cord ischemia rates of 7.5%, renal failure rates of 19%, and pulmonary dysfunction rates of 36%21. The risks of open repair are significantly higher than any other option for repair. Open repairs are durable but have substantial perioperative mortalit y and postoperative morbidity. Additionally, due to existing comorbidities and the high risk for complications this is not an option for many patients. Endovascular Techniques There is limited availability of data rep orting the results of endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Many of these techniques require off -label use or modification of the grafts, which bring into"
13,page_13,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 13 of 54 question the safety and long -term durability. The literature suggests that s norkel and chimney grafts can be performed with decent technical success rates, but seal and f ixation and long term durability are in question and have not been formally evaluated45. A recent review found that 10.7% of patients in the literature treated for thoracoabdominal aneurysm with parallel grafts experienced type 1 endoleak . A 2004 to 2006 st udy of the novel t -branch device (Cook Medical) was studied in high risk subjects. The study showed a technical success of 93%, thirty -day mortality of 5.5%, major perioperative complications 14% including paraplegia 2.7%, new onset dialysis 1.4%, respira tory failure 6.8%, myocardial infarction 5.5%, and stroke 1.4%. All -cause mortality at twelve months was 6 subjects. There was no evidence of stent migration or aneurysm growth over the twelve month period75.79. In a study of type 4 thoracoabdominal aneurysms with custom manufactured fe nestrated grafts o ver a six year period, 231 patients were treated. Thirty day mortality was 2.6% and 2 year survival was 83%. Freedom from secondary intervention was 93% at 30 days and 73% at 2 years51. Experience with the t -branch device evaluating 22 patients between 2010 and 2013 reported a technical success of 100%. The re -intervention rate at 6 months was 90%, branch occlusion was 14%, paraplegia was 5%, and paraparesis in 5%. Again, these lack long -term data to address the durability of the stent grafts. In all endovascular options , close surveillance is mandatory for early identification of visceral or branched vessel stenosis or pre -occlusion . A retrospective study r eported by Sanford Health (IDE Application G140207, Clinical Use Summary) reports the only subjects that would not be ideal candidates include subjects with prior suprarenal fixation stents, dissection, present emergently. The retrospective study examines 12 patients which meet the clinical study criteria that were treated between 2012 and 2014. In this patient population, there was one subject with renal failure and one subject with a respiratory event in the first 30 days. There was one unrelated patie nt death and one CVA in the first year. Additionally, in this study there was one instance of branch vessel occlusion and secondary intervention. A large number of subjects may benefit from alternative endovascular treatments that may be performed with less risk of complications and shorter recovery time. For these subjects, endovascular repair with a manifold system that is not based on patient an atomy may be the only treatment option. Proximal Extension The overlapping or layering of Valiant stent grafts has been a standard practice in clinical care of subject s with thoracic aortic disease. Data reported by Sanford Health (IDE Application G140 207/S034, Clinical Use Summary) include 23 patients treated between 2012 and 2017 using a combination of the Valiant stent graft with the Thoracic Bifurcation no evidence of migration. There were three reinterventions (3/23, 13%) including one for a diss ection distal to the thoracic graft and two for endoleaks. There has been a follow -up of over 5 years supporting the safety of this device when layered to extend the proximal landing zone of the thoracic bifurcation. The one year survival of a non -emergen t TAA is 82% at one year76The one year survival of a non -emergent TAA is 82% at one year80 and 55.8% at 5 years77.81. This proximal extension is done in two layers to mitigate the risks of material fatigue and wear. Either Valiant Captivia or Valiant Navion may be used as a proximal extension. Staged Procedures"

We do not believe staging presents any new risks that are not currently covered under the risk profile for the VTAAA system, but these risks may happen at a higher frequency. These ris ks still present no greater risk than the probable risk from the progression of the patient’s condition. The increased risks for a planned stage procedure (visceral artery bridge endoleak or delayed distal seal) are risks from an additional procedure incl uding anesthetic and contrast exposure, compounded physiologic insult from multiples procedures, access site complications, wire injury, device integrity issues from component interaction, paraplegia, spinal cord ischemic event, aneurysm enlargement, aneur ysm rupture, and death. Increased risks for a bail -out staged procedure include the above risks and increased procedure time or failure to treat. Stent graft designs The manifold system has the advantage of being independent of patient anatomy allowin g for use off-the-shelf. It can also adapt to numerous anatomical variations including tortuosity and vessel location. The design allows for continuous flow to the visceral and infrarenal segments throughout the procedure. Additionally, the proximal dep loyment and delayed distal seal allows for more flexibility in stenting the visceral vessels, multiple bail outs, or staging of the procedure throughout device deployment. The importance of proximal deployment and gradual sweeping branch stents has been r eported as a critical element for maintaining vessel patency82. Analysis of bridging stent characteristics It has become evident that the use of the appropriate bridging stent including placement and stent is necessary to minimize risk of target vessel occlusion and kinking82. The ideal stent has not been determined or standardi zed, but currently a balloon expandable stent covered is preferred . The use of a covered stent has the advantages of optimal seal, minimizing risk of endoleak, and improved patency rates83. The two most widely used stents are the iCAST covered stent (Atrium Medical) and the JoMed stent (Abbott). The iCAST covered stent has been widely used and reported in the literature, and was the most frequently used stent in the recent GLOBALSTAR registry, with only five of 889 visceral arteries lost during follow up84. The JoMed stent has been also widely used and it is the balloon expandable covered stent of choice by the Cleveland Clinic group, with recent report of >95% 5 -year visceral artery patency among 632 subject s treated by fenestrated endografts85. The long -term risks of stent fracture and dislodgment have not been systematically reported but seem to be exceptionally low with adequate selection of proximal landin g zone. The Fluency stent (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, AZ) has been used by one investigator , with excellent patency rates and low risk of kinking or stent fracture86. Justification for Specific Patient Selection Criteria Relevant for this Study Treatment of TAAA aneurysms in all patients that meet entry criteria will be considered for this study. All patients diagnosed with a TAAA repair are considered high risk due to the natural history of a patient with a TAAA. Their options are limited for endovascular repair and due to the comorbidities in this population they are all high risk open repair. Additionally, all p atients undergoing open surgical repair of a thoraco abdominal aneurysm are considered to be at high risk for comorbidities and complications. Based on initial clinical experience, we believe that we can treat all patients with outcomes better to those of open surgical repair with less cost over the year. The current approach is an endovascular repair with lower surgical morbidity and mortality rate compared to open repair. Endovascular repair may also decrease the recovery time and length of hospital stay. From the initial clinical evaluation, certain pa tients may not be a good candidate for this approach have been identified. This patient population includes patients presenting emergently, with compromised renal access, or dissections. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study has been refine d to present a patient population that we feel may significantly benefit from this"

The inclusion criteria listed in section 6 including aneurysm characteristics, access vessel morphology, minimum neck length, diameter of aneu rysm, branch vessel size, patency of the four major visceral vessels, and size of distal fixation site are required as inclusion criteria to achieve an adequate seal zone and optimal placement with the stent graft and branches. The patient population bei ng exc luded from this study includes patients with a ruptured aneurysm (or contained rupture), obstructive stenting of the visceral vessels, or a dissection in the treated portion of the aorta. Also p atients with thrombus or excessive calcification within the neck of the aneurysm will be excluded as they put the patient at high risk of aneurysmal rupture or embolic event during surgical manipulation. Anatomy that does not allow for primary or assisted patency of the left subclavian artery will be excluded because it is required for access. Additionally, anatomy that would not allow for maintenance of at least one patent hypogastric artery will be excl uded in order to prevent organ and/or pelvic ischemia and paraplegia. In reference to the objective of cost of TAAA delivery, prior studies suggest the one-year costs associated with open TAA repairs are approximately $150,000+/ -$10,000. 56Assuming a power of 80% and alpha=0.05, we would need 20 patients per gr oup to detect a difference of $2 0,000 between the mean one - year costs of open TAA repair vs TEVAR. Longitudinal costs over a one year period, inclusive of global healthcare costs (readmission, o utpatient care, rehabilitation stays) are not available from the literature, but would be analyzed in this study, and thus inform healthcare policy, reimbursement strategies, and hospital administrators. Cost allocation for Open Thoracic Aortic Surger y (left) versus Thoracic Endovascular Surgery (right). Total cost for open surgery $64,531 vs. 61,909 for endovascular surgery (p=0.4) There are significant differences in the cost allocations to deliver open surgery versus endovascular TAAA repair, with device charges being central drivers to cost for endovascular TAAA repair and bed charges related to long hospitalization driving cost for open surgery.57 These costs allocations yield a similar hospitalization cost, yet don’t account for substantive differences in post -hospital disposition, wherein further costs may be rapidly accrued by need for subacute or rehabilitation facility more often with open surgery. This study will capture such critical information and inform payor structure. Rationale fo r Exposing Target Population to Potential Risks of Staging"

(Dr. Murray Shames, IDE G170024 and Dr. Thomas Maldonado, IDE G170048 ). There were no intra - operative deaths or SCI events, supporting that the device when used in planned staged procedure can be implanted safely and repeatedly. When compared to literature reported SCI rates for single stage TAAA procedures, this is a viable option for patients at higher risk for SCI events. Given the success we have exper ienced with patients treated to date and the low risk of the completion procedure, we feel that it is justified to expose the target patient population to the potential risk. Device Description and Drawings The Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System is made up of two main body components and makes use of several off -the-shelf FDA -approved stent graft components (see Appendix B for system drawing) . The two custom main body grafts are the thoracic bifurcation (Figure 1 A) and the visceral manifold (Figure 1 B). The thoracic bifurcation is deployed in the thoracic aorta and provides the proximal seal for the device . For a Type I or II thoracoabdominal aneurysm the proximal seal is in zone 3, for Type III and V the device seals in zone 4. The two limbs of the thoracic bifurcation allows for continued aortic flow while deploying the visceral segment. The visceral manifold is deployed within the larger 20 mm limb of the thoracic bifurcation to set the stage for the visceral debranching. The branches of t he visceral manifold extend to the visceral vessel with the use of covered bridging stents and provide distal seal of the manifold . The smaller 16 mm limb of the th oracic bifurcation extends to the infrarenal segment to either seal in zone 9 for a Type I and V and in zone 10 for Type II and III. All other connections in the device make use of sizes that are modular and independent of patient anatomy.

The thoracic bifurcation is composed of a self -expanding , metallic spring scaffold made from nitinol stents sewn to a polyester fabric graft with nonresorbable sutures and is manufactured in the following sizes: Table 2 . Thoracic bifurcation dimensions The proximal end of the visceral manifold stent graft (Medtronic) deploys into the 20 mm leg of the thoracic bifurcation and quadfurcates to perfuse the celiac, SMA, right, and left renal arteries via bridging stents. The visceral manifold is composed of a self -expanding, metallic spring scaffold made from nitinol stents sewn to a polyester fabric graft with nonresorbable sutures and is manufactured in the following sizes: Table 3. Visceral manifold dimensions Branch components The limbs of the visceral m anifold are extended to the target branch vessel with 9 -mm balloon expandable stents (Atrium, iCast). The Atrium iCasts are a stainless steel stent covered with a PTFE film and these are not modified by the physician. The balloon expandable stents are ov erlapped to reach the target branch vessel and the distal end is appropriately sized to the branch vessel. The interfaces between the branch components are lined with self -expanding bare metal nitinol stents (Medtronic, Complete SE) to improve resistance to kinking and stent graft separation. Iliac extension components The visceral bypass (Medtronic) deploys into the 16 mm limb of the thoracic bifurcation to perfuse the iliac segment. The visceral bypass is composed of a self -expanding, metallic spring scaffold made from nitinol stents sewn to a polyester fabric graft with nonresorbable sutures and is manufactured in the following sizes:"

Visceral bypass dimensions The infrarenal bifurcation (Medtronic) deploys into the visceral bypass to bif urcate aortic flow to the iliac segments. The infrarenal bifurcation is composed of a self -expanding, metallic spring scaffold made from nitinol stents sewn to a polyester fabric graft with nonresorbable sutures and is manufactured in the following sizes: Table 5 . Infrarenal bifurcation dimensions The iliac limbs and extenders (Medtronic, Endurant II) will be utilized from a commercially available Endurant II limb or appropriately sized iliac limb extension stent graft. These will be deployed in the infrarenal bifurcation and will provide distal seal of the stent graft system. The iliac limbs will be available in the commercially manufactured sizes and appropriately oversized for implantation in the infrarenal bifurcation. Principles of Operation The Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System works to bifurcate aortic flow upstream of the target visceral vessels. This bifurcation has a two -fold benefit. First it allows for aortic flow to be compartmentalized into a visceral segment and an infraren al segment providing for uninterrupted flow to the visceral vessels as well as the infrarenal segment throughout the procedure. If any of the connections cannot be made or the patient status declines during the procedure, then it can be staged and the connections can be made at a later date. Second, the upstream bifurcation encourages more favorable flow conditions in the bridging stents and target vessels which may prevent target vessel occlusion. This is due to the fact that the bifurcations are upstre am providing a sweeping transition into the renal arteries that is smooth providing for relatively laminar flow conditions. The design demonstrates that more central aortic flow is obtained with this design increasing flow rates in the visceral vessels to potentially increase target vessel patency (Figure 2) . The device can be used as an off -the-shelf system, negating the need for lead times associated with custom -built devices. The critical sizing that will need to be done is with the proximal end of the thoracic bifurcation , distal landing zone in the aorta or iliac arteries, and the bridging stents. The proximal end of the thoracic bifurcation can be sized by choosing any of the available sizes of the Medtronic TAAA thoracic bifurcation stent grafts , and the sizes of the bridging stents can be manipulated by choosing any of the commercially available sizes of the Atrium iCast. The Atrium iCasts are added to the system in -vivo and connected with passive fixation which negates the need to size the main b ody components based on the"
19,page_19,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 19 of 54 target vessel sizes. All other connections in the device make use of sizes that are the same, independent of patient anatomy. The deployment of this device is also independent of device alignment. Angular alignment of the thoracic bifurcation and the visceral manifold has very little impact on the outcome of the case. Longitudinal alignment is more important , but a safety factor has been built -in by calling for the distal ends of the visceral manifold to be deployed above their target vessels by 1 -2 cm . The longitudinal landing should be optimized so that the graft is not landed too low so that the connection with the visceral vessels is challenging to make.

Summary of Nonclinical Information to Support Study Initiation All non -clinical testing to support the manufactured device was performed by Medtronic and is reported in the Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System Master File, MAF -2551. Rationale for the Selection of Tests The rationale for the selection of tests is described in a device evaluation strategy table describing the Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System as a whole. This device eva luation strategy table describes the device procedure, performance, and basic safety -related attributes and addresses the potential failure modes and subsequent clinical mitigation strategies for the proposed investigational device. This is attached in Ap pendices. Report of Prior Investigations Synopsis The outcomes from prior clinical evaluation of the study device, including successfully treating 99% (84/85) of the intended target vessels and 96% (27/28) limb patency observed at one year, demonstrate the potential benefits of the device. When contrasted with open repair’s significant complication rates and branch fe nestrated device’s significant anatomi c and logistic limitations, the potential risk of the proposed novel graft does not outweigh the potential benefit of widened anatomic availability and improved patency rates. Given the potential benefits, we feel tha t it is justified to expose the target patient population to the potential risk. The non -clinical testing performed by Medtronic and the clinical results reported by Sanford Health show adequate safety of the device to support a durable comparison of long itudinal cost and patient centered outcomes for patients treated with the Medtronic Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System, and provide a valid comparison of open and endovascular surgical outcomes for TAAA patients."

After the patient has been properly consented, the patient will complete additional screening procedures that need to be completed. If the patient does not sign the informed co nsent, they will not be enrolled in the study. Information to be collected for screening includes: o Patient demographics o Medical history o Current health status o Physical examination o Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) o Pregnancy test (for female patients of childbear ing age) o CTA or CT with contrast of the chest, abdomen and pelvis if renal function allows. If renal function does not allow CT with contrast, an alternative contrast -enhanced imaging modality or, at a minimum, CT non -contrast in conjunction with Duplex u ltrasound will be used at physician discretion to evaluate: • Access vessels for compatibility with vascular access techniques • Obstructive stenting of the visceral vessels • Vessels diameters suitable for use with the Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft Syste m • Aneurysm rupture • Dissection • Patency of left subclavian artery, hypogastric arteries, lumbar arteries, and all four visceral vessels • Thrombus or excessive calcification in the neck of the aneurysm • Presence and location of any previously placed graft material o Complete blood count to evaluate white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets o Basic metabolic panel to evaluate creatinine o For patients with a history of smoking a pulmonary function test o Cardiac clearance Case Planning From the pre -op CT, the su rgeon will make the following measurements to size the endografts. 1. Length of the proximal seal zone, the distance required to land the thoracic bifurcation stent graft, this requires ≥ 2.5 cm section of healthy aorta or previously placed graft material , distal to the left subclavian artery or ≥ 2.5cm of surgical graft. 2. Diameter of the proximal landing zone to define the required diameter of the thoracic bifurcation stent graft. The diameter of the thoracic bifurcation stent graft should be 10 -15% larger than the diameter of the aorta to proper oversize the stent graft. 3. Maximum aortic diameter within the treated aorta 4. Distance from the top of the celiac to the top of the most cephalic renal. 5. Distance from the top of the proximal seal zone to the takeoff of the celiac. 6. Distance from the top of the celiac to the SMA. 7. Angulation at the mid -thoracic aorta. 8. Angulation at the diaphragm. 9. Angulation at the renal arteries. 10. Distance from the right r enal to the ispilateral internal iliac artery. 11. Distance from lower renals to aortic bifurcation. 12. Diameter of the branch vessels (celiac, SMA, left renal, and right renal) to determine the diameter bridging stents needed and percent patency. 13. Diameter of the right and left common iliac to secure the distal seal of the infrarenal bifurcation. 14. Diameter of the distal aorta to secure the distal seal in aorta"

Length of proximal seal zone 19. Length of aneurysm Note: If treating a dissection under the expanded selection arm the true and false lumen as well as any naturally occurring fenestrations will be evaluated to determine placement of the device and which lumen feeds the branch vessels. Note: If treating a patient with previously placed graft ma terial, either proximally or distally, it must be determined if the landing zones will be within the previously placed graft material or if it the landing zones extend beyond the limits of the previously placed graft material. Pre-operative procedures The patient will be removed from anti -coagulants prior to surgery. The day of surgery the following labs will be taken: o Complete blood count to evaluate white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets o Basic metabolic panel to evaluate creatinine o Prothrombin time (at physician discretion) o Partial thromboplastin time (at physician discretion) o Pregnancy test (for female patients of childbearing age) The patient will be treated with general anesthesia under standard medical practices along with placement of a lumbar drain when possible. The management of anesthesia and the lumbar drain will be performed by the staffed anesthesia team. Standard heparinization practices will be followed and active clotting time will be monitored throughout the procedure. The patient will be prepped in normal sterile fashion from the clavicle to mid -thigh. Additionally contrast will be diluted 50/50 in saline to reduce contrast exposure. Radiation reduction procedures will be followed as allowed. Thoracic Grafts as a method of staging. Use of thoracic grafts as a method of staging as a pre -operative adjunct procedure. a. Thoracic Graft Placement i. This refers to implanting stent -grafts into the thoracic aorta prior to enrollment into the IDE clinical study. ii. Device Visualization and Preparation Refer to the Instructions for use provided for the thoracic components to be used. iii. Device Placement Ensure that the distal edge of the thoracic graft is 5 -7 cm proximal to the celiac artery. iv. Thoracic Aorta Component Deployment Follow the stud y protocol or IFU for deploying the thoracic graft components. v. Completion The date of the index procedure will be targeted for within 6 weeks of the thoracic graft placement, but will be based on physician discretion, clinical presentation, and patient co mpliance. Impla nt Procedures Note: The design of the Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System is modular in nature and allows for bailouts and staging of the procedure following the deployment of each device. The procedure can be stopped at the comp letion of deployment of each component of the system and the patient has the opportunity for alternate endovascular, open repair techniques, or completion of the procedure at a later date if such conditions arise."
24,page_24,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 24 of 54 A. The implantation of the Valiant Thoracoa bdominal Stent Graft System is conducted under fluoroscopic/angiographic guidance. Refer to the Medtronic Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System Instructions for Use (IFU) for techniques and methods for device deployment and implantation. B. The Valia nt Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System may be implanted in a staged procedure per physician discretion (in either a planned or bail -out fashion). The physician may choose to perform the procedure in two or more stages due to the following conditions/scena rios including but not limited to: hypogastric patency, LSA patency, visceral vessel patency, decreased MEP/SEP potentials, at risk dominant segmental arteries, pulmonary status, or any patient whose physiologic limitations places them at risk because of the expected length of surgery. The preferred method for planned staging is to create a controlled endoleak which provides limited and temporary perfusion to the aneurysm sac. These methods include but are not limited to placing a bare metal stent in the celiac artery bridge, placing a bare metal stent in the bridge to an alternate visceral artery (ie:SMA or renal), or not completing distal seal in the aorta or iliac arteries. a. Planned Staged Procedure: Visceral artery bridge endoleak i. This refers to leaving open a portion of the covered stent bridge between the visceral manifold and target vessel. This is achieved by combining bare metal sten ts with covered stents to leave ~1 -2cm of uncovered conduit along the pathway. This intentional endoleak is res olved in a subsequent intervention where the open portion is covered over by an additional covered stent. It is preferable to achieve this config uration with the bridge to the celiac artery but it can be done in analogous fashion with either the SMA or ren al arteries. ii. Device Visualization and Preparation Refer to the Instructions for use provided for the bare metal stent for visualization and preparation instruction. iii. Bridging Stent Deployment Follow directions in the IFU when deploying bridging stents. Al ways deploy a covered stent in the leg of the visceral manifold per the Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System IFU (9mm iCast at 8atm inflation pressure). When possible, covered stents should be used in the target vessel. The chain of covered stents s hould be non -continuous in nature with at least one bare metal balloon expandable stent connecting them. The segment of completely bare stent should be short (~1 -2cm) with 2 -3cm overlapping with covered stent on either side. Creation of the uncovered segme nt in as straight a configuration as the anatomy allows will facilitate wire passage during the completion procedure below. Note: The controlled endoleak should never be created by leaving a visceral manifold limb unconnected to a visceral vessel or with an uncovered segment >2cm due to the pressurization of the aneurysm sac. If a visceral vessel is occluded, the corresponding visceral manifold limb should be plugged with a vascular plug and an alternative (patent) vessel utilized for the staging procedu re. The placement of the non-continuous chain of covered bringing stents and a bare metal stent helps direct flow while creating a controlled endoleak. iv. Completion Completion of the staged procedure is targeted for 4 -6 weeks following the index procedur e, but will be based on physician discretion, clinical presentation, and patient compliance. Note: The physician may choose to complete the procedure earlier if the patient is symptomatic or has other concerns for aneurysm sac growth or rupture."

Vascular access will be established in the brachial or axillary artery. The staged limb of the visceral manifold will be cannulated and the bare segment will be covered over by at least on e iCast. b. Planned Stage Procedure: Delayed distal seal i. This refers to completing the visceral debranching (manifold to target arteries) with covered stents and subsequently leaving out one or more of the distal aortic/iliac components. ii. Device Visualizatio n and Preparation Refer to the Instructions for use provided for the distal aortic/iliac components to be used. iii. Distal Aortic/Iliac Component Deployment Follow the study protocol or IFU for deploying the distal aortic/iliac components. iv. Completion Comp letion of the staged procedure is targeted for 4 -6 weeks following the index procedure, but will be based on physician discretion, clinica l presentation, and patient compliance. Note: The physician may choose to complete the procedure earlier if the pati ent is symptomatic or has other concerns for aneurysm sac growth or rupture. Completion procedure may be performed under local or general anesthesia. c. Bail-out Stage Procedure i. A bail -out method may be used for staging in the event patient status decline s during the case or inability to technically complete the case. ii. Device Visualization and Preparation Refer to the Instructions for use provided for the components to be used. iii. Device Deployment Refer to the Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System (IFU) for device deployment and implantation of the remaining components. iv. Completion due to patient status decline Completion of a bail -out staged procedure due to patient status should be complete d as soon as clinically feasible following the index procedure, but will be based on physician discretion, clinical presentation, and patient compliance. Note: The physician may choose to delay staging if the patient has complications or there are concer ns with completing the secondary procedure. v. Completion due to inability to technically complete the case Completion of a bail -out procedure due to technical challenges have the following options that present no more risk than the alternative of no treatm ent. a. Complete case at another date b. Medical management c. Convert to open surgical repair d. Referral to another facility/investigator that can complete the procedure Note: If treating a dissected aorta, naturally occurring fenestrations will be utilized first, and if necessary, there may be the additional use of an excimer laser or perforating needle and catheter to perforate the intimal membrane. This perforation will be used to enter either the false or true lumen in order to accommodate placement of t he device."

Note: For type 1 and 5 aneurysms the dist al end of visceral bypass (VB) should be sized to provide the distal seal with the aorta and then proceed to Completion Procedures , listed below . For type 2 and 3, proceed to deployment of the infrarenal bifurcation and Endurant II limb stent graft instru ctions in the Medtronic Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System IFU. Note: For proximal extension of the thoracic bifurcation, two Valiant thoracic grafts, either Valiant Captivia or Valiant Navion , can be used. One to extend the landing zone more proximally and one to layer to prevent wear. Deploy the Valiant Captiva or Navion thoracic grafts according to the ir respective manufacturer’s IFU and continue according to the Medtronic Valiant Thoracoabdomi nal Stent Graft System IFU. Note: If the VB is too short or too small to provide distal seal, a Valiant Captivia Free -Flo stent graft or Endurant Limb may be used in place or in conjunction with the Visceral Bypass to provide adequate distal seal. For type 2 and 3 proceed to deployment of the infrarenal bifurcation and Endurant II limb stent graft instructions in the Medtronic Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System IFU. If a commercially available Endurant limb or Valiant stent graft is used as the Vis ceral Bypass a commercially available Endurant mainbody stent graft with suprarenal fixation and a Gore cuff is required for adequate fixation. See below for deployment procedures. Note: If treating a subject with an occluded visceral vessel, a vascular p lug may be used to occlude the extra limb of the TAAA Visceral Manifold stent graft. C.

Dopperable signals will be confirmed in bilateral lower extremities and the access upper extremities. 7. Once adequate perfusion is confirmed, heparinization will be reversed. 8. In the event of patient deat h an autopsy may be performed. Post-operative Care Patients may remain intubated and be transferred to the ICU standard post -operative care. Patients with a spinal drain will remain in bed with optimization of spinal perfusi on pressure for 48 -72 hour s whenever possible . Post-operative care will be tailored to the patient taking into account events of surgery as well as pre -operative comorbidities to optimize the patient’s recovery.

Potential Study Device Benefits and Risks Based on Leveraged Clinical Information Patients diagnosed with TAAA have a poor natural history and require sur gical intervention to extend life. Several repair techniques have been developed, but each carry risk. As discussed previously, o pen repairs are durable but have substantial perioperative mortality and postoperative morbidity. Endovascular techniques ar e plagued by high procedural complexity and poor branch vessel patency , leading to accrual of costs over time . Parallel techniques may have poor sea l and may be prone to endoleak. In contrast, the manifold approach has circumferential seal at the proxima l end of the system. It has relatively simple case planning and it has virtually no ischemic time. Due to these advantages, w e believe the novel proposed technique may overcome so me of the current clinical risks with other approaches and may be associate d with reduced costs and better quality of life for the recipient. Patients who participate in this study may benefit from having a less invasive procedure compared to open repair of their thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. We expect the amount of discom fort, total blood loss, recovery time, and overall hospital stay to be less than open repair. Many of the patients presenting with a thoracoabdominal aneurysm are not candidates for open repair due to existing comorbidities. With the progressive nature o f the disease, these patients have limited options for medical intervention and are willing to assume a higher amount of risk. Patients who have a planned staged procedure may benefit from reduced SCI events, contrast exposure, fluids, procedure time, and less overall insult to their pulmonary status. We expect the amount of discomfort, total blood loss, recovery time, and overall hospital stay to be similar to an unstaged repair. These subjects would be placed at increased risks related to a second proce dure including those identified in the risk analysis. With the progressive nature of the disease, these patients have limited options for medical intervention and may be willing to assume a higher amount of risk. Patients after treatment with the Valia nt Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System may also have a better quality of life measure on objective QOL instruments. Using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 Item Survey (SF -36), we will study the physical functioning of the patients, role limitation s as a result of physical problems, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality (frequency of feeling full or tired), social functioning, and general mental health. Prior investigations have not been performed to identify these critical patient focuse d outcomes after endovascular repair of TAAA."

Study Statistics A. Primary outcome variable . The primary technical safety endpoint is freedom from major adverse events (MAE) at 30 days or during hospitalization if this exceeds 30 days. Major adverse events include all -cause mortality within 30 days of the procedure, bowel ischemia, myocardial infarction, paraplegia, renal failure, respiratory failure, and stroke. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the proportion of study subjects wit h treatment success at 1 year. Treatment success is defined as a composite of technical success and freedom from the following: o Aneurysm enlargement i.e., >5mm as compared to any previous CT measure using orthogonal (i.e., perpendicular to the centerline) measurements o Aneurysm rupture o Aneurysm -related mortality o Conversion to open repair o Secondary intervention for migration, Type I and III endoleaks, device integrity failure (e.g., fracture), and patency -related events (i.e., device component stenosis or occlusion and embolic events) The primary non -technical endpoint is improvement in quality -of-life scores (by SF36) and reduced 1 year costs for patients who undergo endovascular repair vs open surgery. B. Secondary outcome variables . Secondary endpoints include: • Technical success and the individual components of technical success:"

Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis. Sample Size Justification The sample size for the study is limited to 16 patients (10 subjects in the primary study arm and 6 subjects in the expanded selection criteria arm) , as this is adequate to provide preliminary clinical safety data and effectiveness of the device and provide the comparator group for open thoracoabdominal surgery patients . The device, while novel, has been evaluated in a clinical setting and has initially demonstrated both safety and effectiveness. The limited sample size allows adequate patient data to be collected under a controll ed protocol without exposing a large patient population to the risk associat ed with a novel device design. The safety and effectiveness data collected in this study will be pooled with other physician sponsored investigational device exemptions (PS -IDEs) e valuating the Visceral Manifold System and should be sufficient to develop an appropriate pivotal study."

Longitudinal costs over a one year period, inclusive of global healthcare costs (readmission, outpatient care, rehabilitation stays) are not available from the literature, but would be analyzed in this study, and thus inform healthcare policy, reimbursement strategies, and hospital administrators. Data Pres entation and Analysis Plan The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of this device as there are no or very limited devices and clinical options available for this patient population. The primary safety endpoint of this study is freedom from major adverse events (MAE) at 30 days or during hospitalization if this exceeds 30 days. Major adverse events include death, bowel ischemia, myocardial infarction, paraplegia, renal failure, respiratory failure, and stroke. The primary safety endpo int will be analyzed to determine statistical significance when compared to a target performance goal. A literature review of outcomes of open surgical repair was used to create the performance goal as there is not a comparable endovascular option to use for analysis. The performance goal was selected based on the range of subjects experiencing a major adverse event at 30 days. The range was calculated based on assumptions of the minimum and maximum number of subjects experiencing at least one MAE in the historical open surgical repair group (Table 6). Based on the literature reviewed and the above assumptions the range of subjects experiencing at least one MAE in the open surgical repair group is 30.5% to 77.4%. The primary effectiveness endpoint is t he proportion of the study subjects with treatment success at 1 year. Similarly, the data will be presented as quality outcomes with the number of study subjects with treatment success compared to the overall patient population. The primary non -technic al endpoint is patient quality of life domains at one year by SF36 testing at one year, and other follow -up intervals. Additionally, data outcomes from this study will be entered into a common vascular database so that data can be pooled with other PS -IDEs. This would provide consistent reporting across the PS -IDEs. Additionally, the PS -IDEs will be evaluating the same device and endpoints to allow for a pool -ability of data across the sites. The data will be separated into two separate study arms: pr imary study arm and expanded selection arm. The primary cost related outcomes are total, global healthcare costs from time of surgery to one year after treatment with the Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft Syste m. Statistical Methods The primary hypothes is of the Visceral Manifold Study is the number of subjects experiencing a major adverse event through 30 days will be less than a target performance goal (PG) of 50%. The PG was determined by using a conservative target that is approximately the average o f the open surgical repair MAE rate calculated above (30.5% -77.4%, Table 6). The anticipated test device 30 day MAE rate was based on the current rate of MAE’s (26%, Table 7) observed in 20 subjects meeting inclusion criteria into the primary study as of June 2016. The sample size for the Visceral Manifold Study was determined using an exact method based on a one-sided 2.5% significance level and an anticipated 26% investigational device 30 day major adverse event rate. Based on these assumptions, a sam ple size from the pooled PS -IDE data of 46 subjects provides at least 80% power to test the primary hypothesis."

Risk Analysis The risk analysis includes a description and analysis of all increased risks to the research subjects and how these risks will be minimized. The risks can be separated into three categories: procedural -related risks, device performance -related risks, and device material -related risks."

The Sanford DSMB will be responsible for examining accumulated safety and other relevant data at prespecified points during the course of the study in order to make recommendations concerning continuation, termination, or modification of the study . Based on the results of its deliberations, the DSMB can recommend continuation of the study unchanged, study interruption, study termination, modification of the study, or alteration in the data monitoring plan. 8. Risks a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency. b. Steps taken to minimize the risks. c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations. d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality. e. Financial risks to the participant s. The risk analysis includes a description and analysis of all increased risks to the research subjects and how these risks will be minimized. The risks can be separated into three categories: p rocedural -related risks, device performance -related risks, and device material -related risks . Procedural -related risks Procedural related risks including general and device specific procedural risks can result in several serious harms to the patient. These risks can be mitigated in a number of ways including strict adherence to the investigational protocol, patient eligibility criteria, procedures performed by trained and qualified physicians, use of standard surgical and endovascular techniques, and regular follow -ups. Although the risk is lowered by following these mitigation st rategies the risk cannot be completely eliminated. However, the potential benefit of the Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System as compared to other surgical techniques outweighs the potential procedural related risks to the patient. General proc edure related risks: Contrast toxicity can result in renal insufficiency or renal failure. Increased procedural difficulty may lead to an increase in the volume of contrast required. Adhering to the patient selection criteria should mitigate the risk of c ontrast induced nephropathy, but it can still occur. Allergic response to anticoagulation can occur. Patients who undergo the proposed procedure will require anticoagulation. A complete history of the patient before the procedure and adhering to the antic oagulant’s product standards will mitigate the risk of hypersensitivity reaction. Central nervous damage and subsequent paraplegia can occur when a significant amount of the aorta has stent graft coverage and a patient then becomes hemodynamically unstabl e. Conformance to patient selection criteria and proper spinal cord protection measures will mitigate the risk of spinal cord ischemia and subsequent paraplegia, but they can still occur. Peripheral nerve damage can occur at the surgical access sites. This procedure has 3 surgical access sites. Utilizing accepted surgical techniques performed by trained physicians will mitigate the risk of peripheral nerve damage, but some nerve damage can still occur. Paraplegia can occur when a stent graft is deployed in the aorta and blocks the lumbar arteries resulting in spinal cord ischemia. Although the risk can be mitigated by employing proper spinal protection measures (i.e. spinal drain), by screening patients for major lumbars feeding the spinal cord where the graft is intended to go, and for screening patients for occluded internal iliac arteries, paraplegia can still happen. Injury to access vessel from sheath placement can occur as a result of improper s heath sizing or placement. Adherence to good surgical technique minimizes the risk of damaging sites of sheath placement."
38,page_38,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 38 of 54 Dissection of a vessel can result from excessive wire manipulations due to an inability to access target vessels. Using proper endova scular technique and coming from a left arm access (provides a more direct path to the aorta) can mitigate this risk, but dissection can still occur. Embolism due to excessive wire manipulations may result in embolization in the arch or in the descending thoracic aorta resulting in occlusion of a great vessel, visceral branch vessel, or an extremity. Using proper endovascular and surgical techniques as well as accessing through the left arm to provide a straighter path to the aorta lessen the risk, but emb oli may still occur. Branch artery or parenchyma damage of ischemia can occur from blockage or occlusion of a branch vessel. Using fluoroscopic guided placement of devices, careful case planning, careful measuring when modifying devices, verification of alignment when resheathing devices, partial deployment to ensure proper placement, use of appropriate sized branch vessel stents and complaint transition zone between stents and native vessels, and monitoring devices over time will help mitigate this risk, but damage from ischemia can still occur. Systemic effects including increased risks of morbidity and mortality may be associated with this surgery. Using proper endovascular technique, strict adherence to the investigation protocol, and monitoring of device over time can mitigate this risk, but system effects can still occur. Local effects at the access site including wound infection, hematomas, and seromas, arterial or venous damage may occur. The risk can be mitigated by using accepted surgical t echnique by a trained physician, but local effects may still occur. Device -specific procedure related risks: Failure to access the aorta can result in vessel damage from wire manipulations and procedural failure. Using proper endovascular technique, co ming from a left arm access (provides a more direct path to the aorta), proper patient selection, and careful case planning for sizing can mitigate this risk, but vessel damage and procedural failure may still occur. Inaccurate deployment of the thoracic bifurcation due to mal -rotation or inaccurate placement may lead to vessel occlusion and end organ or limb ischemia. Although the risk of inaccurate deployment can be mitigated by careful case planning, use of partial deployment and pre -cannulated wires to aid positioning, and use of radiopaque alignment markers, mal -rotation or inaccurate placement may still occur. Inaccurate deployment of the visceral manifold due to mal -rotation or inaccurate placement may lead to vessel occlusion and end organ or li mb ischemia. Although the risk of inaccurate deployment can be mitigated by careful case planning, use of partial deployment and pre -cannulated wires to aid positioning, and use of radiopaque alignment markers, mal -rotation or inaccurate placement may sti ll occur. Inaccurate deployment of visceral bypass due to mal -rotation or inaccurate placement may lead to vessel occlusion and end organ or limb ischemia. Although the risk of inaccurate deployment can be mitigated by careful case planning, pre-cannula ted wires to aid positioning, and use of radiopaque alignment markers, mal -rotation or inaccur ate placement may still occur. Inaccurate deployment of infrarenal bifurcation due to mal -rotation or inaccurate placement may lead to vessel occlusion and end organ or limb ischemia. Although the risk of inaccurate deployment can be mitigated by careful case planning, pre -cannulated wires to aid positioning, and use of radiopaque alignment markers, mal -rotation or inaccurate placement may still occur. Inaccur ate deployment of iliac limbs due to mal -rotation or inaccurate placement may lead to vessel occlusion and end organ or limb ischemia. Although the risk of inaccurate deployment can be mitigated by careful case planning, pre -cannulated wires to aid positi oning, and use of radiopaque alignment markers, mal-rotation or inaccurate placement may still occur."

Displa cement of the iCast covered, balloon expandable branch vessel stent due to incomplete apposition of the stent graft, non -compatible or damaged components/accessories, or size mismatch can result in endoleak, aneurysm enlargement, aneurysm rupture, vessel o cclusion, end organ or limb ischemia. Although the risk can be mitigated with the use of careful case planning, strict adherence to the investigation procedure, use of industry standard seal zone lengths and oversizing, completion angiograms, regular foll ow-ups, treatment with cuffs, ballooning, or additional stent grafts, the risk of displacement still exists. Inadvertent internal iliac occlusion and ischemic colitis due to vessel occlusion can occur. The risk can be mitigated with the use of careful c ase planning, using proper endovascular technique, completion angiograms, and regular follow -ups. Device -related risks There are device -related risks of the modular components succumbing to material fatigue resulting in component separation, endoleak, k inking, or migration. These risks can be mitigated several ways including adhering to industry standard seal zone lengths, proper oversizing, lining branch stents with self - expanding stents, regular follow -ups to identify early evidence of migration or se paration and allow for appropriate treatment, by the use of completion angiography coupled with cuffs, ballooning, or additional stent grafts if evidence of endoleak. Migration can occur when a stent graft is deployed with inadequate landing zone , impro per oversizing, resulting in vessel occlusion, endoleak, aneurysm enlargement, or aneurysm rupture. Although the risk of migration can be mitigated by using industry accepted overlaps, proper oversizing, accepted suture techniques, and adhering to the fol low up schedule, it can still occur. Component separation can occur when a stent graft is deployed with improper overlap, improper oversizing, or when a suture line fails, resulting in vessel occlusion, endoleak, aneurysm enlargement, or aneurysm rupture . Although the risk of component separation can be mitigated by using industry accepted overlaps, proper oversizing, accepted suture techniques, and adhering to the follow up schedule, it can still occur. Graft occlusion due to angulation, kink, or mal -alignment modular components can lead to implant thrombosis. Using careful case planning for appropriate sizing, adherence to the investigational protocol, lining with self -expanding stents and regular patient follow -up can mitigate this risk, but graft o cclusion can still occur. Endoleak and endotension due to inadequate seal between graft and components, graft permeability , poor graft seal, improper oversizing, suture line holes, or graft wear can result in aneurysm enlargement, aneurysm rupture , or retrograde flow from branch arteries . Although the risk can be mitigated with completion angiograms, regular follow -ups, and treatment with secondary procedures or devices (cuffs, balloons, and stents), endoleak or endotension can still occur. Graft inf ection can result in fever, sepsis, and conversion to open repair. The risk can be mitigated by following the investigational protocol, administering post -operative blood tests to monitor condition, use of antibiotics, and regular follow -up. Even with th ese mitigation strategies the risk of graft infection still exists."
41,page_41,"Date: June 30 , 2020 Principal Investigator: James Black Application Number: IRB00075706 Version 4.0 Page 41 of 54 Branch stent graft kink or crush can result from aneurysm sac remodeling, stent graft migration, or fatigue of implant. Although the risk can be mitigated by lining the bridging stents with self -expanding bare metal stents, kink can still occur. And if it does it may result in vessel o cclusion or embolism . Aortic stent graft kink may result in misalignment of kink of components ultimately resulting in vessel occlusion or embolism. Although the risk can be mitigated by careful case planning, proper subject selection, lining bridging stents with self -expanding stents, adherence to the investigational protocol, and regular subject follow -ups, it can still happen. Stent breakage due to manufacturer flaw, fatigue, poor placement of stent, or compatibility with other components can resul t in vessel occlusion, embolism, migration, separation, vascular trauma, and vessel rupture. Although the risks can mitigated with the use of careful case planning for placement and sizing, proper oversizing, use of compatible components, and regular foll ow-up, stent breakage can still occur . Branch vessel stent crush due to aneurysm remodel , longitudinal or rotational movement, placement, fixation, or material fatigue and subsequent decreased kink resistance can result in branch vessel occlusion, lum en obstruction, end organ or limb ischemia. These can be mitigated with the use of careful case planning for appropriate sizing, adherence to the investigational protocol, lining bridging stents with self -expanding stents to increase radial resistance, an d regular follow -up. Barb fracture /separation due to placement, fixation, or fatigue can result in migration, separation, vascular trauma, or embolism. This can be mitigated with the use of careful case planning for subject selection and regular follow -up. Fabric wear due to material fatigue can result in endoleak, component separation, or migration. Using proper placement of devices and regular follow -up, but fabric wear can still occur. Type III endoleak due to a defect in the graft or inadequate seal between modular graft components can lead to aneurysm enlargement, aneurysm rupture, or retrograde flow from branch arteries . Although the risk can be mitigated with careful construction of the grafts, proper seal between grafts, completion angiogram s, regular follow -ups, and treatment with secondary procedures or devices (cuf fs, balloons, and stents), endoleaks can still occur. Biocompatibility risks due to use of materials that are not biocompatible can lead to adverse reactions in subject s. This can be mitigated by only using commercially available materials that have acceptable biocompatibility profiles. Even with these mitigation strategies, adverse reactions can occur. 4.5.2 Mitigation of Risks Significant c are and thought has gone into designing the Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System and investigational procedure for proper delivery and deployment of devices to minimize risks to patients to the greatest degree possible. The design of the stent graft is bifurcated to provide flow to uninterrupted blood flow to the visceral and infrarenal segments during the repair process, negating the need for aortic clamping utilized in open repair. Additionally, the design of the stent graft system is modular to allow for bailouts and staging of the procedure throughout device deployment. At any point in the procedure, the patient still has the opportunity for alternative treatments such as open surgical repair or other endovascular techniques. All efforts will be made to minimize the identifie d risks including: • Adherence to eligibility criteria and screening procedures to ensure that appropriate patients are selected and enrolled."

Other reports: The sponsor -investigator will provide accurate, complete, and current information about any aspect of the investigation upon request from the reviewing IRB or F DA. Data and Safety Monitoring This study will have oversight by Sanford Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of independent scientific and bio -statistical expertise, who are not participating as investigators in the study. Sanford is an integrated healthcare system comprised of hospitals, physicians , and other healthcare providers and facilities located in Sioux Falls, SD . The Sanford DSMB will comprise at least 1 physician experienced in treating the study population and an independent b iostatistician (including NAMSA statistical support). The Sanford DSMB will work with the PI to monitor and evaluate the safety of subjects and progress of the study. The board will meet after every 5th patient receiving the investigational device and annually during the follow -up period to review subject data. The board will also meet at unscheduled times according to clinical necessity. The data safety reports reviewed at each meeting will contain enrollment data and all documented adverse events experi enced by the participants and treatment outcomes. The focus of the analysis is to determine whether enrollment should continue or be closed and whether the trials should continue as originally designed or require modification/amendment. Definitions Aortic aneurysm enlargement : >5mm as compared to any previous CT measure using orthogonal (i.e., perpendicular to the centerline) measurements Aortoiliac aneurysm: aneurysm of the abdominal aorta and including one or both of the iliac arteries Aneurysm -related mortality : Death o ccurring within 30 days or during hospitalization following the index procedure, unless there is evidence of accidental or self -inflicted death; Death occurring within 30 days or during hospitalization following conversio n to open repair or a secondary intervention for migration, Type I and III endoleaks, device integrity failure (e.g., fracture), or patency -related events (i.e., device stenosis or occlusion and embolic events) , unless there is evidence of accidental or se lf-inflicted death; Death occurring within 30 days or during hospitalization for a complication of the aneurysm or a complication associated with the device, such as: • aortic rupture • fistula formation (e.g., aorto -enteric ) • embolization • malperfusion of organ(s) or limb(s)"

Medicare Generalizability The Valiant Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System is intended to treat thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms and the highest incidence of this disease is observed in Medicare eligible patients. A 2013 market survey of inpatient data revealed that 79.8% (1642/2058) of all thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms occurred in patients over the age of 65. In that same survey, Medicare was the principal payer in 76.3% of those cases and the secondary payer in 82.6% of those cases58. Aneurysmal degeneration occurs more commonly in the aging populati on. Aging may lead to weakening of the aortic wall due to changes in the collagen and elastin. Additionally, comorbidities that may increase the risk for aneurysm formation are smoking, chronic obstructive, pulmonary disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis , male gender, older age, high body mass, genetic disorders, and family history87."
