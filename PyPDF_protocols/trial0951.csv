Study Duration Total study duration will be approximately 30 months: 21 months of recruitment period + 9 months of treatment period , approximately from January 15th, 2017 to June 30th, 2020. The extension period may continue beyond these dates. The study data will be analyzed when the required number of events (approximately 3 25 deaths) are observed. This is projected to occur approximately 9 months after the last subject is randomized. All subjects will be treated and/or followed after randomiz ation until the study data analysis is performed, and then they will be monitored for survival status until death. Patients continuing to benefit from apatinib treatment , after final analysis and subsequent unblinding, will be given an option to consent to continue treatment with apatinib. Placebo patients will stop taking the placebo and will be monitored for survival status until death. Study Phase Phase II I Objective Primary objective To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of Apatinib compar ed to Placebo in patients with Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (GC) Secondary objectives • To evaluate progression- free survival (PFS) • To evaluate objective response rate (ORR)"

Study Overview This is a prospective, randomized, double- blinded, placebo -controlled, multinational, multicenter, parallel -group, phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) compared to Placebo plus BSC in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who failed two or more prior trea tment regimens . After informed consent and screening procedures, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Apatinib or Placebo group. All subjects will receive best supportive care (BSC). The randomization will be stratified by the following factors; Geograph ic region (Asia vs. North America/Europe), Disease measurability (measurable vs. nonmeasurable ), Prior ramucirumab treatment (Yes vs. No), and Treatment therapy line (3rd vs. ≥4th). Randomized subjects will receive either the test product Apatinib at 700"

If treatment related toxicity is detected, two steps of dose reductions ( 600 mg and 400 mg for Apatinib ) are allowed during the entire study period according to the dose adjustment plan (refer to Section 4.4 ) Tumor response and progression will be assessed every other cycle (8 weeks interval) by a local imaging facility. Patient treatment decisions will be made based on local imaging r esults and investigator opinion which will be entered into the case report forms. Scans will be obtained at baseline and throughout the study and will be analyzed post-study by a central imaging analysis facility. Centrally imaging results will determine the patient ’s best tumor response and time of progression according to RECIST 1.1. Post-treatment follow -up visit will be made at 4 weeks after the end of treatment (EOT) and then survival follow -ups will follow at 8 weeks interval till the death of the subject or closure of the study. Extension Period: Continued treatment with apatinib and best supportive care or best supportive care alone during the extension period of the study is only for those subjects that are taking either apatinib or placebo at the time of unblinding, respectively. For all other subjects that have not been considered as reaching the end of study (i.e. subjects in survival follow - up) and are not taking study medication at the time of unblinding, they will be followed for survival status only. It is anticipated that less than 40 subjects will be taking study medication at the time of unblinding of which less than 30 will be taking apatinib. Subjects taking apatinib at the time of unblinding: After the End of the Study (EOS) when the study is unblinded, subjects still on apatinib treatment with best supportive care, if determined to be safe to continue therapy by the investigator, may consent to continue this treatment until disease progression, intolerability, death, withdrawal of consent, or, if none of those has occurred, apatinib becomes available through other methods acceptable to the applicable regulatory authority .

For apatinib subjects not willing to consent for further treatment after the study is unblinded or for those where the protocol extension period has not been approved locally or nationally, will stop the apatinib administration and perform the End of Treatment visit , Post-treatment Follow - up for safety, and Survival Follow -up as appropriate. A study schedule for subjects continuing apatinib treatment in the extension period is provided in Table 2. Subjects taking placebo at the time of unblinding: Subjects who are determined to be taking the placebo and best supportive care when the study is unblinded may consent to continue to be followed for survival status and continued best supportive care . For those subjects that were taking placebo, no End of Treatment visit is required. Best supportive care may be continued for patient s no longer taking placebo, if appropriate , and only until other anti -cancer therapy is administered, disease progression, intolerability, death, or withdrawal of consent . The study schedule for subjects receiving only best supportive care in the extension period is to be determined by the investigator as standard of care for managing that supportive care. Japan Specific Safety Run- In: The AM104 ethnic bridging study determined that there is no statistically significant difference in Japanese ethnic popula tion pharmacokinetics as compared to Chinese and/or C aucasians that would make it unsafe to proceed at the study starting dose. The AM104 study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 20 1 mg of Apatinib in 18 healthy volunteers of each of three specific ethnic populations; Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian. Initiation of enrollment in Japan will have a safety run- in approach to further confirm the safety of the study starting dose in this ethnic population.

Exploratory Measures: ・ Pharmacodynamic marker: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), sVEGFR- 1, sVEGFR2 and sVEGFR3. ・ Pharmacokinetics Statistical Methods Efficacy analysis The primary analysis of OS will be conducted in the ITT population (all randomized subjects) using a stratified (by the randomization stratification factors) logrank test at the two-sided alpha= 0.05 level of significance. If the primary analysis of OS is statistically significant, then the key secondary endpoints of PFS and ORR will be analyzed using a fixed- sequence testing procedure. First, PFS will be analyzed using the same statistical methods that are used in the primary efficacy analysis of OS. If the analysis of PFS is statistically significant, then ORR will be analyzed using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by the randomization stratification factors. However, if a prior test is not statistically significant, then the subsequent analyses will be exploratory rather than confirmatory. All other secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using tw o-sided tests at the alpha=0.05 level of significance, with no adjustments for multiplicity DCR will be analyzed using the same methodology as described for ORR. For the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnai re-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ -C30) and EuroQol 5-Dimension 5- Level (EQ -5D-5L) Questionnaire, the treatment groups will be compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models with treatment group and the randomization stratification variables as factors, and with the baseline value of the corresponding endpoint as a covariate.

Background Gastric cancer is the 4th most common cancer world -wide and is the 4th most common cause of cancer -related death.1 The p revalence rate of gastric cancer is higher in Asian, South America and Eastern Europe than in Western Europe and North America.2 Surgical resection is effective for complete cure of gastric cancer , but is only applicable to localized disease. A majority of patients have locally advanced, metastatic , or recurrent cancer that is inoperable. For such patients, extending the duration of survival by systemic chemotherapy is the primary treatment, and platinum and /or 5 -FU based combination chemotherapy is widely used globally. As a first -line standard chemotherapy, multiple -agent combination chemotherapy is used, such as DCF (docetaxel; cisplatin; 5- fluorouracil) in the US, ECF (epirubicin; cisplatin; 5- fluorouraci l) in Europe, CF (cisplatin; 5-fluorouracil either as infusional 5- FU or oral fluoropyrimidines like capecitabine or S -1) in Korea.3 According to several recent meta -analyses which analyzed the role of chemotherapy in patients with inoperable or metastasiz ed gastric cancer, conservative chemotherapy is reported to improve survival and quality of life compared to the best supportive care.4, 5, 6 However, the response rate for first -line therapy in advanced gastric patients is below 50%, and even in those fortunate cases that respond to the first -line chemotherapy, many patients re -experience tumor progression over time, often developing peritoneal metastasis and experiencing rapid exacerbation of systemic conditions. This result s in 20~50% of patients requiring second -line chemotherapy in actual clinical practice.7 A typical treatment therapy of advanced and metastatic gastric cancer is a combination therapy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin, which was not inferior in overall survival compared to 5 -FU-based therapy with no significant difference in response rate. Such results indicate that capecitabine, an oral 5 -FU analog , may replace the continuous intravenous infusion of 5- FU and supported that the combination therapy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin is a globally acceptable standard therapy. 8, 9 As such, existing cytotoxic chemotherapies are based on fluoropyrimidine, cisplatin and anthracycline which can increase the oncological effect by combining two or three drugs rather than one, but improvement in 5 -year survival is around 30– 35% 10 , 11 , 12 and median overall survival only reaches 9~ 11 months for inoperable advanced gas tric cancer.8 In addition, combination therapy of chemotherapy agents may increase"
30,page_30,"Protocol No. LSK- AM301 Protocol v ersion 5.0_20181116 LSK Bio Partners, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 31 of 32 anticancer effect but also increases the risk of toxic ity. Many gastric cancer patients are elderly and also have other diseases which may limit the use of chemotherapy agents. Therefore, to improve disadvantages of the existing anticancer therapies such as treatment toxicity, inconvenient administration method, limited survival extension, development of new chemotherapies and drugs for targeted treatment is warranted. 13 Drugs developed for targeted therapy of gastric cancer can be functionally broken into (1) HER2 signaling pathway inhibitor s, (2) EGFR signaling pathway inhibitor s and (3) Neovascular inhibitor s, while the inhibitors for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), mTOR and MET pathway have also been developed recently and are being studied for clinical application.14 Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) among the molecular targeted therapies of gastric cancer is anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, a HER2 signaling pathway inhibitor, and a combination therapy of Trastuzumab and chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients with HER2 overexpression has been approved by the US FDA, Europe’s EMEA and Korea in 2010. This was based on the result drawn from the ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) study in gastric cancer patients with HER2 overexpression that adding Trastuzumab significantly improves the duration of survival (13.8 months vs. 11.1 months, p = 0.0046). 15 Gefitinib and Erlotinib, Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway inhibitors, did not show a significant effect on gastric cancer as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR -1. 16 , 17 In addition, cetuximab and panitumumab, anti -EGFR monoclonal antibodies, were assessed in phase III study. The median PFS for patients allocated capecitabine- cisplatin plus cetuximab was 4.4 months (95% CI 4.2 -5.5) compared with 5.6 months (95% CI 5.1 -5.7) for patients allocated capecitabine- cisplatin alone (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.92- 1.29; p -value=0.32) in cetuximab phase III study, EXPAND study. 18 For panitumumab phase III study, REAL- 3 study, the median overall survival in patients allocated EOC (epirubicin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine) was 11.3 months (95% CI 9.6- 13.0) compared with 8.8 months (95% CI 7.7- 9.8) in patients allocated modified- dose EO C plus panitumumab (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07- 1.76; p -value=0.013). These studies showed negative results.19 However, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF R-2) inhibitor, Ramucirumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) and has recently obtained approval in the US and is being used because the mean overall survival was at least 20% greater for the Ramucirumab (5.2 months) group than for the Placebo group (3.8 months)"

CONFIDENTIAL Page 32 of 33 in a phase III study (REGARD study) . 20 , 21 , 22 In addition, the combination of ramucirumab with paclitaxel significantly increases overall survival compared with placebo plus paclitaxel (9.6 months vs. 7.4 months, HR 0.807 [95% CI 0.678- 0.962; p - value=0.017]) in a phase III study (RAINBOW study). Based on the results, ramucirumab is recommended as a standard second- line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer.23 These drugs have less toxicity than existing anticancer drugs and have an advantage of allowing patient -tailored trea tment as they are designed to rea ct to signaling pathways specific to cancer. Lately in addition, clinical studies on new compounds of tyrosine kinases receptor inhibitors which suppress vascular angiogenesis, growth and metastasis are being carried out. Vascular endothelial cell growth f actor (VEGF) is a circulating signal protein and because it induces a number of vascular angiogenesis - related responses such as cell proliferation or migration, vascular infiltration, and movement from bone marrow to stem cells when combined with a VEGF re ceptor (VEGFR), VEGF and VEGFR become physiologically important targets. An anti -VEGF monoclonal antibody, Bevacizumab, was evaluated in phase III study, and the AVAGAST study is the first antiangiogenic agents trial in gastric cancer. Even though the study did not show significant improvement of the OS (bevacizumab plus chemotherapy: 12.1 months vs. placebo plus chemotherapy: 10.1 months; HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.79 – 1.03; p- value=0.1002]), adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy was associated with significant incre ases in both PFS (6.7 months vs. 5.3 months; HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.68 – 0.93]) and ORR (46.0% vs. 37.4%; p -value=0.0315) in the first- line treatment of advanced gastric cancer. 24 The VEGFR family is comprised of VEGFR1/Flt -1, VEGFR2/KDR/Flk -1 and VEGFR3/Flt -4. V arious inhibitors which target the VEGFR family, including sorafenib, vandetanib, cediranib, and sunitinib, have been developed to date. These are all non - specific VEGF receptor small molecule inhibitors . Sorafenib achieved an approval for advanced renal cancer25 and liver cancer26 . Sunitinib achieved approval for gastrointes tinal stromal tumor27 and advanced renal cell cancer28 and has been studied for advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.29 1.2. General Information The family members of VEGF receptors include: VEGFR -1(Flt-1), VEGFR -2 (KDR/Flk - 1), VEGFR -3 (Flt -4). Vascular angiogenesis in tumors is mainly induced by VEGF binding to VEGFR -2 (KDR/Flk -l). VEGFR -2 signaling in tumor vascular endothelial cells is now"
32,page_32,"Protocol No. LSK- AM301 Protocol v ersion 5.0_20181116 LSK Bio Partners, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 33 of 34 recognized as a pivotal and rate- limiting step in tumor angiogenesis, and much research has focused on generating novel agents that inhibit this pathway. Most human tumors produce a high level of VEGF to trigger production of vasculature necessary to sustain tumor growth. Recently there have been several new drug candidates targeting inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity by inhibiting the VEGF receptors. Apatinib is an orally administered small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which selectively inhibits VEGFR -2 to suppress endothelial cell migration and proliferation and, by reducing the tumor microvascular density, induces an antiangiogenic effect and antineoplastic effect. Clinical study results of Apatinib are summarized in the following. YN968D1 is the mesylate salt o f apatinib freebase. Many prior studies were conducted referring to dose of apatinib as the weight of apatinib including the mesylate salt. In this study and in future studies, LSK will refer to apatinib dose strength as the weight of the apatinib freebas e alone instead of weight of the apatinib mesylate salt. The freebase dosage is approximately 81% of the mesylate dosage. The formulation is the same. Referring to apatinib dose strength as freebase is more aligned with standards for referencing total active product. 1)Phase I, dose escalation, PK study in subjects with advanced cancer 30 A phase I dose escalation study was conducted in China from August 2007 to March 2009, which enrolled 46 subjects at . Of these, 19 subjects were enrolled in a dose- escalation study . Another 27 subjects were enrolled in the PK study. The subjects enrolled primarily were gastrointestinal tumor (73.9%). All subjects had received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen , 84.7% had prior surgery and 27% had radiation treatment . Measurable lesions were documented in 45 of the subjects at baseline. Subjects were treated for up to 56 days of continuous therapy and all subjects in the study received a total of 133 cycles of therapy . The study was conducted at five dose levels (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg, 850 mg, and 1,000 mg of YN968D1 [as apatinib mesylate] ). One (1) additional subject was included in the 250 mg -cohort due to withdrawal of consent of another participant. Two (2) DLTs at the dose level of 1,000 mg/day were documented. One (1) subject had Grade 3 hypertension and the other had Grade 3 hand -foot syndrome (HFS). Three additional subjects were enrolled in the 850 mg group. None of the total six (6) subjects in the 850 mg-cohort experienced DLTs. Therefore, the MTD for this dosing schedule was"
33,page_33,"Protocol No. LSK- AM301 Protocol v ersion 5.0_20181116 LSK Bio Partners, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 34 of 35 determined to be 850 mg daily of YN968D1. Pharmacokinetic assessments were also conducted on eleven (11) subjects in the 750 mg-single -dose cohort who continued to the 750 mg-multiple -dose cohort after a 7 -day- washed- out period while one withdrew consent. Thus, the PK analysis population for single -dosing was n = 8 for 500 mg -cohort, n = 12 for 750 mg- cohort, n = 8 for 850 mg- cohort (one subject from the dose- escalation cohort provided consent to participate in the PK cohort), and for multiple- dosing 750 mg- cohort (n = 11) for 56 days. The overall mean pharmacokinetic parameters of YN968D1 after single and multiple oral dose administration are summarized in Table 3 below. For single dose evaluation, C max was achieved in 3 to 4 hours after oral administration. The plasma level of YN968D1 varied considerably between patients. The concentration of YN968D1 in plasma increased with dose. C max and AUC 0-24 showed a dose- dependent increase at doses from 500 to 850 mg, whereas increased slightly more than dose proportional ly at dose of 850 mg dose , and showed high inter -individual variability . The e limination half -life of the terminal phase (t 1/2λz), estimated to be approximately 9 hours , was consistent over the three dose levels. For multiple -dose at 750 mg, the mean C max was 2,421 ng/mL on Day 1, which increased to 2,553 ng/mL by Day 6 , and the mean AUC 0-24 was 19,399 ng·h/mL on Day 1, which increased to 25,449 ng·h/mL by Day 6. There was no further increase in Cmax and AUC beyond 6 days of multiple dosing, and this was similar for the mean elimination t1/2. Steady -state conditions were achieved by Day 6 , suggesting no accumulation during 56 days of once -daily dosing. Table 3.

The most frequ ently observed adverse drug reactions were hypertension (69.5% , 29 grade 1-2 and 3 grade 3- 4), proteinuria (47.8% , 16 grade 1-2 and 6 grade 3 -4), and hand- foot syndrome (45.6% , 15 grade 1-2 and 6 grade 3 -4). Hypertension w as generally manageable with antih ypertensive agent s. Approximately 10 % of the subjects who developed HFS progressed to Grade 3. Other treatment -related AEs were generally mild or moderate in severity and were manageable. The treatment was discontinued for both of the two subjects who experienced DLT. After recovery, one (1) subject was able to reinitiate treatment at a reduced dose. A total of 15 subjects received at least one cycle of YN968D1 at the initial dose. Four (4) subjects discontinued the treatment during Cycle 1, of which 1 subject in the 250 mg dose group due to disease progression and 3 in the 1,000 mg dose group due to intolerable toxicity. Eighteen (18) subjects had a dose reduction for different toxicities du ring the extended treatment ( 1 in 1,000 mg group, 13 in 850 mg group , and 4 in 750 mg group). For those subjects who experienced dose reduction, the mean duration of treatment with YN968D1 was 5.4 months. Among the 45 subjects with measurable lesions, 4 withdrew consent due to receiving other therapy, 1 experienced intolerable toxicity , and 3 were lost to follow -up. Therefore, 37 subjects were evaluable for best overall response. Partial response (PR) was observed in 7 (18.9%) subjects, stable disease (SD) in 24 subjects (64.9%), resulting in a disease control rate of 83.8% at 8 weeks.

Median overall survival (OS) of Group A, B and C was 2.50 months (95 % CI, 1.87 -3.70 months), 4.83 months (95 % CI, 4.03- 5.97 months) and 4.27 months (95 % CI, 3.83- 4.77 months), respectively, and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.40 months (95 % CI, 1.20 -1.83 months), 3.67 months (95 % CI, 2.17 -6.80 months) and 3.20 months (95 % CI, 2.37 -4.53 months), respectively. Both the PFS (P <0.001) and OS (P <0.001, P = 0.0017) showed a statistically significant difference between the YN968D1 group and the Placebo group. Nine patients had a PR (Group B n=3, Group C n=6). Toxicities were tolerable. Toxicities of Grade 3 or over were hand -foot syndrome and hypertension, and hematologic toxicities of Grade 3 or over were rare. Considerin g the safety profile of YN968D1 at the two dose levels of 850 mg and 425 mg, the dosing regimen of 850 mg"

To sum up, YN968D1 increased PFS and OS in patients with advanced gastric cancer who failed to second- line or higher anticancer therapy. 3) Phase III clinical study in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer32 A multicenter, randomized, double- blind, phase III study was conducted in patients who failed to second- line therapy. The study was designed as 28 days/cycle, consisting of YN968D1 850 mg (as apatinib mesylate) group and Placebo group. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. Randomization was done centrally and was stratified by the number of metastatic sites (≤2 or >2). A total of 2 67 randomly assigned subjects were included in FAS population; 176 in the YN968D1 group and 91 in the Placebo group. As for the efficacy, mean overall survival was statistically greater for the YN968D1 group than for the Placebo group (6.5 months versus 4.7 months ; HR= 0. 709; 95% CI (0.537~0.937 ); p< 0.01 49). mPFS also showed the same result (2.6 months versus 1.8 months ; HR= 0. 444, 95%CI (0. 331~0. 595), P<0.001). ORR was 2.84% and 0.00% for the YN968D1 group and the Placebo group, respectively. As for the safety, YN968D1 was mostly controlled by treatment discontinuation or reduction. The most common adverse events were hand- foot skin reaction (HFSR), proteinuria and hypertension. In conclusion, the efficacy and safety of YN968D1 850 mg w ere confirmed in advanced and metastatic gastric cancer. 1.3. Study Rationale In this phase II I study, we will assess the benefit of YN968D1 treatment in advanced and metas tatic gastric cancer patients who failed standard of treatment at 700 mg/day of YN968D1 (as apatinib mesylate) , which was within the maximum tolerated dose in the phase I study30, in terms of overall survival (OS) , progression free survival (PFS) , tumor response rate, disease control rate and quality of life. The target population will be advanced and metastatic gastric cancer patients who have failed approved standard treatment s (disease progression or intolerant to available approved dr ugs). YN968D1 is known to selectively inhibit VEGFR -2 and angiogenesis of cancer. Various laboratory tests showed results that YN968D1 highly selectively inhibits protein tyrosine kinase VEGFR -2/KDR (IC 50 about 1 nM) receptor, and YN968D1 demonstrated an anticancer effect in gastric cancer cell line (NCI -N87 cell line) implanted -nude mouse. In mouse with hypodermic implantation of colorectal, liver, kidney, breast or non-small cell cancer cells, YN968D1 also demonstrated an anticancer effect. Also, a combination"

CONFIDENTIAL Page 38 of 39 therapy of oxaliplatin and YN968D1 showed a high cancer cell growth inhibitory effect while having no increase in toxicity. As a result of phase I clinical study conducted in patients with advanced solid tumor30, Apatinib mesylate had the MTD of 850 mg and the clinically recommended dose of 750 mg. The most common side effects were hypertension, proteinuria, and hand -foot syndrome but were all mild to moderate in severity and were manageable. In terms of effectiveness, a total 83.8% of patients had disease controlled; partial response in 18.9% and stable disease in 64.9%. Out of 22 patients with gastric -colorectal cancer who were included in the study, 18 showed a disease control effect where 4 of them were partial responses indicating an outstanding effect. Phase II and phase III clinical stud ies conducted in China showed a great effect of increasing overall survival compared to the Placebo group in patients with advanced gastric cancer 31. 32. Based on the positive outcome, Apatinib has been approved in China for treatment of advanced gastric cancer in 2014. Previous studies show clinical benefits in OS and PFS, however, there is no more treatment option for patients who failed approved standards therapies. As described above, Apatinib has shown potential survival benefit in patients with gastric cancer ; therefore, its efficacy and safety need to be ascertained in this controlled and properly powered phase I II study. This study will be the steppingstone to continue the clinical development of Apatinib as a treatment agent for advanced and metastatic gastric cancer . Moreover, the data to be obtained from this study will contribute to our understanding of this disease. 2. STUDY OBJECTIVE The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) compared to Placebo plus BSC in p atients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer ( GC). 2.1. Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Apatinib administered with best supportive care (BSC) in the target population in terms of improving overall survival compared with that of placebo administered with best supportive care (BSC)."

Secondary Objectives The secondary objective s of this study are as follows ; • To evaluate progression- free survi val (PFS) • To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) • To evaluate disease control rate (DCR) • To evaluate EORTC QLQ- C30 and EORTC QLQ -STO22 • To evaluate EQ -5D-5L • To explore pharmacodynamic markers : Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), sVEGFR- 1, sVEGFR2, and sVEGFR3 • To evaluate pharmacokinetics Moreover, t he safe ty of Apatinib will be evaluated and safety measures are as follows; • Adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination, 12- lead ECG, and ECOG performance status 3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan This is a prospective, randomized, double- blinded, placebo- controlled, multinational, multicenter, parallel -group, phase I II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) compared to Placebo plus BSC in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who failed two or more prior trea tment regimens . After informed consent and screening procedures, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2 :1 ratio to Apatinib or Placebo group. All subjects will receive best supportive care (BSC). The randomization will be stratified by the following factors : Geographic region (Asia vs. North America/Europe), Disease measurability (measurable vs. nonmeasurable ), Prior ramucirumab treatment (Yes vs. No), and Treatment therapy line (3rd vs. ≥4th). Randomized subjects will receive either the test product Apatinib (freebase) at 700 mg/day plus BSC or Placebo plus BSC and will be evaluated at regular site visits, which will be made every 2 weeks till the death of the subject or discontinuation of the study treatment due to disease progression, intolerable toxicity or subject ’s withdrawal of"

If treatment related toxicity is detected, two steps of dose reductions ( 600 mg, 400 mg for Apatinib ) are allowed during the entire study period according to the dose adjustment plan ( refer to S ection 4.4 ). The intent of the study is to have subjects receive a dose every day continuously. The actual dose received will be captured and the start and stop of dosing will be used to calculate dose intensity and duration of treatment. A cycle length is determined by either the calendar days or days on treatment, whichever is appropriate for the individual subject . Dose interruptions such as for management of adverse events may elongate the cycle days as needed, however, the subject should be evaluated at reasonable intervals to ensure the subjects safety such as follow- up for adverse events and laboratory value monitoring. While continuously receiving study investigational product, per the protocol schedul e, subjects should be evaluated at regular site visits, which will be made approximately every 2 weeks as described above. Tumor response and progression will be assessed every other cycle (8 weeks interval) by a local imaging facility. Patient treatment decisions will be made based on local imaging results and investigator opinion which will be entered into the case report forms. Scans will be obtained at baseline and throughout the study and will be analyzed post- study by a central imaging analysis facility. Centrally imaging results will determine the patient ’s best tumor response and time of progression according to RECIST 1.1. Post-treatment follow -up visit will be made at 4 weeks after the end of treat ment (EOT) and then survival follow -ups will follow at 8-week interval s till the death of the subject or closure of the study. More frequent intervals of survival follow -up may be performed to provide for the most accurate survival data at the time of interim and final analysis or during periodic updates . In this trial, approximately 459 subjects will be enrolled (among them, the anticipated number of Japanese patients is at least 50 and up to 100 will be enrolled.) The study data will be analyzed when the required number of events (approximately 325 deaths) are observed. This is projected to occur approximately 9 months after the last subject is randomized. All subjects will be treated and/or followed after randomization until the study data analysis is performed, and then they will be monitored for survival status until death. Subjects continuing to benefit from apatinib treatment, after final analysis and"

Subjects who have been receiving placebo will be allowed to consent for extension of best supportive care only until the extension period is completed or the study is stopped by the sponsor. All subjects who are taking investigational product at the time of unblinding will be asked to consent for continued survival follow- up during the extension phase of the study. Subjects who were off treatment at the time of unblinding, but are still participating in the study (i.e. in survival follow -up) do not require a new consent after unblinding to continue participation. 3.1.1. Additional Information for Japan Specific Safety Run- In The AM104 ethnic bridging study determined that there is no statistically significant difference in Japanese ethnic population pharmacokinetics as compared to Chinese and/or Caucasian that would make it unsafe to proceed at the study starting dose. The AM104 study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 201 mg of Apatinib in 18 healthy volunteers of each of three specific ethnic populations; Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian. Initiation of enrollment in Japan will have a safety run -in approach to further confirm the safety of the study starting dose in this ethnic population. Initially, in Japan, only 6 patients will be enrolled and assigned either Apatinib or Placebo to investigate the safety at the same starting dose and with the same randomization/enrollment criteria as all other study patients. The treatment assignment, as with all patients, will not be known to any study personnel with the following exceptions. During the observation period, the independent data monitoring committee or an appropriately unblinded and separate study personnel who would perform no other study activity or duties that would jeopardize the integrity of the study, will determine whether at least 3 of the 6 patients have been assigned to Apatinib treatment. The patient s will be hospitalized and monitored during the 14 days of DLT evaluation period including performing the following evaluations once on either study day 7, 8 or 9 that is not noted in the standard study schedule, ・ Physical examination ・ Measurement of vital signs including weight ・ Assessment of ECOG performance score ・ Assessment of adverse event ・ Collection of concomitant medication information ・ Hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation test and urinalysis"

CONFIDENTIAL Page 42 of 43 If at least 3 have been assigned Apatinib treatment, the Apatinib treated patients will be observed for a minimum of 14 days of therapy. If less than 3 patients are randomized to Apatinib treatment, 3 more patients (bringing the total to 9 patients) may b e enrolled immediately to ensure that the DLT evaluation in Japan patients is performed on at least 3 Apatinib treated patients. If no DLT occurs during the DLT evaluation period (at least 0/3 Apatinib treated patients), the study may proceed in Japan with further enrollment per protocol and the IDMC and PMDA will be notified. If there is only 1 DLT during the DLT evaluation period (at least 1/3), another 3 patients may be enrolled to ensure that at least 6 Apatinib patients are observed for the 14 day DLT evaluation period. If there remains only 1 DLT during the DLT evaluation period after at least 6 Apatinib treated patients are observed (at most 1/6 Apatinib treated patients), the study may proceed in Japan with further enrollment per protocol and the I DMC and PMDA will be notified.

Discussion of Study Design This study is a prospective, randomized, double-b linded, placebo- controlled, multinational, multicenter, parallel -group, phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. In the Chinese phase I study30, Apatinib mesylate demonstrated noteworthy efficacy with 18 of 22 patients with gastro -colorectal cancer showing disease control. Of those 18 patients with disease control, 4 subjects showed partial response. The mean treatment duration in this phase I study was 5.4 months. In the phase I study 30, treatment with apatinib was given until disease progression, death, an intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent and the most frequent adverse events were hypertension, proteinuria and hand- foot syndrome, which were mild to moderate in severity and manageable. The phase I efficacy data showed that partial response was seen in 18.9% of patients and stable disease in 64.9%, totaling an 83.8% disease control rate. In other words, out of 22 patients with gastric- colorectal cancer in total who were included in this phase I study, 18 subjects had disease control including 4 subjects with partial response, which indicates an excellent efficacy profile. In the phase II and III studies recently conducted in China as mentioned above, Apatinib demonstrated an excellent efficacy that it increased overall survival compared to the Placebo group when administered to patients with advanced gastric cancer who failed two or more lines of therapy. Based on the results from the clinical studies, this phase III study is planned to confirm the effects of Apatinib in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. The subjects will be randomized at 2:1 ratio to receive either Apatinib (freebase) 700 mg qd or Placebo qd and then the safety and efficacy will be assessed during the treatment period. In addition, this study has been des igned as a double- blind, placebo- controlled, and multinational, multicenter study. The target population—advanced or metastatic gastric cancer patients who have failed standard therapies —is an appropriate candidate who will possibly benefit from Apatinib treatment considering there is no recommended or accessible further treatment. To reserve objectivity and credibility of the study results, a"
47,page_47,"Protocol No. LSK- AM301 Protocol v ersion 5.0_20181116 LSK Bio Partners, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 48 of 49double- blind design has been adopted. Patients will be stratified according to the geographic region (Asia vs. North America/Europe) . Region was employed as a stratification factor in order to avoid an imbalance among regions in the randomization to the Apatinib group and the Placebo group. In addition, disease measurability (measurable vs. nonmeasurable), Prior ramucirumab treatment (Yes vs. No), and Treatment therapy line (3rd vs. ≥4th) will be employed as stratification factors. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS), which is considered the most reliable cancer endpoint andis the preferred endpoint from a regulatory perspective. Thus, OSwas selected as theprimary endpoint in this phase III trial. EORTC and EQ -5D questio nnaires were selected in order to assess the quality of life of subjects because these questionnaires are being used in cancer patients worldwide. 3.4.

Extension period study visits After the study is unblinded and the extension period of the study begins, all subjects taking study medication at that time should have their study treatment assignment unblinded and determined to be either apatinib or placebo. For subjects that are not taking study medication at the time of unblinding, the investigator may request to know their treatment assignment. Subjects who have stopped taking study medication or best supportive care prior to unblinding will not be given the option to restart taking apatinib or begin receiving best supportive care. Subjects taking placebo at the time of unblinding: Subjects who are determined to be taking the placebo and best supportive care when the study is unblinded may consent to continue to be followed for survival status and to continue best supportive care. For those subjects that were taking placebo, no End o f Treatment visit is required. Best supportive care may be continued for patients no longer taking placebo, if appropriate, and only until other anti -cancer therapy is administered, disease progression, intolerability, death, or withdrawal of consent. No A E’s or SAE’ s will be gathered for subjects receiving only best supportive care. Survival status will continue to be requested until withdrawal of consent. The study schedule for subjects receiving only best supportive care in the extension period is to be determined by the investigator as standard of care for managing that supportive care. Subjects taking apatinib at the time of unblinding: After the End of the Study (EOS) when the study is unblinded, for those subjects taking apatinib, if the investigator determines that it is safe to continue apatinib treatment, they should obtain consent from the subject to continue to administer apatinib and perform safety evaluations, tumor assessments and survival follow -up.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 58 of 59 For each subject who has provided written consent and whose eligibility is confirmed, a registration number will be assigned by the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS), and the subject will be enrolled in the study (enrollment). Detailed procedures for IWRS use will be specified in a separate document . 4.3. Administration of Investigational Product Investigational products will be administered orally once a day , approximately 1 hour after breakfast. It is recommended that the administration time should be consistent throughout the study period (that is, the administration interval should be approximately 24 hours). The investigational product should not be taken until during the clinic visit of Day 1 of each cycle. Subjects should take 3 tablets of 200 mg and 1 tablet of 100 mg in strength at a time. If the dose is reduced to 6 00 mg, 3 tablets of 200 mg in strength should be taken. If the dose is reduced further to 4 00 mg, only 2 tablets of 20 0 mg in strength should be taken at a time. If the subject vomits after swallowing the IP, the dose will not be replaced and there will be no replacement of a missed dose of IP . 4.4. Dose Adjustment Plan To ensure safety of subjects, the dose of study treatment may be reduced for the toxicities described below as related to treatment, including ‘Certain, Probable or Possible ’ causality . ・ In case of Grade I non- hematologic al treatment related toxicity and Grade I or II hematolo gic toxicity, no dose adjustment needs to be done. ・ In case of Grade II non- hematologic al treatment related toxicity, study treatment is continued without modification and with required symptomatic treatment. The investigator may reduce the dose by one level in the next cycle if they determine that continuing Grade II treatment related toxicity or a significant potential of worsening should be avoided. ・ In case of potentially related or related anti- angiogenic treatment Grade II AEs, pre - emptive dose reduction is recommended and the investigator may reduce the dose by one level at any time to reduce the risk of potential significant worsening that may cause the patient to discontinue the study. If the AE Grade stabilizes or decreases with dose reduction, the investigator may choose to increase the dose by one level at any time within the cycle or at the start of the next cycle to maximize potential study treatment exposure. The investigator may decrease or increase the dose"

CONFIDENTIAL Page 59 of 60 according to tolerability of the pat ient of Grade II AEs, but may not decrease below the 400 mg qd dose level and may not increase above the 700 mg qd dose level. ・ In case of Grade III or IV non -hematologic al treatment related toxicity, study treatment will be temporarily withheld and resumed upon recovery to ≤ Grade I within 3 weeks. If treatment is resumed upon recovery, the dose should be reduced by one level. If recovery takes longer than 3 weeks, the investigator should contact the sponsor to determine if the patient may continue on study treatment. ・ In case of Grade III or IV hematological treatment related toxicity, study treatment will be temporarily withheld and resumed upon recovery to ≤ Grade II within 3 weeks. If treatment is r esumed upon recovery, the dose should be reduced by one level. If recovery takes longer than 3 weeks, the investigator should contact the sponsor to determine if the patient may continue on study treatment. During each administration cycle (28 days/cycle), only a single dose reduction ( 700 mg qd to 600 mg qd or 600 mg qd to 400 mg qd) is permitted; A total of two dose reductions are permitted during the entire study period; and dose reduction below 4 00 mg qd will not be permitted. 4.5. Double- Blinding Method 4.5.1. Double- Blinding All investigational products that were made indistinguishable between study drug and matching placebo in appearance for the purpose of double- blinding will be supplied to the investigators and will be identified by code numbers. 4.5.2. Maintenance of Blinding Allocation to either the Apatinib group or the Placebo group will be double- blinded. As Apatinib- matching placebo will be supplied, the Apatinib group and the Placebo group cannot be distinguished at the time of the delivery and dispensing of the investigational product. Double- blindness of the study is maintained by prohibiting subjects and investigators as well as any study personnel of the sponsor or CRO except for the persons in charge of randomization codes and labelling of IP from accessing randomization codes. The allocation code of a given subject can be broken according to the unblinding procedures described in Section 4.5.3 only if medically necessary to treat intercurrent illness or medical emergency , or according to the sponsor ’s judgment that the code must be broken to protect the rights and safety of the subject."

Unblinding Procedure in Emergency Situations Unblinding should only occur when medically necessary to treat an intercurrent illness or medical emergency. When the treatment information assign ed to a subject need to be revealed emergently in order to appropriately treat an intercurrent illness or medical emergency, the investigator will request an emergency code break for the subject by entering the necessary data into IWRS according to a written procedure prepared separately. A discussion with the medical monitor for the sponsor (or sponsor ’s designee) should occur when possible to review alternatives to unblinding that could be taken. If there can be no discussion with the medical monitor for the sponsor (or sponsor ’s designee) before unblinding the emergency code, this should be documented. In response to the request for an emergency code break, the emergency code for the subject will immediately be unblinded via IWRS . IWRS will notify the in vestigator of the treatment information assigned to the subject, and will also notify the sponsor and its representative of the unblinding. 4.6. Treatment Compliance The investigator and/or the designated person responsible for dispensing investigational products (IP) must be able to account for all IP provided to the site. The person responsible for dispensing the IP must document the dispensing detail (the subject number, the date, the amount of dispensed IP, the lot number of IP , the IP code on each IP package dispensed, etc.) and have access to the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Dose modification, interruptions, and reason for these actions must be recorded in the source documents. No IP is to be used other than for the purpose of this study. 4.7. Prior and Concomitant Medications 4.7.1. Contraindi cated Treatment The f ollowing treatments or medications are contraindicated during the Treatment period. If any of these treatments/medications is administered, the subject should be withdrawn from the study treatment . ・ While patients are on treatment cycle of this study, other anticancer therapy, systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy (Radiation as a palliative therapy to treat bone metastasis will be allowed.), immunotherapy, cancer -related hormone therapy (cancer unrelated alternative hormone therapy that was initiated prior to the study enrollment is allowed) or herbal medicines that have official indication as anticancer drugs, or administration of investigational products from other"

Tumor Evaluation (Chest, abdominal and pelvic CT/MRI) Tumor imaging will be further explained in an Imaging manual. A CT should be used with slice thickness ≤ 5 mm. Tumor will be assessed CT (or PET -CT) scan o r MRI —whichever is used, the same method and the same equipment should be used throughout the study —at the following time points: ・ Within 14 days before Baseline visit (baseline measurement) ・ The end of every other cycle thereafter ・ End of treatment (EOT) visit 1) 1) If CT/MRI is performed within 4 weeks prior to EOT or disease progression is clearly confirmed by previous CT/MRI, tumor evaluation is not required at EOT. If a subject is withdrawn from the IP treatment due to any reason except for disease progression , tumor evaluation will be continued every 8 weeks until disease progression is confirmed or other tumor treatment is initiated . The change of imaging equipment will be allowed only if subjects become hypersensitive to the contrast medium for CT or if there is concern about too much radiation exposure. In addition to these planned tumor evaluations, unscheduled imaging is allowed as clinically indicated at the Investigator's discretion. The key images to be used for determination of disease progression will be reviewed by a central imaging analysis facility based on objective tumor assessments using the RECIST guidelines (version 1.1). The tumor response criteria is presented in Appendix 2. If a diagnosis cannot be made with CT/MRI due to atypical radiological appearance, primary or metastatic biopsy is recommended. Subsequent biopsies are carried out based on the investigator ’s discretion, but it should be considered in case of growth or change in the enhancement pattern identified during follow -up. Histop athologic examination of the biopsy specimen should be assessed by an expert pathologist. 5.2.2. Patient Reported Outcome Following two questionnaires will be used as tools to collect patient reported outcomes. These questionnaires will be completed at the first day of every cycle ( 4 weeks interval) . ・ European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire -Core 30 (EORTC QLQ -C30) with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire- the gastric cancer"

Early Termination of the Study The study may be terminated at any time by the sponsor for any reason. Some reasons may be due to new safety information, non- compliance issues, or judg ment of study futility. In this event, the sponsor will inform the study Investigators, investigational sites, and all regulatory authorities. The extension period of the study may be terminated by the sponsor for any reason. 6.2. Criteria for Treatment Discontinuation Subjects may voluntarily withdraw their consent from the study or the investigator may terminate a subject's participation if the investigator judges that the subject can no longer fully comply with the study requirements or if any of the study procedures are deemed potentially harmful to the subject. If any of the following criteria is met during the treatment period, the study treatment will be discontinued. 1. Subject withdraws his/her consent . 2. The development of disease progression is confirmed according to the RECIST guideline (version 1.1) that makes it inappropriate to continue with study treatment according to the investigator ’s discretion or consent for continued treatment beyond RECIST confirmed disease progression is not obtained. (see Section 6.3) 3. Clinical symptoms determined to be due to disease progression that makes it inappropriate to continue with study treatment according to the investigator ’s discretion or consent for continued treatment beyond clinical symptoms that are determined to be due to disease progression is not obtained. (see Section 6.3) 4. Onset of CTCAE grade ≥ 3 hypertension for which a causal relationship to the investigational product cannot be ruled out. (However, the judgment on whether or not to continue the treatment will be made by the investigator.) 5. Not having received a dose of the investigational product within the past consecutive 3 weeks for specific reasons, such as the onset of a treatment related adverse event . 6. Treatment with prohibited concomitant medication of sufficient dose and duration to confound the study results or to make continuation or restarting of treatment within 3 weeks unsafe for the patient ."
69,page_69,"Protocol No. LSK- AM301 Protocol v ersion 5.0_20181116 LSK Bio Partners, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 70 of 71 7. Intolerable toxicity even after 2 dose reductions. 8. Confirmed positive pregnancy test . 9. The s ubject is lost to follow -up. 10. The subject is dead. 11. The investigator determines that continuation of study treatment is not appropriate. 6.3. Treatment continuation after disease progression Patients who will be treated beyond disease progression must review and sign a supplemental informed consent form before continuing on study drug. In addition, the following activity must be performed and the investigator must provide documentation of their opinion with supporting laboratory evaluation data that : • The patient demonstrates investigator -assessed potential for clinical benefit and does not have rapid disease progression. • It is safe to continue study drug and the patient, by evidence of signing consent, is tolerant of any continuing adverse events . • ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 or stable ECOG performance status of 2 with no signs of rapid deterioration (ECOG status of 2 for past three months or more where the investigator feels that the det erioration of ECOG performance status from baseline at study entry is not indicative of potential to have serious adverse events within at least 30 days from beginning of continuation study treatment). • The patient has a life expectancy of more than 30 days. • Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (e.g., CNS metastases) . • A radiographic assessment/scan should be performed approximately 8 weeks (±7 days) , or earlier if the patient is exhibiting symptoms that may indicate continued progression, after initial Investigator -assessed progression to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size or continued progres sive disease. The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the patient is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued treatment with study therapy . For the patients who continue receive study therapy beyond progression, further progression is defined as an additional 15 % increase in tumor burden from time of initial progression. This includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial progression or"
70,page_70,"Protocol No. LSK- AM301 Protocol v ersion 5.0_20181116 LSK Bio Partners, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 71 of 72 rapid deterioration in the performance status. Study treatment should be discontinued permanently upon documentation of further progression. Laboratory tests will continue with other study evaluations as described in the subsequent cycle study schedule to adequately ensure subject safety and further evaluations to ensure the subjects safety and continued benefit may be performed at the investigator ’s discretion . After the decision to end study treatment permanently, an end of treatment (EOT) examination will be performed (at completion/discontinuation) and the subject will proceed to the post-treatment follow -up and survival follow -up. However, subjects in either treatment group will be withdrawn from the study if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Subject withdraws his/her consent on the follow -up period. 2. Subject is lost to follow -up. Post-treatment follow -up can be carried out before withdrawal if the subject agrees to it. Data that have already been collected on withdrawn subjects will be retained and used for analysis but no new data will be collected after withdrawal. When subjects withdraw from the study, they will be asked whether the study center can continue to contact them or family members for survival status only. If this consent is withdrawn, publicly accessible records may be used for documentation of death. 6.4. Handling Early Withdrawals In any case of early withdrawal from the study, the date and reason should be recorded in the subject ’s eCRF and source documents. If the reason for early withdrawal was an AE, the outcome of the AE should be reported according to Secti on 7.2 and 7.3. All subjects who have received at least one dose of IP should complete all tests scheduled for the EOT wherever possible. Screening numbers and randomization numbers , once allocated, cannot be reused. Any new subject will always receive new subject numbers (screening number and randomization number). 6.5. Medical C are After the End of Treatment for Withdrawn Subjects Subjects for whom the study is terminated or suspended or who are withdrawn from the study due to disease progression or intolerable toxicity will be provided with or directed"

After being withdrawn from the treatment, subjects will be monitored for surv ival status (See Section 3.4.5 and 3.4.6 ). 7. SAFETY REPORT 7.1. Definition 7.1.1. Adverse Event (AE) An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient who has signed the informed consent form. The event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational product. Examples of AE s include but are not limi ted to: • Abnormal test findings that are clinically significant. • Clinically significant symptoms and signs. • Clinically significant changes in physical examination findings. • Signs or symptoms resulting from drug overdose, misuse, or withdrawal. Disease progression assessed by measurement of malignant lesions on imaging studies should not be reported as an AE. Treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that has a start date on or after the first dose of the investigational product until the final subject visit or, if it has a start date before the date of the first dose of study drug, increase in severity on or after the date of the first dose of investigational product until the final subject visit. The safety analysis will be carried out wit h TEAE. Adverse events collected during screening period (from the time of informed consent until right before the first administration of the investigational product) will be separately listed and reviewed. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that: • Results in death. • Is life-threatening. • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 1)"

Causality Evaluation The investigator should assess the causality of AE s and record the causal relationship , along with the ground that such an assessment is made on , in the eCRF. In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and eCRF, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. The causality of AEs and SAEs to study treatment should be determined using the following definitions as guidelines[40]. AEs with at least possible relationship and AEs with conditional and unassessable relationship are considered causally related to the study treatment. Table 7. Definition of Causality Assessment Criteria Term Assessment Criteria Certain • Event or laboratory test abnormali ty, with plausible time relationship to drug intake • Cannot be explained by disease or other drugs • Response to withdrawal plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically) • Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i.e. an objective and specific medical disorder or a recognized pharmacological phenomenon) • Rechallenge satisfactory, if necessary Probable /Likely • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake • Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs • Response to withdrawal clinically reasonable • Rechallenge not required Possible • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake • Could also be explained by disease or other drugs • Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear Unlikely • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship impr obable (but not impossible)"

Serious Adverse Event Reporting All SAE must be repo rted to the sponsor without del ay from the time of investigator ’s acknowledgement on the event, whether or not the SAE has a causal relationship to the investigational product. The investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/IEC of the SAE, as per local requirements. If a non -serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow -up information must also be provided to the sponsor without delay, whether or not it has a causal relationship to the investigational product. All SAE will be recorded in the eCRF. The site should fax or e -mail the SAE Report Form within 24 hours from the time of discovery of the SAE with as much information as possible to the sponsor. During the extension period, new SAE should only be reported for subjects who are taking apatinib and have not completed Post- treatment Follow -up visit. The SAE form should have the following information: • Study title, protocol number, and sponsor name • Reporter’s name, investigator’s name, and contact number • Site name, site number, and subject’s identification code (subject’s study number) • SAE name, start and stop dates of the event • Causality to the investigational product, action taken in regard to investigational product, and treatments (any procedures or medications given) to manage the SAE, and the outcome of the event If the site obtains additional information regarding the event after submitting the Initial SAE Report Form, the site should prepare a Follow -up SAE Report Form and send it to"

Exposure During Pregnancy Apatinib is not intended for use during pregnancy or lactation. Reproductive studies in animals have not been performed to date with Apatinib and there have been no data regarding the exposure during human pregnancy. Angiogenesis is critical to fetal development and the inhibition of angiogenesis following admini stration of Apatinib is likely to result in adverse effects on pregnancy. If a potential subject is a female of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be obtained before she can be enrolled as a subject. A female subject or a male subject ’s female sexual partner must use effective contraception consistently and correctly during the study and for at least 28 days after they have stopped taking the investigational products. It is not known whether Apatinib is secreted in human milk. Because drugs are commonly excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a female subject or a male subject ’s female sexual partner must not breastfeed while receiving the investigational products during this study and for at least 28 days after they have stopped taking the investigational products. Nonetheless, if any pregnancy or breastfeeding occurs to a female subject or a male subject ’s female sexual partners, during the study period and for at least 28 days after the end of treatment, the"

In addition, the follow -up survey will be conducted when pregnancy occurs and the outcome of the pregnancy must be reported to the sponsor using the Pregnancy Report Form. Assessment of the event will be conducted by the investigator with consultation from sponsor and actions may be taken on a case by case basis. Potential action may include unblinding the involved subject ’s treatment assignment following unblinding procedure and discontinuing study treatment.

Outlines of analysis are described below, and details of analysis methods will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Version 1.0 of the SAP will be finalized before EOS. 8.3.1. General Principles of Data Analysis Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS software (SAS Institute, SAS Circle, Cary, NC, USA) and all statistical tests, unless otherwise specified, will be t wo-sided at a 5% significance level. 8.3.2. Analysis Population Data obtained from subjects in this study will be analyzed by intent to treat ( ITT) set, safety set, full analysis set (FAS) or per protocol set (PPS). ・ ITT set consists of data from all subjects who are randomized. In the ITT set, subjects will be included in the group to which they were randomized. The analysis for primary endpoint, OS and the secondary endpoint s of PFS and ORR will be conducted in the ITT set. ・ Safety set consists of data from all subjects who received at least one dose of Apatinib or placebo. In the Safety set, subjects will be included in the group based on the treatment that was received. Safety data will be analyzed by safety set. ・ FAS consists of data from all subjects who received at least one dose of the Apatinib or placebo. The FAS will be used for all efficacy analyses. ・ PPS consists of data from subjects included in FAS who completed the study per protocol without major violation such as inclusion /exclusion criteria violation and use of prohibited concomitant medication during the study. The PPS will be used for all efficacy analyses. 8.3.3. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and Baseline Characteristics will be summarized by descriptive statistics by treatment group for the ITT set .

Subjects alive or lost to follow - up at the end of study (EOS) are censored. The comparison of OS between the two treatment groups will be performed with a stratified logrank test at the two- sided alpha=0.05 level of significance. In order to estimate the hazard ratio, a Cox proportional hazards regression model will be fitted with treatment group and the randomization stratification variables as factors [Geographic region (Asia vs. North America/Europe), Disease measurability (measurable vs. nonmeasurable), Prior ramucirumab treatment (Yes vs. No), and Treatment therapy line (3rd vs. ≥4th)]. Kaplan- Meier estimates will be calculated for each treatment group to construct the survival curve. The median overall survival and its 95 % CI will also be presented. 8.3.5. Key Secondary Efficacy Analys es If the primary analysis of OS is statistically significant, then the key secondary endpoints of PFS and ORR will be analyzed using a fixed- sequence testing procedure. These analyses will be conducted using the ITT set. First, PFS will be analyzed using the same statistical methods that are used in the primary efficacy analysis of OS . If the analysis of PFS is statistically significant, then ORR will be analyzed using the Cochran- Mantel - Haenszel test s tratified by the randomization stratification factors. However, if a prior test is not statistically significant, then the subsequent analyses will be exploratory rather than confirmatory. ・ Progression Free Survival (PFS): Time from randomization to either radiological progression (determined by the central imaging analysis facility ) or death from any cause. Subjects alive and free of progression at the end of study (EOS) are censored. Option s for PFS assessment for each situation are as shown in Table 7, and censoring date will be based on the last tumor assessment date. ・ Objective Response Rate (ORR) : Percentage of subjects with a Best Overall Response (determined by the central imaging analy sis facility) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) . For PFS, the same statistical method that is used in primary efficacy analysis (OS) will be performed. For the ORR (CR or PR), the frequency and percentage of subjects will be calculated"

Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) and Interim Analysis 8.4.1. IDMC Independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) is composed of 3 members (2 clinicians and 1 statistician) who are fully independent of the entity conducting the trial. The IDMC should comply with IDMC charter in the ICH GCP guideline. The IDMC will convene when a pproximately 163 events are observed to review"

The IDMC can also convene when unexpected adverse drug reaction with a Grade 3 or more (based on NCI- CTCAE 4.0 3) are observed. The IDMC can also convene, if necessary, to ensure appropriate review of the Japan specific safety run -in. 8.4.2. Interim Analysis An interim analysis will be conducted with collected clinical data when approximately 163 (approximately 50% of the required 325 events) events are observed. All planned study procedures such as pa tient enrollment, treatment and follow -up visit should be performed regardless of the interim analysis. If it is necessary to change the timing of the interim analysis, in consultations with sponsor, the IDMC can change interim analysis time and its corresponding statistical criteria for early termination. The interim analysis will assess the primary efficacy endpoint. The IDMC will review the result s of the interim analysis and recommend to the sponsor whether or not to terminate the trial for futility . Final decision regarding study termination will be made by the sponsor. The IDMC and statisticians involved in the interim analysis should keep the interim analysis result completely confidential. The result s of the interim analysis should be kept unknown to all staff involved in the conduct of the trial. If early termination is decided, the IDMC delivers the interim analysis report to the sponsor after the official unblinding procedure . Early termination will be considered if the interim analysis is futile, that is when the calculated conditional power based on primary efficacy endpoint is less than 0.2. Early stopping for futility interim analysis does not inflate the Type -I error, thus Type I -error adjustment is not needed. 9. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSUARANCE 9.1. Monitoring During the study conduct, study monitors of the sponsor or designated person nel must be allowed to visit all study sites periodically to assess the data quality and study integrity and to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on eCRFs is accurate. The investigator and institution will allow monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this source verification."

Baseline assessment The baseline tumor lesions assessed within 14 days before randomization will be categorized as measurable lesions (lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as ≥10 mm) or as non -measurable lesions (all other lesions, including lesions <10mm in longest diameter, infiltrating type of GC , and truly non- measurable lesions ). Specific criteria for determination for measurability will be provided in a separate imaging guideline. All measurable lesions should be identified as target lesions, and should be evaluated by measurement of the sum of the longest diameters of measurable and viable lesions. 2. Definitions Measurable lesions: must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of ; ・ 10 mm by CT /MRI scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) ・ 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable) ・ 20 mm by chest X -ray Non-measurable lesions : All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) , as well as truly non- measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non- measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques Target lesions : All measura ble lesions up to a maximum of five lesions in total and two lesions per organ with the greatest size (a long axis for non- nodal lesions and a short axis for nodal lesions) should be identified as target lesions. Target lesions should be representative of all involved organs and in addition be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements (with large lesions that are difficult to measure avoided). Non-target lesions: All lesions not selected as target lesions will be handled as non- targe t lesions, regardless of whether measurement is possible. Multiple non- target lesions in the same organ or site may be recorded as a single item (e.g., multiple enlarged pelvic lymph"

Response Criteria of Target Lesions Response of Target Lesions Definition Complete response ( CR) The disappearance of all target lesions and reduction in short axis of any nodal target lesions to < 10 mm Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions, taking as a reference the b aseline sum diameters Stable Disease ( SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as a reference the smallest sum diameter while on study . Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)."

The best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘ CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR."
