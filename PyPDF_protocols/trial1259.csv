Unless specific treatment discontinuation criteria are met, treatment can continue for up to 6 cycles for patients in Arm 3. Patients who continue to receive benefit fro m their assigned treatment at the final data cut- off (DCO) and database lock may continue to receive their assigned treatment for as long as they and their physician feel they are gaining clinical benefit. For patients continuing to receive durvalumab treatment following the final DCO and database lock, it is recommended that the patients continue the scheduled site visits according to the limited schedule in section 9.3. and investigators monitor the patients’ safety laboratory results prior to and periodically during treatment with durvalumab in order to manage adverse events (AEs) in accordance with the durvalumab toxicity management guidelines. In the event that a roll-over or safety extension study is available at the time of the final DCO and database lock, patients currently receiving treatment with durvalumab may be transitioned to such a study, and the current study would reach its end. The roll-over or safety extension study would ensure treatment continuation with visits assessments per its protocol.

A step wise approach will be adopted. The initial safety review will take place when the first 30 patients (10 in each arm) have completed the 1 stcycle of treatment and had 21 days of follow up. A second review will take place when an additional 30 patients (10 in each arm) have completed the 1stcycle of treatment and have had 21 days of follow up, making a total of 60 patients. At the time of 2ndreview, it is expected that the initial 30 patients would have had at l east 6 weeks of follow up, with some patien ts receiving much longer. These two reviews will be carried out by the IDMC in an unblinded manner. After review of the unblinded data, the IDMC will make a recommendation on whether the study should continue recruitment as planned, or hold recruitment. The IDMC recommendation will be communicated to all sites when available. In addition, the IDMC will meet approximately every 6 months thereafter to continue safety monitoring. Statistical methods The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP treatment compared with EP (Arm 1 vs. 3) and the efficacy of durvalumab + EP treatment compared with EP (Arm 2 vs 3) in terms of OS. OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. The 2 primary endpoints of this study are OS (Arm 1 vs. 3) and OS (Arm 2 vs. 3). To control for type 1 error, a significance level of 1% will be used for the analysis of OS (Arm 1 vs. 3), and a significance level of 4% will be used for the analysis of OS (Arm 2 vs. 3). The study will be considered positive (a success) if either of the OS analysis results are statist ically significant. Secondary efficacy variables include PFS for durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus EP (Arm 1 vs. 3), PFS for durvalumab + EP versus EP (Arm 2 vs. 3), OS and PFS for durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus durvalumab + EP (Arm 1 vs. 2), objective response rate, the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 and 12 months from randomization and the proportion of patients alive at 18 months. PFS (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the site Investig ator) is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objective PD or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomized therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. All endpoints relate d to tumor assessment are assessed by site Investigator. Efficacy data will be summarized and analyzed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis, and the treatment arms will be compared on the basis of randomized treatment, regardless of thetreatment actually received. Patients who were randomized but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment are included in the ITT population."

The interim analysis of OS w ill occur when approximately 318 OS events have occurred (60% maturity) in the durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP and EP treatment arms and approximately 318 OS events have occurred (60% maturity) in the durvalumab + EP and EP treatment arms (approximately 28 months after the first patient is randomized). The data cut-off for the final analysis of OS (the second data cut-off) will occur when approximately 425 OS events have occurred across the durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP and EP treatment arms (80% maturity) and approximately 425 OS events have occurred across the durvalumab + EP and EP treatment arms (80% maturity). If the average true OS HR is 0.69, the study will have 89% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference at the final analysis with a 2-sided 0.93% significance level (for an overall alpha of 1%) for the comparison of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus EP (Arm 1 vs 3), and 96% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference at a 2-sided 3.57% significance level (for an overall alpha of 4%) for the comparison of durvalumab + EP versus EP (Arm 2 vs 3); this translates to a 4.8-month benefit in medi an OS over EP (15.7 months vs 10.9 months).The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant is an average HR of 0.78 for durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus EP and 0.82 for durvalumab + EP versus EP. With a 15-month recruitment period and a minimum follow-up period of 27 months assumed, it is anticipated that this analysis will be performed 42 months after the first patient has been randomized. At the time of each data cut-off, secondary efficacy endpoints will also be assessed. The complete testing strategy is described in Section 8. OS will be analyzed using a stratified log-rank test (stratified for platinum-based therapy planned at Cycle 1 [cisplatin or carboplatin]). Th e effect of treatment will be estimated by the HR together with its corresponding confidence interval and p-value for the ITT population. PFS, programmatically derived from si te Investigator assessments, will be analyzed in the same way as OS above. Safety data will be summarized descriptively and will not be formally analyzed. China data Global recruitment will be complete once approximately 795 patients have been randomized. Once global enrollment is completed, recruitmen t will continue in China only. A total of up to 189 patients from China will be randomized (see Section 8.6for details). To evaluate consistency as required by the CFDA, the efficacy and safety in the China cohort will be analyzed separately using the same statistical me thods as for the global cohort analysis unless otherwise specified (see Section 8.6). Owing to late recruitment of patients in the expansion cohort, data cut-offs for the China cohort analyses may be different from global data cut-off to ensure appropriate evaluation. The analysis will be performed when the OS data from the China patients are of similar maturity, where si gnificant clinical efficacy is established in the global cohort. Safety and tolerability will be summarized for the China Safety Analysis Set."

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study Lung cancer has been the most common cancer in the world for several decades, with an estimated 1.8 million new cases in 2012 (12.9% of all new cancers), and was also the most common cause of death from cancer in 2012, with 1.59 million deaths (19.4% of the total cancer deaths; GLOBOCAN 2012 ). Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents approximately 13% of all newly diagnosed lung cancers ( Puglisi et al 2010 ). SCLC is perhaps the most aggressive form of the disease, distinguishable from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by its rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, and early dissemination. It is strongly associated with tobacco smoking and is also associated with an extremely high mutation rate. Inactivation of TP53 and RB1 occurs frequently, and in a recent study in which sequencing of SCLC tumors was carried out, recurrent mutations were identified in the CREBBP , EP300 , and MLL genes that encode histone modifiers ( Peifer et al 2012 ). Furthermore, mutations in PTEN, SLIT2, and EPHA7 (as well as focal amplifications of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase gene) were observed. A 2-stage system dividing patients into limited and extensive disease was developed in 1973 by the United States (US) Veteran’s Administration Lung Cancer Study Group. Limited disease was defined as tumor tissue that could be encompassed in a single radiation port, and extensive-stage disease (ED) was defined as any tumor that extended beyond the boundaries of a single radiation port. At present, limited disease is identified in ~30% of patients, and ED is identified in ~70% of patients. Four to six cycles of platinum based chemoth erapy, etoposide in comb ination with either cisplatin or carboplatin, without maintenance therapy has been the standard care (SoC) for patients with ED SCLC for the past 25 years ( Pignon et al 1992 , Roth et al 1992 ), and are recommended by major worldwide oncology treatment guidelines, ie, ASCO, NCCN, ESMO. Despite high initial response rates of up to 70% ( Rossi et al 2012 ), it is estimated that 80% of patients with limited stage and almost all patients with ED SCLC will relapse or experience disease progression ( Clark and Ihde 1998 ). Therefore, the prognosis for patients with SCLC in general and particular ED SCLC is poor; the reported 2-year survival is only 5% and 5 years survival rate is less than 2% ( Rossi et al 2012 ). There are no large Phase III studies comparing cisplatin/etoposide and carboplatin/etoposide. A large meta-analysis of 4 studies (incl uding >600 LD and ED patients), performed by Rossi et al 2012 , showed similar efficacy between carboplatin- and cisplatin-containing regimens; median OS was 9.6 months for cisplatin and 9.4 months for carboplatin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.27; p=0.37). Objective response rate (ORR) was 67.1% and 66.0%, respectively (relative risk, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.16; p=0.83). Several large phase III studies using EP as the comparator in this setting have consistently reported the median PFS between 4-6 months and median OS between 7-11 months ( Slotman"
25,page_25,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab Study Code D419QC00001Version 6.0 Date 16 January 2020 26(186)et al 2015 ). Most recent published data on EP as control arm of a randomized phase III study reported median PFS in 1stline treatment of ED-SCLC as 4.4 months and median OS as 10.9 months ( Reck et al 2016 ). 1.1.1 Immunotherapies It is increasingly understood that cancers are recognized by the immune system, and, under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors ( Dunn et al 2004 ). PD-L1 is part of a complex system of receptors and ligands that are involved in controlling T-cell activati on. PD-L1 acts at multiple sites in the body to help regulate immune responses by delivering inhibitory signals to T cells through the PD-1 and CD80 receptors. PD-L1 is a member of the B7 family of ligands that inhibit T-cell activity through binding to the PD-1 receptor ( Keir et al 2008 ) and to CD80 ( Butte et al 2007 ). PD-L1 expression is an adaptive response that helps tumors evade detection and elimination by the immune system. Expression of PD-L1 protein is induced by inflammatory signals that are typically associated with an adaptive immune response (eg, IFN γ) and can be found on both tumor cells (TC) and tumor infiltrating immune cells (IC). The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 on activated T cells delivers an inhibitory signal to the T cells, preventing them from killing target TC, and protecting the tumor from immune elimination ( Zou and Chen 2008 ). PD-L1 may also inhibit T cells through binding to CD80, although the exact mechanism is st ill not elucid ated ( Butte et al 2007 ; Paterson et al 2011 ). The inhibitory mechanism described above is co-opted by tumors that express PD-L1 as a way of evading immune detection and elimination. The binding of an anti-PD-L1 agent to the PD- L1 receptor inhibits the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 and CD80 receptors expressed on immune cells. This activity overcomes PD-L1-mediated inhibition of antitumor immunity. While functional blockade of PD-L1 results in T-cell reactivation, this mechanism of action is different from direct agonism of a stimulatory receptor such as CD28. In vivo studies have shown that durvalumab inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models via a T cell-dependent mechanism ( Stewart et al 2015 ). PD-L1 is expressed in a broad range of cancers with a high frequency, up to 88% in some types of cancers. Based on these findings, an anti-PD-L1 antibody could be used therapeutically to enhance antitumor immune responses in patients with cancer. Results of non-clinical and clinical studies of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway have shown evidence of clinical activity and a manageable safety profile, supporting the hypothesis that an anti-PD-L1 antibody could be used to therapeutically enhance antitumor immune response in cancer patients ( Brahmer et al 2012 ; Hirano et al 2005 ; Iwai et al 2002 ; Okudaira et al 2009 ; Topalian et al 2012 ; Zhang et al 2008 ) with responses that tend to be more pronounced in patients with tumors that express PD-L1 ( Powles et al 2014 ; Rizvi et al 2015 ; Segal et al 2015 ). In addition, a high mutational burden eg, in bladder carcinoma (Alexandrov et al 2013 ) may contribute to the responses seen with immune therapy."

CTLA-4 delivers a negative regulatory signal to T cells upon binding of CD80 (B7.1) or CD86 (B7.2) ligands on antigen-presenting cells ( Fife and Bluestone 2008 ). Blockade of CTLA-4 binding to CD80/86 by anti-CTLA-4 antibodies results in markedl y enhanced T-cell activation and antitumor activity in animal models, including killing of established murine solid tumors and induction of protective antitumor immunity. Therefore, it is expected that treatment with an anti CTLA- 4 antibody will lead to increased activation of the human immune system, increasing antitumor activity in patients with solid tumors. Pre-clinical data has now been added to with a wealth of clinical data showing that blockade of negative regulatory signals to T-cells such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) has promising clinical activity. Ipilimumab was granted United States (US) Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently under investigation for several other malignancies whilst nivolumab and pembrolizumab, two anti-PD-1 agents and atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 agent have been granted approvals by agencies such as the United States of America Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approval for the treatment of a number of malignancies including metastatic melanoma, squamous and non-squamous cell non-small-cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and urothelial carcinoma. In addition, there is data from agen ts in the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 class showing clinical activity in a wide range of tumor types. 1.1.2 Durvalumab Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa subclass that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 (but not programmed cell death ligand-2) with PD-1 on T cells and CD80 (B7.1) on immune cells (IC). It is being developed by AstraZeneca/MedImmune for use in the treatment of cancer. (MedImmune is a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca/MedImmune will be referred to as AstraZeneca throughout this document.) Durvalumab has been engineered to reduce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In vitro studies demonstrate that durvalumab antagonizes the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 on primary human T cells, resulting in their restored proliferation and release of interferon gamma (IFN γ) (Stewart et al 2015 ). To date durvalumab has been given to more than 1800 patients as part of ongoing studies either as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Details on the safety profile of durvalumab monotherapy are summarized in Section 1.2.1.3 and Section 6.5. Refer to the current durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for a complete summary of non-clinical and clinical information including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics. 1.1.3 Trem elimumab Tremelimumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig)G2 mAb that is directed against CTLA-4 cluster of differentiation [CD]152), a cell surface receptor that is expressed primarily on activated T cells and acts to inhibit their activation. Tremelimumab completely blocks the interaction of human CTLA-4 with CD80 and CD86, resulting in increased release of"

Tremelimumab is being developed by AstraZeneca for use in the treatment of cancer. To date tremelimumab has been given to more than 1500 patients as part of ongoing studies either as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer agents. Details on the safety profile of tremelimumab monotherapy are summarized in Section 1.3.2.2. Refer to the current tremelimumab IB for a complete summary of non-clinical and clinical information including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics. 1.1.4 Durvalumab + tremelimu mab combination therapy Because the mechanisms of action of CTLA-4 and PD-1 are non-redundant targeting both PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways may have additive or synergistic activity ( Pardoll 2012 ); therefore, in addition to evaluating both agen ts in the monotherapy setting in a number of cancer indications AstraZeneca is also investigating the use of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy for the treatment of cancer. Study D4190C00006 is a Phase Ib dose-escalation study to establish the safety, PK/pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. The dosing schedule utilized is durvalumab every 2 or 4 weeks (Q2W, Q4W) up to 12 months, combined with tremelimumab Q4W up to Week 24 for 7 doses then every 12 w eeks (Q12W) for 2 additional doses for up to 12 months. The study is ongoing and continues to accrue. In addition, other clinical studies have since started looking at the combination in both NSCLC and other oncology indications. To date more than 800 patients have received the combination using a number of doses and dosing schedules. Details on the safety profile of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy are summarized in Sections 1.2.1.1 and 1.3.2.3 . Refer to the current editions of the durvalumab and tremelimumab IBs for a complete summary of non-clinical and clinical information incl uding safety, PK and efficacy. 1.1.5 Rationale for conducting this study ED SCLC is an aggressive malignancy, th e prognosis remains poor de spite favorable initial response to chemotherapy. Platinum-based chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for over 2 decades. Although patients have good re sponses to chemother apy initially, almost all patients with ED-SCLC will relapse quickly. These facts indicate a significant unmet medical need. Novel therapies are urgently needed to improve clinical outcomes. 1.1.5.1 Rationale for the combination of durvalumab ± tremelimumab with chemotherapy Nonclinical and clinical studies have indicated that blockade of immune checkpoints (PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) can have a positive effect on antitumor immunity. One potential strategy is to combine these nonredundant and potential synergistic single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors, thereby producing an additive improvement in tumor response ( Larkin"
28,page_28,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab Study Code D419QC00001Version 6.0 Date 16 January 2020 29(186)et al 2015 , Postow et al 2015 ). Patients with SCLC may be particularly susceptible to these immunotherapies given the high mutational burden of this disease ( Salgia and Skarin 1998 ). The use of combination chemotherapy is a mainstay of oncology therapy. The goal of combination chemotherapy is to utilize agents that affect cancer cells by different mechanisms, thus reducing the risk of developing resistance. Current investigations are now adding immunotherapeutics to chemotherapeutics to broaden antitumor responses. Checkpoint inhibitors have been tested in NSCLC, either used alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Preliminary efficacy data from Study D4190C00006 have demonstrated that durvalumab+tremelimumab is active and well toler ated. As of 15 April 2015, in 63 patients with at least 16 weeks of follow up, the objective response rate is 27%. Recently the IMpower133 study was presented at the World Congress on Lung Cancer (Horn et al., September 2018). IMpower133 was a randomized placebo-controlled phase III study, comparing atezolizumab + etoposide/platinum (EP) with placebo + EP in frist line treatment of ED-SCLC. The study demonstrated a statist ically signif icant improvement in OS with the combination of atezolizumab + etoposide/platinum (EP) compared to placebo + EP; the median OS was 12.3 months in the atezolizumab +EP group and 10.3 months in EP+ placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.91; P = 0.007). The median progression-free survival was 5.2 months and 4.3 months, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P = 0.02). The safety profile of atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide was consistent with the previously reported safety profile of the individual agents, with no new findings observed. Nivolumab as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 mAb) has also been investigated in relapsed SCLC in CheckMate 032 ( Antonia et al 2016 ). In this study, nivolumab at 3mg/kg was tested as monotherapy, and nivolumab 1mg/kg + ipilimumab 3mg/kg, and nivolumab 3mg/kg+ipi 1mg/kg were assessed. The objective response rates reported were similar: 10%, 14% and 10%, respectively. Median survival data have also been recently reported of 4.4 months, 7.7 months and 6.0 months, respectively. Although the observed spectrum of toxicities was that expected for these agents, the fact that lower rates of Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed in the ipilimumab arm at 3mg/kg (compared to other tumor types) suggests that patients with SCLC tolerate CTLA4 blockade better. The safety and efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy have also been demonstrated across multiple tumor type s. Data for durvalumab ± tremelimumab with standard platinum based chemotherapy in advanced cancers are being generated from 2 ongoing Phase I studies; an internal study D419SC00001 (n=6) and a phase Ib study (NCT02537418) run by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG; n=111 as of an October 2016 cut-off). The combinations tested are tolerable and manageable; details on the safety profile found in these studies are summarized in Sections 1.2.2 and1.3.2.4 . Preliminary results from the CCTG study will be presented for the NSCLC cohorts in IASLC 2016; the overall objective response rate in NSCLC cohorts (n=24) was 52.9%."

The study has reported an objective response rate of 55% ( Langer et al 2016 ). In summary, the preliminary efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of durvalumab ± tremelimumab generated to date, together with early positive signals with other PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy support the development of these treatments in combination with EP chemotherapy in ED SCLC. 1.1.6 Study aim This is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter, global study to determine the efficacy and safety of combining durvalumab ± tremelimumab with EP followed by durvalumab ± tremelimumab maintenance therapy versus EP alone as first-line treatment in patients with ED SCLC. 1.2 Rationale for study design, doses, and control groups This is a Phase III, randomized, comparative study to assess the benefit-risk profile of adding immunotherapy to first-line chemotherapy versus current SoC of chemotherapy. Given the different treatment administration schedules and treatment durations, this study will use an open-label design. 1.2.1 Durvalumab and t remelimumab dose and treatment regimen justification 1.2.1.1 Durvalumab+ tremelimumab combination therapy dose rationale The durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy doses and regimen selected for this study are based on the goal of selecting an optimal combination dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab that would yield sustained target suppression (PD-L1 and CTLA-4 respectively), demonstrate promising efficacy, and have an acceptable safety profile. Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics data Study D4190C00006 included dose cohorts with both a Q4W and a Q2W schedule of durvalumab in combination with a Q4W schedule of tremelimumab. The Q4W schedule was included to align with the Q4W dosing of tremelimumab. PK simulations from durvalumab monotherapy data indicated that a similar area under the drug concentration-time curve at steady state (AUC ss; 4 weeks) was expected following both 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W dosing with durvalumab. The observed durvalumab PK data from the D4190C00006 study were in line with the predicted monothera py PK data developed pre-clinically and in line with that seen in the first-time-in-human (FTIH), single agent study (CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108) in patients with advanced solid tumors. This demonstrates similar exposure of durvalumab 20 mg/kg Q4W and 10 mg/kg Q2W, with no alterations in PK when durvalumab and tremelimumab (doses ranging from 1 to 3 mg/kg) are dosed together. While the median maximum plasma concentration at steady state (C max,ss) is expected to be higher with 20 mg/kg Q4W (approximately 1.5 fold) and median trough concentration at steady state (Ctrough,ss ) is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg Q2W (approximately 1.25 fold), this is not"

Monotonic increases in pharmacodynamic activity were observed with increasing doses of tremelimumab relative to the activity observed in patients treated with durvalumab monotherapy. There was evidence of augmented pharmacodynamic activity relative to durvalumab monotherapy with combination doses containing 1 mg/kg tremelimumab, including both the 15 and 20 mg/kg durvalumab plus 1 mg/kg tremelimumab combinations. Clinical data In Study D4190C00006 various dose combinations have been explored, with doses of tremelimumab ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg and doses of durvalumab ranging from 3 to 20 mg/kg. Tremelimumab was given on a Q4W schedule whilst durvalumab was explored in both a Q4W and Q2W schedule, with the goal of identifying the dose combination that best optimizes the risk:benefit profile in an acceptable range of PK and pharmacodynamic values. Patients treated with doses of tremelimumab above 1 mg/kg had a higher rate of adverse events (AEs), including discontinuations due to AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), and severe AEs. Between the 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab and 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 3 mg/kg tremelimumab cohorts treated at the Q2W schedule, the number of patients reporting any AE, ≥ Grade 3 AEs, SAEs, and treatment-related AEs was higher in the 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 3 mg/kg tremelimumab cohort than the 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab cohort. A similar pattern was noted in the Q4W regimens, suggesting that, as the dose of tremelimumab increased above 1 mg/kg, a higher rate of treatment-related events may be anticipated. Further, the SAEs frequently attributed to immunotherapy, pneumonitis, colitis and other immune mediated events, were more commonly seen in cohorts using either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of tremelimumab compared to the 1-mg/kg dose cohorts. Together, these data suggest that a combination using a tremelimumab dose of 1 mg/kg appeared to minimize the rate of toxicity when combined with durvalumab. As a result, all combination doses utilizing either the 3 or 10-mg/kg doses of tremelimumab were eliminated in the final dose selection. In contrast, cohorts assessing higher doses of durvalumab with a constant dose of tremelimumab did not show an increase in the rate of AEs. The data suggested that increasing doses of durvalumab may not impact the safety of the combination as much as the tremelimumab dose. Further, safety data between the 10-mg/kg and 20-mg/kg cohorts were similar, with no change in safety events with increasing dose of durvalumab. In Study D4190C00006, of all treatment cohorts, the cohort of patients treated in the 20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab group had a tolerable safety profile, but still showed strong evidence of clinical activity. No dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were re ported in this cohort. Preliminary clinical activity of the durvalumab and tremelimumab combination did not appear to change with increasing doses of tremelimumab. The 15- and 20-mg/kg durvalumab Q4W"

Efficacy data suggested that the 20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose cohort may demonstrate equivalent clinical activity to other dose combinations. All together, the data suggested that a 20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose combination (equivalent to fixed doses of 1500 mg and 75 mg respectively) should be selected for further development. Refer to the current durvalumab IB for a complete summary of non-clinical and clinical information on the durvalumab + tremelimumab combination, including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics. 1.2.1.2 Rationale for 4 cycles of combination therapy followed by durvalumab monotherapy Long-term follow up on melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 targeting antibody (dosed every 3 weeks [Q3W ] for 4 doses and then discontinued), shows that patients responding to ipilimumab derive long-term benefit, with a 3-year OS rate of approximately 22%. Furthermore, the survival curve in this population reached a plateau at 3 years and was maintained through 10 years of follow up ( Schadendorf et al 2013 ). Similar data have been presented for othe r anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting an tibodies: ! Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) was dosed Q2W for up to 96 weeks in a large Phase I dose-escalation and expansion study, and showed responses were maintained for a median of 22.94 months for melanoma (doses 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg), 17 months for NSCLC (doses 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), a nd 12.9 months for renal cell carcinoma patients (doses 1 and 10 mg/kg) at the time of data analysis ( Brahmer et al 2014 , Drake et al 2013 , Hodi et al 2014 ). Similar long term results may be expected with use of other immune-mediated cancer therapeutics such as tremelimumab, durvalumab, or the combination of the two agents. The durvalumab + tremelimumab combination regimen will be administered for 4 doses Q3W in combination with chemotherapy followed by durvalumab monotherapy Q4W until disease progression. One additional combination dose will be administered post chemotherapy – see Section 1.2.2 . 1.2.1.3 Durvalumab monotherapy dose rationale A durvalumab dose of 20 mg/kg Q4W is supported by in-vitro data, non-clinical activity, clinical PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, a nd activity data from Study 1108 in patients with advanced solid tumors and from a Phase I trial performed in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumor (D4190C00002)."

The PK approached linearity at ≥3 mg/kg Q2W, suggesting near complete target saturation (membrane-bound and sPD-L1), and further shows that the durvalumab dosing frequency can be adapted to a particular regimen given the linearity seen at doses higher than 3 mg/kg. The expected half-life with doses ≥3 mg/kg Q2W is approximately 21 days . A dose-dependent suppression in peripheral sPD-L1 was observed over the dose range studied, consistent with engagement of durvalumab with PD-L1. A low level of immunogenicity has been observed. No patients have experienced immune-complex disease following exposure to durvalumab (For further information on immunogenicity, pleas e see the current IB). Data from Study D4190C00006 (phase I trial in NSCLC patients using the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab) also show an approximately dos e-proportional increase in PK exposure for durvalumab over the dose range of 3 to 20 mg/kg durvalumab Q4W or Q2W. (For further information on PK observations in Study D4190C00006 , please see the current IB). The observed durvalumab PK data from the combination study were well in line with the predicted monotherapy PK data (5th median and 95th percentiles) for a Q4W regimen. A population PK model was developed using the data from Study 1108 (doses=0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W ( Fairman et al 2014 ). Multiple simulations indicate that a similar overall exposure is expected following both 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W regimens, as represented by AUCss (4 weeks). Median Cmax,ss is expected to be higher with 20 mg/kg Q4W (~1.5 fold) and median Ctrough,ss is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg Q2W (~1.25 fold). Clinical activity with the 20 mg /kg Q4W dosing regimen is anticipated to be consistent with 10 mg/kg Q2W with the proposed similar dose of 20 mg/kg Q4W expected to (a) achieve complete target saturation in majority of patients; (b) account for anticipated variability in PK, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity in diverse cancer populations; (c) maintain sufficient PK exposure in case of ADA impact; and (d) achieve PK exposure that yielded maximal antitumor activity in animal models. Given the similar area under the drug concentratio n-time curve (AUC) and modest differences in median peak and trough levels at steady state, the observation that both regimens maintain complete sPD-L1 suppression at trough, and the available clinical data, the 20 mg/kg Q4W and 10 mg/kg Q2W regimens are expected to have similar efficacy and safety profiles, supporting further development with a dose of 20 mg/kg Q4W. Clinical data Refer to the current durvalumab IB for a complete summary of clinical information including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics at the 20 mg/kg Q4W regimen."

Population PK analysis indicated onl y minor impact of body weight (WT) on the PK of durvalumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body WT-based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 mg Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by comparing predicted steady state PK concentrations (5th, median and 95th percentiles) usi ng the population PK model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body WT of ~75 kg). A total of 1000 patients were simulated using body WT distribution of 40–120 kg. Simulation results demonstrate that body WT-based and fixed dosing regimens yield similar median steady state PK concentrations with slightly less overall between-patient variability with fixed dosing regimen. Similarly, a population PK model was developed for tremelimumab using data from Phase 1 through Phase 3 (N=654; doses = 0.01 to 15 mg/kg Q4W or Q90D; metastatic melanoma) (Wang et al 2014 ). The population PK model indicated minor impact of body WT on PK of tremelimumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The WT-based (1 mg/kg Q4W) and fixed dosing (75 mg Q4W; based on median body WT of ~75 kg) regimens were compared using predicted PK concentrations (5th, median and 95th percentiles) using population PK model in a simulated population of 1000 patients with body weight distribution of 40 to 120 kg. Similar to durvalumab, simulations indicated that both body WT-based and fixed dosing regimens of tremelimumab yield similar median steady state PK concentrations with slightly less between-patient variability with fixed dosing regimen. Similar findings have been reported by others ( Ng et al 2006 , Wang et al 2009 , Zhang et al 2012 , Narwal et al 2013 ). Wang and colleagues investigated 12 monoclonal antibodies and found that fixed and body size-based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies ( Wang et al 2009 ). In addition, they investigated 18 therapeutic proteins and peptides and showed that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing the between-patient variability in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics parameters ( Zhang et al 2012 ). A fixed dosing approach is preferred by the prescribing community due to ease of use and reduced dosing errors. Given expectation of similar pharmacokinetic exposure and variability, we considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens. Based on average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg durvalumab (equivalent to 20 mg/kg) and a fixed dose of 75 mg tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg) is included in the current study. 1.2.2 Rationale for proposed phase III dose and schedule The dosing schedule proposed is aligned with the standard fixed dosing of 1500 mg durvalumab plus 75 mg tremelimumab for 4 cy cles followed by durvalumab monotherapy (1500 mg), which is supported by efficacy and safety as well as tolerability data across multiple studies in multiple tumor types (see Section 1.2.1 ). To conform to the chemotherapy schedule in the study, we propose to use standard durvalumab+tremelimumab dose and ratio at a Q3W dosing interval, rather than the standard Q4W schedule."
34,page_34,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab Study Code D419QC00001Version 6.0 Date 16 January 2020 35(186)The safety of a Q3W dosing schedule in combination with chemotherapy has been explored in an ongoing study D419SC00001 (described below), where tremelimumab is administered at 75 mg in combination with 1120 mg durv alumab Q3W followed by 1120 mg durvalumab Q3W. The combination has been declared tolerable and manageable (see below for more detail). The 1120 mg dose of durvalumab is the Q3W equivalent of the standard 1500 mg Q4W dose. The tremelimumab dose was not lowered proportionally to 56 mg as 75 mg is the lowest tested biologically effective dose. In this study, we propose to use the phase III fixed dose of durvalumab, so this study will combine 75 mg tremelimumab with 1500 mg durvalumab Q3W in combination with chemotherapy. The relative increase in dose density of durvalumab (ie, 1500 mg Q3W instead of Q4W) is supported by the fact that toxicities attributable to durvalumab do not appear dose dependent, and pharmacokinetic modeling reveals no meaningful differences in drug levels between Q3W and Q4W dosing. Supportive Clinical Data The safety and tolerability data that support the proposed combination and schedule is based on two ongoing phase I/IB studies investigating the safety and tolerability of durvalumab + tremelimumab in combination with various chemotherapy regimens in solid tumors: an AstraZeneca internal study ( D419SC00001) and CCTG study (NCT02537418). AstraZeneca Phase I Study ( D419SC00001). This phase I study is evaluating the safety a nd tolerability of durvalumab + tremelimumab in combination with first-line chemotherapy regimens in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The tumor types originally included: ovarian/peritoneal/fallopian tube cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and gastric/gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. In the SCLC cohort, durvalumab 1120 mg + tremelimumab 75 mg Q3W is given concurrently with carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min and etoposide 100 mg/m 2Q3W, followed by durvalumab 1120 mg monotherapy Q3W. As of Dec 6, 2016, 6 patients with SCLC had completed 4 cycles of treatment. No DLT was reported during the first cycle of treatment (a 21 -days period). One patient developed grade 4 hepatitis with elevation of ALT, AST and GGT at C5D1. Although the onset of this event was one day after the protocol defined DLT pe riod of 4 cycles, it was considered as a DLT following discussion with investigator. The liver enzymes were normalized within 16 days after steroid use and was confirmed not to be a Hy’s law case. As there was only one DLT reported in 6 patients, the safety profile of this combination with chemotherapy at Q3W schedule is declared tolerable and manageable. CCTG study (NCT02537418)"

SC LC patients enrolled into the etoposide-ca rboplatin c ohorts started IO treatment in cycle 3 of chemotherapy; all other chemotherapy regimens assessed the IO combination starting at cycle 1. Overall, toxicities related to the chemotherapy core regimen appeared as expected in severity and frequency (See section 1.3.2.4 for more detail on the safety profile from this study). Overall, across all dose levels, there was no clear dose dependency in any of the reported AEs and there was no DLT reported per protocol defined criteria (DLT period of 21 days). Toxicities related to durvalumab and tremelimumab were also those expected for these agents, although a number of potential IO related toxicities such as diarrhea, skin rash, hepatic function changes or pneumonitis were difficult to differentiate from those reported for cytotoxic agents. As expected, there were more IO related toxicities reported for dose levels containing tremelimumab. In general, all regimens were tolerable and manageable at all dose levels. There was no discernible difference in the tolerability profile when IO treatment was"

In general, the overall safety profile from these two studies appears to be consistent with available safety and tolerability d ata for durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab. PK Modelling PK modelling has been carried out to predict the effect of switching from a Q4W regimen to a Q3W regimen for both durvalumab (1500 mg; 4 doses) and tremelimumab (75 mg; 4 doses) exposures. Results suggest that a Q3W regimen would yield similar exposures to Q4W; both durvalumab and tremelimumab are expected to yield a slightly higher Cmax and Cmin on a 3 week schedule, but a lower AUC. For durvalumab, Cmax values were 660 vs. 596 ( μg/mL), Cmin, were 144 vs. 94 ( μg/mL), and AUC was 5879 vs.6061 ( μg/mL) for Q3W and Q4W schedule, respectively. For tremelimumab, Cmax is 26.1 vs. 25.1 ( μg/mL), Cmin is 7.2 vs. 5.7 (μg/mL), and AUC is 267 vs. 289 ( μg/mL), respectively for the Q3W vs. Q4W regimen. Therefore, PK modeling suggests that a Q3W schedule does not impose a significant increased safety risk based on expected durvalumab and tremelimumab exposures. Taken together, the totality of data provides sufficient safety data to support the combination of 1500mg durvalumab plus 75mg tremelimumab with chemoth erapy. There is supportive safety data for the combination of 1120 mg durvalumab plus 75 mg tremelimumab Q3W x 4 doses followed by 1120 mg durvalumab Q3W from Study D419SC00001. The safety of the combination of 1125 mg durvalumab (Q3W) plus tremelimumab 75mg (multiple doses, Q6W) or 225mg (3 doses, Q6W) or 56mg (multiple doses, Q3W) with chemotherapy has been assessed in more than 100 p atients in the CCTG Phase I trial. Clinical data from NSCLC patients in Study D4190C00006 suggest that increasing the dose of durvalumab has no significant impact on the safety and tolerability of the durvalumab and tremelimumab combination. In addition, PK modelling data suggest there will be a minimal impact on IP exposure if the standard doses (1500/75) are given on a Q3W regimen. Additional dose of Tremelimumab Patients in Arm 1 will receive additional one dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab post chemotherapy at week 16 if patient complete all 4 doses of durvalumab + tremelimumab during chemotherapy. The rationale to have an additional dose of tremelimumab after chemotherapy is based on the possibility that ch emotherapy may limit the responsiveness of T cells to tremelimumab, and that tremelimumab given after chemotherapy will help control rapid progression that is inherent to the clinical course of SCLC, thereby sustaining the responses that may have been achieved during induction. 1.2.2.1 Safety confirmation of proposed doses To better support the use of the 1500 mg durvalumab ±75mg tremelimumab Q3W in this study and to ensure safety and tolerability in this larger phase III study, a safety confirmation of the proposed dose and schedule will be conducted within the protocol by an independent"

A step wise approach will be adopted. An init ial safety review will take place when the first 30 patients (10 in each arm) have enrolled and completed the 1stcycle of treatment and had 21 days of follow up. These 30 patients will be continued to be followed for long term safety. A second review will take place when an additional 30 patients (10 each arm) complete the 1stcycle of treatment and have had 21 days follow up, giving a total of 60 patients. At the time of this second review, it is expected that the init ial 30 patients will have longer term follow up that may extend into the maintenance period. This safety review will be carried out by the IDMC in an unblinded fashion. The IDMC will make a recommendation on whether recruitment should continue, be modified or be held. The IDMC will continue to monitor the study conduct approximately every 6 months thereafter (see Section 6.10). 1.2.3 Rationale for control ar m: standard care therapy International guidelines (European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) currently recommend treatment with 4 to 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (EP), either cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with etoposide, without maintenance therapy for ED SCLC; this has been widely adopted in clinical practice across the world. Although 6 cycles of EP have not been shown to be superior to 4 cycles in the overall population, 1 group did re port a trend favoring 6 cycles of EP for an ED SCLC subgroup (Veslemes et al 1998 ). The use of 4 cycles of EP in the experimental arms (Arms 1 and 2) in this study is consistent with that observed in other trials combining platinum-based chemotherapy with investigational agents, particularly immunotherapies, to minimize the toxicity burden to patients. Patients in th e control arm (Arm 3) can receive up to 6 cycles of EP; patients who demonstrate continued tumor volume reduction after 4 cycles of EP can continue with an additional 2 cyc les of EP at investigators’ discretion. Cisplatin and carboplatin have indistinguishab le clinical efficacy but are different in terms of cost and toxicity profiles. The selection of cis platin or carboplatin in combination with etoposide is at the investigator’s discretion, but must be in accordance with eligibility criteria, specifically inclusion 11, in Section 3.1. These agents are commonly used in ED SCLC and will be given as per the product label for the indication and the NCCN and ESMO guidelines (Früh et al 2013 , Kalemkerian et al 2013 ). ! Etoposide: 80 to 100 mg/m 2daily on Days 1 to 3 (total dose 300 mg/m2) given Q3W ! Carboplatin: AUC 5-6 on Day 1 given Q3W ! Cisplatin: 75 to 80 mg/m2intravenous (IV) on Day 1 given Q3W Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) will be permitted for patients in Arm 3 only; this will be at the investigators’ discretion as per SoC guidance for ED SCLC. PCI is not permitted for patients in Arms 1 and 2 due to the unknown risks of combining PCI with immunotherapies."

OS is the golden standard endpoint in oncology drug evaluation. The recent data from the IMpower133 study reinforces the importance of OS in this clinical setting. PFS may serve as a surrogate endpoint for OS when differences between treatment arms are of sufficient magnitude and clinical importance ( FDA Guidance 2011 , Pazdur 2008 ). In certain settings, the utility of surviva l as an endpoint may potentially be confounded by subsequent therapies. Specifically, there are currently a numbe r of molecules, that target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, which are in late-stage development to which patients with SCLC in the EP arm of this study may have access to upon progression. Nivolimab has recently received FDA approval for 3 rdline treatment of ED SCLC. Access to these agents creates challenges in being able to fully characterize the effects of study treatment on OS if patients subsequently receive these immunotherapeutic agents. The comparison of the durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP and the durvalumab + EP arms will provide information as to the relative contribution of adding tremelimumab to the established benefit-risk profile of durvalumab + EP. This comparison is not currently included in the mu ltiplicity-controlled statis tical testing procedure because the proposed study is not powered for the comparison. However, the treatment difference will be summarized descriptively to evaluate the relative benefit-risk difference between the 2 experimental arms. Antitumor activity, including the secondary endpoint of PFS, will be assessed per site investigators according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines. Objective response rate is commonly used in oncology to directly measure treatment effect on the tumor. Other secondary efficacy endpoints of proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months from randomization (APF6 [PFS rate at 6 months]), proportion of patients alive and progression free at 12 months from randomization (APF12 [PFS rate at 12 months]) and overall survival at 18 months after randomization (OS18) will be examined to further evaluate the antitumor effect and survival benefit of durvalumab ± tremelimumab + EP compared with EP. APF6, APF12, and PFS will be assessed using site Investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1. The secondary endpoints of patient-reported sy mptoms and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 v3 and QLQ-LC13 will show the overall benefits and toxicity of the treatment from the patient’s perspective and will aid in assessing the benefit-risk evaluation. These PRO questionnaires are well-established instruments that have been used extensively in lung cancer clinical studies. The PK and immunogenicity of durvalumab and tremelimumab are being examined to assess any potential impact on PK, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy parameters. Biological samples will be used to explore potential biomarkers in tumor and serum that may influence pathogenesis, response, and clinical characteristics."

Overall, as of 7 May 2015, 456 of 694 patients treated with durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W were evaluable for response (defined as having ≥24 weeks follow-up, measurable disease at Baseline, and ≥1 follow-up scan or discontinued because of disease progression or death without any follow-up scan). Data from patients with SCLC in this study, although limited (n=19), showed a favorable disease control rate (DCR) of 26.3% when durvalumab was given 10 mg/kg Q2W. In PD-L1 unselected patients, the ORR, based on investigator’s assessment per RECIST 1.1, ranged from 0% in uveal melanoma to 20.0% in bladder cancer, and DCR at 24 weeks ranged from 4.2% in triple-negative breast cancer to 39.1% in advanced cutaneous melanoma. PD-L1 status was known for 383 of the 456 response evaluable patients. Across the PD-L1-positive tumors, ORR was highest (>10%) for bladder cancer, advanced cutaneous melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (33.3% each); NSCLC (26.7%); and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (18.2%). Moreover, in the PD-L1-positive subset, DCR at 24 weeks was highest (>10%) in advanced cutaneous melanoma (66.7%), NSCLC (36.0%), hepatocellular carcinoma and bladder cancer (33.3% each), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (18.2%). 1.3.1.2 Durvalumab + tremelimumab Preliminary efficacy data from Study 6 have demonstrated that this combination is clinically active and well tolerated in NSCLC. As of 15 Ap ril 2015, 63 patients with at least 16 weeks of follow-up were evaluable for response across various durvalumab + tremelimumab dose regimens. Of these, 17 patients (27%) had a best overall response of PR, 14 patients (22%) had a best response of SD, 22 patients (35%) had PD, and 10 patients (16%) were NE. The ORR (confirmed and unconfirmed CR or PR) was 27%, and the DCR (CR, PR, or SD) was 49% as assessed by RECIST 1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al 2009 ). In the 20-mg/kg durvalumab and 1-mg/kg tremelimumab Q4W cohort, a total of 5 of 11 patients were evaluable for efficacy with at least 8 weeks of follow-up. Of these, there were 2 patients (40%) with PR, 1 patient (20%) with SD, and 1 patient (20%) with PD. As of 4 October 2015, preliminary efficacy data were available for 6 patients with SCLC treated in Study 10 (D4190C00010: a Phase I study of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in patients with advanced solid tumors) with the combination of durvalumab (20 mg/kg) and tremelimumab (1 mg/kg) ad ministered Q4W for 4 doses, followed by durvalumab alone at a dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W for up to a total of 12 months. Among the"

Nivolumab as monotherapy, or in combination with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 mAb), has also been investigated in relapsed SCLC in CheckMate 032 study ( Antonia et al 2016 ). Nivolumab 3mg/kg as monotherapy and nivo lumab 1mg/kg+ipilumab 3mg/kg, and nivolumab 3mg/kg+ipilimumab 1mg/kg were assessed. The objective response rates reported were similar, 10% 14% 10%, respectively. Median survival were 4.4 months, 7.7 months and 6.0 months, respectively ( Antonia et al 2016 ). 1.3.1.3 Durvalumab ± tremelimumab with chemotherapy Studies evaluating agents targeting PD-L1 or CTLA-4 in combination with chemotherapy have yielded encouraging results (see Section 1.1.5.1 ). Durvalumab ± tremelimumab with standard platinum based chemotherapy in advanced cancers are being generated from an ongoing phase Ib study (NCT02537418) run by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG). Preliminar y results will be presented in IASLC 2016. Up to October 2016 cut off, a total of 111 patients have been dosed with various chemotherapy regimens and different tumor type. The overall objective response rate in the NSCLC cohort (n=24) was 52.9% (NSCLC data based on a data cut off of July 2016). CheckMate 012 (NCT01454102) is a multi-arm Phase I study of nivolumab in combination with various anticancer agents or as monotherapy in chemotherapy-naïve patients with NSCLC. The result just published in the Journal Of Clinical Oncology showed the objective response rates for nivolumab 10 mg/kg plus gemcitabine-cisplatin, nivolumab 10 mg/kg plus paclitaxel-cisplatin, nivolumab 10 mg/kg plus paclitaxel-carboplatin, and nivolumab 5 mg/kg plus paclitaxel-carboplatin were 33%, 47%, 47% and 43% respectively; 24-week PFS rates were 51%, 71%, 38% and 51% respectively. On the basis of these results, the antitumor activity of first-line nivolumab in combinat ion with platinum doublets is highly promising (Rizvi et al 2016 ). In addition, the phase II KEYNOTE-021 study showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to standard-of-care carboplatin and pemetrexed followed by pembrolizumab for 2 years and indefinite pemetrexed maintenance therapy significantly improved the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response compared with carboplatin and pemetrexed alone followed by indefinite pemetrexed maintenance therapy in patients with chemotherapy-naive, advanced non-squamous NSCLC ( Langer et al 2016 ). In the study, 123 patients with stage IIIB/IV, chemotherapy-naive, nonsquamous NSCLC were randomized to receive four cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2every three weeks), with or without 24 months treatment with pembrolizumab (200 mg every three weeks). 33 of 60 patients (55%; 95% CI 42, 68) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group achieved an objective response compared with 18 of 63 patients (29%; 18, 41) in the chemotherapy alone group (estimated treatment difference 26% [95% CI 9-42%]; p=0.0016)."

Result demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS with the combination of atezolizumab + EP compared to placebo + EP with median OS of 12.3 months in the atezolizu mab + EP group compared to 10.3 months in placebo + EP group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.91; P = 0.007). The median progression-free survival was 5.2 months and 4.3 months, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P = 0.02). On the basis of these clinical data, the an titumor activity of PD-L 1/CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies in combination with first-line p latinum-/taxane-based doublets is highly promising. Given the synergistic potential of durvalumab and tremelimumab, the combination of both these drugs with chemotherapy has the potential to further improve the response rates and response durability along with overall survival. 1.3.2 Overall Risks Monoclonal antibodies directed against imm une checkpoint proteins, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as well as those directed against programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA- 4), aim to boost endogenous immune responses directed against tumor cells. By stimulating the immune system however, there is the potential for adverse effects on other tissues. Most adverse drug reactions seen with the immune checkpoint inhibitor class of agents are thought to be due to the effects of inflammatory cells on specific tissues. These risks are generally events with a potential inflammatory or immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or unique interventions such as immunosuppressants and/or endocrine therapy. These immune-mediated effects can occur in nearly any organ system, and are most commonly seen as gastrointestinal AEs such as colitis and diarrhea, pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD), hepatic AEs such as hepatitis and liver enzyme elevations, skin events such as rash and dermatitis, and endocrinopathies including hypo- and hyper-thyroidism. 1.3.2.1 Durval umab Risks with durvalumab include, but are not limited to, diarrhea/colitis and pneumonitis/ILD, endocrinopathies (ie, events of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency,hyper-and hypo-thyroidism, type I diab etes mellitus and diabetes insipidus), hepatitis/increases in transaminases, nephritis/increases in creatinine, rash/dermatitis, myocarditis, myositis/polymyositis, and other rare or less frequent inflammatory events including neuromuscular toxicities (e.g. Guillain Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis). For information on all identified and potential risks with durvalumab, please always refer to the current version of the durvalumab IB. In monotherapy, clinical studies AEs at an incidence of > 20% include events such as fatigue, cough, decreased appetite, dyspnea and nausea.

In the AstraZeneca internal study (D419SC00001) 6 patients with SCLC were evaluable for safety at the time of this report. Common adverse events reported were neutropenia (6 pts), nausea (4 pts), decreased appetite (4 pts), rash (3 pts), diarrhea (2 pts) and pyrexia (2 pts). Diarrhea, skin rash were generally low grade , with the exception of one grade 3 erythroderma that responded to topical steroids. One patient with intermittent grade 1 diarrhea required steroid treatment and resolved. Cycle 4 was modified in this patient where IO was held and chemotherapy was dose reduced to 75% due to grade 4 neutropenia. Grade 3 and above events were febrile neutropenia (2 pts), platelet decrease (1 pt), and lung infection (1 pt) which were considered to be chemotherapy related, hepatitis (1 pt), and erythroderma (1 pt) which were considered to be immune related. Febrile neutropenia, lung infection, hepatitis were reported as SAE. 2 patients had Grade 3/4 lipase/amylase elevation at baseline and were considered not drug related; these were due to pancreatic metastas is at baseline confirmed by imaging. One patient died due to disease progression as primary cause and a secondary cause of lung infection. Two patients discontinued treatment due to immune related hepatitis and persistent skin rash. Two patients continue on active study treatment and are being followed up for long term safety."

On Cy cle 1 Day 16 the patient presented with s/s of Grade 4 heart failure and myocarditis as well as Grade 3 thyroiditis that initially responded to steroid administration. She was sent home only to be readmitted with weakness, fever, dizziness and dehydration. The patient’s condition deteriorated despite steroids, supportive treatment (inotropic support, use of ace inhibitors) and eventually died. Preliminary autopsy report showed multiple metastases in the involv ed lungs (effusions), liver, and lymph nodes. Except for atherosclerosis, there were no evid ence of myocardial infarction nor pulmonary emboli. Case Report No. . An event of limbic encephalitis (Grade 5) occurred in a 65 year old female with metastatic SCLC who on Cycle 2 Day 27 presented with s/s of limbic encephalitis (eg, cognitive decline, restlessness, agitation, EEG findings suggestive of encephalopathy, CSF findings of increased WBC and protein, MRI finding of no intracranial mass, and despite treatment with antibiotics, steroids, the patient eventually died. Confounding factors that may likely also provide alternative cause/explanation for this event include the following: 1) a possible paraneoplastic effect of underlying SCLC, 2) concomitant medications that included treatment with phe nobarbitone and midazolam, 3) underlying diabetes mellitus for which patient had insulin/oral hypoglycemic treatment and 4) possible CNS infection. Overall, toxicities related to the chemotherapy core regimen and to durvalumab and tremelimumab were as expected for these agents. In general, the combination of durvalumab plus tremelimumab with chemotherapy appears tolerable and manageable. External clinical data also supports these findings. In a randomized Phase III study in patients with ED SCLC treated with etoposide-plat inum ± ipilimumab, the overall incidence of treatment-related Grade 3/4 AEs was 48% for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 44% for chemotherapy plus placebo. The most common immune-related AEs in patients treated with chemotherapy + ipilimumab involved skin (rash and pruritus) and gastrointestinal tract (diarrhea) ( Reck et al 2016 ). Furthermore, in the setting of single-IO + EP, the recently published IMpower133 study demonstrated that the safety profile of atezolizumab plus EP was consistent with the previously reported safety profile of the individual agents, with no new findings observed (Horn L et al., September 2018). 1.3.3 Overall benefit-risk assessment There remains a significant unmet medical need for additional treatment options for patients with ED SCLC. Four or six cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy has been considered the standard treatment regimens for 2 decades; however, OS remains poor with a 2-year survival rate of 5% despite favorable initial responses. The vast majority of ED SCLC patients will relapse with a median time to progression of 4 to 6 months and a median OS of 7 to PPD PPD"

The poor prognosis reflects the limited treatment options available, highlighting the need for the development of newer therapeutic options. Treatment with durvalumab and/or tremelimumab has shown activity in several tumor types in a subset of patients deriving meaningful and durable benefit. Efficacy data for patients treated with durvalumab monotherapy have shown clinical activity across several tumor types. Preliminary data generated from patients with NSCLC treated with durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy have also shown early signs of clinical activity, and data from the literature indicate that the comb ination may act synergistically ( Wolchok et al 2013 ). Thus, these agents may potentially offer benefit to this patient population. Also, as presented in Section 1.1.5.1 , the studies evaluating agents targeting PD-L1 or CTLA-4 in combination with chemotherapy has yielded encouraging eff icacy data, with a seemingly tolerable toxicity profile. Therefore, the rationale for this study is supported by the available nonclinical and clinical safety data, the limited survival benefit provide d by the currently available treatment options to patients, the limited life expectancy due to malignant disease, the activity seen with durvalumab alone and in combination with tremelimumab in a number of tumor types, the preliminary data on the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of PD-L1 or CTLA-4 with chemotherapy, and the strength of the scientific hypotheses evaluating the safety and tolerability of adding durvalumab ± tremelimumab to first-line standard platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of first-line ED SCLC. Based on these considerations, the proposed treatments may have the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit by generating durable clinical responses, thereby potentially extending survival. Therefore, the overall benefit-risk assessment supports the proposed study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab with standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. 1.4 Study design This is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter, global study to determine the efficacy and safety of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP or durvalumab + EP versus EP chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with ED SCLC. A schematic diagram of the overall study design is shown in Figure 3 , and a detailed study flow chart is shown in Figure 4 . This study will randomize approximately 795 eligib le patients at sites worldwide. Once global enrollment of 795 patients is completed, recruitment will continue in China only. A total of up to 189 patients from China will be randomized (see Section 8.6for detail). Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio in a stratified manner according to the planned platinum-based therapy for Cycle 1 (cisplatin or carboplatin) to receive treatment with durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP (Arm 1), durvalumab + EP (Arm 2), or EP (Arm 3). Cross over will not be permitted as part of this study. Doses and treatment re gimens are described in Section 7.2. Assessments will be conducted as indicated in Table 2 and Table 3 ."

The information will be recorded in the IVRS/IWRS system at randomization. The above does not list the exact sequence of study related procedures, but provides the steps that should be taken during the screening period prior to randomization of the patient. At randomization, once the patient is confirmed to be eligible, the investigator or suitably trained delegate will obtain a unique rando mization number via the IVRS/IWRS. Numbers will start at 001 and will be assigned strictly sequentially by IVRS/IWRS as patients are eligible for entry into the study. The system will randomize the eligible patient to 1 of the 3 treatment arms. If the patient is ineligible and not randomized, the IVRS/IWRS should be contacted to terminate the patient in the system. Patients will begin treatment on Day 1, although a window of up to 2 days is permitted between randomization and first dose of IP.

There can be no exceptions to this rule. Patients who are enrolled but found to not meet all the eligibility criteria must not be randomized and must not be initiated on treatment and must be withdrawn from the study as a screen failure. When a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is randomized in error or incorrectly started on treatment, the inve stigator should inform the AstraZeneca Study Physician immediately, and the Study Physician and the investigator should discuss whether to continue or discontinue the patient from treatment. The Study Physician must ensure that all decisions are appropriately documented."

Non-sterilized male partners of a female patient must use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control.

Not engaging in sexua l activity is an acceptab le practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. ∀Female partners (of childbearing potential) of male patients must also use a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period ( Table 1 ). Note: Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or post-menopausal. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply: ! Women <50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more follo wing cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). ! Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more followi ng cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopa use with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy). Highly effective methods of contraception, defined as those that result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly are described in Table 1 . Note that some contraception methods are not considered highly effective (eg, male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper-containing intrauter ine device; progestoge n-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibi tion of ovulation is not the primary mode of action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel, which is considered highly effective]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills). !

Patients who permanently discontinue drug for reasons other than confirmed objective RECIST disease progression should continue to have RECIST scans performed Q6W ± 1 week for the first 12 weeks, then Q8W ± 1 week until confirmed objective disease progression/death (whichever comes first) as defined in Table 3 . If a patient is discontinued for unconfirmed progression then the patient should also continue to have RECIST scans performed Q6W ± 1 week for the first 12 weeks, then Q8W ± 1 week until confirmed objective disease progression or until death (whichever comes first) as defined in Table 3 . All patients will be followed for survival until the end of the study. Patients who decline to return to the site for evaluations should be contacted by telephone as indicated in Table 3 as an alternative. Patients who have permanently discontinue d from further receipt of IP will need to be discontinued from the IVRS/IWRS. If a patient is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.11."

These patients should have the reason for study withdrawal recorded as “eligibility criteria not fulfilled” (ie, pati ent does not meet the required inclusion/meets exclusion criteria). This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures (ie, not randomized patients). Patients can be re-screened a single time, but they cannot be re-randomized. 3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IP and assessments) without prejudice to further treatment. Patients who withdraw consent for further participation in the study will not receive any further IP or further study observation, with th e exception of follow-up for survival, which will continue until the end of the study unless the patient has expressly withdrawn their consent to survival follow-up. Note that the patient may be offered additional tests or tapering of treatment to withdraw safely. A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) for withdrawal and the presence of any AE. The investigator will follow-up AEs outside of the clinical study. If a patient withdraws consent, they will be specifically asked if they are withdrawing consent to: - all further participation in the study including any further follow up (eg, survival contact telephone calls) - withdrawal to the use of any samples (see Section 5.5.4 ). 3.10.2.1 Survival status for patients who withdrew consent and were lost to follow-up Patients will be considered lost to follow-up only if no contact has been established by the time the study is completed (see Section 9.3), such that there is insufficient information to determine the patient’s status at that time. Patients who refuse to continue participation in the study, including telephone contact, should be documented as “withdrawal of consent” rather than “lost to follow-up.” Investigators should document attempts to re-establish contact with missing patients throughout the study period. If contact with a missing patient is re-established, the patient should not be considered lost to follow-up and evaluations should resume according to the protocol. At the time of PFS and OS analyses, the survival status of all patients in the full analysis and the safety analysis sets should be re-checked; this includes those patients who withdrew consent or are classified as “lost to follow-up.”"

STUDY PLAN AND TIMING OF PROCEDURES The procedures for the screening and treatment periods in this study are presented in Table 2 and the procedures for the follow-up period are presented in Table 3 . Patients treated in Arms 1 and 2 who continue beyond week 20 will continue with all week 20 assessments defined in Table 2 until confirmed progression or termination of treatment ( Table 2 ). Patients who discontinue or complete treatment (ie, patients in arm 3 who complete 4 cycles of chemotherapy) will follow assessments as defined in Table 3 . All patients must follow the scan schedule which is at baseline, week 6±1 week, week 12±1 week and Q8W ±1 week from randomization thereafter un til confirmed PD. Follow up visits should be planned to align to this scan schedule where possible. For all treatment arms - PRO and tumor efficacy (RECIST) assessment dates are not affected by dose delays and remain as originally scheduled, as they are based on the date of randomization (not the date of therapy). - AstraZeneca requests that at least one subsequent scan is acquired and sent to AstraZeneca-appointed imaging Contract Res earch Organization after each initial progression event for all patients, across all arms of the study if possible. - All other scheduled assessments must be performed relative to the start of the dosing cycle such that all laboratory procedures, etc required for dosing should be performed within 3 days prior to dosing. For durvalumab monotherapy or durvalumab + tremelimumab combination arms !Patients may delay dosing under certain circumstances: - Dosing may be delayed per the Toxicity Management Guidelines, due to either an immune or a non-immune-related AE. Note: EP is the SoC and is expected to cause hematologic non-immune-related AEs for which the non-immune- related Toxicity Management Guidelines should not be applied. Sites should utilize dose delays, dose modifications, G-CSF or component transfusions (eg, platelet transfusions) as necessary per local standards to main tain the dose and schedule of EP treatment to optimize tolerability for individual patients. Communication with the Sponsor for questions is welcomed. ∀ If dosing must be delayed for reasons other than treatment-related toxicity, dosing will resume as soon as feasible. ∀ Dosing intervals of subsequent cycles (during chemotherapy interval is 21 days, post chemotherapy interval is 28 days) may be shortened as clinically"

In addition, WHO performance status should be provided when information on subsequent anticancer therapy is provided, where possib le. eDetails of any treatment for SCLC (including surgery) after the last dose of study treatment must be recorded in the eCRF fPatients may be contacted in the week following data cut-off to confirm survival status. Details of any treatment for SCLC (inc luding surgery) after the last dose of study treatment must be recorded in the eCRF. Every effort should be made to contact patients by telephone to follow and record survi val status. Survival assessments may continue per protocol (every 2 months) post the primary analysis of OS unless instructed otherwise by AstraZeneca gFree T3 and free T4 will only be measured if TSH is abnormal or if there is clinical suspicion of an AE related to the endocrin e system. hADA for tremelimumab will be assessed for Arm 1 patients only; ADA for durvalumab will be performed for Arm 1 and 2 patients on ly. iA sample to look for antibodies to tremelimumab will be taken 90 days ± 7 days after last dose of tremelimumab. jFor the PRO data collection, the research nurse or study coordinator should ensure that the patient completes the questionnaire prior to any other study procedures and before discussion of PD to avoid introducing bias to the patient’s responses. The EORTC QLQ-C30 should always be completed prio r to the EORTC QLQ-LC13 module. kPRO-CTCAE will only be administered in countries where a linguistically validated version exists. lThe site should complete the Hospital Admission (HOSPAD) form at every scheduled clinic visit up to and including the study tre atment discontinuation follow-up visit. If the patient discontinues study treatment for reasons other than RECIST 1.1 assessed PD, the HOSPAD form should continue to b e completed until PD has been confirmed. mOnly for patients yet to progress, RECIST 1.1 assessments will be performed on images from CT (preferred) or MRI, each preferabl y with IV contrast, of the chest and abdomen (including liver and adrenal glands). Pelvic imaging is recommended only when primary or metastatic disease in the pelv ic region is likely. Additional anatomy should be imaged based on signs and symptoms of individual patients. A follow up scan is requested after every radiological PD on study where possible; this is irrespective of whether the PD needs to be confirmed or not as set out in Appendix F. As long as the patient is clinically stab le, in the event of radiologic PD according to RECIST 1.1, an additional scan should be performed preferably at the next scheduled imaging visit and no less than 4 weeks afte r the prior assessment of radiologic PD (please refer to Appendix F).If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the patient has not progressed, every attempt shoul d be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their scheduled visits (relative to the date of randomization). nFor patients who discontinue their assigned IP following confirmed PD, available readings of CT/MRI from local practice will be collected from the patients’ medical charts while information on subsequent anticancer treatment and/or PFS2 is collected. oFor coagulation parameters, activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio are to be assessed as clin ically indicated."

Demographic data and other characteristics will be recorded including date of birth or age, gender, smoking history, and race/ethnicity, according to local regulations. A standard medical and surgical history will be obtained. Written informed consent and any locally requi red privacy act document authorization must be obtained prior to performing any protocol-specific procedures, including screening evaluations. If laboratory or imaging procedures were performed for alternate reasons prior to signing consent, these can be used for screening purposes with consent of the patient. However, all screening laboratory and imaging results must have been obtained within 21 days of randomization (except if using a patient’s diagnostic scan which may be used as a baseline scan if taken within 28 days of randomization and in accordance with the requirements outlined in Appendix E ). All patients will be asked to provide consent to supply a sample of their tumor (archived or newly acqui red biopsy) where available. This consent is included in the main patient informed consent form (ICF). Screening/baseline evaluations may be performed over more than 1 visit.The timing of vital sign assessmen ts should be such that it allows the blood draw (eg, PK blood sample) to occur at the timepoints indicated in Table 2 . 4.2 Treatment period All procedures to be conducted during the treatment period will be performed according to the assessment schedule (see Table 2 ). Whenever vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments should occur in the following order: ECG, vital signs and then blood draws. The timing of the vital signs assessments should be such that it allows the blood draw (eg, PK blood sample) to occur at the timepoints indicated in Table 2 . ! Patients in Arm 3 only: Patients who receive additional cycles of EP and/or PCI at investigators’ discretion will be expected to follow the assessment schedule in Table 3 after 4 cycles of EP; additional visits or scans due to the optional extension of EP or PCI will be recorded as unscheduled visits/assessments. 4.2.1 Safety Conf irmation Period This applies to the first 60 patients randomised to the study and will be split into two parts; an unblinded safety review carried out by the IDMC will be conducted after the initial 30 patients have had a minimum of 21 days follow up and again after an additional 30 patients have been randomised and had 21 days of follow up (see Section 6.10.1 for details). All procedures will follow the same assessment schedule as for the treatment period ( Table 2 )."

Patients who permanently discontinue drug for reasons other than objective RECIST disease progression should continue to have RECIST scans performed Q6W ± 1 week for the first 12 weeks (relative to the d ate of rando mization), and then Q8W ± 1 week thereafter until confirmed objective disease progression/death (whichever comes first) as defined in Table 3 . If a patient is discontinued for unconfirmed progression then the patient should also continue to have RECIST scans performed Q6W ± 1 week for the first 12 weeks (relative to the date of randomizatio n), and then Q8W ± 1 week thereafter until confirmed objective disease progression or until death (whichever comes first) as defined in Table 3 . All procedures to be conducted during the Follow-up period will be performed according to the assessment schedule (see Table 3 ). Whenever vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments should occur in the following order: ECG, vital signs, and then blood draws. The timing of the first 2 assessments should be such that it allows the blood draw (eg, PK bl ood sample) to occur at the timepoints indicated in Table 3 . All patients will be followed for survival until the end of the study. The schedule of study procedures for patients in long-term follow up is presented in Table 12 in Section 9.3 Study timetable and end of study. 5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS A Web-Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and query handling. The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs as specified in this study protocol and in accordance with the instructions provided. The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and the provision of answers to data queries according to the clinical study agreement (CSA). The investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site. 5.1 Efficacy assessments This study will evaluate the primary endpoint of OS. Secondary objective eff icacy assessments of PFS, proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 and 12 months from randomizatio n (APF6, APF12) and ORR w ill be derived (by AstraZeneca) from site Investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1. OS18 will also be evaluated."
78,page_78,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab Study Code D419QC00001Version 6.0 Date 16 January 2020 79(186)Tumor assessments utilize images from CT (preferred) or MRI, each preferably with IV contrast, of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, collected during screening/baseline and at regular (follow-up) intervals during study treatment. An y other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual patients. The RECIST 1.1 guidelines ( Appendix E ) provide a method of assessment of change in tumor burden in response to treatment. Screening/Baseline imaging should be performed no more than 28 days before rando mization, and id eally should be performed as close as possible to and prior to the start of st udy treatment. The RECIST 1.1 assessments of bas eline images identify target (defined measurable) and non- target lesions, and each lesion (and any new lesion) is evaluated in subsequent, on-treatment follow-up images. This allows determination of follow-up target lesion response, non-targ et lesion response, and overall time-point tumor responses (CR, PR, SD, PD or NE). Efficacy for all patients (all arms) will be assessed on images collected Q6W ±1 week for the first 12 weeks relative to the date of randomisation, and Q8W ± 1 week thereafter until confirmed objective disease progression or off-study. It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible [refer to the study plans in Table 2 (treatment period), and Table 3 (follow up)]. If an unscheduled imaging assessment is performed and the patient has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at his or her next regularly scheduled imaging visit. AstraZeneca requests that at least one subsequent scan is acquired (and sent to the AstraZeneca-appointed imaging Contract Research Organization) after each initial progression event for all patients, across all arms of the study, no earlier than 4 weeks after and no later than the next regularly scheduled imaging visit after the initial progression event. If a patient discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subsequent anticancer therapy) after the initial assessment of progression, then the patient should continue to be followed with scheduled imaging until objective disease progression. Following objective disease progression, patients should continue to be followed up for survival every 2 months (8 weeks) as outlined in the follow-up schedules of assessments (Table 3 ). In addition, all patients will be contacted in the week following data cut-off to confirm survival status. 5.1.1 Reading of scans Although scan assessments will be performed by Investigators, all images, including unscheduled visit scans, will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to an AstraZeneca- appointed imaging Contract Research Organization for QC and storage in the event that central review is required. Ma nagement of patients will be based solely upon the results of the RECIST 1.1 assessment conducted by the Investigator."

Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the patient or the patient’s family, or by contact with the patient’s current physician. The details of first and subsequent therapies for cancer, after discontinuation of treatment, will be collected. In addition, patients on treatment or in surv ival follow-up will be contacted following the data cut-off for the primary analysis of PFS and all subsequent survival analyses to provide complete survival data. These contacts should generally occur within 7 days of the data cutoff. Survival assessments may continue as per protocol (every 2 months) post the primary analysis of OS. 5.2 Safety assessments 5.2.1 Laboratory safe ty assessments Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be taken at the times indicated in the assessment schedules and as clinically indicated (see Table 2 and Table 3 ). Clinical laboratory safety tests, including serum pregnancy tests, will be performed in a licensed clinical laboratory according to local sta ndard procedures. Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary depending on the laboratory method used and routine practice at the site. Urine pregnancy tests may be performed at the site using a licensed test (urine or serum pregnancy test). Clinically significant abnormal la boratory results should be repeated as soon as possible (preferably within 24 to 48 hours). Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator. The date, time of co llection, and results (values, units and reference ranges) w ill be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. The laboratory variables to be measured are presented in Table 4 (clinical chemistry), Table 5 (hematology), and Table 6 (urinalysis). Other safety tests to be performed at Screening include assessment for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), hepatitis C antibodies, HIV antibodies."

Situations in which physical examination results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 6.3.6 . 5.2.3 Electrocardiogram Resting 12-lead ECGs will be recorded at Screening and as clinically indicated throughout the study (see Table 2 ). ECGs should be obtained after the patient has been in a supine position for 5 minutes and recorded while the patient remains in that position. In case of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QTcF value >470 ms, 2 additional 12-lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (eg, 30 minutes) to confirm the finding."

Prior to the beginning of each infusion (measured once from approximately 30 minutes before up to 0 minutes [ie, the beginning of the infusion]) ! Approximately 30 minutes during the infusion ( halfway through infusion) ! At the end of the infusion (approximately 60 minutes ±5 minutes) ! A 1-hour observation period is recommended after the first infusion of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP and durvalumab + EP.

If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes, then BP and pulse rate measurements should follow the principles as described above or be taken more frequently if clinically indicated. Additional monitoring with assessment of vital signs is at the discretion of the investigator per standard clinical practice or as clinically indicated. Subsequent infusions BP, pulse rate, and other vital signs should be measured and collected/recorded in the eCRF prior to the start of the infusion. Patients should be carefully monitored, and BP and other vital signs should be measured during and after infusion as per institution standard and as clinically indicated. Any clinically significant changes in vital signs should be entered onto an unscheduled vital signs case report form (CRF) page.

The PRO instruments will be completed by the patients using a handheld ePRO device. All assessments should be completed without assi stance from anyone according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 and Table 3 ). It takes approximately 30 minutes for patients to complete the questionnaires; therefore, the burden to the patient is moderate."
85,page_85,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab Study Code D419QC00001Version 6.0 Date 16 January 2020 86(186)5.3.1.1 EORTC QLQ-C30 The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3 questionnaire is included for the purpose of assessing HRQoL and is a well-established measure of HRQoL/health status and commonly used as an endpoint in cancer clinical studies. It assesses HRQoL/health status through 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), and a global health and quality-of-life (QoL) scale. Six single-item symptom measures are also included dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties (see Appendix F ). For each of the 15 domains, final scores are transformed such that they range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater functioning, greater HRQoL, or greater level of symptoms ( Aaronson et al 1993 ). 5.3.1.2 EORTC QLQ-LC13 For patients with SCLC, a disease-specific 13 -item self-administered questionnaire for lung cancer was developed (EORTC QLQ-LC13; Appendix F ) to be used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 ( Bergman et al 1994 ). It comprises both multi-item and single-item measures of lung cancer-associated symptoms (i e, coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and pain) and side effects from conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy (ie, hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, and dysphagia). Similar to the EORTC QLQ-C30, all questions except one have a 4-point scale: “not at all”, “a little”, “quite a bit” and “very much”. One question (no. 43, “Did you take any medicine for pain?”) has a response option of “yes” or “no”. The scoring approach for the EORTC QLQ-LC13 is similar to the EORTC QLQ-C30. 5.3.1.3 PRO-CTCAE The PRO-CTCAE is included to address tolerability from the patients’ perspective. It was developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The PRO-CTCAE will only be administered in those countries where a li nguist ically v alidated version exists. It was developed in recognition that collecting symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symp tomatic AE data collection. This was based on findings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings ( Antonia et al 2014 , Litwin et al 1998 , Sprangers and Aaronson 1992 ). These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, the CTCAE term “myalgia” has been converted to “aching muscles”). For several symptoms, like fatigue and pain, additional questions are asked about symptom frequency, severity, and interference with usual activities. The items included in the PRO-CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and patients. These items have been extensively evaluated by cancer patients to be clear, comprehensible, and measure the symptom of interest. In this study, only items that are considered relevant for the study, site of cancer, and cancer treatment are selected (see Appendix F ). 5.3.1.4 Patients’ Global Impression of Change The PGIC item is included to assess how a patient perceives his/her overall change in health status since the star t of study treatment. P atients will choose from response options from “very much improved” to “very much worse.”"
86,page_86,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab Study Code D419QC00001Version 6.0 Date 16 January 2020 87(186)5.3.1.5 EQ-5D-5L The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal (EuroQol Group 1990 ). Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a s imple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in populat ion health surveys. The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, seve re problems, and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty ( EuroQol Group 2013 ). Since 2009, the EuroQol Group has been developing a more sensitive version of the EQ-5D (the EQ-5D-5L) that expands the range of responses to each dimension from 3 to 5 levels of increasing severity ( Herdman et al 2011 ). Preliminary studies indicate that the 5L version improves upon the properties of the 3L measure in terms of reduced ceiling effect, increased reliability, and an improved ability to differentiate between different levels of health ( Janssen et al 2008a , Janssen et al 2008b , Pickard et al 2007 ). The patient will be asked to indicate his/her current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions. The questionnaire also includes a visual analogue scale, where the patient will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state (see Appendix F ). 5.3.2 Administration of the patien t-reported outcome questionnaires Patients will complete the PRO assessments by using an electronic tablet (ePRO) during clinic visits. Each center must allocate the responsibility for the administration of the PRO instruments to a specific individual (eg, a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a back-up person to cover if that individual is absent. The PRO questionnaires must be administered and completed at the clinic as per the schedule of assessments. The PRO questionnaires will be administered on the days specified in the schedules of assessments (see Table 2 and Table 3 ). The EORTC QLQ-C30 should always be completed prior to the EORTC QLQ-LC13 m odule. It is important that the site staff carefully explain the significance and relevance of the data to participating patients so that they are motivated to comply with data collection. The following best practice guidelines should be followed when collecting PRO data via an electronic device: ! It is preferred that PRO questionnaires are completed prior to any other study procedures (following informed consent) and before discussion of disease progression to avoid biasing the patient’s responses to the questions. ! PRO questionnaires must be completed in private by the patient."
87,page_87,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab Study Code D419QC00001Version 6.0 Date 16 January 2020 88(186)! Patients should be given sufficient time to complete the PRO questionnaires at their own speed. ! The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is confidential. Therefore, if the patient has any medical problems, he/she should discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment. ! The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the patient on how to use the ePRO device using the materials and training provided in the ePRO device. The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind patients that there are no right or wrong answers and avoid in troducing bias by not clarifying items. The patient should not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to answer the PRO questionnaires. A key aspect of study success is to have high PRO compliance. Therefore, it is essential to follow the schedule of assessments and that sites make sure the device is charged and fully functional at all times in order to minimize missing data. 5.3.3 Health ca re resource use The assessment of health care resource use will increase the understanding regarding the relationship between treatment and tumor-related cancer symptoms on resource use, such as the need for palliative procedures to address obstruction and bleeding. This will be captured and analyzed to inform submissions to payers. To investigate the impact of treatment and disease on health care resource use, the following variables will be captured by hospital resource use module HOSPAD form: ! Planned and unplanned hospital attendances beyond study protocol mandated visits (including physician visits, emergency room visits, day cases, and admissions) ! Primary sign or symptom the patient presents with ! Length of hospital stay ! Length of any time spent in an intensive care unit 5.4 Pharmacokinetics 5.4.1 Collection of samples for pharmacokinetics analysis Blood samples for determinat ion of etoposide, carboplatin, cisplatin, durvalumab, and tremelimumab concentration in serum or plasma will be obtained according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 and Table 3 ). Samples for etoposide, carboplatin, and cisplatin will be collected from selected sites only and will include approximately 6 patients per arm dosed with etoposide and carboplatin and approximately 6 patients per arm dosed with etoposide and cisplatin.

Samples will be collected, labeled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. Full details of the analytical method used will be described in a separate Bioanalytical Validation Report. 5.4.2 Collection of samples to measure for the presence of ADAs The presence of ADA will be assessed in serum samples taken according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 and Table 3 ). Samples will be measured for the presence of ADAs and ADA neutralizing antibodies for both IPs (durvalumab and tremelimumab) using validated assays. Tiered analysis will be performed to include screening, confirmatory, and titer assay components, and positive-negative cut points previously statistically determined from drug-naïve validation samples will be employed. 5.4.2.1 Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic/ADA samples Durvalumab and tremelimumab PK and ADA samples will be disposed of a maximum of 10 years after the IPs are approved for marketing. EP PK samples will be disposed of after the Bioanalytical Report finalization or six months after issuance of the draft Bioanalytical Report (whichever is earlier), unless requested for future analyses. PK and ADA samples may be disposed of or destroyed or anonymized by pooling. Additional analyses may be conducted on the anonymized, pooled PK samples to further evaluate and validate th e anal ytical method. Results from such analyses may be reported separately from the clinical study re port (CSR). Anonymised EP PK samples will be retained for no more than 5 years after the CSR is finalised. Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, w ill be performed alongside the bioanalysis of the test samples. The results from the evaluation will not be reported in the CSR but separately in a Bioanalytical Validation Report. Any residual back-up PK samples may be used fo r future exploratory biomarker research (in this case, residual back-up PK samples will be shipped to AstraZeneca-assigned Biobank or designee; see details in the Laboratory Manual). 5.5 Biomarkers By participating in this study the patient consents to the collection and use of donated biological samples as described here. Tissue samples will be obtained from all screened patients where available. Based on availability of tissue, additional exploratory biomarkers may be evaluated as described in Section 5.5.1 Samples will be obtained according to the assessment schedules provided in Table 2 and Table 3 ."

The results may be pooled with biomarker data from other durvalumab and tremelimumab studies to evaluate biological responses ac ross indications and to compare results in monotherapy versus combination settings. 5.5.1 Exploratory biomarkers Blood and tumor samples for exploratory biomarker analyses will be obtained according to the schedules presented in Table 2 . Details for collection, volumes, storage, and shipment of biologic samples are presented separately in the Laboratory Manual. Baseline measures (and on-treatment changes) will be correlated with outcomes. Note that samples will be obtained from patients randomized to each treatment arm. Comparisons will be made between baseline measures to determine if biomarkers (or combination of markers) are prognostic or predictive of outcomes associated with Arms 1, 2, and 3. The exploratory biomarker plan is described by sample type below. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and somatic mutations/alterations – tumor and plasma SCLC is characterized by its high mutational load, as described in Section 1.1. Recent data from a Phase I/II study CheckMate 032 (A Phase I/II, Open-label Study of Nivolumab Monotherapy or Nivolumab Combined With Ipilimumab in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors) have shown that patients with a high tumor burden (TMB high) derive greater clinical benefit from PD-1 bl ockade alone or in combination with CTLA-4 blockade. To better understand the significance of this finding and any impact this may have on patients in the present study (CASPIAN), we plan to assess tumor burden in both tumor and blood samples. The overall mutation burden and/or somatic mutations/genomic alterations in tumor tissue and/or plasma may be assessed using methodologies including, but not limited to, whole exome sequencing to targeted sequencing. Such measurements may be correlated with response. Tumor markers This study will mandate the collection of archival/diagnostic tumor tissue, where available, which will be analyzed for various markers by immunohistochemistry."

The relationship between a patient’s PD-L1 expression and spatial distribution within the tumor microenvironment and efficacy outcomes with durvalumab, tremelimumab and EP. 2. The relationship between a patient’s tumor mutational burden and/or presence of somatic mutations/gen omic alterations and efficacy outcomes with durvalumab, tremelimumab and EP. 3. The impact, if any, of the level of DLL3 expression on efficacy outcomes with durvalumab, tremelimumab and EP (once a validated assay becomes available). Other markers that may be assessed, subject to availability of tissue, include CD8 and CD4/FoxP3 protein expression in an effort to enumerate cytotoxic vers us regulatory T cells. Based on availability of tissue, a panel of addi tional, immune-relevant markers expressed on TILs or on tumor cells may be assessed. Markers of special interest include, but are not limited to Ox40, GITR, PD-L2, Tim-3, CD137 and Lag 3. Other tissue-based approaches may be pursued including RT-QPCR and in situ hybridization (eg, for detection of IFN- γsignaling genes such as CXCL9 , CXCL10 , IFN-γitself, and DLL3 ), and/or somatic mutation detection methodologies. Management of biomarker data The biomarker data will have unknown clinical significance. AstraZeneca will not provide biomarker research results to patients, their family members, any insurance company, an employer, clinical study investigator, general physician, or any other third party, unless required to do so by law.

SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. 6.1 Definition of adverse events An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition (other than progression of the malignancy under evaluation) or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver), or the abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, ECG). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. The term AE is used to include both SAEs and non-serious AEs. 6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow- up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: !results in death !is immediately life-threatening !requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization !results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity !is a congenital abnormality or birth defect !is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above"
93,page_93,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab Study Code D419QC00001Version 6.0 Date 16 January 2020 94(186)! Adverse Events (AEs) for malignant tu mours reported duri ng a study should generally be assessed as Serious AEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medical Event’ criterion should be used. In certain situations, however, medical judgement on an individual event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumour event should be assessed and reported as a Non-Serious AE. For example, if the tumour is included as medical history and progression occurs during the study, but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the malignant tumour, the AE may not fulfill the attributes for being assessed as serious, although reporting of the progression of the malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, some types of malignant tumours, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatmen t that does not require hospitalization, may be assessed as Non-Serious; examples include Stage 1 basal cell carcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via cone biopsy. Malignant tumours that – as part of normal, if rare, progression – undergo transformation (e.g., Richter's transformation of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia into diffuse large B cell lymphoma) should not be considered a new malignant tumour For further guidance on the definition of an SAE, see Appendix A . All SAEs (ie, those occurring after the AE and SAE collection period) considered to be reasonably related to the study treatments or to the research must be notified to the sponsor with no time limit. 6.3 Recording of adverse events 6.3.1 Time period fo r collection of adverse events AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time of the patient signing the informed consent form until the follow-up period is completed (90 days after the last dose of durvalumab ± tremelimumab or EP). If an event that starts post the defined safety follow-up period noted above is considered to be due to a late onset toxicity to study drug, then it should be reported as an AE or SAE as applicable. 6.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events During the course of the study, all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up for each patient for as long as the event is ongoing. Ever y effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, even if the events continue after the patient has discontinued study drug, or the study has completed. Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated but without further recording in the eCRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary."

A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov). It is important to distinguish between SAEs and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 6.2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but it is not an SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke, but it would be an SAE if it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2. 6.3.4 Causality collection The investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IPs and each AE and answer “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?” For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for other medications and study procedures. Note that, for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal relationship is implied as “yes.” A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A . 6.3.5 Relationship to protocol procedures The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of the relationship of SAEs to protocol procedures on the SAE report form. This includes both non-treatment-emergent (ie, SAEs that occur prior to the administration of IP) and treatment-emergent SAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required during the study (eg, blood collection). The following guidelin es should be used by investigators to assess the relationship of SAEs to the protocol: ! Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure or intervention that was described in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the patient’s medical record. ! Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other than the procedure or intervention that was described in the protocol. The alternative etiology must be documented in the study patient’s medical record. 6.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or reported in response to the open question from the study personnel: “Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?” or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the rec ording of diagnoses is preferred, when possible, to record a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or"

Deterioration as compared with baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values and vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IPs. If deterioration in a laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result or vital sign will be considered as additional information. Whenever possible, the reporting investigator should use the clinical term rather than the laboratory term (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AEs. Deterioration of a laboratory value that is une quivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. 6.3.8 Hy’s law Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN may need to be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix D for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s law. 6.3.9 Disease progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to the disease for which the IP is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of new or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 6.3.10 New cancers The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE. New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the ad ministration of the study treatment and have been identified after the patient’s inclusion in this study."

Death clearly resulting from disease progression should be reported to the Study Monitor/Physician at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the eCRF in the Statement of Death page. It should not be reported as an SAE. ! Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under study, the AE causing the death must be reported to the Study Monitor /Physician as an SAE within 24 hours. It should also be documented in the Statement of Death page in the eCRF . The report should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of PD, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death. ! Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. It should also be documented in the Statement of Death page in the eCRF. A post-mortem may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed, a copy of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to AstraZeneca Patient Safety or its representative within the usual timeframes. Deaths occurring after the protocol defined safety follow-up period after the administration of the last dose of study drug should be documented in the Statement of Death page. If the death occurred as a result of an event that started after the defined safety follow-up period and the event is considered to be due to a late ons et toxicity to study drug, then it should also be reported as an SAE. 6.3.12 Safety Data To Be Collected follo wing the final DCO of the study For patients continuing to receive durvalumab treatment after final DCO and database lock, it is recommended that the patients continue the scheduled site visits according to Table 12 and investigators monitor the patient’s safety laboratory results prior to and periodically during treatment with durvalumab in order to manage AEs in accordance with the Toxicity Management Guidelines.

The investigator or other site personnel will informAstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar day, ie, immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigator or other site personnel indicates that an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an automated e-mail alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the WBDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site personnel will report the SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone.

The reference documents for the definition of expectedness or listedness are the IBs for durvalumab and tremelimumab. The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures and expertise are available to handle medical emergencies during the study. A medical emergency usually constitutes an SAE and is to be reported as such . 6.5 Adverse events of special interest An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of the IP and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of this IP. AESIs for durvalumab ± tremelimumab include, but are not limited to, events with a potential inflammatory or immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants, and/or hormone replacement therapy. These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical studies with durvalumab monotherapy and combination ther apy. An immune-mediated adverse event (imAE) is defined as an AESI that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to"

Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the imAE. If the investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an imAE, the investigator should promptly contact the Study Physician. AESIs/imAEs observed with durvalumab ± tremelimumab include the following: ! Diarrhea/Colitis and intestinal perforation ! Pneumonitis ! Hepatitis ! Endocrinopathies (ie, events of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, hyper- and hypothyroidism and type I diabetes mellitus) ! Rash/Dermatitis ! Nephritis/Blood creatinine increases ! Pancreatitis ! Myocarditis ! Myositis/Polymyositis ! Rare/less frequent imAEs including neuromuscular toxicities (eg, Guillain-Barré, and myasthenia gravis) ! Other inflammatory responses that are rare/less frequent with a potential immune- mediated etiology include, but are not limited to, pericarditis, sarcoidosis, uveitis and other events involving the eye, skin, hematological ,rheumatological events, vasculitis, non-infections meningitis and non-infectious encephalitis. It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs. ! In addition, infusion- related reactions and hypersensi tivity/anaphylactic reactions with a different underlying pharmacological etiology are also considered AESIs. Further information on these risks (eg, presenting symptoms) can be found in the current version of the durvalumab and tremelimumab IBs. More specific guidelines for their evaluation and treatment are described in detail in the Toxicity Management Guidelines (see Section 6.9). These guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assi st the Investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treati ng these types of toxicities. These guidelines"

There is currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose of durvalumab or tremelimumab, and possible symptoms of overdose are not established. ! An overdose with associated AEs will be recorded as the AE diagnosis or symptoms in the relevant AE modules of the eCRF and in the Overdose eCRF module. ! An overdose without associated symptoms will only be reported in the Overdose eCRF module. If an overdose of an AstraZeneca IP occurs during the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel will inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site. For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply (see Section 6.4). For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days. 6.6.2 Standard of Care For patients randomized to the SoC (Arm3) group please refer to the local prescribing information for treatment of cases of overdose. If any overdose is associated with an AE or SAE please record the AE/SAE diagnosis or symptoms in the relevant AE modules only of the eCRF. 6.7 Pregnancy All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca except for: !Pregnancy discovered before the study patient has received any study drugs. 6.7.1 Maternal exposureIf a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the IPs should be discontinued immediately."

Congenital abnormalities or birth defects a nd spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) s hould be followed up and docum ented even if the patient was discontinued from the study. If any pregnancy occurs during the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel should inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZen eca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 to 5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies. The same timelines apply when outcome information is available. 6.7.2 Paternal exposure Male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP combination therapy, 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab + EP, or 90 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab maintenance therapy, which ever is the longer time period. Please follow the local prescribing information relating to contraception and the time limit for such precautions for EP agents. Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy, 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab + EP or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy, whichever is the longer time period, should, if possible, be followed up and documented. Where a report of pregnancy is received, prior to obtaining information about the pregnancy, the investigator must obtain the consent of the patient’s partner. Therefore, the local study team should adopt the ge neric ICF template in line with local procedures and submit it to the relevant Ethics Committees (ECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) prior to use. 6.8 Medication Error For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that either causes harm to the patient or has the potential to cause harm to the patient."

The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 or 5 calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. 6.9 Management of IP-related toxicities The following general guidance should be followed for management of toxicities. ! Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding the agent suspected of causing the toxicity if required). ! If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideration should be given to continuing the same dose of the assigned IP along with appropriate continuing supportive care. If medically appropriate, dose modifications are permitted ! All dose modifications should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation of the approach taken. ! Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, concomitant medications, and infections). This includes EP induced toxicity. In the event that toxicities are clearly attributed to chemotherapy, both EP and durvalumab ± tremelimumab should be delayed. ! In the absence of a clear a lternative etiology, all events should be considered potentially immune r elated and the Toxicity Manageme nt Guidelines should be followed. ! In the event that durvalumab ± tremelimumab is discontinued or delayed as part of the toxicity management guidance EP should st ill be administered as scheduled; every effort should be made to ensure patients receive at least 4 cycles of EP across all arms in the study, if c onditions allow. If unsure how to manage a patient please contact the study physician at AstraZeneca to discuss individual cases. All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03. 6.9.1 Durvalumab and durvalumab + tremelimumab Comprehensive Toxicity Management Guidelines have been developed to assist investigators with the recognition and management of toxicit ies associated with the use of the immune- checkpoint inhibitors durvalumab [Medi4736] (PD-L1 inhibitor) and tremelimumab (CTLA-4 inhibitor). Given the similar underlying mechanisms of toxicities observed with these two compounds, these guidelines are applicable to the management of patients receiving either"

Additionally, these guidelines are applicable when either drug is used alone or in combination and is administered concurrently or sequentially with other anti-cancer drugs (i.e. antineoplastic chemotherapy, targeted agents), as part of a protocol specific treatment regimen. The Toxicity Management Guidelines provide information for the management of immune-med iated reactions, infusion-related reactions, and non-immune mediated reactions that may be observed with checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy or combination checkpoint inhibitor regimens, with specific instructions for dose modifications (including discontinuations) and treatment interventions. Investigators are advised however to use local practice guidelines and consult local references for the management of toxicities observed with other can cer treatment. The most current version of the Toxicity Management Guidelines is provided to investigative site as an Annex document and is maintained within the Site Master File. In addition, a version of the current TMGs is available through the following link: https://tmg.azirae.com. Please contact the clinical study associ ate for information on how to gain a ccess to this website. Patients should be thoroughly evaluated and appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the imAE. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE diagnosis. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, events should be considered potentially immune related. In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab and tremelimumab should be permanently discontinued (see Section 3.9 of this protocol and Toxicity Management Guidelines). Following the first dose of IP, subsequent administration of durvalumab and tremelimumab can be modified based on toxicities observed as described in the Toxicity Management Guidelines. These guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assist the investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities. These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to durvalumab monotherapy and the durvalumab + tremelimumab regimen by the reporting investigator. Dose reductions are not permitted. In case of doubt, the investigator should consult with the Study Physician. The current Toxicity Management Guidelines is maintained within the Site Master File. Please contact your clinical trial associate for information on how to gain access to this website. 6.9.2 Standard-of-care agents Chemotherapies are associated with a number of unwanted effects. EP-r elated toxicity management, dose adjustment, including dose delays and reductions should be performed as indicated in the local prescribing information for the relevant agent. In the event of unfavorable tolerability, patients can switch betw een cisplatin and carboplatin therapy at any point on study (assuming eligibility for the switched therapy is met)."

Sites should utilize dose delays, dose modifications, G-CSF or component transfusions (eg, platelet transfusions) as necessary per local standards to maintain the dose and schedule of EP treatment to optimize tolerability for individual pa tients. Communication with the Sponsor for questions is welcomed. In the event that an AE can reasonably be attributed to EP, dose adjustment of EP should be attempted before modifying the administration of durvalumab ± tremelimumab. In the event that EP is delayed, durvalumab ± tremelimumab should also be delayed and to be resumed as soon as feasible. Every effort should be made to ensure patients receive at least 4 cycles of EP across all arms in the study, if conditions allow. 6.10 Study governance and oversight The safety of all AstraZeneca clinical studies is closely monitored on an ongoing basis by AstraZeneca representatives in consultation with Patient Safety. Issues identified will be addressed; for instance, this could involve ame ndments to the study protocol and letters to investigators. 6.10.1 Safety Co nfirmation An IDMC comprised of independent experts will be convened to confirm the safety and tolerability of the proposed dose and schedule of durvalumab ± tremelimumab in combination with platinum based chemotherapy at two early stages of enrolment. A step wise approach will be adopted. The initial safety review will take place when the first 30 patients (10 in each arm) have completed the 1st cycle of treatm ent and had 21 days of follow up. A second review will take place when an additional 30 patients (10 in each arm) who have completed the 1st cycle of treatment and have had 21 days of follow up. At the time of the 2nd review, it is expected that the initial 30 patients would have had at least 6 weeks of follow up, with some patients receiving much longer. These two reviews will be carried out by the IDMC in an unblinded manner. After review, the IDMC will make a recommendation on whether the study should continue recruitment as planned, or hold recruitment. The IDMC recommendation will be communicated to all sites when available. In addition, the IDMC will meet approximately every 6 months thereafter to continue safety monitoring. Full details of the IDMC procedures, processes, and interim analyses can be found in the IDMC Charter."

As durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody and therefore a protein, it will be degraded to small peptides and amino acids and will be eliminated by renal and reticuloendothelial clearance. It is therefore not expected that durvalumab will induce or inhibit the major drug metabolising cytochrome P450 pathways. As a result, there are no expected pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. The mechanism of action of durvalumab involves binding to PD-L1, and therefore significant pharmacodynamic drug interactions with the commonly administered concomitant medications are not expected. Despite this, appropriate clinical monitoring in all of the planned clinical studies will be conducted to evaluate any potential drug-drug interactions. 7.8 Post-study access to study treatment After the final analysis, AstraZeneca will continue to supply open-label drug to patients receiving durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy up to confirmed progression (see Section 7.2.2 )."

STATISTICAL ANALYSES 8.1 Statistical considerations All statistical analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives. A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized within 3 months of the first randomized patient, and any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments completed prior to reporting of the data. The primary aim of the study is to compar e the efficacy and safety of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP with EP alone and the efficacy and safe ty of durvalumab + EP with EP alone. Sections 8.2to 8.5describe the statistical analyses that apply to the global cohort data. For the China cohort, the same definitions of outcome measures (Section 8.4) and methods of statist ical analyses (S ection 8.5) will be applied unless specified otherwise in Section 8.6or the supplementary China SAP. The same OS treatment effect under the alternative hypothesis is assumed in the plan for the China cohort analyses. 8.2 Sample size estimate The study will randomize approximately 795 elig ible patients 1:1:1 to durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP (Arm 1), durvalumab + EP (Arm 2), or EP (Arm 3). The randomization will be stratified based on planned platinum-based therapy in cycle 1 (carboplatin or cisplatin). Once global enrollment achieves 795 randomized patients, recruitment will continue in China only. A total of up to 189 patients from China will be randomized into the study (see Section 8.6for details). The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP treatment compared with EP (Arm 1 vs. 3) and the efficacy of durvalumab + EP treatment compared with EP (Arm 2 vs. 3) in terms of OS. To control for type 1 error, a significance level of 1% will be used for the analysis of Arm 1 vs. 3, and a significance level of 4% will be used for the analysis of Arm 2 vs. 3. The study w ill be considered positive (a success) if either of the OS analysis results are statist ically signif icant. The sizing assumes a 3-month delay in separation of the OS and PFS curves between arm 1 vs. arm 3 and between arm 2 vs. arm 3, hence the use of average HRs. There will be 2 data cut-off timepoints in the study. The interim analysis of OS will occur when approximately 318 OS events have occurred (60% maturity) in the durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP and EP treatment arms and approximately 318 OS events have occurred (60% maturity) in the durvalumab + EP and EP tr eatment arms. With a 15 month recruitment period in the global cohort and a minimum follow-up period of approximately 13 months, it is anticipated that this analysis will be performed approximately 28 months after the first patient is randomized). The data cut-off for the primary analysis of OS will occur when approximately 425 OS events have occurred across the durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP and EP treatment arms (80%maturity) and approximately 425 OS events have occurred across the durvalumab + EP"

If the av erage true OS HR is 0.69, the study will have 89% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference at the final analysis with a 2- sided 0.93% significance level (for an overall alpha of 1%) for the comparison of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus EP (Arm 1 vs 3), and 96% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference at a 2-sided 3.57% significance level (for an overall alpha of 4%) for the comparison of durvalumab + EP versus EP (Arm 2 vs 3); this translates to a 4.8-month benefit in median OS over EP (15.7 months vs 10.9 months).The smallest treatment difference that would be statist ically signif icant is an average HR of 0.78 for durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus EP and 0.82 for durvalumab + EP ve rsus EP. With a 15-month recruitment period and a minimum follow-up period of 27 months assumed, it is anticipated that this analysis will be performed 42 months after the first patient has been randomized. A key secondary objective is to assess th e efficacy of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP treatment compared with EP (Arm 1 vs. 3) and the efficacy of durvalumab + EP treatment compared with EP (Arm 2 vs. 3) in terms of PFS. These analyses of PFS will be included in the MTP, as described in Section 8.5. If the average true PFS HR is 0.71, the study will have 90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference at the 5% level (using a 2-sided test) for the PFS comparisons when approximately 360 PFS events have been observed in the two treatment arms to be compared. The secondary objective comparisons of durv alumab + tremelimumab + EP vs. durvalumab + EP for OS and PFS are not included in the MTP. 8.3 Definitions of analysis sets Definitions of the analysis sets for each outcome variable are provided in Table 10 .

At each visit, patients will be programmat ically assi gned a RECIST 1.1 over all visit response of CR, PR, SD, PD, or NE depending on the status of their disease compared with baseline and previous assessments. Baseline will be assessed within the 21 days prior to randomization (unless the diagnostic scan is used as baseline, in which case this can be within 28 days prior to randomization – see Appendix E ). If a patient has had a tumor assessment that cannot be evaluated, then the patient will be assigned a visit response of NE (unless there is evidence of progression, in which case the response will be assigned as PD).

Overall survival OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Note: Survival calls will be made in the week following the date of data cut-off for the analysis; if patients are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is after the data cut-off date, these patients will be censored at the date of data cut-off. Death dates may be found by checking publicly available death registries. 8.4.1.3 Secondary endpoints Progression-free survival PFS (per RECIST 1.1 using Investigator assessments) will be defined as the time from the date of rando mization until th e date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomized therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment. However, if the patient progresses or dies after 2 or more missed visits, the patient will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment. If the patient has no evaluable visits or does not have baseline data, he or she will be censored at Day 1 unless the patient dies within 2 visits of Baseline. The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates, not visit dates. RECIST 1.1 assessments/scans contributing towards a particular visit may be performed on different dates. The following rules will be applied: - The date of progression will be determined based on the earliest of the scan dates of the component that triggered the progression. - For investigational assessments, the date of progression will be determined based on the earliest RECIST 1.1 assessment/scan dates of the component that indicates progression. - When censoring a patient for PFS, the patient will be censored at the latest of the dates contributing to a particular overall visit assessment. Note: For target lesions, only the latest scan date is recorded in the RECIST 1.1 eCRF out of all scans performed at that assessment for the target lesions, and similarly for non-target"

In the absence of significant clinical deterioration, the investigational site is advised to continue the patient on their randomized durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP or durvalumab + EP treatment until progression has been confirmed. If progression is not confirmed, the patient should continue their randomized durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP or durvalumab + EP treatment and on-treatment assessments. Treatment through PD in the EP arm is at the investigator’s discretion; however, a follow up scan is required for all patients in the EP arm, even if a subsequent treatment is started. Objective response rate ORR (per RECIST 1.1 using Investigator assessments) is defined as the number (%) of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR. The denominator is a subset of the ITT population who has measur able disease at Bas eline. Data obtained up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR. Patients who go off treatment without progression, receive a subsequent therapy, and then respond will not be included as responders in the ORR. Proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 and 12 months The APF6 and APF12 will be defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed using site Investigator assessments) at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Proportion of patients alive at 18 months The OS18 will be defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 18 months. 8.4.1.4 Exploratory endpoints Time from randomization to second progression (PFS2) PFS2 will be defined as the time from the date of rando mization to the earliest of the progression event subsequent to that used for the PFS endpoint or death. The date of second progression will be recorded by the Investigator in the eCRF and defined according to local standard clinical practice and may involve any of the following: objective radiological imaging, symptomatic progression, or death. The site will be asked whether the patient has had a second progression event on a regular basis (see Table 3 ) following the first progression event used for the primary variable PFS (the first progression) and the status recorded. Patients alive and for whom a second disease progression has not been observed w ill be censored at the last time known to be alive and without a second disease progression, that is, censored at the latest of the PFS or PFS2 assessment date if the patient has not had a second progression or death."

These will be collected for all patients. Data from all cycles of treatment will be combined in the presentation of safety data. “On treatment” will be defined as assessments between date of start dose and 90 days following discontinuation of IP (90 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or durvalumab monotherapy or EP). For AEs, on treatment (or treatment- emergent AEs) will be defined as any AEs that started after dosing or prior to dosing and which worsens following exposure to the treatment. AEs observed up until 90 days following discontinu ation of study treatment (ie, 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab, tremelimumab, or EP) or until the initiation of the first subsequent therapy following discontinuation of treatment (whichever occurs first) will be used for the reporting of AE summary tables . This will more accurately depict AEs attributable to study treatment only because a number of AEs up to 90 days following discontinuation of study treatm ent are likely to be attributable to subsequent therapy. However, to assess the longer term toxicity profile, AE summaries will also be produced containing AEs observed up until 90 days following discontinuation of study treatment (ie, without taking subsequent therapy into account). Further details will be provided in the SAP. Any events in this period that occur after a patient has received further therapy for cancer (following discontinuation of IP) will be flagged in the data listings. A separate data listing of AEs occurring more than 90 days after discontinuation of study treatment will be produced. These events will not be included in AE summaries. 8.4.2.2 Safety assessments For the change from baseline summaries for vital signs, laboratory data, ECGs, and physical examination, the baseline value will be the latest result obtained prior to the start of study treatment. The QTcF will be derived during creation of the reporting database using the reported ECG values (RR and QT): QTcF = QT/RR^ (1/3), where RR is in seconds Corrected calcium will be derived during creation of the reporting database using the following formulas: Corrected calcium (mmol/L) = Total calcium (mmol/L) + ([40 – albumin (G/L)] ×0.02)"

For example: - If a CTCAE criterion involves a change from baseline, evaluable patients would have both a pre-dose and at least 1 post-dose value recorded. - If a CTCAE criterion does not consider changes from baseline, to be evaluable, the patient need only have 1 post-dose value recorded. The denominator in vital signs data should include only those patients with recorded data. 8.4.3 Calculation or deri vation of patient-reported outcome variables PRO questionnaires will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 with the QLQ-LC13 module (HRQoL and lung cancer-specific symptoms), PRO-CTCAE, PGIC, and EQ-5D-5L. All items/questionnaires will be scored according to published scoring guidelines or the developer’s guidelines if published guidelines are not available. All PRO analyses will be based on the FAS (intent-to-treat [ITT] population), unless stated. The PRO data will be assessed using mean/responder analyses based on published thresholds. Qualitative research with patients, clinicians and a review of the literature determine that the key symptoms and issues for patients are insomnia, appetite loss, dyspnea, hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, fatigue as well as physical functioning and global health status decline. These 7 symptoms have been identified as primary measures of interest. Th e physical functioning and overall health status domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 are furthermore pre-specified endpoints of interest. 8.4.3.1 EORTC QLQ-C30 The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions that can be combined to produce 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, a nd social), 3 symptom s cales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), 6 individual items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global measure of health status. The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be scored according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 scoring manual ( Fayers et al 2001 ). An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 will be derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items, each of the functional scales, and the global health status scale in the EORTC QLQ-C30 according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual. Higher scores on the global health status and functioning scales indicate better health status/function, but higher scores on symptom scales/items represent greater symptom severity. 8.4.3.2 Lung cancer module (EORTC QLQ-LC13) The QLQ-LC13 is a lung cancer-specific module from the EORTC for lung cancer comprising 13 questions to assess lung cancer symptoms, treatment-related side effects, and pain medication."

For each dimension, respondents will select which statement best describes their health on that day from a possible 5 options of increasing levels of severity (no problems, slight problems, m oderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D health state is referred to by a 5-digit code allowing for a total of 3125 h ealth states. For example, state 11111 indicates no problems on any of the 5 dimensions. These data will be converted into a weighted health state index by applying scores from EQ-5D value sets elicited from general population samples (the base case w ill be the United Kingdom valuation set, with other country value sets applied in scenario analyses). Where values sets are not available, the EQ-5D-5L to EQ-5D-3L crosswalk will be applied (Oemar et al 2013 , Janssen et al 2008a , Janssen et al 2008b ). In addition to the descriptive system, respondents also assess their health on the day of assessment on a visual analogue scale, ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health). This score is reported separately. 8.4.4 Calculation or derivation of pharmacokinetic variables 8.4.4.1 Population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response/safety analysis A population PK model will be developed using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach. The impact of physiologically relevan t patient characteristics (covariates) and disease on PK will be evaluated. The relationship between PK exposure and effect on safety and efficacy endpoints will be evaluated. The results of such an analysis will be reported in a separate report. The PK, pharmacodynamic, demo graphic, safety, and efficacy data collected in this study may also be combined with s imilar data from other studies and explored using population PK and/or PK-pharmacodynamic methods. 8.4.4.2 Pharmacokinetic non-compartmental analysis PK concentration data and summary statistics will be tabulated by time point. Peak and trough concentrations will be determined as data allow. Samples below the lower limit of quantification will be treated as missing in the analyses. 8.4.4.3 Immunogenicity analysis Immunogenicity results will be analyzed descriptively by summarizing the number and percentage of patients who develop detectable ADAs against durvalumab and tremelimumab. The immunogenicity titer and the presence of neutralizing ADAs will be reported for samples confirmed positive for the presence of ADAs. The effect of immunogenicity on PK, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety will be evaluated, if the data allow. 8.5 Methods for statistical analyses The formal statistical analysis will be performed to test the main hypotheses for OS: !

With this approach, hypotheses will be tested in a pre- defined order as outlined in Figure 6. Acc ording to alpha (test mass) splitting and alpha recycling, the test mass that becomes available after each rejected hypothesis is recycled to secondary hypotheses not yet rejected Note given OS is tested at multiple timepoints (i .e., interim and final analyses), the OS tests for the same comparison (i.e., shown in 1 box in th e MTP) will be considered as 1 test family. As long as one test in the family can be rejected, the family is rejected thus the assigned total alpha to the family can be recycled to next MT P level. This testing procedure stops when the entire test mass is allocated to non-rejected hypotheses. Implementation of this pre-defined ordered testing procedure, including recycling, will strongly control type I error at 5% (2- sided), among all key hypotheses.

If the OS (Arm 2 vs. 3) analysis is significant, then 4% alpha will be recycled to the OS (Arm 1 vs. 3) endpoint; If the OS (Arm 1 vs. 3) analysis is significant, then 1% alpha will be recycled to the OS (Arm 2 vs. 3) endpoint; If both OS primary analyses are significant, then 5% alpha will be recycled to the PFS (Arm 2 vs. 3) endpoint. If PFS (Arm 2 vs. 3) is significant, then the 5% alpha will be recycled to PFS (Arm 1 vs. 3). Spending alpha between the analyses in MTP in this way will strongly control type 1 error (Glimm et al 2009 ) For the OS endpoint, there is 1 IA planned, and the alpha level will be controlled at the interim and primary analysis t imepoints by using the Lan-DeMets (Lan and De Mets, 1983 ) spending function that approximates an O’Brien Fleming approach. The O’Brien Fleming boundaries for the OS interim and final analyses will be adjusted depending on the alpha used for the OS endpoint. In addition, durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP will be compared with durvalumab + EP for OS and PFS. This comparison is not included in the MTP. 8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variable(s) 8.5.1.1 Overall survival The primary analyses of the primary OS endpoi nts will occur when approximately 425 deaths have occurred across the durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP and EP treatment arms (80% maturity) and approximately 425 deaths have occurred across the durvalumab + EP and EP treatment arms (80% maturity). OS will be analyzed using a stratified log-rank test adjusting for planned platinum therapy in cycle 1 (carboplatin or cisplatin). The effect of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus EP treatment as well as durvalumab + EP versus EP treatment will be estimated by the HR together with its corresponding ([1- adjusted alpha] × 100%) CI and p-value for the ITT population. The HR and CI can be estimated from the Cox proportional hazards model. Kaplan-Meier plots of OS will be presented by treatment arm. Summaries of the number and percentage of patients who have died, those still in survival follow-up, those lost to follow-up, and those who have withdrawn consent will be provided along with the median OS for each treatment."

These analyses will be performed using the same methodology as for the primary endpoints described above. The analysis to compare durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus durvalumab + EP will not be included in the multiple testing strategy. The assumption of proportionality will be assesse d. Proportional hazards will be tested firstly by examining plots of complementary log-log (eve nt times) versus log (time) and, if these raise concerns, by fitting a time-dependent covariate to assess the extent to which this represents random variation. If a lack of proportionality is evident, the variation in treatment effect will be described by presenting piecewise HR calculated over distinct time periods. In such circumstances, the HR can still be meaningfully interpreted as an average HR over time unless there is extensive crossing of the survival curves. If lack of proportionality is found, this may be a result of treatment-by-covariate interactions, which will be investigated. A sensitivity analysis for OS will examine the censoring patterns to rule out attrition bias, which is achieved by a Kaplan-Meier plot of time to censoring, where the censoring indicator of OS is reversed. A subgroup analysis will be conducted comparing OS between durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP and durvalumab + EP versus EP in the following subgroups of the FAS: planned platinum therapy (carboplatin or cisplatin), age, ge nder, performance status, smoking status, AJCC stage (III/IV), CNS metastasis at baseline (Y/N), ethnicity, and geographical region. Other baseline variables may also be assessed if there is clinical justif ication or an imbalance is observed between the treatment groups. The purpose of the subgroup analyses is to assess the consistency of treatment effect across expe cted prognostic and/or predictive factors. Forest plot(s) will be generated. No adjustment to the significance level for testing of the subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be made, since all these analyses will be considered supportive of the analysis of OS. For each subgroup level of a factor, the HR and 95% CI will be calculated from a Cox proportional hazards model that only contains a term for treatment. Thes e HRs and associated two-sided 95% CIs will be summarised and presented on a forest plot, along with the results of the overall primary analysis. If there are too few events available for a meaningful analysis of a particular subgroup (it is not considered appropriate to present analyses where there are less than 20 events in a subgroup), the relationship between that subgroup and OS will not be formally analyzed. In this case, only descriptive summaries will be provided."

The assumption of proportionality will be assessed in the same way as for OS. The analysis will be based on the programmat ically derived PFS usi ng site Investigator assessments. In addition, as a sensitivity analysis, patients who take subsequent therapy prior to progression or death will be censored at their last evaluable assessment prior to taking the subsequent therapy. Subgroup analyses and a forest plot will be provided for PFS comparing durvalumab ± tremelimumab + EP and EP alone in the same way as previously specified for OS. No adjustment to the significance level for testing will be made since all these subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be considered supportive of the primary analysis of PFS. 8.5.2.2 Objective response rate The ORR will be based on the programmatically derived RECIST using site Investigator data. The ORR will be compared between durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus EP as well as durvalumab + EP versus EP using logistic regression models. The results of the analysis will be presented in terms of an odds ratio together with its associated profile likelihood CI and p- value (based on twice the change in log-lik elihood resulting from the addition of a treatment factor to the model). This analysis will be performed in the ITT population. Summaries will be produced that present the number and percentage of patients with a tumor response (CR/PR).

The key symptoms were: cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, insomnia, fatigue and appetite loss. Therefore, thes e key SCLC symptoms will be identified as primary measures of interest. In addition, physical functioning and overall health status domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 are furthermor e pre-specified endpoints of interest. 8.5.3.1 Mixed-model repeated measures analysis Change from baseline in cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea and chest pain as assessed by the EORTC QLQ - LC13 and insomnia, fatigue and appetite loss as assessed by the EORTC QLQ -C30 will be the primary analysis and assessment of PRO outcome measures. The analysis will be performed using a linear mixed model for repeated measures analysis of change from baseline in the scores for each assessment time point. 8.5.3.2 Time to deterioration Time to symptom and function/HRQoL deterioration will be analyzed for each of the symptom scales/items, function scales, and gl obal health status/QoL in EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13.

The effect of immunogenicity on PK, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety will be evaluated if data allow. 8.5.8 Pharmacokinetic/phar macodynamic relationships If the data are suitable, the relationship between PK exposure and efficacy/safety parameters may be investigated graphically or by using an appropriate data modeling approach. 8.5.9 Biomarker data The relationship of DLL3, TMB, somatic alterations and PD-L1 expression and, if appropriate, other exploratory biomarkers to clinical outcomes (including but not restricted to PFS) may be presented based on sample availability. Summaries and analyses for exploratory biomarkers may be documented in a separate analysis plan and reported outside the CSR in a separate report. 8.5.10 OS interim analysis One OS interim analysis is planned for durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus EP as well as for durvalumab + EP versus EP. This analysis will be performed by an IDMC. The interim analysis of OS will be conducted when approximately 318 OS events have occurred (60% maturity) in the durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP and EP treatment arms and approximately 318 OS events have occurred (60% maturity) in the durvalumab + EP and EP treatment arms. The Lan DeMets spending function that approximates an O’Brien Fleming approach will be used to account for the mu ltiplicity introduced by including an interim analysis for superiority (Lan and DeMets 1983 ). The criterion for superiority is a statistica lly significant improvement in OS at the interim analysis. If 75% of the OS events required at the time of the final OS analysis are available at the time of the interim analysis (ie, 318/425 OS events have occurred), the 2-sided significance level to be applied for the OS (Arm 2 vs 3) at the interim and final analysis would"

If the OS interim analysis result does not meet the criterion of stopping for superiority, then all patients will continue to be followed for survival. The recommendations from the IDMC will not reveal the results of the analyses but will take the form of “Continue/M odify/Recommend early submission/Stop.” Details of the IDMC plan and communication process is provided in the IDMC Charter. 8.6 China cohort The China cohort is defined as all patients from sites in China accredited by CFDA and enrolled into the study prior to the last patient last visit (LPLV) of the global cohort. The China cohort will include approximately 189 randomized patients. The global cohort consists of all patients randomized by the documented date of last patient randomized of the global cohort. Once global enrollment is complete, recruitment across all sites except for those from China will be closed, and the recruitment of patients in China will continue. Hence, a patient randomized in the China cohort prior to the last patient randomized in the global cohort will be included in both the global FAS and China FAS. A patient randomized in the China cohort after the last patient was randomized in the global cohort will be included only in the China FAS. Per CFDA guidance, in addition to the evaluation of the global cohort data for primary, secondary, and safety objectives, evaluation of consistency in efficacy and safety in the Chinese and Asian populations is required to facilitate the benefit-risk assessment for Chinese patients. Thus, the efficacy and safety data in the China cohort will be summarized and analyzed separately where the same endpoint definitions (as described in Section 8.4) and the same methods for statistical analyses (as detailed in Section 8.5) are applied. The China FAS will include all patients randomized in the China cohort and will be used for all China only eff icacy analyses. The China safety analysis set will consist of all patients randomized in the China cohort who receive at least one dose of study treatment. Efficacy analyses for the China cohort will be performed when the OS data from the patients in this cohort are of similar maturity to th ose of the global cohort where significant clinical efficacy is established in the global cohort, eg, if OS efficacy is established at the primary analysis, a similar maturity to this will be used for the consistency evaluation. All statistical an alyses will be considered exploratory and only performed if sufficient numbers of events or patients are available (eg, ≥20 OS events) unless specified otherwise, descriptive statistics only will be presented. No adjustment for multiplicity will be made and"

Hospitalisation Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. Important medical event or medical intervention Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. ! Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatment ! Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine ! Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm ! Blood dyscras ias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusi on, etc) or convulsions that do not re sult in hospitalisation ! Development of drug dependency or drug abuse"

Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the patient actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? ! Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology a nd toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties? ! De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug? ! No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. ! Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge. ! Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship. In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: ! Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug? ! Is there a known mechanism? Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’. Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility."

Collection of samples for genetic research The blood sample for genetic research will be obtained from the patients on Day 1 pre-dose (at or after randomization). Alt hough DNA is stable, early samp le co llection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding patients who may withdraw due to an adverse event (AE), such patients would be important to include in any genetic analysis. If for any reason the sample is not drawn on Day 1, it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit. Only one sample should be collected per patient for genetics during the study. Samples will be collected, labelled, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. For blood volume, see Laboratory Manual.Coding and storage of DNA samples The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are important to maintain patient confidentiality. Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years from the date of last patient last visit, af ter which they will be destroyed. DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. An additional, second code will be assigned to the blood either before or at the time of DNA extraction replacing the information on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will be identifiable by the second, unique number only. This number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated organization. No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or designated organizations working with the DNA). The link between the patient enrolment/rando misation code and the second number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or designated organizations. The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit and to trace samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent. Ethical and Regulatory Requirements The principles for ethical and regulatory requir ements for the study, including this genetics research component, are outlined in Section 10of the main Clinical Study Protocol. Informed consent The genetic component of this study is option al and the patient may participate in other components of the main study without participat ing in the genetic component. To participate in the genetic component of the study, the p atient must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the genetic component of the study. Copies of both signed and dated consent forms must be given to the patient and the original filed at the study centre. The"

Patient data protection AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to patients, any insurance compa ny, any employer, their family members, general physician or any other third party, unless required to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identity of the patient. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a patient. For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an investigator might know a patient’s identity and also have access to his or her ge netic data. Also Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the patient’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate. Data management Any genotype data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca and/or designated organizations to analyze the samples. The results from this genetic research may be reported in a separate report from the CSR or published in scientific journals. AstraZeneca and its designated organisations may share summary results (such as genetic differences from groups of individuals with a disease) from this genetic research with other researchers, such as Hospitals, Academic Organization or Health Insurance Companies. This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the results of similar studies to learn even more about health and disease. The researchers can only use this information for health related research purposes. Researchers may see summary results but they will not be able to see i ndividual patient data or any personal identifiers. Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged with the genetic data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database. Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size The number of patients that will agree to participate in the genetic research is unknown. It is therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal statist ical evaluation or whether only descriptive s tatistics will be generated. A statistical analysis plan will be prepared where appropriate."

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. Specific guidance on the managing liver abnormalities can be found in Sections 5.2.1 and 6.3.8 of the protocol. During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry. The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternati ve explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. Definitions Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TB) ≥ 2xULN at any point during the study following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP). Hy’s Law (HL) AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together with TB ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases mu st precede or be coincident with (ie, on the same day) the elevation in TB, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TB must occur."

INTRODUCTION This Appendix details the implementation of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 guidelines ( Eisenhauer et al 2009 ) for this study with regards to Investigator assessment of tumor burden including protocol-specific requirements for this study. Additional special guidance is provided for determination of confirmation of radiological progression. 2. DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE, NON-MEASURABLE, TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS Measurable: A lesion, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have short axis1diameter of ≥15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. Non-measurable: ! All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 mm to <15 mm short axis diameter at baseline2). ! Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examinat ion (manual palpation) that is not measurable by CT or MRI. ! Previously irradiated lesions3 ! Brain metastasis ! Skin lesions assessed by clinical examination 1The short axis is defined as the longest axis perpendicular to the long axis of the tumor. 2Nodes with <10 mm short axis are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed as non-target lesions (NTLs). 3Localised post-radiation changes which affect lesion s izes may occ ur. Therefore, lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and must be selected as NTL at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment."

Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic–blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability. Blastic lesions are considered non-measurable. ! Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for measurabilit y from a radiolog ical point of view, but if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these should be sel ected over cystic lesions as Target Lesions (TLs). Target Lesions (TLs): A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TLs at baseline. Lymph nodes, in any location (local/regional and distant), are collectively considered as a single organ, with a maximum of 2 lymph nodes as TLs. A bilateral organ (eg, adrenal glands), a segmented organ (eg, liver), or multilobed organ (eg, lung) is each considered as a single organ. Non-Target Lesions (NTLs): Additional measurable lesions not recorded as TLs and non-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as NTLs at baseline. 3. IMAGING MODALITIES The same method of assessment on the same imaging technique should be used to characterize each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow-up visits. A summary of the methods of assessment (imaging modalities) to be used for RECIST 1.1 assessment of TLs, NTLs and new lesions, is provided in Table 13, (please see below).

It is recommended that IV contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the chest and abdomen (including the entire liver and both adrenal glands) will be used to assess tumor burden at baseline and follow-up visits. Any other areas of disease involvement (eg, pelvis, brain) should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual patients. In patients who are sensitive to IV CT contrast , a non-contrast CT examination of the chest and an MRI with IV MRI contrast of the abdomen is appropriate. In patients with severely compromised renal function a non-contrast CT examination of the chest and abdomen is appropriate. For brain lesion assessment, MRI w ith IV contrast is the preferred method over IV contrast-enhanced CT. It is strongly recommended to maintain use of the same imaging modality (CT or MRI), acquisition protocol, facility, and scanner across all imaging time points per patient. 3.2 Clinical examination Clinical examination of skin/surface lesions (by visual inspection or manual palpation) will not be used for assessment of TL. Clinically d etected lesions can be s elected as TLs if they are assessed by CT or MRI scans. Clinical examination can be used to assess NTLs in patients that also have other lesions assessab le by CT, MRI or plain X-ray and to identify the presence of new lesions. 3.3 X-ray 3.3.1 Chest X-ray Chest X-ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL. Chest X-ray can, however, be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions. 3.3.2 Plain X-ray Plain X-ray may be used as a method of assessment for bone NTL and to identify the presence of new bone lesions. 3.4 Ultrasound In this study, ultrasound examination will not be used for assessment of TL and NTL as it is not a reproducible acquisition method (operator de pendent), is subjectiv e in interpretation and may not provide an accurate assessment of true tumor size. Ultrasound examination can, however, be used to identify the presence of new lesions. Tumors identified by ultrasound will need to be assessed by correlative CT or MRI anatomical scan. 3.5 Endoscopy and laparoscopy Endoscopy and laparoscopy will not be used for tumor assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumor assessment."

Results of cytological examinat ion for the neoplastic origin of any effusion (eg, ascites, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion) that a ppears or worsens during the study will not be used as part of the tumor response assessment in this study. An effusion that appears or significantly worsens (from trace to large) radiologically by CT/MRI anatomical scans will be considered to be disease progression due to New Lesions or progression of NTLs, respectively. 3.8 Isotopic bone scan Bone lesions identified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by CT, MRI, or X-ray at baseline should be recorded as NTL and followed by the same method as per baseline assessment. Isotopic bone scans may be used as a method of assessment to identify the presence of new bone lesions at follow-up visits. New lesions may be recorded in case positive hot-spots appear on a bone scan that were not present on a previous bone scan, however, a newly observed equivocal hot-spot on a bone scan which cannot be verified with correlative imaging (CT, MRI, X-ray) of the same anatomical region shall not be the only trigger for a PD assessment at that time point. 3.9 FDG-PET/CT 18F- Fluoro-de oxyglucose positron emission tom ography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, according to the following algorithm: New lesions will be recorded where there is positive 18F- Fluoro- deoxyglucose uptake4not present on baseline or prior FDG-PET scan or in a location corresponding to a new lesion on CT/MRI at the same follow-up visit. If there is no baseline or prior FDG-PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on CT/MRI scans, then follow-up CT/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical indicated, in order to verify new lesions. At present, low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined FDG-PET/CT scan are of limited use in anatomically-based efficacy assessments, and it is therefore suggested that they should not substitute for dedicated di agnostic contrast-enhanced CT scans for tumor measurements by RECIST 1.1. In exceptional situations, if a site can document that the CT 4A positive FDG-PET scan lesion should be reported only when uptake is greater than approximately twice that of the surrounding tissue or liver."

Caution that this is not recommended because the PET portion of the CT introduces additional (PET) data that may bias an Investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed. 4. TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 4.1 Schedule of evaluation The methods of assessment of tumor burden used at baseline CT/MRI scans of the chest and abdomen (including the entire liver and both adrenal glands) must be used at each subsequent follow-up assessment. Additional imaging may be performed based on the signs and symptoms of the patient (eg, new lesions at follow up). The baseline scan for this study must be done within 21 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 and ideally should be performed as close as possib le to the start of investigational product. The patient’s diagnostic scan can be used as the baseline scan if it complies with recommended Image Acquisition Guidelines for assessing tumor burden in the chest and abdomen (including liver and adrenal glands) within 28 days prior to randomization. Efficacy for all patients will be assessed by objective tumor assessments every 6 weeks ± 1 week for the first 12 weeks (relative to the date of rando mization; see Table 2 and Table 3 of the Clinical Study Protocol), then every 8 week s ± 1 week thereafter until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (irrespective of the reason for stopping treatment/or subsequent therapy). For patients who discontinue study drug due to tox icity in the absence of objective progression, objective tumor assessments should be continued every 6 weeks ± 1 week for 12 weeks (relative to the date of randomization) th en every 8 weeks ± 1 week until confirmed objective disease progression. Radiographic progression (PD by RECIST 1.1) requires co llection of a the subsequent scan no earlier than 4 weeks after the prior assessment of PD and no later than the next regularly scheduled imaging visit. In patients receiving study treatment beyond the first RECIST 1.1- defined PD, if progressi on is not confirmed with the subsequent scan then the patient may continue on study treatment a nd continue with imaging assessments on their regular schedule. If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the patient has not progressed, ev ery attempt should be made to perform the subsequent asse ssments at their scheduled visits. This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some patients being assessed at a different frequency than other patients. Additional assessments will be performed post objective disease progression for patients remaining on treatment, or until subsequent cancer therapy according to the clinical study protocol."

Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions or s hort axis diameter for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected. The site and location of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes). All measurements should be recorded in millimeters. At baseline, the sum of the diameters for all TLs will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TLs will be calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters. Special cases:! For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, al ways report the longest diameter. For pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 d imensions, always report the short axis diameter. ! If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is >5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan. ! If a TL has completely disappeared, the diameter should be recorded as 0 mm for the current and all subsequent scans. If a lesion appears in the same lo cation on a subsequent scan, it will be recorded as a New Lesion. ! If a TL splits into two or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts. ! If two or more TLs merge, then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be recorded for one of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion(s). ! If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned. If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. ! If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an estimate of the size of the lesion, and the overall visit assessment will be designated as PD. ! When a TL has had any intervention eg, definitive radiotherapy, embolization, surgery, etc., during the study, the size of the TL should st ill be provided where"

If a TL has been completely removed (surgery) or disappears following an intervention, the diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. 4.2.2 Evaluation of target lesions This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine objective tumor visit response for TL ( Table 14). Table 14 Evaluation of target lesions Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all TLs since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis diameter to <10 mm. Partial response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient decreas e in sum of diameter to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD Progression of disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as reference the smallest previous sum of diameters (nadir) - this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study. In addition to the relative incr ease of 20%, th e sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm from nadir. Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the TLs at follow-up were not assessed or not evaluable (eg, missing anatomy) or had a lesion intervention at this visit. Note: if the sum of diameters meets th e progressive di sease criteria, progressive diseas e overrides not evaluable as a TL response CR Complete response; PR Partial response; PD Progression of disease; NE Not evaluable; SD Stable disease; TL Target lesion. 4.3 Non-target lesions 4.3.1 Evaluation of no n-target lesions All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL s hould be identi fied as NTL at baseline. Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status s hould be followed at subsequent visits. At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response should be recorded by the Investigator. This section provides the defi nitions of the criteria used to determine and record overall response for NTL at the investigational site at each visit ( Table 15)."

All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). Non-CR/non-PD Persistence of one or more NTL. Progression (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Unequivocal progression may be due to an important progression in one lesion only or in several lesions. In all cases the progression MUST be clinically significant for th e physician to consider changing (or stopping) therapy. Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant when one or some of the NTLs were not assessed and, in the Investigator’s opinion, they are not able to provide an evaluable overall NTL assessment at this visit. Note: for patients without TLs at baseline, this is relevant if any of the NTLs were not assessed at this visit and the progression criteria have not been met. CR Complete response; PR Partial response; PD Prog ression of disease; NE Not evaluable; NTL Non-target lesion; TL Target lesion. To achieve ’unequivocal progression’ on the basis of NTLs, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of stable disease or partial response in TLs, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest increase in the size of one or more NTLs is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 4.4 New lesions Details of any new lesions will als o be recorded with the date of assessment. The presence of one or more new lesions is assessed as progression. The finding of a new lesion shoul d be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumor assessments should be continued until the previously new lesion has been assessed as unequivocal and then the progression date should be declared using the date of the init ial scan when the new lesion first appeared. A lesion identified at a follow-up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. 4.5 Symptomatic deterioration Symptomatic (clinical) deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy."

CONFIRMATION OF RADIOLOGICAL PROGRESSION A follow-up scan is collected after the initial RECIST 1.1-defined PD, preferably at the next (and no later than the next) scheduled imaging visit, and no less than 4 weeks after the prior assessment of PD, and the Confirmation of Radiological Progression criteria described below are applied for tumor assessments of this follo w-up scan. Patients with radiological PD who continue to receive study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator and patient (following consultation with AstraZeneca) can receive treatment until no longer having clinical benefit. Confirmation of radiological progression guide lines are set for the following reasons: ! For patient management and treatment decisions"

In the absence of significant clinical deterioration, to promote the collection of additional scans after the first radiologic RECIST 1.1 assessment of progressive disease (PD) in order to distinguish pseudoprogression from true radiologic progression. Confirmation of Radiological Progression Criteria: Confirmation of radiological progression guidelines ar e used to evaluate scans subsequent to a prior radiological PD. An immediate prior RECIST 1.1-defined radiologic PD would be considered confirmed if any of the following cr iteria are met in a subsequent follow-up scan (acquired preferably at the next regularly sc heduled imaging visit but no sooner than 4 weeks after RECIST 1.1-defined PD scan): ! ≥20% increase in the sum diameters of TLs compared with the nadir at 2 consecutive visits, each with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm in sum of diameters compared to nadir (as per RECIST 1.1 definition) ! and/or significant progression (worsening) of NTLs at the follow-up scan timepoint compared with the immediate prior timepoint (as per RECIST 1.1 definition) ! and/or significant progression (worsening) of pre-existing new lesions at the follow-up scan time point compared with the immediate prior time point (Note: Pre-existing new lesions are evaluated as NTLs at the confirmatory scan time-point) ! and/or additional (brand) new unequivocal lesions at the follow-up scan time point (as per RECIST 1.1 definition). NOTE: In order to have confirmed radiologi cal progression, ther e should be two consecutive assessments meeting the PD definition, the first PD by RECIST 1.1 and the second PD using the confirmation of radiological progression cri teria (above). If the first assessment fulfilling the PD definition by RECIST 1.1 is not confir med, the patient may continue with assessments until the next PD by RECIST 1.1, which will also require a follow-up scan evaluated using the Confirmation of Radiological Progression criteria. If the first PD (by RECIST 1.1) is not confirmed by the immediate next scan, then the Investigator should not change the PD assessment of the first scan. If a patient discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subsequent anticancer therapy) prior to radiologic progression, then the patient should still continue to be followed until objective disease progression. 6.

SPECIFICATIONS FOR RADIOLOGICAL IMAGING These notes are recommendations for use in clinical studies. The use of standardized protocols for CT and MRI allows comparability both within and between different studies, irrespective of where the examination has been undertaken. If specified, all images will be collected, quality ch ecked and stored centrally by the imaging CRO appointed by AstraZeneca. Guidelines for image acquisition, anonymization, storage at the investigative site as source data and transfer to the imaging CRO will be provided in a separate document. The management of pati ents will be based solely upon the local assessments conducted by the Investigator. 7.1 CT Scan CT scans of the chest and abdomen (and pelvis when indicated) should be contiguous throughout all the anatomical region of interest. The most critical CT image acquisition para meters for optimal tumor evaluation using RECIST 1.1 are anatomic coverage, contrast administration, slice thickness, and reconstruction interval. 7.1.1 Anatomic coverage Optimal anatomic coverage for most solid tumors is the chest and abdomen (and pelvis if indicated). Coverage should encompass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the disease under evaluation and should additionally investigate areas that may be involved based on signs and symptoms of individual patients. Because a lesion later identified in a body part not scanned at baseline would be considered as a new lesion representing disease progression, careful consideration should be given to the extent of imaging coverage at baseline and at subsequent follow-up time points. This will enable better consistency not only of tumor measurements but also identification of new disease. 7.1.2 Contrast administration Optimal visualisation and measurement of metastases in solid tumors requires consistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrast as well as timing of scanning. Typically, most abdominal imaging is performed during the portal venous phase and (optimally) about the same time frame after injection on each examination. An adequate volume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are demonstrated to best effect and a consistent method is used on subsequent examin ations for any given patient. It is very important that the same technique be used at baseline and on follow-up examinations for a given patient. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non-contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non-enhanced) should be performed should also be based on th e tumor type, anatomic location of the disease and should be optimised to allow for comparison to the prior studies if possible. Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to d etermine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward."
174,page_174,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab Study Code D419QC00001Version 6.0 Date 16 January 2020 175(186)Care must be taken in measurement of TLs on a different modality and interpretation of non- target disease or new lesions, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size using a new modality. Oral contrast is recommended to help visualise and differentiate structures in the abdomen. If iodine contrast media is medically contr aindicated at baseline or at any time during the course of the study then the recommended methods are: CT thoracic (chest) examination without contrast and abdominal (and pelvis) MRI with contrast. If MRI cannot be performed then CT without IV contrast is an option for the thorax and abdomen (and pelvis examination). For brain imaging, MRI with IV contrast is the preferred method. 7.1.3 Slice thickness and reconstruction interval It is recommended that CT scans be performed at 5mm contiguous slice thickness and this guideline presumes a minimum 5 mm thickness in recommendations for the measurable lesion definition. Exceptionally, particular institutions may perform medically acceptable scans at slice thicknesses greater than 5 mm. If this occurs, the minimum size of measurable lesions at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scans. All window settings should be included in the assessment, particularly in the thorax where lung and soft tissue windows should be consider ed. When measuring lesions, the TL should be measured on the same window setting for repeated examinations throughout the study. All images from each examination should be included in the assessment and not “selected” images of the apparent lesion. 7.2 MRI SCAN MRI has excellent contrast, spatial and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. The modality used at follow-up s hould be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. Generally, axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis (and other anatomies eg, neck) with T1 and T2 weighted imaging along with gadolinium-enhanced imaging can be performed. The field of view, matrix, number of excitations, phase encoding steps, use of fat suppression and fast sequences should be optimised for the specific body part being imaged as well as the scanner utilised. CT of the chest is typically recommended over MRI due to significant motion artifacts (heart, major blood vessels, breathing) associated with MRI. It is beyond the scope of this appendix to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques if possible. For these reasons, CT is the imaging modality of choice."
