The medical and so cietal imp acts are considerable and obesity is one of the most significant public health challenges worldwide1-7. Obesity is associated with increased risk of a variety of comorbidities, a ffects physical and mental health a nd reduces health related quality of life8, 9. Pharmacotherapy may serve as a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention for individuals with obesity in order to achieve and sustain a clinically relevant weight loss, to improve comorbid conditions and to facilitate a healthier lifestyle. Few anti-obesity medications are currently available and there is a need for more effective and safe therapeutic options for treatment of obesity. The present trial is a 68-week trial designed to show reduction in body weight and compare the effect and safety of semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c.) 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity. Objectives and endpoints: Primary objectiveTo compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity on body weight Key secondary objectives To compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity on: !Cardiovascular risk factors !Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs) To compare the safety and tolerability of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity Primary estimand The estimand will quantify the average treatment effect of semaglutide relative to semaglutide placebo after 68 weeks, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, in all randomised subjects regardless of adherence to treatment and regardless of starting rescue 3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

The medical and so cietal imp acts are considerable and obesity is one of the most significant public health challenges worldwide1-7. Obesity is associated with increased risk of a variety of comorbidi ties including hyperglycaemia, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, urinary incontinence, non-alcoholic s teatohepatitis, cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer, and risk of early death 10-24. Moreover, obesity adversely affects physical and mental health a nd reduces health related quality of life8, 9. Obesity is also associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, which also increases th e risk of cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality25. The risk of obesity-related complications and comorb idities increases with increasing BMI, and a weight loss of 5 −10 % has significant health benefits in terms of slowing progression to T2D26-29. Furthermore, a weight loss of 5 −10% improves many other obesity related comorbidities as well as physical symptoms and quality of life30-37. Finally, studies suggest a beneficial impact of weight loss on cardiovascular risk and mortality in both people with diabetes and obesity38-40. Lifestyle intervention in the form of diet and exercise is first line treatment for obesity, but most people with obesity struggle to ach ieve and maintain their weight loss 41-50. Surgical treatments offer an effective alternative for some people with seve re obesity, but surgery carries a risk in connection with the procedure and is not without complications. Furthermore, surgery requires close follow-up of the individual which can be cumbersome and costly41-46, 51, 52. Pharmacotherapy may therefore serve as a valuable adjunct to lifestyle interventio n for individuals with obesity in order to achieve and sustain a clinically relevant weight loss, to improve comorbid condi tions and to facilitate a healthier lifestyle. Few anti-obesity medications are c urrently available and there is a need for more safe and effective therapeutic options for treatment of obesity, especially tr eatments that also target weight maintenance, preventio n and treatment of comorbidities41-45, 53, 54. 3.2 Background 3.2.1 Semaglutide Semaglutide is the next generation glucagon-like peptide -1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) currently under development by Novo Nordisk for the treatment of weight management (NN9536). Semaglutide has been optimised resulting in a longer half-life of approximately 160 hours, making it suitable for once-weekly dosing 55. GLP-1 RA is a physio logical regulator of appetite and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation56.3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

A total of 957 randomised subjects with obesity (without diabetes) were exposed to semaglutide (n=718), liraglutide 3.0 mg (n=103) or placebo (n=136). In this trial, an overall monotone dose-dependent weight loss was observed across the 5 semaglutide doses tested (0.05 to 0.4 mg once-daily). The es timated weight loss at week 52 was 13.8 % at the highest dose tested (0.4 mg once-daily) compared to the weight loss of 2.3% achieved by diet, exercise and placebo alone. 57 Clinical58-62and non-clinical data63indicate that the body weight-reducing effect of semaglutide is mainly mediated by a reduced energy intake. No unexpected safety findings were identified and the tolerability and safety profile was overall consistent with previous findings in the T2D development programme and the GLP-1 RA class in general. A comprehensive review of results from the non-clinical and clinical studies of semaglutide can be found in the current edition of the investigator’s brochure (IB)57and any updates hereof. 3.2.2 Trial population The trial population w ill consist of subjects with obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI > 27 kg/m2) and weight-related comorbidities. These s ubjects represent a clinically relevant population for pharmacotherapeutic weight management as they are at significant risk for weight-related morbidities and mortality, and are likely to benefit from weight reduction. Information about weight-related comorbidities, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea or cardiovascular disease, will be collected systemat ically at screening by the investigators as part of the medical history. Subjects with T2D are excluded from the trial. Sub jects with overweight or obesity and T2D will be addressed in a dedicated trial. First line treatment in weight management should always be lifestyle modification through a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Thus only subjects who have tried but failed a dietary weight loss intervention w ill be included in accordance with regulatory guidelines 64, 65. 3.3 Benefit-risk assessment 3.3.1 Benefits Subjects will be treated with a regimen anticipated to be better than or equal to the weight management they receive at the time of entry into the trial. Results from the phase 2 trial (NN9536-4153) demonstrated that semaglutide s.c. once-daily as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity was effective for weight loss in subjects with obesity, while displaying a satisfactory tolerability profile. Ov erall, a monotone dose-dependent weight loss was observed across all tested doses of semaglutide (0.05 to 0.4 mg once-daily). The weight loss was 11.55 percentage points larger for the 0.4 mg group compared wi th placebo. Weight loss was 3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

In addition, it is expected that all subjects will benefit from participation through close contact with the trial site and counselling by a dietician or a similar qualified healthcare professional, all of which will most likely result in intensified weight management. 3.3.2 Risks and precautions The sections below describe identified and potential risks associated with semaglutide treatment. The identified/potential risks are based on findings in non-clinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks !Gastrointestinal adverse events !Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RA s, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutid e were gastrointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. !Cholelithiasis !Events of cholelithiasis were the most frequently reported gallbladder events in the phase 2 weight management trial (NN9536-4153) and were in a few instances co- reported with the event adjudication committee (EAC) confirmed acute pancreatitis. As a precaution, if cholelithiasis is suspected, appropriate clinical follow-up is to be initiated at the investigator’s discretion. !Acute pancreatitis !Acute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 RA drug class. As a precaution, subjects with a history of c hronic pancreatitis or recent acute pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, trial product s hould be discontinued in case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis in accordance to Section 8.1. Potential risks !Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) !Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal 3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"
18,page_18,"Protocol CONFIDENTIALDate: 21 D ecember 2017 Novo Nordisk Trial ID: NN9536-4373 Version: 2.0 Status: Final Page: 17 of 104 human thyroid. Accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor-mediated C-cell changes in humans is considered to be low. However, as a precaution, exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to medical hi story of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) have been implemented in the trial. !Pancreatic cancer !There is currently no support from non-cli nical studies, clinical tri als or post-marketing data that GLP-1 RA based therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer, but pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by European Medicines Agency. As a precaution, subjects with a history of malignant neoplasms within the past 5 years prior to screening will be excluded from the trial. !Allergic reactions !As is the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide are at risk of developing immunogenic and allergic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to semaglutide or related products will not be enrolled in this trial. Other risks !Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) !Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 3.3.3 Conclusion on benefit-risk profile Necessary precautions have been implemented in the design and planned conduct of the trial in order to minimise the risks and inconveniences of participation in the trial. The safety profile for semaglutide generated from the clinical and non-clinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly. The results of the phase 2 trial (NN9536-4153) ind icate that semaglutide will provide a clinically meaningful weight loss. In conclusion, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and outweighed by the anticipated benefits that semaglutide woul d provide subjects incl uded in this trial. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events of semaglutide s.c. may be found in the IB 57and any updates hereof.3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

The trial includes a screening visit to assess the subject’s eligibility followed by visits/phone contacts every 2ndweek during dose escalation. From week 20, visits/phone contacts will take place every 4thweek for the remaining maintenance period until end of treatment (week 68). A follow-up visit (‘End of trial’) for safety assessments is scheduled 7 weeks after end of treatment to account for the exposure and the long half-life of semaglutide. The trial design is outlined in Figure 5-1 .3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

A 68-week treatment duration (including 52 weeks on target dose) is considered sufficient to assess weight loss, safety and tolerability in the phase 3 weight management development programme in accordance with regulatory guidelines64, 65. The 7 weeks follow-up period is included to account for the exposure and long half-life of semaglutide. A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, mult i-centre trial design is chosen to minimise bias in the assessment of the effect and safety of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo, as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. 5.5 Justification for dose Results from the phase 2 dose-finding trial (NN9536-4153) showed that the semaglutide s.c. 0.4 mg once-daily dose was most effective in terms of weight loss while displaying an acceptable tolerability profile. Using population pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling, it was estimated that a once-weekly maintenance dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide s.c. will result in similar C maxat steady-state as that obtained by the once-daily 0.4 mg semaglutide s.c. dose in trial NN9536-4153. A maintenance dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide s.c. once-weekly has been chosen for the phase 3 weight management development programme. The once-weekly dosing is anticipated to ease the burden of drug administration in clinical practice. Subjects will be initiated at a once-weekly dose of 0.25 mg and follow a fixed-dose escalation regimen, with dose increases every 4 weeks (to doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg/week), until the target dose is reached after 16 weeks. It is well known that to mitigate GI side effects with GLP-1 RA treatment, dose escalation to the target dose is required. Based on experience from the semaglutide T2D development programme, a similar fixed-dose escalation regimen was selected, with dose escalation every 4 weeks until the target dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks. Please refer to Section 7.1for more details on treatment doses. 6 Trial population Prospective approval of protocol de viations to recruitment and enrolment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. 6.1 Inclusion criteria Subjects are eligible to be included in the trial only if all of the following criteria apply:3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

Efforts must be made to have the subjects, who discontinue trial product, to continue in the trial. Subjects must be educated about the continued scientific importance of their data, even if they discontinue trial product. Only subjects who withdraw consent will be considered as withdrawn from the trial. 8.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment !Discontinuation of treatment can be decided by either the investigator or the subject. !Subjects who discontinue trial product should continue with the scheduled visits and assessments to ensure continued counselling and data collection. !If the subject does not wish to attend the sc heduled clinic visits, effort s should be made to have the visits converted to phone contacts.

Subjects meeting discontinuation of trial product cr iteria no. 2, 5 and 6 are allowed to resume trial product, if the criteria are no longer met (see Section 8.1.1 ). A subject who does not fulfil the eligibility criteria must not be randomised. If a subject is randomised in violation of inclusion, exclusion or rando misation criteria, this will be handled as an important protocol deviation, and the IEC/IRB and regulatory authorities must be notified according to local requirements. The primary reason for discontinuation of trial produ ct must be specified in the source data at the time of discontinuation, and subject should continue to follow the visit and assessment schedule. A change in ‘treatment status’ must be made in IWRS to discontinue trial product. If subject is not allowed to resume trial product, the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the ‘end oftreatment’ form in the CRF, and final drug accountability must be performed. 8.1.1 Temporary discontinuation of trial treatment If a subject has discontinued trial product due to te mporary safety concern not related to trial product and is allowed to resume, the subject s hould follow the guide for missed doses (Section 7.1). Similarly, a subject who discontinues tri al product on their own initiative should be encouraged to resume trial product (S ection 7.1). Each missed dose should be recorded in the CRF, as per subject’s reco llection. If a ‘tr eatment status’ session previously has been made in IWRS to indicate discontinuation of trial product, a new “treatment status” session must be made to resume trial product. 8.2 Withdrawal from the trial A subject may withdraw consent at any time at his/her own request. If a subject withdraws consent, the investigator must ask the subject if he/she is willing, as soon as possible, to have assessments performed according to the ‘end of treatment’ visi t. See the flowchart for data to be collected. Final drug accountability must be performed even if the subject is not able to come to the trial site. The investigator must make a ‘treatment status’ session in IWRS to discontinue trial product. If a subject withdraws from the trial, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the medical record. If the subject withdraws consent, Novo Nordisk may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

These events are reviewed by an independent external event adjudication committee in a blinded manner, refer to Appendix 3 for further details. There are 4 ways to identify events relevant for adjudication as described below: !Investigator-reported events for adjudication: When reporting AEs, the investigator must select the appropriate AE category based on pre-defined criteria (see Table 9-1 andAppendix 4 ) !Death !AE Search (standardised screening): All AEs not directly reported by the investigator as requiring adjudication, will undergo screening to identify potential events for adjudication. The investigator can be queried to provide additional information related to the reported AE, e.g. alternative aetiology, underlying cause(s) and/or clinical details. !EAC-identified events: When reviewing source documents provided for another event for adjudication, the EAC can identify additional events in scope for adjudication that were not initially reported by the investigator. In these in stances, the investigator will be notified of the newly identified event and has the option to report the EAC-identified event. Regardless of whether the investigator decides to report the event, it will undergo adj udication.

However, no formal statist ical inference is planned based on number of adverse events. Given the trial sample size, the power of statistical tests for effect endpoints is described below. The tests of superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg to semagl utide placebo for the primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints are performed using the fixed-sequence statistical strategy. This strategy tests the endpoints using a predefined hierarchical order, all at the significance level of 5%, moving to test the next endpoint only after a statistically significant superiority result (p-value < 5%) on the previous endpoint. The test hierarchy is given in Table 10-2 with underlying assumptions, marginal power and effective pow er. The effective power is calculated under the assumption of independence of endpoints by multiplying the respective marginal powers successively. As the two primary endpoints are included in the statistical testing hierarchy, significant superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs . semag lutide placebo must be demonstrated for each of the primary endpoints. In the analysis approach addressing the primary estimand, week 68 assessments from retrieved subjects (AD) are used. These data are also used to impute missing measurements at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD). The imputation is done separately within each treatment arm (see description below). However, for the power calculations missing values (MT and MD), regardless of treatment arm, are assumed to be similar to semaglutide placebo subjects. These assumptions are likely conservative with respect to the power, and correspond to the jump to reference sensitivity analysis planned below. Assumptions The common assumptions for the power calculations are:3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

Given these assumptions, the sample size of 1950 subjects (1300 in the semaglutide 2.4 mg once- weekly and 650 in the semaglutide placebo arm), gives an effective power (marginal powers multiplied) of 99% for the first seven endpoints in the hierarchical testing procedure.

Missing body weight measurement at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD) are imputed using assessments from retrieved subjects (AD) in each randomised treatment arm. This will be done according to the timing of last available observation (LAO) of body weight. Missing body weight measurements at week 68 for subjects on randomised treatment (MT) are imputed by sampling from available measurements at week 68 from subjects on randomised treatment (AT) in the relevant randomised treatment arm. The multiple im putation approach is done in three steps: 1.Imputation: Defines an imputation model using retrieved subjects (AD) from FAS and done within groups defined by randomised treatmen t and the timing of the LAO of body weight. The model will be a linear regression of body weight (kg) at week 68 with gender (male/female), baseline BMI (kg/m 2) (in categories 27-<35, 35-<40, ≥40) as factors and baseline body weight (kg) and LAO of body weight (kg) as covariates. No interactions will be included. The grouping of timing will be done by quarters (intervals of 17 weeks). If t iming by quarters is too restrictive, halves (intervals of 34 weeks) or excluding timing will be used. If any subjects are MT, an imputation model for missing body weight measurements at week 68 for MT subjects will also be defined using AT subjects in a similar way. The estimated posterior distribution for the parameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation models are then used to impute missing week 68 body weight values for each randomised treatment arm. This will be done 1, 000 times and results in 1,000 complete data sets. 2.Analysis : Analysis of each of the 1,000 complete data sets, using the analysis models (ANCOVA and logistic regression) results in 1,000 times 2 estimations. 3.Pooling : Integrates the 1,000 times 2 estimation result s into two final results using Rubin’s formula. Based on NN9536-4153 phase 2 results 1,000 copies should be sufficient to establish stable results. If 1,000 copies are insufficient, 10,000 copies will be used. The multiple imputations will be generated using Novo Nordisk trial number 95364373 as seed number. Sensitivity analyses Jump to reference multiple imputation approach (J2R-MI): Missing values of body weight at week 68 (MT and MD) for both the semaglutide 2.4 mg and semaglutide placebo group are imputed by sampling among all available assessments at week 68 in the semaglutide placebo group (AT and AD). This approach makes the assumption that subjects instantly after discontinuation lose any effect of randomised treatment beyond what can be expected from semaglutide placebo treatment as adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity 80.

The model w ill be a linear regre ssion of body weight (kg) at week 68 with gender (male/female), BMI (kg/m2) (in categories 27-<35, 35-<40, ≥40 as factors and baseline body weight (kg) as c ovariate. No interactions will be included. The estimated posterior distribution for the parameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation models are then used to impute missing week 68 body weight values for each randomised treatment arm. This will be done 1, 000 times and results in 1,000 complete data sets. The jump to reference approach is the basis for the sample size calculations. A single imputation approach as done by Sacks81(S1-SI and S2-SI) : Missing weight measurements at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD) are impu ted using a weight regain rate of 0.3 kg/month after LAO but truncated at no change from baseline whenever the extrapolation would lead to a positive weight gain relative to baseline. If a subject's weight at drug discontinuation represented a gain in weight relative to baseline, no additional gain will be imputed, and the unfavourable gain is carried forward to week 68. The weight regain imputation will be done for both randomised arms(S1-SI). Additionally, a version where only the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm uses the regain rate while the semaglutide placebo arm uses last available observation (corresponding to a weight regain rate of 0 kg/month) will be performed (S2-SI). For bot h versions, missing weight measurements at week 68 for subjects on randomised treatment (MT) are imputed by using LAO. Tipping-point multiple imputation analysis (TP-MI) : First, missing data are imputed according to the primary multiple imputation approach. Second, for the semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment arm a penalty will be added to the imputed values at week 68. The approach is to gradually increase this penalty until all confirmed conclusions from the primary analysis are reversed. For each hypothesis tested the specific value of the penalty that reverses the conclusion will be used to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results. This sens itivity analysis evaluates the robustness of the superiority conclusions. Mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) : This ‘MMRM for effectiveness’ will use all assessments regardless of adherence to randomised treatment, including assessments at week 68 for retrieved drop-outs (AD). The MMRM for effectiven ess will be fitted using the same factor and covariate as for the primary analyses all nested within visit.

Week 68 assessments for retrieved drop-outs (AD) are not used in this analysis. The MMRM for efficacy will use assessments only from subjects who are taking the randomised treatment until end of treatmen t or until first discontinuing of randomised treatment. The derived date of the second consecutive missed dose will be used as the latest date for using assessments in this MMRM. The assessment closest in time and before the derived date of the second consecutive missed dose will be used as last assessment on randomised treatment. For subjects who initiate rescue interventions before completion or first discontinuing of randomised treatment, the date of starting weight management drugs or undergoing bariatric surgery will be used as latest date for using assessments in this MMRM. Similarly, the assessment closest in time and before the date of starting weight management drugs or undergoing bariatric surgery will be used as last assessment on randomised treatment. The MMRM for efficacy will be fitted using % weight change and the same factor and covariate as for the primary analyses all nested within visit. An unstructured covariance matrix for measurements within the same subject will be employed, assuming that measurements for different subjects are independent. The secondary estimand for 5% responders will be assessed using the same MMRM for efficacy. From the MMRM individually predicted values for % weight change at week 68 will be used to classify each subject as 5% responder or not. This classification will then be analysed using a logistic regression model with treatment as the only factor.

The Semaglutide s.c. safety committee may recommend unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an independent ad hoc group will be established in order to maintain the blinding of the trial personnel. Event adjudication committee An independent external EAC is established to perform ongoing blinded adjudication of selected types of events and deaths (see Table 9-1 andAppendix 4 ). The EAC will evaluate events sent for adjudication using pre-defined definitions and guidelines in accordance with the EAC Charter. The evaluation is based on review of pre-def ined clinical data collected by the trial sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering all required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact on trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments.The assessment made by both the EAC and the investigator will be presented in the clini cal trial report. In this trial, cardiovascular events will be adjudicated in order to adequately characterize the cardiovascular safety profile, since cardiovascular disease is an important and serious comorbidity of obesity 84. In addition, events of acute pancreatitis will be adjudicated because Novo Nordisk monitors these events closely, as treatment with GLP-1 RAs has been associated with acute pancreatitis. 7) Publication policy The information obtained during the conduct of this trial is considered confidential, and may be used by or on behalf of Novo Nordisk for regulatory purposes as well as for the general development of the trial product.

At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property. In all cases the trial results will be reported in an objective, accurate, balanced and complete manner, with a discussion of the strengths and limitations. In the event of any disagreement on the content of any publication, both the investigators’ and Novo Nordisk opinions will be fairly and sufficiently represented in the publication. Authorship Novo Nordisk will work with one or more investigator(s) and other experts who have contributed to the trial concept or design, acquisition, analysis or interpretation of data to report the results in one or more publications.

Where required by the journal, the investigator from each trial site will be named in an acknowledgement or in the s upplementary m aterial, as specified by the journal. Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s) For a multicentre clinical trial, analyses based on single-site data usually have significant statistical limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare professionals or subjects, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. Thus, Novo Nordisk may deny a request or ask for deferment of the publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. In line with Good Publication Practice, such individual reports should not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Investigator access to data and review of results As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database. Individual investigators will have their own subjects' data, and will be provided with the randomisation code after results are available. 8) Dissemination of clinical trial data Information of the trial will be disclosed at clinicaltrials.gov and novonordisk-trials.com. It will also be disclosed according to other applicable requirements such as those of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 86, the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA)87, European Commission Requirements88, 89and other relevant recommendations or regulations. If a subject requests to be included in the trial via the Novo Nordisk e-mail contact at these web sites, Novo Nordisk may disclose the investigator’s contact details to the subject. As a result of increasing requirements for transparency, some countries require public disclosure of investigator names and their affiliations. The Primary Completion Date (PCD) is the last assessment of the primary endpoint, and is for this trial Last Subject First Treatment + 68 weeks c orresponding to ‘end of treatment’ visit. If the last subject is withdrawn early, the PCD is considered the date when the last subject would have completed ‘end of treatment’ visit. The PCD determines the deadline for results disclosure at clinicaltrials.gov according to FDAAA. 9) Data quality assurance Case Report Forms (CRFs) !Novo Nordisk or designee is responsible for the data management of this trial including quality checking of the data.3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

Events meeting the AE definition !Any abnormal laboratory test results or safety assessments, including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. !A CLAE: a clinical abnormal laboratory finding which is clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. !Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. !Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. !Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of trial product regardless of intent. !A ""lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments.

Note: pre-existing conditions should be recorded as medical history/concomitant illness. !Pre-planned procedures, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. Definition of an SAE An SAE is an AE that fulfils at least one of the following criteria: !Results in death !Is life-threatening !The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. !Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation !Hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalisation are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalisation” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. !Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.

Novo Nordisk may need to report this AE to relevant regulatory authorities. Assessment of severity The investigator will assess intensity for each event reported during the trial and assign it to one of the following categories: !Mild : An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. !Moderate : An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities. !Severe : An event that prevents normal everyday activities. Note: Severe is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both an AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.

Relationship between an AE/SAE and the relevant trial product (s) should be assessed as: !Probable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. !Possible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. !Unlikely - The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product. Alternative aetiology, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant medication, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to trial product administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator should use the IB for the assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical records that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, it is important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send a follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Final outcome The investigator will select the most appropriate outcome: !Recovered/resolved: The subject has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial-related activity after the subject signed the informed consent. !Recovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. !Recovered/resolved with sequelae: The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequelae meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. !Not recovered/not resolved: The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged or the outcome is not known. !Fatal: This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with a fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. !Unknown: This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. Follow-up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Novo Nordisk to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible (e.g. severe hypersensitivity reactions). This may include additional laboratory tests (e.g. skin prick test) or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C- cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical in terpretation of substantially elevat ed calcitonin levels (> 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !tobacco use !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in va rious clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various comorbidities) is poorly unde rstood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells. Calcitonin monitoring A blood sample will be drawn at pre-specif ied trial visits for measurement of calcitonin. In case a subject has a calcitonin value ≥ 10 ng/L, the algorithm outlined in Figure 11-1 and described below should be followed. The al gorithm app lies for all calcitonin values in the trial.3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

The subject should remain in the trial; however, all medications susp ected to relate to this condition must be discontinued until diagnosis has been established. Background: These values were found in 9 (0.15%) of a population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease90. All of these patients were diagnosed with MTC, resulting in a p ositive predictive value of 100%.

Calcitonin ≥ 50 and < 100 ng/L Action: The subject (even if a screen failure) shoul d be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. The subject should remain in th e trial and can continue on trial product. Background: These values were found in 8 (0.14%) of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease90. Two of these subjects were diagnosed with MTC and two were diagnosed with C cell hyperplasia, resulting in a positive predictive value of a C-cell anomaly of 50%. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !if available, and if there are no contraindications, a pentagastrin stimulation test should be done. For subjects with positive pentagastrin stimulation test, surgery should be considered. !if pentagastrin stimulation test is not available, thyroid ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy may add important clinical information about the need for surgery. Calcitonin ≥ 10 and < 50 ng/L Action: The subject can continue in the trial on tr ial product. Continue sampling of calcitonin according to the protocol. If the subject is a screen failure, or if the value is from the last sample taken in the trial, the subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. Background: Calcitonin values from 20–50 ng/L were found in up to 1% of subjects of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease90. The predictive value of a C-cell anomaly for this calcitonin level was 8.3%. However, the likelihood of having a medullary carcinoma >1 cm with calcitonin in this range is extremely low. For calcitonin values between 10-20 ng/L Costante et al. 90identified 216 (3.7%) patients. One patient out of the 216 had a subsequent basal (unstimulated) calcitonin value of 33 ng/L, and had C- cell hyperplasia at surgery. Two other studies used a cut-off of calcitonin > 10 ng/L to screen for C-cell disease, but they do not provide sufficient infor mation on patients with basal CT > 10 and < 20 ng/L to allow conclusions 91, 92.3URWRFROY_ CONFIDENTIAL"

The rationale for implementation is to ensure a better characterisation of the population in scope as new technologies and hypothesis develops. The collection of whole blood at baseline (visit 2) and end of treatment (visit 24) will allow for future genetic analysis thereby increasing the understanding of obesity, obe sity treatment and related diseases in the future. !As the scope of the biosampling for future analysis has broadened to cover obesity and - related diseases with this amendment, some paragraphs in appendix 7 have been revised. Furthermore, the informed consent has been updated to reflect the broader scope. A separate protocol will be developed before the bi osamples from NN9536-4373 can be analysed in the future. This will include rationale for the analysis as well as reporting requirements. !Removal of criteria for discontinuation of trial treatment for subjects included in the trial in violation of the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria and/or randomisation criteria. Subjects will not be discontinued from trial product if considered safe to continue. However, prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrolment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted and deviations from the protocol should be avoided. !Classifications of risks have been removed from the protocol and instead a reference to the IB or any updates hereof has been added for furt her details of the risks associated with semaglutide treatment. !Minor clarification of content and correction of minor errors and typos.

Clinical58-62 3and non-clinical data6364indicate that the body weight-reducing effect of semaglutide is mainly mediated by a reduced energy intake. No unexpected safety findings were identified and the tolerability and safety profile was overall consistent with previous findings in the T2D development programme and the GLP-1 RA class in general. 2.2.2 3.2.2 Trial population The trial population w ill consist of subjects with obesity (BMI > ≥30 kg/m 2) or with overweight (BMI >≥27 kg/m2) and weight-related comorbidities. 2.3 3.3 Benefit-risk assessment 2.3.1 3.3.2 Risks and precautions The sections below describe identified and potential risks associated with semaglutide treatment. For classification and further details of the risks, please refer to the current version of the IB or any updates hereof. The identified/potential risks are based on findings in non-clinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks Gastrointestinal adverse events !Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RA s, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutide were gastrointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Potential risks Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) !Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks expos ure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calc itonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid. 3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQWJORE CONFIDENTIAL"

However, as a precaution, exclusio n and discontinuation criteria related to medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) have been implemented in the trial. Other risks Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) !Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 2.4 Section 7.1 Treatments administered !Injections may be administered in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm, at any time of day irrespective of meals. Subjects should be en couraged to inject in the same area throughout the trial, but changing between left and right side is allowed. 2.5 Section 8 Discontinuation/Withdrawal criteria 2.5.1 Section 8.1 Discontinu ation of trial treatment The subject must be discontinued from trial product, if any of the following applies: 1.

The analyses may include biomarkers currently known or discovered in the future. Genetic analyses may include analysis of candidate genes or genetic markers throughout the genome with the purpose of understanding and predicting response to semaglutide as well as to understand obesity or other related diseases. Analyses of circulating biomarkers will measure hormones, metabolites or other non-genetic serum entity with the purpose of understanding and predicting response to semaglutide as well as understanding obesity or other related diseases. These samples need to be frozen and should be sent in batches to the central laboratory. The analyses are likely to be performed after the trial has come to an end, and results will therefore not be part of the clinical trial report.

Identified risks Gastrointestinal adverse events !Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RA s, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutide were gastrointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Potential risks Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) !Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid. Accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor-mediated C-cell changes in humans is considered to be low. However, as a precaution, exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) have been implemented in the trial.

The rationale for extending the trial is to obtain a better understanding of how the weight, cardiovascular risk factors and glucose metabolism develops after completed pharmacotherapy intervention in people living with overweight or obesity. The extension of this trial mimics a real world setting and can thereby provide better guidance to health care professionals in the future management of people living with obesity as well as to these people. Separate Clinical Trial Reports (CTR) will be prepared for the main and the extension phase of the trial. !Addition of “Main phase” and “Extension phase” throughout the protocol to highlight which sections are related to the “main phase” and which are related to the “extension phase”.

The extension of this trial mimics a real world setting and can thereby provide better guidance to health care professionals in the future management of people living with obesity as well as to these people. Focus in the off-treatment extension phase is change in body weight, cardiovascular risk factors and glucose metabolism in a subset of subjects who have completed the main phase on the target dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly or sem aglutide placebo as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. The 2.4 mg dose has been selected as an inclusion criterion in the extension phase as this is the target dose in the main phase of NN9536-4373 as outlined in Section 5.5. 3.1.2 Overall design Extension phase The extension phase is a 45-week off-treatment period after the last visit in the main phase (i.e. V25) without structured lifestyle intervention. Subjects on the target dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly or semaglutide placebo at the End of Treatment visit (V24) are considered eligible and will be offered continued follow-up at the investigational site for an additional 45 weeks. For subjects continuing in the extension phase, the total trial duration will be approximately 122 weeks (2 weeks screening, 68 weeks treatment and 52 weeks observation). The extension phase includes 5 visits to the clinic (week 68, 75, 80, 104 and week 120); the first two visits of the extension phase (V24 extand V25 ext) coincide with the visits (V24 and V25) in the main phase of the trial. 3.1.3 Key inclusion criteria Extension phase !Informed consent for the extension phase obtained before any trial related activities for the extension phase !On randomised treatment on the target dose at week 68, i.e. treated with 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly or semaglutide placebo 3.1.4 Key exclusion criteria Extension phase !Female who is pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the extension phase3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQWJORE CONFIDENTIAL"
