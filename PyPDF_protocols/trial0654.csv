Patients and Investigators must respect the visit schedule per study flowchar t. If a visit date is changed, the next visit should take pla ce according to the original schedule. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS S ample size determination: According to the literature a nd previous studies having assessed sarilumab, the stan dard deviation (SD) of the RAID score could be estimat ed at 2.5 points. On this basis, a sample size of 140 included patients in order to have at least 112 evaluable patients (assuming almost 20% of non-evaluable patients) , produces a precision, two-sided 95% confidence int erval (CI), with a distance from the mean to the limits th at will be less than 0.5 (considering 20% non-evaluable patients) when the estimated SD is 2.5, assum ing that the change from baseline will be from 30% t o 50% of baseline score. Analysis populations: xIntent-to-treat (ITT) populat ion: all patients who met the eligibility criteria and who are actually treated. xSafety population: all patients who have signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and have been exposed to at least one dose or part of a dose of IMP. xPer-protocol population: patients of ITT population without major protocol deviations. Primary analysis: The primary study objective i s to assess the change in RAID score from baseline to W24. The number of available dat a, mean, standard deviation, median and range (minimum, maximum) will be provided with the 95% conf idence interval of the mean change from baseline to W24. Main analysis will be performed on ITT population. Sens itivity analysis will be conducted in reproducing the same analysis using the per-protocol population. In addition, multivariate analyses such as ANCOVA, Logistic Regressions and Multiple Correspondences analysis can be performed from baseline in order to exploratory explain patient profiles. Analysis of secondary endpoints: All secondary parameters wil l be described; 95% CI will be provided."

The inflammatory process can als o target other organs, characte ristically bone marrow (anemia), eye (scleritis, episcleritis) , lung (interstitial pneumonitis, pleuritis), cardiac (p ericarditis) and skin (nodules, leukocytoclastic vasculitis). It is estimated that approxim ately 0.5-1% of the adult populati on in North America and Europe is affected by RA (2) with 65-70% of RA patients having progressiv e disease that leads to joint destruction, disabili ty and premature death (3, 4, 5). RA affects three times more women than men and the incidence is highest among women over 40 years of a ge (6). Apart from symptomatic treatments as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflamm atory Drugs (NSAIDs), conventional synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (c sDMARDs) were shown to maintain or improve physical func tion and retard radiographic j oint damage (7). More recently, biological compounds including thos e targeting tumor necrosis fa ctor (TNF) alpha, B-cells, or T- cells, have been used successfully to treat RA, and demonstrate g reater efficacy in combination with the reference csDMARD, met hotrexate (MTX). However, about 30-40% of patients fail to respond to these therapies (8, 9) and 50-60% fail to achieve a maj or clinical response (by American College of Rheumatology [ACR] criteria or good response by European League Against Rheumatism [EULAR] criteria). These limitations have prompted t he development of therapies wi th alternative mechanisms of action. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a ke y cytokine involved in the R A pathogenesis causing inflammation and joint destruc tion (10, 11). Inhibition of IL-6 signaling through blockade of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) was first demonstrated to be effective by tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the IL-6 receptor, with intravenous (IV) and newly subcutaneous (SC) formulations (12-18). 4.1.2 Sarilumab Sarilumab, a fully human IgG1 mAb produced using a novel techno logy Velocimmune® developed by Regeneron, targets IL-6R and inhibits IL-6 signali ng.

Kevzara®is expected to be available co mmercially in the second half of 20 18 in France. 4.1.3 Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) Although disease status has bee n globally improved in RA, and i nflammation is better controlled since the wide access to biologi cs, there remain some unmet nee ds as identified by patients’ residual patient burden of disease and comorbidities. Over the last 20 years, there has been a growing interest for s ubjective data and patients’ health care perception (self-reported he alth assessment, quality of li fe, and satisfaction with health care and medication), especially in ch ronic diseases. Apart from pre venting joint destruction and disability in RA patients, treat ments aim to provide them bette r health-related quality of life (24- 26) which leads to assess patient ’s perspective on outcomes sinc e it is often different from physician’s perspective. PRO incorporation into clinical p ractice and in research in RA i s widely supported by international organizations a nd professional bodies including t he European Patients’ Academy on Therapeutic Innovations (EUPAT I; http://www.patientsacademy. eu/index.php/en/) and the EULAR (25) in Europe, and the Pa tient-Centered Outcomes Researc h Institute (PCORI; http://www.pcori.org/research-re sults) and the ACR (27) in the U nited States; all of whom recognize the patients’ uni que position in providing direct fee dback on their disease. Regarding RA treatments, PROs in clude overall disease burden as sessment measured by generic or specific patient self-repor ted questionnaires, which assess domains such as pain or physical function, but may also include anx iety/ depression, fatigue, sl eep and physical activities (28, 29). Depression is the most frequent comorbidity in RA (30). Such ou tcomes are of utmost importance to patients (31). In f act, patients strive for what they consider to be remission, which is normalization of patients’ live s which includes also normal social life, normal physical activities etc. Although not all out comes appear similarly acce ssible to disease-modifying therapies or biologics; since mental well-being is multi-factor ial, levels of efficacy on such outcomes would be useful infor mation for both patients and care givers, and could help guide prescriptions. PROs were assessed in RA patient s treated with sarilumab in pre vious phase III studies [in combination with MTX or other csDMARD (32, 33) and as monotherapy (21 )] showing an improvement from baseline by week 24 in patient global assessme nt of disease activity, pain, Health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI), Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical score, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fat igue (FACIT-F). The Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID) scale is a patie nt-derived score developed by EULAR a few years ago (29). Thi s specific composite index co mprises the seven most important dimensions (measured w ith a numerical rating scale fr om 0 to 10) shown as useful for the assessment of PROs in RA pa tients: pain, functional disabil ity, fatigue, emotional and physical well-being, sleep dist urbance, and coping (29, 34). The RAID was assessed in the"
22,page_22,"Clinical Trial Protocol 06 June 2018 Study Number: SARILL08755 - INN Version number: 3.0 Property of the Sanofi Group - str ictly confidential Page 23international MONARCH and TARG ET trials (21, 33), with greater i mprovement under sarilumab compared to placebo, but findings were not conclusive due to adjustment for multiplicity of tests. Furthermor e, these randomized trials were conducted with the usual caveats associated to patient selection and patient characteristics. In addition, few data are availab le regarding PROs in French RA patients (29, 35, 36). In particular, no French patients wer e included in the recent inte rventional comparative study aiming to assess PROs (including th e RAID scale) in RA patients receiving sarilumab or placebo in combination or not with csD MARD (21, 33). Thus, knowing that the Outcome Measures in rheumatology (OMERACT) Equity Working Group suggested some hete rogeneity in the PROs according to population characteri stics (37), detection for PRO improvement is currently an important meaning for France besides efficacy criteria. 4.2 STUDY RATIONALE This French study will permit data collection from an moderatel y to severely active RA patient population with the aim to analyze relevant data derived from P RO instruments in order to gain further insights into efficacy of sarilumab. This is all the mo re important given that some PROs domains were previously scarcel y collected while being of great importance for RA patients. Furthermore they must be taken i nto account in the shared decisi on-making process for RA treatment (38). More specifically, the main objec tive of this French single-arm, open-label phase IV study is to assess the effect of sarilumab on PROs including important but previously little assessed domains in particular in France, in patients with moderately to severely active RA and inadequate response or intoleran ce to current csDMARDs or TNF i nhibitors. Among all the studied PROs [RAID, Hospital Anxiety and Depressio n Scale, HADS (39); FACIT-F (40); HAQ-DI ( 41); International Physical Activity Questio nnaire, IPAQ (42); Multidimensional Assessment of Thymic States, MAThyS (43), and pa tient global assessment of disease activity], RAID change f rom baseline to week 24 is chose n as primary criterion as this scale comprises the seven most important dimensions shown as use ful for the PRO assessment in RA patients (29, 34). Included patients will receive S C sarilumab 200 mg q2w, in accord ance with the Summary of Product Characteristics (23). I n addition to the efficacy of the product as previously shown, this limited number of injections, as done in this phase IV study with patient management closer to real-life clinical practice tha n in previous international clini cal trials, may lead to provide a positive impact on patients’ perceptions, and then to PROs improv ement under treatment. The 6-month-core period of the SariPRO study will be completed by another maximum 24-week period to assess long-term saf ety of sarilumab and to allow pati ents to pursue their treatment until sarilumab is commercially available in France."

Sarilumab will be supplied by the Sponsor in 1.14 mL ready-to-us e, single-use prefilled glass syringes delivering 200 mg (175 mg/m L) of sarilumab for subcutane ous (SC) injections. A patient will use one prefilled syringe for each dosing. In case o f specific laboratory abnormalities over the treatment period (see section 10.4.6 for more details), the Sponsor will supply 1.14 mL ready-to-use, single-use prefill ed glass syringes delivering 150 m g (131.6 mg/mL) of sarilumab for SC injections, using the Intr eractive Voice Response System (IVRS). During the treatment period, the I MP should be administered eve ry 14 days; however an IMP administration window of ±3 days is permitted per protocol to a ccommodate exceptional circumstances, eg, laboratory test result pending), ongoing adv erse event, or patient scheduling difficulty. Patients and/or their non-professional caregivers will be train ed to administer IMP at the start of the treatment period. This trai ning must be documented in the p atients’ study file. The study coordinator or designe e may administer the first injection, or allows the patient to self-inject, under observation, and provide feed back on technique, thus comb ining the initial dose administration as part of the tra ining procedure on Treatment P eriod Day 1 (Visit 2). If SC injections have to be done on da ys when the patient has a study visit, the IMP will be administered following clinic procedures and blood collection. For doses not given at the study site, a diary card will be provi ded to record information pertain ing to these injections; these diaries will be kept as source data in the patients’ study file . If a patient or non-professional caregiver is completely unable to administer sarilumab at home, it is permitted that the dose will be administered as described above by a home nurse as scheduled. Sarilumab is administered as s ubcutaneous injection in the abdo men (except for the 2-inch area surrounding the navel), the front of the thigh or in upper arm. The site for each injection should be rotated. Injections should not be administered into skin tha t is sore (tender) , bruised, red, hard, scarred or damaged. The injecti on sites will be inspected by th e site personnel at each visit and any injection site reactions (IS Rs) should be documented approp riately on the AE electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) page. 8.2 NON-INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) Not applicable."

Following kits of one prefilled syringe will be pr ovided for each patient, using the IVRS. Additional treatment kits to provi de medication under circumsta nces as damaged kit or unusable kit will be allocated by IVRS. 8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE Investigators or other authori zed persons (eg, pharmacists) are responsible for storing the IMP in a secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, l abeling specificati ons, policies, and procedures. Control of IMP storage conditions , especially control of temper ature (eg, refrigerated storage) and information on in-use stabilit y and instructions for handli ng the Sanofi compound must be managed according to the r ules provided by the Sponsor. All sarilumab PFS must be stored at a controlled temperature of 2-8qC (with no freezing), and in the original carton in order to pr otect from light. After remov ing the PFS from the refrigerator, it should be allowed to warm up at roo m temperature before injectin g sarilumab (for at least 30 minutes before using), and it shou ld be administered within 14 days and should not be stored above 25ºC."

All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. Any quality issue noticed with the r eceipt or use of an IMP (def iciency in condition, appearance, pertaining documentation, labeli ng, expiration date, etc.) must be promptly notified to the Sponsor. Some deficiencies ma y be recorded through a complaint procedure. A potential defect i n the quality of IMP may be subject to initi ation of a recall procedure by the Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to r ecall the IMP and eliminate po tential hazards. Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a thi rd party (except for patients enrolled in the study), allow t he IMP to be used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance Measures taken to ensure and document treatment compliance and I MP accountability include: xProper recording of treatment k it number or packaging number as required on appropriate electronic case report form (e- CRF) page for accounting purpose s. xA diary card will be provided t o patients to reco rd home injecti ons. Patients will be asked to return all empty drug supply boxes, unused PFS, and diary car ds to the clinic at each visit as a measure of drug accountability and patient compliance . Sharps containers for any used PFS will be provided loc ally to patients for home usag e. After home injections, the used syringes must be placed into the sharps containers imm ediately. The sharps containers should be returned t o sites and discarded by the sit e staff at the frequency per local schedule. So, sharps contai ners for used syringes, back-pa ck and insulated cooling bag for transport from sites to patient’s home will be provided by the sponsor to the site for the patients. xThe study coordinator tracks treat ment accountability/complianc e, either by diary, or by counting the number of unused/use d treatment kits and fills in the appropriate page of the patient treatment log. The monito r in charge of the study then checks the data entered on the IMP administration page by com paring them with the IMP that has been retrieved and the patient treatment log form. 8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments All partially used or unused treat ments will be retrieved by th e Sponsor or destroyed at study site."

This can ei ther be given as a single weekly dose usually 48 hours after MTX ad ministration or be divided into d aily doses to achieve at least 5 mg folic acid per week. It is the Investigator’s decision as to which dosing regimen is used. Oral corticosteroids : Patients may receive oral cortico VWHURLGVDWGRVHRI mg/day prednisone or equivalent duri ng the study, if initiated at leas t 4 weeks prior to Baseline. To treat AE for a condition not related to R A that requires a corticoste roid dose modification, increased doses of oral corticosteroids during the study will be permitted . Corticosteroids can be stepwise discontinued at the investigato r's discretion in eligible patients in order to achieve a steroid-fr ee condition. After a potential in creased dose of oral corticosteroids, up to 15 mg of prednisone daily (or equivalent), the corticoster oid dose should be tapered down to the previous level as rapidl y as medically possible. In cases where increased corticosteroids doses for RA conditions can’t be tapered down during the study, patient maintenance in the study should be reevaluated based on t he investigator’s judgment. Intranasal, inhaled, or topical cor ticosteroids as per label are permitted, as needed throughout the course of the study. NSAIDs : Patients may be treated with NSA IDs or cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhi bitors (COX-2) at a stable dose that was initiated a t least 4 weeks prior to Baseli ne, up to the maximum recommended dose during the study. The dose should remain stabl e during the study, unless dose reduction is required for safet y reasons. The choice and doses o f NSAIDs and COX-2are at the discretion of the Investigator . The addition of new NSAIDs duri ng the study treatment period is not permitted. Analgesics (other than NSAIDs) and opioids : Analgesics and opioids up to the maximum recommended doses may be used for pain as required. However, pa tients should not take analgesics or opioids within 12 hour s prior to a visit where cl inical efficacy assessments are performed. Lipid-lowering agents : Lipid lowering drugs are permitted. Dose should be stable for at least 6 weeks prior to screening. Anti-IL -6 drugs, including sarilumab, a re known to increase serum"

Use of lipid- lowering agents in patients wit h elevated lipids at any time du ring the study are strongly encouraged in conjunction with the treating physician’s clinica l judgment and guidelines such as National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III, see Appendix C). 8.8.3 Drug interactions In vitro studies demonstrate that IL-6 reduces cytochrome CYP1A 2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. Cau tion should be exercised in patient s who will start sarilumab treatment while on therapy with C YP3A substrates (e.g. oral cont raceptives or statins). Sarilumab or tocilizumab, whic h antagonize IL-6, may normalize t he formation of CYP450 enzymes. As a result, the thera peutic effect of drugs that are m etabolized by these CYP450 isoforms may decrease when RA pa tients start receiving sariluma b. CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored in patients that e nter the treatment period. Some examples of CYP450 substrates wit h a narrow therapeutic index th at require therapeutic monitoring (pharmacodynamics and/ or drug concentration) include : warfarin, cyclosporine, theophylline, digoxin, antie pileptics like carb amazepine (Carbat rol®, Tegretol®), divalproex (Depakote®), phenytoin (Dilantin®), or valproic acid (Depakene®); or antiarrhythmics, like disopyramide (Norpace®), procainamide (Procan®, Pronestyl®), or quinidine (Quinidex®, Quin- Release Quin-G®)."

The Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID) is a patient- reported outcome measure evaluating the impact of RA on pa tient quality of life which co mprises 7 domains: pain, function, fatigue, physical and psychologica l wellbeing, sleep disturbanc e and coping. Each domain is evaluated using a s ingle question answered by a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. Each domain also has a specific weight assigned by a patient su rvey. The RAID score is a continuous variable ranging from 0 (best) to 10 (worst) (see App endix B). The RAID score will be assessed at each assessment visit over th e treatment period, from V2 (at first IMP administration) to V5 (at Week 24). 9.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 9.2.1 Secondary efficacy endpoints (6-month core period) 9.2.1.1Values at each assessment visit and changes from baseline for the total RAID score, HADS, MAThys, FACIT-Fatigue, HAQ-DI, morning stiffness, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and patient global assessment of disease activity All the studied PROs will be a ssessed at each visit over the tr eatment period (from V2 to V5). Questionnaires used are all valid a nd self-rating reliable scale s. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) measures anxiety and depression in both hospital and community settings. T his questionnaire comprises 14 items divided into two subscales: anxiety and depressio n (see Appendix B). Each item is answered by a 0 to 3 rating scale, leading to maximum score s of 21 points for anxiety and d epression. A total score up to 19 indicates a major depressive e pisode; a total score up to 13 in dicates adjustment disorders and minor depression. The Multidimensional Assessment of Thymic States (MAThys) is a multi-dimensional assisted self-administered ques tionnaire comprising five dimens ions (emotional reactivity, cognition speed, psychomotor f unction, motivation and sensory p erception) divided into 20 items relating to individual states a s perceived by patients for the preceding week (see Appendix B). Each item is set out as a continuous measure in the form of a vi sual analogic scale of 10 cm on which the subject is asked to mak e a mark to indicate where he/ she is positioned between the two predefined extreme propositions."
37,page_37,"Clinical Trial Protocol 06 June 2018 Study Number: SARILL08755 - INN Version number: 3.0 Property of the Sanofi Group - str ictly confidential Page 38The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACI T-F) is a symptom- specific scale that measures fatigue in patients assess with chr onic illness therapy over the 7 preceding days. This scale comprises 13 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) (see Appendi x B). The figures are reversed during score calculations, so that higher score values indicat e more favorable conditions. To tal scores then range from 0 to 52, with lower scores repres enting greater fatigue. The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-oriented outcome assessment questionnaire specifically deve loped to asse ss the extent of a RA patient’s functional ability. It consists of 20 questions referring to ei ght component sets: dressing/ grooming, arising, eating, walki ng, hygiene, reach, grip, and a ctivities (see Appendix B). Knowing that here are 2 or 3 quest ions for each section, scorin g within each section is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unabl e to do). The eight category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale fr om zero (no disability) to th ree (completely disabled). It is not truly continuous but ha s 25 possible values. The duration of morning stiffness (in minutes) will be sel f-reported by RA patients. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is a 27-item self-reported questionnaire designed to measur e physical activity of patient. It comprises several parts (job- related, transport-related, dome stic and leisure-time physical activity) and intensities (moderate, vigorous, walking) and includes sitting time (see Appendix B). Ba sed on frequency, duration and intensity of self-repo rted physical activity, individuals are c ategorized into low, moderate and high physical activity groups. The patient global assessment of disease activity measures RA activity as perceived by the patient, using a 100 mm horizontal visual analog scale (VAS). 9.2.1.2Values at each assessment visit and changes from baseline for ESR, DAS28-ESR, CDAI, and joint counts (TJC, SJC) At each visit, all the efficacy parameters will be assessed. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is measured in mm/hr. This laboratory test will be performed in a local medical laboratory. The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA. The index includes the assessment of 28 joints for swelling and tenderness, acute phas e response (ESR or CRP), and general health status. For thi s study, ESR will be used to calc ulate the DAS28 score. The index is calculated using the following formula: DAS28-ESR î¥ 7-& î¥ 6-& îOQ (65 î PtGA where TJC28 is the tender joint count on 28 joints, SJC28 is the swollen joint count on 28 joints, ln is the natural log, ESR is the erythrocyte sedimenta tion rate (mm/hour), i.e., patient’s global assessment of disease activity (PtGA using a 100 mm VAS) .

The CDAI is a combined index for measuri ng disease activity in RA that do es not include a laboratory test. It is c alculated as follows: CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + Pt GA (in cm) + PhGA (in cm) where TJC28 is the tender joint count on 28 joints, SJC28 is the swollen joint count on 28 joints, PtGA is patient’s global assessment of disease activity (100mm V AS), and PhGA is the physician’s global assessment o f disease activity (100mm VAS).

In case the IMP is stopped, it should be determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be a last resort. Any IMP discontin uation must be fully documented in the eCRF. In any case, the patient should remain in th e study as long as possible. 10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product Temporary treatment discontinua tion decided by th e Investigator corresponds to more than one sarilumab injection not administe red to the patient. A temporary treatment discontinuation greater than 31 days has to be considered as permanent. Temporary treatment discontinua tion may be considered by the In vestigator because of suspected or confirmed AEs. Re- initiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or l aboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the responsibil ity of the IMP in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikel y and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to the Section 7)."

All efforts should be made to document the reason(s) for t reatment discontinuation and thi s should be documented in the eCRF. Patients must discontinue saril umab if they experience any of th e following: xPregnancy in female patients xOpportunistic infections (in cluding but not limited to tubercul osis and disseminated herpes zoster) and serious infections xGastro-intestinal perforations or diverticulitis xNeutropenia (ANC <500 cells/mm3) xThrombocytopenia (platelet count <50,000 cells/mm3) xALT or AST elevation of >5 times ULN xMalignancies (with the excepti on of local basal or squamous cel l carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix ute ri that have been excised an d cured) xSigns/symptoms of anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity following SC a dministration of sarilumab xUse of biologic DMARD other than sarilumab xAny AEs, per Investigator’s judgmen t, that may jeopardize the p atient’s safety.

However, if patients no longer wish to take the IMP, the y will be encouraged to remain in the study. The Investigators should discu ss with them key visits to attend . The value of all their study data collected during their continued i nvolvement will be emphasized as important to the public health value of the study. Patients who withdraw from the study treatment should be explic itly asked about the contribution of possible AEs t o their decision, and any AE info rmation elicited must be documented. All study withdrawals must be r ecorded by the Investigator in t he appropriate screens of the eCRF and in the patient’s medical records. In the medical record , at least the date of the withdrawal and the reason should be documented. In addition, a patient may withdraw his/her consent to stop part icipating in the s tudy.

Any o ther AE not listed as an expected event in the summary of product characteristics or in t his protocol will be considered unexpected.

Infections Biologics including s arilumab have been associated with an incr eased risk of infections. Physicians should then exercise caution when considering the us e of sarilumab in patients with a history of recurring infections or with underlying conditions ( e.g., diabetes mellitus) which may predispose patients to infectio ns. Sarilumab should not be admin istered in patients with active infection. Therefore patients with active current infection or a hi story of recurring infection (including but not limited to active T B or history of incompletely treated TB and atypical mycobacterial disease, hepati tis B and C, and herpes zoster) wil l be excluded from the study. The effects of sarilumab on acute reactants, neutrophils, and the signs and symptoms of infection should be considered when evalua ting a patient for a potential infection. Any infection should be reported by the Investigator as an adverse event and a correspo nding eCRF form should be filled in (type of infection, treatment w ith antibiotics if any with ro ute of administration). As all biologics, sarilumab ma y induce immunosuppression, increasi ng the risk of reactivation of latent TB. As a precautionary measure, patients with active TB wi ll be excluded from the study. For inclusion, patient with a past history of TB could be includ ed only if there is a documented confirmation medically validate d by the Investigat or that the p atient was adequately treated and does not meet any of the TB-relate d exclusion cr iteria, notably based on physical examination, negative chest X-ray and TB test over the Screening period. NOTE: in case of latent TB infec tion the patient may be includ ed if a subsequent appropriate anti TB treatment is initi ated since at least 3 weeks"

Also patient s hould be advised, when IMP is admi nistered at home, to self-monitor for potential signs and symptoms that may suggest a hypersensitiv e reaction for 30 minutes after administration. Any problems should be documented in the patient ’s Home Dosing Diary or in the medical notes and reported as AE. In case of systemic hypers ensitivity reaction, the IMP should be discontinued and those events meeting seriousness crit eria (e.g., hosp italization, life threatening, etc.; see Sec tion 10.4.1.2) should be reported as SA Es. Signs of a possible hypersensitivity reaction include but are n ot limited to: xFever, chills, pruritus, urticaria , angioedema, and skin rash. xCardiopulmonary reactions, i ncluding chest pain, dyspnea, hypot ension, or hypertension. If clinical criteria for anaphylax is are met, appropriate treatm ent should be administered immediately and the event should be reported as a SAE. Diverticulitis and gastroi ntestinal perforation Symptomatic diverticulosis, divert iculitis, or ch ronic ulcerativ e lower GI disease such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or other chronic lower GI condition s might predispose to perforations. Therefore patients with a histor y of previous gastrointestinal per foration or diverticulitis will be excluded from the study. The Investigator should pay part icular attention to gastrointes tinal symptoms such as, but not limited to, abdominal pain, hemorrh age, or unexplained change i n bowel habits with fever to assure that the diagnosis is not missed and that the conditions are managed appropriately to avoid the complication of perforati on. If necessary, the patient shou ld be referred to a specialist. Corticosteroid use is known to inc rease the risk of gastrointes tinal perforations. The Investigator should be aware of this potential risk and monitor any sign of d iverticulitis. Gastro-intestinal perforation is an AESI with immediate notific ation to be reported as SAE (see Section 10.4.4). Confirmed diverticulitis or gastrointestinal u lceration should be reported as AEs. Management of dyslipidemia Patients treated with sariluma b have been observed to have incr eased elevations of all lipid parameters, and RA is a known indepe ndent risk factor for cardio vascular events. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, patients with severe uncontrolled fastin g hypercholesterolemia (>3.5 g/L [9.1 mmol/L]) or hypertriglycerid emia (>5.00 g/L [5.6 mmol/L]) will be excluded from the study. Patients who are found to have dyslipidemia during the course of the study should be treated according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)/A dult Treatment Panel 3 (ATP3; See Appendix C) or appli cable local guideline.

A sufficient precision (half-lengt h of the 95% confidence interval ) is required. According to the literature (44, 45, 46) an d findings from the MONARCH and TARGE T studies (22, 33), the standard deviation (SD) of the RAID score could be estimated at 2.5 points. On this basis, a sample size of 140 patients (122 e valuable, if 20% non-evaluabl e patients) produces a precision, two-sided 95% confiden ce interval (CI), with a distan ce from the mean to the limits that will be less than 0.5 when the estimated SD is 2.5.

All eCRFs should be completed in their enti rety in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. Should a correction be made, the c orrected information will be entered in the eCRF overwriting the initial information. An audit trail allows identifying the modification. Data are available within the s ystem to the Sponsor as soon as they are entered in the eCRF. The computerized handling of the data by the Sponsor may genera te additional requests (DRF) to which the Investigator is obliged to respond by confirming or m odifying the data questioned. The requests with their respons es will be managed through the e CRF. 13.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS The complete list of computeri zed systems used for the study is provided in a separate document which is maintained in the Sponsor trial master file."

Women in the following categor ies are not considered WOCBP 1. Premenarchal 2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: - Documented hysterectomy- Documented bilateral salpingectomy- Documented bilateral oophorectomy. 3. Postmenopausal female - A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months w ithout an alternative medical cause. A high follicle s timulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal st ate in women not using hormonal contraception or ho rmonal replacement therapy (H RT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. - Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopau sal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-hormonal highly eff ective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Ot herwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confir mation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE Female participants Female participants of childbear ing potential are eligible to p articipate if they agree to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and corre ctly as described in the following Table.

If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. Sexual abstinence Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effec tive method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence need s to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. NOTES: a) Typical use failure rates may d iffer from those when used con sistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contrace ptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies. b) Hormonal contraception may be s usceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case T WO highly effective methods of contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for up to 3 months after treatment after the last dose of study treatment."
