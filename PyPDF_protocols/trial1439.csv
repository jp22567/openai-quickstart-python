Randomiz ed phase III study testing nivolumab and ipilimumab versus a carboplatin based doublet in 1st line treatment of PS 2 patients or elderly (more than 70 years old) with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. SPONSOR CHU of Rennes COORDINATING INVESTIGATOR Dr Hervé Lena Service de pneumologie CHU de Rennes - Hôpital Pontchaillou 2 rue Henri Le Guilloux 35033 Rennes Cedex 9 France PROTOCOL VERSION 2.0 RATIONALE / CONTEXT Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and the leading cause of cancer - related deaths in Western countries (1). Unfortunately, at the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients already have metastatic disease and a systemic, palliative treatment is the primary therapeutic option. Guidelines for PS 2 patients or older than 75 years old patients a t the time of diagnosis recommend for fit patients a carboplatin doublet chemotherapy. Nivolumab has proven efficacy in 3rd line squamous cell lung carcinoma and is superior to chemotherapy in 2nd line treatment of squamous and non -squamous lung cancer in term of overall survival. In 1st line, nivolumab failed to show superiority compared to a platin based doublet in terms of progression free survival and overall survival in tumors ≥ 5% PD -L1 expression. The association Nivolumab pl us Ipilimumab showed encouraging results in first line setting in phase 1 study. We think that with regard to the manageable toxicity of nivolumab in lung cancer population and the possibility to obtain long responses, this association could be a valid option for this population of elderly and/or PS2 patients in term of overall survival. ORIGINALITY AND INNOVATIVE ASPECTS It will be the first trial to test the efficacy of the association nivolumab and ipilimumab in PS2 and elderly in advanced NSCLC patients. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To compare overall survival of patients in experimental arm versus chemotherapy SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To evaluate :  survival at one year of patients treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus patients treated with chemotherapy ,  the objective response rate ,  the p rogression free survival ,  the safety and the tolerability of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus chemotherapy ,  the QOL,  the prognostic impact of PD-L1 expression by immun ochemistery (IHC) on OS and PFS ,  the predictive impact of a geriatric mini data set on OS, PFS and toxicity and its evolution under treatment, this analysis will be restricted to patients ≥70 years old. PRIMARY EVALUATION CRITERION Overall survival SECONDARY EVALUATION CRITERIA  Percentage of patients alive one year after inclusion in the trial ,"

Patient s will be randomized 1:1 into one of the two treatment arms and stratified by age (70 years old versus less than 70 years old) , by PS (PS 0/1 versus PS2) and by histology (squamous versus non -squamous) . Experimental arm: Nivolumab (BMS -936558) dosed intravenously over 3 0 minutes at 240 mg every 2 weeks combined with Ipilimumab dosed intravenously over 30 minutes at 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons specified in the protocol. Nivolumab and Ipilimumab can be continued beyond progression according to RE CIST 1.1 if the investigator assesses a clinical benefit (defined paragraph) Control arm : the investigator will declare before randomization the treatment among: Doublet of chemotherapy acc ording to standard of care carboplatin (AUC 5) with a dose that will be capped to 700 mg and pemetrexed (500 mg/m²) over 4 to 6 hours every three weeks (restricted to non -squamous histology) or carboplatin (AUC 6) with a dose that will be capped to 700 mg and paclitaxel (90 mg/m² ) D1 D8 D15 over 4 to 6 hours every 4 we eks, with a maximum of 4 cycles of carboplatin based doublet, and the possibility to use maintenance with pemetrexed. Follow up will be done over 30 minutes every 6 weeks in both arms, until progression. Patients treated by the association nivolumab plus ipilimumab in experimental arm and who did not discontinue for progression or toxicity will be treated up to 2 years. In case of subsequent progression a rechallenge with additional one year of treatment by the association nivolumab plus ipi limumab will be proposed. For patients treated by chemotherapy in control arm, after progression, a second line therapy will be proposed according to standard of care. OS will be followed continuously while patient s are on the study drug and every 3 month s via in -person or phone contact after patient s discontinue the study drug. All randomized patients will be evaluated. Su bsequent therapies will be recorded during one year after inclusion. NUMBER OF PATIENTS The primary endpoint of the phase III is overall survival. The study is calibrated to detect a treatment effect hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65, translating in an improvement of 1 - year OS rate from 40% (control arm) to 55% (Nivolumab and Ipilimumab arm). A total of 199 events observed at the time of the final analysis would have 85% power to show statistically significant log -rank test at a 2 -sided alpha level of 5% . Considering a recruitment duration of 24 months and a18 months follow -up for the last included pa tient (estimated total duration of the study: 42 months), 242 patients will be randomized in the study (121 by arm)."

Interim analyses During the trial, one interim analysis for futility will be performed, permitting to early stop the trial, if no sufficient efficacy is shown. This analysis will be performed after that 33% of the expected events have o ccurred. Using planned enrollment rate, this analysis should be performed after inclusion of 171 patients (17 months after first included patient). No adjustment of type I error was required.

Name and description of investigational medicinal products Nivolumab (BMS -936558) is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype mAb that binds PD -1 on activated immune cells and disrupts engagement of the receptor with its liga nds PD -L1 (B7-H1/CD274) and PD -L2 (B7 -DC/CD273), thereby abrogating inhibitory signals and augmenting the host antitumor response. Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1κ that binds to the CTLA -4 antigen expressed on a subset of T cells from human and nonhuman primates. CTLA -4 is a negative regulator of T -cell activity. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA -4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA -4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA -4 has been shown to augment T -cell activat ion and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T - effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA -4 signaling can also reduce T -regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T -cell responsiveness, includ ing the anti -tumor response. 2.2. Summary of results of non -clinical trials and clinical trials available and relevant regarding the research involving the human person study concerned Control arm Chemotherapy is feasible and beneficial for elderly NSCLC patients with advanced/metastatic disease [1 –4]. On the other hand, it should be noted that elderly had higher rates of adverse events during chemotherapy compared with patients younger than 55 years and this observation was independent of comorbidity [5]. This could be the reason for the significant under -treatment of elderly patients in clinical practice. Prospective trials support the use of carboplatin -based doublets in fit elderly patients [6-7]. For less fit patients, single - agent treatment (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, taxanes) represents a valid option according to ESMO guidelines published in 2014 [8] . There are no data to support any single agent offering an OS benefit, v ery limited data are available for octogenarians and, therefore, no specific recommendations can be made for this group. Performance status, comorbidities, life expectancy and patient’s preference should be taken into account when developing a treatment strategy. For patients PS 2 with advanced NSCLC, t he updated systematic review performed by the ASCO clinical practice guideline update and published in oct 2015 [9] identified two small trials spec ifically comparing single agent versus combination chemothe rapy in patients with PS 2. The first trial which included 205 participants, compared carboplatin plus pemetrexed with pemetrexed alone [10]. In the results, OS and PFS were statistically significantly longer with the combination. Adverse events were slight ly more frequent with the combination, but the results were not statistically significant. One trial with 56 participants compared cisplatin plus gemcitabine with gemcitabine and found that OS and QoL was also higher; however, the study was stopped early a nd had few participants [11]. The Cochrane systematic review on chemotherapy and supportive care, updated in 2012, continued to show that chemotherapy and best supportive care versus supportive care alone benefit patients, including those who have PS 2 [12]. PFS were statistically significantly longer with the combination."
19,page_19,"ENERGY Trial Code Sponsor 35RC16_9734 / GFPC 08 -2015 / BMS CA209 -449 Protocole Version 2.0 du 06/11/2017 Page 20/60 Trials limited to patients with PS 2 have typically not rep orted the cause for designation of PS 2 (ie, cancer -related symptoms secondary to large tumor burden v po or PS designation beca use of multiple chronic conditions) . That’s why ASCO guidelines concluded in 2015, that the data informing chemotherapy decisions for patients with PS 2 are insufficien t to make a strong reco mmendation favoring combination chemotherapy. Patients and clinic ians should discuss the risks and benefits of combination chemoth erapy. Some patients may choose single -agent chemotherapy if their perception of risk outweighs perceived benefits of combination therapy. There is no effective tool to determine which patients will tolerate doublet therapy and experience an improvement in PS with a reduction of symptoms and which patients will experience an acceleration of their decline with treatment [9]. Experimental arm Immunotherapeutic approaches recently have dem onstrated clinical efficacy in several cancer types, including melanoma and hormone -refractory prostate cancer [13]. Tumors may modulate and evade the host immune response through a number of mechanisms, including down regulation of tumor -specific antigen expression and presentation, secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulation of inhibitory ligands. T cell checkpoint regulators such as CTLA -4 and programmed death -1 (PD -1, CD279) are cell surface molecules that, when engaged by their cognate l igands, induce signaling cascades down -regulating T cell activation and proliferation. One proposed model by which therapeutic T cell checkpoint inhibitors derive antitumor activity is through breaking of immune tolerance to tumor cell antigens. Nivolumab is now approved in Europe to treat patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC with progression on or after platinum -based chemotherapy. The approval was based on the results of CA209017 [14], a randomized trial of nivolumab versus docetaxel. The median overall survival (OS) for Patient s in the nivolumab arm was 9.2 months versus 6 months for those in the docetaxel arm (HR = 0.59). Improvement in survival was observed for nivolumab regardless of PD -L1 expression, though there was a trend for better efficac y for those with PD -L1 expressing tumors. A single arm trial (CA209063) of 117 Patient s with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC, with progression after platinum -based chemotherapy and at least one additional systemic regimen, showed a 15% overall response rate (ORR), of whom 59% had response durations of 6 months or longer [15]. A second phase 3 study, CA209057 [16], stopped at a pre planned interim analysis by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), met its primary endpoint of superior overall survival of nivolumab versus docetaxel in Patient s with previously -treated non -squamous NSCLC. Patient s in the nivolumab arm had a 27% reduction in risk of death (HR = 0.73; P = 0.0015). Interaction p -values, reported for PD -L1 expression subgroups by each of the predefined expression levels, suggested a clinically important signal of a predictive association. Nivolumab also significantly improved ORR vs docetaxel (P=0 .0246), with ORR as high as 36% in Patient s with PD -L1 expressing tumors. OS approximately doubled with nivolumab vs docetaxel across the PD -L1 expression continuum. In contrast, no difference in OS was seen between nivolumab and docetaxel when PD -L1 was n ot expressed in the tumor. Nivolumab monotherapy has also been evaluated in first -line NSCLC, where it showed promising activity regardless of histology. As in pretreated NSCLC, activity with nivolumab monotherapy is pronounced in PD -L1 expressing NSCLC. The recruitment of the trial comparing nivolumab to chemotherapy in 1st line at the investigator’s choice is cl osed to inclusions. In general, nivolumab also has been well tolerated to date, with a favorable safety profile relative to anticipated toxicities based on an immunostimulatory mechanism of action. Nivolumab monotherapy has also been evaluated in first -line NSCLC, where it showed promising activity regardless of histology [17]. But study Checkmate 026 failed to demonstrate a PFS nor OS benefit in f avor of Nivolumab versus a platin -based doublet in first line treatment of stage IV NSCLC ≥ 5% PD -L1 expression [18]. Preclinical data indicate that the combination of PD -1 and CTLA -4 receptor blockade may improve antitumor activity. In vitro combinations of nivolumab plus ipilimumab increase IFN -ɤ production 2 - to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Increased antitumor activity of the combination was also observed in 3 of 5 syngeneic murine cancer models. In a murine melanoma va ccine model, blockade with either CTLA -4 or PD -1 antibodiesincreased the proportion of CTLA -4 and PD -1-expressing CD4/CD8 tumor infiltrating T effector cells, and dual blockade increased tumor infiltration of T effector cells and decreased intratumoral T r egulatory cells, as compared to either agent alone [19]. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab was evaluated in CA209004 (MDX1106 -04), a phase 1b multiple ascending dose study in Patients with treatment -naive and previously treated advanced melanoma . Results showed promising activity, with higher, but tolerable toxicity than ipilimumab alone [20]. Based on these data, CA209069, a"

In patients with BRAF wild type tumors, the ORR was 61% (44/72), including 22% (16/72) complete responses (CR) in the group treated with the combination, compared to 11% (4/37) with 0 CRs in those treated with ipilimumab alone. The median PFS was not reached in the combination versus 4.4 months for ipilimumab alone (HR=0.4). It should be noted that in the combination group, the ORR was independent of PD -L1 expression. In this group, ORR was 58% among patients with PD -L1+ tumors and 55% among those with PD -L1- tumors. In contrast, in the ipilimumab alone group, the ORR was numerically higher among patients with PD -L1+ t umors (18%) compared to those with PD -L1- tumors (4%). Grade 3 -4 treatment -related AEs were reported in 54% of patients receiving the combination compared to 24% for ipilimumab alone. Ipilimumab has been shown to have activity in lung cancer. A Phase 2 st udy (CA184041) in Patients with NSCLC or small cell lung cancer (SCLC) investigated the addition of ipilimumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel using 2 different schedules (concurrent and phased). The phased schedule demonstrated a significant improvement of immune -related progression -free survival as well as progression -free survival by modified WHO criteria compared to chemotherapy alone, in both NSCLC and SCLC [22]. Based on the initial data in melanoma, and the activity observed with nivolumab and ipilimum ab in lung cancer, the nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination has been also evaluated as first -line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. In CA209012, early combination cohorts evaluated 2 dosing schedules that were studied in the CA209004 study in melan oma: - nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, q 3 weeks x4, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg q 2 weeks (arms G and H, n=24); -nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, q 3 weeks x4, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg q 2 weeks (arms I and J, n=25) These regimens re sulted in significant toxicity, with 39% of patients discontinuing treatment due to a treatment -related adverse event. Thus, additional combination cohorts were initiated, using lower doses of both nivolumab and ipilimumab, or less frequent dosing of ipili mumab. Data from these cohorts demonstrate that both nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q 3 weeks with nivolumab maintenance 3 mg/kg q2w (arm N in study CA209012), as well as ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg q6w is tolerable, when given with nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2w (arm Q in study CA209012). Overall, the safety data are not dissimilar to what has been observed in the nivolumab arm (arm F in CA209012). Of particular note, the rate of discontinuation due to drug -related AEs was 13% in arm N and 11% in arm Q compared t o 10% in the nivolumab monotherapy arm (arm F) [17].

A flat dose of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W was selected since it is identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for patient s weigh ing 80 kg, the observed median body weight in nivolumab treated cancer patients. Using a PPK model, the overall distributions of nivolumab exposures (Cavgss, Cminss, Cmaxss, and Cmin1) are comparable after treatment with either 3 mg/kg or 240 mg nivolumab. The predicted range of nivolumab exposures (median and 90% prediction intervals) resulting from a 240 mg flat dose across the 35 to 160 kg weight range is maintained well below the corresponding exposures observed with the well tolerated 10 mg/kg nivoluma b Q2W dosage. Across the various tumor types in the clinical program, nivolumab has been shown to be safe and well tolerated up to a dose level of 10 mg/kg, and the relationship between nivolumab exposure produced by 3 mg/kg and efficacy and safety has bee n found to be relatively flat. Given the similarity of nivolumab PK across tumor types and the similar exposures predicted following administration of 240 mg flat dose compared to 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen, it is expected that the safety and efficacy profile of 240 mg Q2W nivolumab will be similar to that of 3 mg/kg nivolumab. Hence, a flat dose of 240 mg nivolumab is under investigation. Shorter Infusion Duration Establishing that nivolumab can be safely administered using a shorter infusion time (30 minutes) i s under investigation. Previous clinical studies of nivolumab monotherapy have used a 60 -minute infusion duration wherein, nivolumab has been safely administered up to 10 mg/kg over long treatment periods. Infusion reactions including high -grade hypersensi tivity reactions have been uncommon across nivolumab clinical program. In CA209010, a dose association was observed for infusion site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions (1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were G rade 1 -2 and were manageable. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any safety concerns compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60 -minut e duration. The safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered as a 30 -min infusion was assessed in CA209153 in patients (n=322) with previously treated advanced NSCLC. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the frequency of hypersensitivity /infusion -related reactions (of any cause or treatment -related) in patients administered nivolumab over a 30 min infusion compared with that reported for patients with the 60 min infusion. Thus, it was shown that nivolumab can be safely infused over 30 min . Based on these data, the following schedule will be evaluated in Inergy: - Nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) + ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks) will be evaluated in both PD -L1+ and PD - L1- patients. Of note, all patients included in the trials with ni volumab and ipilimumab were in good general status PS 0 to 1 (inclusion criteria) . Number of elderly patients included in CA209 057 and CA 209 017 was very low even if there was no limitation of age in inclusion criteria. Median age for example in 057 study was 61 years old with only 7% older than 75."

First evaluation will be done at 6 weeks, allowing a rapid crossover in case of progression under nivolumab and ipilimumab . In case of clinical progression, a rapid evaluation will be asked to confirm progression and beginning of chemotherapy . The association of nivolumab and ipilimumab increase toxicity compared to nivolumab alone but at the doses of nivolumab plus ipilimumab that will be used in this study we don’t expect to observe a higher rate of discontinuation due to drug -related AEs tha n with nivolumab alone. This association appears tolerable even for a frail population.  Psychological risks and constraints Not applicable. Cancer patients benefit of specific support according to plans cancers 1 to 3. All research sites have an agreement for treatment of advanced cancer patients and psychological support is part of this agreement.  Socio -economic risks and constraints Nivolumab and ipilimumab will be supplied by BMS. All other drugs are registered and used in this indication and are inclu ded in na tional and international recomme ndations . 2.4. Description and rationale for route of administration, dosage, administration regimen and duration of treatment Experimental arm : Patients will receive treatment with nivolumab as a 30 minutes infusion at 240 mg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab as a 30 minutes infusion at 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, starting on Day 1, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons specified in the protocol section 4.6 . All decisions to continue treatm ent beyond initial progression documented in the study record , discussed and agreed to by the study coordinator . Patient s should be re -consented with an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts. Accumulating evidence indicates a minor ity of Patient s treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of PD. Patient s will be permitted to continue treatment beyond initial RECIST 1.1 defined PD as long as they meet the following criteria determined by the inv estigator: • Investigator -assessed clinical benefit and Patient is tolerating study drug. • Tolerance of study drug • Stable performance status The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether the Patient is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from continued treatment. Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases) ."

The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by clini cal judgment as to whether the patient is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued treatment with nivolumab + ipilimumab. For the patient s who continue nivolumab + ipilimumab study therapy beyond progression, further prog ression is defined as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden from time of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial PD. Nivolumab + ipilimumab treatment should be discontinued permanently upon documentation of further progression. New lesions are considered measureable at the time of initial progression if the longest diameter is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes whi ch must have a short axis of at least15 mm). Any new lesion considered non - measureable at the time of initial progression may become measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except for path ological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to inclusion of new lesions which become measurable, these new lesions must demonstrate an absolute i ncrease of at least 5 mm. For statistical analyses, this will need to be described in patient population information. E.g. Patient s who continue treatment beyond initial investigator -assessed, RECIST 1.1 -defined progression will be considered to have inves tigator - assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial progression event. Control arm : Patients will receive according to standard practice and local guidelines : - carboplatin e AUC 5 with a dose that will be capped to 700 mg I.V D1 and pemetrexed (500 mg/m²) I.V D1 over 4 to 6 hours every 3 weeks for 4 cycles (restricted to non -squamous histology) - or carboplatine AUC 6 with a dose that will be capped to 700 mg I.V D1 and paclitaxel (90 mg/m²) I.V D1 D8 D15 over 4 to 6 hours every 4 weeks for 4 cycles (allowed in squamous and non -squamous histologies). Premedication ( steroids for pemetrexed and paclitaxel, folic acid and vitamin B12 for pemetrexed) and emesis prevention therapy are required and will be used as standard practice. Treatment will be given for 4 cycles except in case of progression or toxicity. See chapter 6 for more detailed description. In cases of patient with a body surface area≥2m², all the chemotherapies doses will be capped at 2m² of body surface area. 2.5.

If D1 cannot be administered, chemotherapy will be stopped. Some exceptions can be discussed with the principal investigator Dose reductions of investigator’s choice chemoth erapy may be required, and will be performed according to Table 6.1.2-2. Chemotherapy dose reductions are permanent; once the dose of any chemotherapy agent is reduced, it may not be re -escalated in subsequent combination cycles. The dose reductions for ea ch agent in the investigator’s choice chemotherapy regimen are not linked and may be adjusted independently as summarized below.

Investigator’s Choice Chemotherapy - Dose Reductions for Hematologic Toxicity Dose adjustments are based on nadir blood counts (assessed as per local standards) since the preceding drug administration. Dose level adjustments for investigator’s choice chemotherapy are relative to that of the preceding administration. Generally, both chemotherapy agents in the investigator’s choice chemotherapy regimen should be dose reduced together for hematologic toxicity. After the first cycle, growth factors may be used to assist hematologic recovery. Use local standards of care in the use of these supportive measures. Additionally, prophylactic antibiotics may be used according to local standards of care. Please report any antibiotic or growth factor use on the eCRF.

The reconstitution of the cytostatics should be ideally realized in central units. In all cases, the traceability of the products must be a ssumed for all enrolled patients. The drugs will be administered as follows. Pemetrexed will be given at a dose of 500 mg/m² as an IV infusion lasting about 10 min on D1 of each 21 -day cycle. Premedication regimen To reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day prior to, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. The corticosteroid should be equivalent to 4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day. To reduce toxicity, patients tr eated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation (see section 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full course of therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in t he week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and once every three cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given on the same day as pemetrexed. Pemetrexed should not be administered to dehydrated patients. Dosage adjustment The dose at the beginning of each cycle will be adjusted to the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PNN) nadir and the platelet nadir of the previous cycle. The PNN must be >1500/mm³ and the platelet count >100 000/mm³ before starting each treatment cycle.

Dose adjustment according to the nadir during each cycle : cf Table 6.1.2-3 Dose adjustment of the carboplatin –pemetrexed combination for non -hematologic toxicity Diarrhea In case of grade III or IV diarrhea (CTCAE), the following measures are authorized: hydration, octreotide and antidiarrhoeal agents. A 25% reduction in the dose of the two drugs is recommended. In case of severe diarrhea necessitating IV rehydrati on and/or associated with fever or severe grade III or IV neutropenia, broad -spectrum antibiotic therapy must be prescribed. Patients with severe diarrhea or diarrhea associated with nausea or vomiting must be hospitalized for IV hydration and correction o f electrolytic imbalance. In the case of diarrhea necessitating hospitalization, chemotherapy must not be administered until the diarrhea has resolved, and the dose must be reduced to 75% of the previous dose. Other non -hematologic toxicity In case of gra de >3 toxicity (excepting neurotoxicity), treatment must be interrupted until the disorder subsides to grade <1 or to the grade observed at enrollment in the study.

The sponsor ensures a proper labelling and the sponsor ensures via the clinical research organization the good distribution of the drugs to all sites. 6.3 Drug ordering and accountability BMS is supplying study drug. The sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the investigational product is stored under the appropriate environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) . If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the investigational product arise, do not dispense the investigational product, and contact BMS immediately. If commercial investigational product is used, it should be stored in accordance with the appropriate local labeling . If the study drug(s) are to be destroyed on site, it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for disposal, and that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable regulations, guidelines, and institutional procedures . 6.4 Authorised and unauthoris ed medicinal products and treatments in the setting of the protocol, including emergency medicinal products 6.4.1. Authoris ed treatments Experimental arm : Patient s are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra -articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if > 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non -autoimmune conditions (eg , delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted. As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution. Control arm : all support treatment (emesi s prevention, GCSF if j udged necessary by investigato ) are allowed as standard of care. 6.4.2. Unauthoris ed treatments The following medications are prohibited during the study (unless utilized to treat a drug -related adverse event):  Immunosuppressive agents  Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Section 6.4.1 )  Any concurrent anti -neoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, extensive, non - palliative radiation therapy, or standard or investigat ional agents for treatment of NSCLC) Investigators should refer to the local product labeling for the chemotherapy drugs selected for use in each Arm B Patient for additional prohibited and restricted concomitant medications. Except for the permitted procedures specified as palliative local therapies, all other radiation therapy or surgery to any tumor lesion is not permitted during study treatment.

In patients with mild to moderate renal insuf ficiency eligible for pemetrexed therapy NSAIDs with long elimination half-lives should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration. Pemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent by glomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycoside, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. This c ombination should be used with caution. If necessary, creatinine clearance should be closely monitored. Carboplatin Concomitant use contraindicated: Yellow fever vaccine: risk of generalised disease mortal Concomitant use not recommended: - Live attenuat ed vaccines (except yellow fever): Risk of systemic, possible fatal disease. This risk is increased in patient s who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. Use an inactivated vaccine where this exist (poliomyelitis). - Phenytoin, fospheny toin: Risk of exacerbation of convulsions (resulting from the decrease of phenytoin digestive absorption by the cytotoxic drug), risk of toxicity enhancement or loss of efficacy of the cytotoxic drug (due to increased hepatic metabolism by phenytoin). 6.4.4. Emergency treatment Carboplatin pemetrexed In case of severe hematologic toxicities like grade IV leucopenia, neutropenia, myelosuppression during more than 3 days and with complications, or grade IV thrombopenia with bleeding or grade III or IV mucitis, the following protocol can be used:  Ac Folinic (leucovorin®) 100 mg/m² IV followed by  Ac Folinic (leucovorin®) 50 mg/m² IV every 6 hours during 8 days. (an oral form can also be used) Carboplatin paclitaxel  Cases of severe hypersensitivity charact erized by hypotension, dyspnea, angioedema or generalized urticaria have been reported in 2% of patients receiving paclitaxel. In case of hypersensitivity reactions, appropriate measures must be taken by the investigator based on the severity of the event.  CTC Grade 1: transient rash, fever <38 ° C: further infusion monitoring. No treatment needed.  CTC Grade 2: hives, fever> = 38 ° C and / or symptomatic bronchospasm: stopping the paclitaxel infusion, administration of 2.5 mg of methylprednisolone dexchloro pheniramine and 60 mg. Resume paclitaxel infusion after sedation of symptoms at a slower rate: 20 ml / h for 15 min and 50 ml / h for 15 minutes then there are no other symptoms at the initial pace until the end of infusion. Particular attention monitored should be monitored during the next administration of paclitaxel.  CTC Grade 3 or 4: severe symptoms and even life threatening: Major bronchospasm requiring intravenous treatment, with or without urticaria, edema / angioedema, anaphylactic shock: stopping t he paclitaxel infusion. Administration of diphenhydramine and methylprednisolone as above. Add adrenaline if necessary. Mention the incident as a Junk Grave Event (SAE). Definitely stop chemotherapy. 6.5.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended"
46,page_46,"ENERGY Trial Code Sponsor 35RC16_9734 / GFPC 08 -2015 / BMS CA209 -449 Protocole Version 2.0 du 06/11/2017 Page 47/60 sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered rela ted to the investigational product.  The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following: Related: There is a reasonable causal relation ship between study drug administration and the AE. Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE. The term ""reasonable causal relationship"" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship. 7.1.2 Adverse reaction of an investigational medicinal product (AR) Any untoward and unintended responses to an investigational medicinal product related to any dose administered. In other wise, that means all adverse events judged by either the reporting investigator or the sponsor as having a reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product, qualify as adverse reactions. 7.1.3 Serious adverse event or serious adverse reaction (SAE/SAR) A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  results in death  is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the Patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the Patient or may require intervent ion [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered as an important medical event. Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pat hogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE. Although pregnancy, overdose , and cancer are not always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs. A Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR) is a serious adverse event with a ca usal relationship to an investigational medicinal product. 7.2 Investigator’s role 7.2.1 Adverse Events to be immediately notified to the sponsor 7.2.1 .1 Serious Adverse Events Every serious adverse event, related to study drugs or not, must be reported immediately by the investigator to the sponsor on a “SAE form” mentioning the date of occurrence, criterion of seriousness, relationship with the study drugs (or the study), and the outcome. Follow -up information must be completed if needed and sent to t he sponsor as soon as new relevant information is obtained. Copies of the patient’s medical record must be attached as well as results of laboratory tests. Whenever a serious event persists at the end of the study, the investigator must follow the patient until the event is considered resolved. 7.2.1. 2. Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is considered as an important medical event and must be reported immediately by the investigator to the sponsor on a “SAE form”. Wherever possible, timel y confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be repo rted as SAEs Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 1) ALT or AST elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) AND 2) Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase) AND"

The investigator must immediately notify the sponsor of this event via the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Any pregnancy that oc curs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to the sponsor. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Overdose An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be reported as an SAE. Laboratory Test Abnormalities considered as SAE All laboratory test results captured as part of the study should be re corded following institutional procedures. Test results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported as such. The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately: - any laboratory test result that is clinically si gnificant or meets the definition of an SAE - any laboratory abnormality that required the Patient to have study drug discontinued or interrupted - any laboratory abnormality that required the Patient to receive specific corrective therapy. Other Safety Cons iderations Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by the protocol, should also be recorded as a non serious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly. 7.2.2 Notification to the sponsor and time frame reporting • Following the Patient ’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs and other events listed above, whether related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. • All SAEs must be collected that occur withi n 100 days of discontinuation of dosing. • The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure. • All SAE and other events listed above must be reported to t he sponsor immediately or within 24 hours from the time the investigator becomes aware of them. • The Investigator must complete, sign, and date the SAE form, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE form with the corresponding source docu ments, and send a copy via fax to Sponsors’ Clinical Trial Vigilance Office (Catherine Mouchel - catherine.mouchel@chu -rennes.fr ) which contacts information provided below: Fax number: 02 99 28 40 10 / Phone number: 02 99 28 91 96 E-mail: vigilance.essais@chu -rennes.fr • When further information or additional follow -up information becomes available, the SAE form should be updated with the new informati on and reported to the sponsor immediately or within 24 hours via the same contacts information. • All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization ."

Appropriate documentation is required in these cases - admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical in tervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).  Specific events related to non -small cell lung cancer progression Disease progression can be considered as worsening of a patient’s cond ition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of a new or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not AE.  Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an Adverse Event (AE) during the study and will not be collected.  Non serious adverse events • The collection of non -serious AEs information should begin at initiation of study drug. The information regarding non-serious AE must be reported in the CRF. • All non -serious AEs (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) shou ld be collected continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of 30 days following the last dose of study treatment. • Seven specific types of non -serious AEs must be collected that occur within 100 days of discontinuation of dosing:  Renal adverse event  Endocrinopathy  Gastro -intestinal adverse event  Hepatic adverse event  Neurological adverse event  Pulmonary adverse event  Skin adverse event • Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become serious. • Follow -up is also required for non -serious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study t reatment as appropriate. 7.3 Sponsor’s role 7.3.1 Analysis of serious adverse events The sponsor must evaluate the following: - the causal relationship of serious adverse events (all adverse events for which the investigator or the sponsor considers that a causal relationship with the investigational medicinal products can be reasonably considered, are considered as suspected adverse reactions. If the sponsor’s evaluation of the event differs from the investigator’s, both opinions are mentioned in the state ment sent to the competent authority if this statement is necessary), - and their expected or unexpected feature, using the reference document in force. All SAEs will be followed to resolution or stabilization. 7.3.2 Method of relationship assessment The method used by the sponsor in evaluating the relationship of the event is as follows: - Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE. - Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE."

If the adverse reaction is unexpected, it is qualified as being Suspected Unexpected SAR (SUSAR) and must be declared in a report by the sponsor to the competent authorities and to the ethic committee. 7.3.3 Declaration of unexpected serious adverse events The sponsor reports all suspected unexpected serious adv erse reactions (SUSAR) to Eudravigilance (European pharmacovigilance database), to local regulatory agency (ANSM), to the ethic committee and to investigators within the regulatory time periods for reporting. 7.3.4 Transmission of annual safety reports On the anniversary date of authorisation of the study delivered by the Health Authorities, the sponsor writes a Data Safety Update Report (DSUR) report containing: - the list of serious adverse events which may be related to the investigational medicinal pro ducts studied, including expected and unexpected serious effects, - a critical analysis of safety of patients who are Patient s in the study. It is sent to local regulatory agency and to the ethics committee within 60 days following the anniversary of authori sation of the trial. 7.3.5 Declaration of other safety data Every safety finding that can alter the benefit/risk ratio of an investigational medicinal product or sufficient to consider changes in administration of the study product or changes in conduct o f the trial must immediately be notified to the sponsor. The former will be the Patient of a report to the competent authorities and ethic committee. 7.3.6 Transmission of Safety Data to BMS SAEs and pregnancies will be reported to BMS within 24 hours. SA Es will be recorded on CIOMS Form; pregnancies will be reported on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form. SAE Email Address: Worldwide.Safety@BMS.com SAE Facsimile Number: 609 -818-3804 If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports will be required. (Note: Follow -up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report will be sent within 24 hours to BMS using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. 7.4 Expected adverse reactions specific to the present study 7.4.1 Adverse reactions related to Nivolumab or Ipilimumab Infections and infestations Uncommon bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) Uncommon histocytic necrotising lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis) Immune system disorders Uncommon anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity, infusion related reaction Endocrine disorders Common hypothyroidism Uncommon adrenal insufficiency, thyroiditis Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common decreased appetite Nervous system disorders Common peripheral neuropathy, headache, dizziness Uncommon myasthenic syndrome, polyneuropathy Cardiac disorders Uncommon tachycardia Vascular disorders Uncommon vasculitis Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Common pneumonitis, dyspnoea, cough"

See “Description of selected adverse reactions; laboratory abnormalities” below. Management Algorithms for Immuno -Oncology Agents Immuno -oncology (I -O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are considered an immuno -oncology agent in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated with immuno -oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms have been developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs: Gastrointestinal, Renal, Pulmonary, Hepatic, Endocrinopathies, Skin, Neurological. While the ipilimumab investigator brochure contains very similar safety management algorithms for these adverse events, the recommendation is to follow the nivolumab algorithms for immune -oncology agents (I -O) in order to standardize the safety management across the three blinded treatment arms. The algorithms are found in the Nivolumab IB and in Appendix 8 of this protocol. Dose Delay for experimental Arm (Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab) Tumor assessments for all Patients should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. Nivolumab and ipilimumab administration should be delayed for the following: Any Grade ≥ 2 non -skin, drug -related AE except forfatigue or laboratory abnormalities • Any Grade 3 skin, drug -related AE Any Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormality, with the following exceptions AST, ALT, total bilirubin, or asymptomatic amylase or lipase: • • If a Patient has a baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin that is within normal limits, delay dosing for dr ug- related Grade ≥ 2 toxicity. • If a Patient has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, delay dosing for drug - related Grade ≥ 3 toxicity. • Any Grade ≥ 3 drug -related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated w ith symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis does not require dose delay."

Patient s that have dr ug-related toxicities that meet the criteria for dose delay, should have both drugs (ipilimumab and nivolumab) delayed until retreatment criteria are met. Criteria to Resume Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Dosing Patient s may resume treatment with study drug when the drug -related AE(s) resolve to Grade ≤1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions: • Patient s may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue • Patients who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug -related skin AE may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity. • Patients with baseline Grade 1 AST/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose delays for reasons other than a 2 - grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubin may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT or total bilirubin. • Patients with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT and total bilirubin values meeting discontinuation parameters (Section 4.5.8.2) should have treatment permanently discontinued. • Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline before treatment is resumed. • Patients who received systemic corticosteroids for management of any drug -related toxicity must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivalent dose of prednisone +/ -10 mg/day. • Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone replacement may resume treatment after consultation with the BMS Medical Monitor. • Dose delay of ipilimumab which results in no ipilimumab dosing for > 12 weeks requires ipilimumab disco ntinuation, with exceptions as noted in Section 6.1.1.7. Ipilimumab may not be resumed sooner than 6 weeks (+/ - 5days) after the prior ipilimumab dose. In general, Patients who meet criteria to resume ipilimumab will also have met criteria to resume nivo lumab, so it should be feasible to synchronize dosing of both drugs when resuming ipilimumab. In order to facilitate this, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipilimumab may be adjusted within the permitted +/ - 5 day window, as long as consecutive nivolumab d oses are given at least 12 days apart. One exception to note is when ipilimumab and nivolumab doses are delayed due to drug related Grade ≥3 amylase or lipase abnormalities not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis. If the inv estigator assesses the Grade ≥3 amylase or lipase abnormality to be related to ipilimumab and not related to nivolumab, nivolumab may be resumed when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grade < 3 but ipilimumab may only be resumed when the amylas e or lipase abnormality resolves to Grade 1 or baseline. Investigator attribution of this toxicity to the ipilimumab dosing must be clearly noted in the patient ’s medical chart. The Medical Monitor should be consulted prior to resuming nivolumab in such Patients. Nivolumab and Ipilimumab d iscontinuation Nivolumab Dose Discontinuation Treatment with nivolumab should be permanently discontinued for the following:  Any Grade 2 drug -related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to topica l therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the re -treatment period OR requires systemic treatment  Any Grade 3 non -skin, drug -related adverse event lasting > 7 days, with the following exceptions for drug - related laboratory abnormalities, uv eitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reactions, and infusion reactions, and endocrinopathies: o Grade 3 drug -related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires discontinuation o Grade 3 drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone replacement do not require discontinuation o Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment discontinuation except those noted below  Grade 3 drug -related thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated with bleeding requires discontinuation  Any drug -related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the following criteria require discontinuation: • AST or ALT > 8 x ULN"

Prior to r e-initiating treatment in a Patient with a dosing interruption lasting > 6 weeks, the BMS medical monitor must be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is interrupted  Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or inter current illness which, in the judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the Patient with continued nivolumab dosing . The assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately from the assessment made for discont inuation of ipilimumab. Although there is overlap among the discontinuation criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met for ipilimumab but not for nivolumab, treatment with nivolumab may continue if ipilimumab is discontinued. If a patient meets the crit eria for discontinuation of ipilimumab but not nivolumab prior to completion of the first 4 cycles, treatment with nivolumab may not resume until the adverse event has fully resolved, and the patient has discontinued steroids, if they were required for tre atment of the adverse event. The relationship to ipilimumab should be well documented in the source documents. Nivolumab should be resumed at 240 mg every 2 weeks. If a patient in any of the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination arms meets criteria for disconti nuation and investigator is unable to determine whether the event is related to both or one study drug, the patient should discontinue both nivolumab and ipilimumab and be taken off the treatment phase of the study. Ipilimumab Dose Discontinuation Ipilimumab should be permanently discontinued if any of the following criteria are met:  Any Grade ≥ 2 drug -related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within 2 weeks OR requires systemic treatment;  Any Grade ≥ 3 bronchospasm or other hypersensitivity reaction;  Any other Grade 3 non -skin, drug -related adverse with the following exceptions for laboratory abnormalities, grade 3 nausea and vomiting, grade 3 neutropenia and th rombocytopenia, and symptomatic endocrinopathies which resolved (with or without hormone substitution);  Any drug -related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the following criteria require discontinuation:  AST or ALT > 8x ULN  Total bilirubin > 5 x ULN  Concurrent AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN  Any Grade 4 drug -related adverse event or laboratory abnormality, except for the following events, which do not require discontinuation:  Grade 4 neutropenia ≤7 days  Grade 4 lymphopenia o r leukopenia  Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities which are not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis.

Treatment Beyond Disease Progression Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of Patients treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of progressive disease (PD). Patients will be permitted to continue treatment beyond initial RECIST 1.1 defined PD as long as all of the following criteria are met and clearly documented: • Investigator -assessed clinical benefit and no rapid disease progression; • Tolerating blinded study drug(s); • Stable performance status; • Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases); • Patient provides written informed consent prior to receiving additional study therapy, using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts, or other alternative treatment options The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the patient is clinically deteriorating and un likely to receive any benefit from continued study therapy. A radiographic assessment should be performed within 6 weeks of original PD to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size, or continued PD. For the Patients who continue study t herapy beyond progression, further progression is defined as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden from time of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of all target lesions and/ or the development of new measurable lesions. For Patients with evaluable disease only, further progression is defined as unequivocal disease progression of non -target lesions or the development of new lesions from time of initial PD. Treatment should be discontinued permanently upon documentation of further disease p rogression. New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the longest diameter is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm).

For statistical analyses that include the investigator -assessed progression date, Patients who continue treatment beyond initial investigator -assessed, RECIST 1.1 -defined progression will be considered to have investigator -assessed progressive disea se at the time of the initial progression event. For Patients in all treatment arms, global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptoma tic deterioration’. Every effort should be made to document. Treatment of Nivolumab or Ipilimumab Related Infusion Reactions Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritis, art hralgias, hypo - or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms of allergic -like reactions. All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE (Insert version e .g.: 4.0) guidelines. Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate: For Grade 1 symptoms : (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated) Remain at bedside and monitor Patient until recovery from symptoms. The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticost eroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for 24 hours). Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the Patient with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 m g (acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor Patient until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusi on rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor Patient closely. If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit. Adm inister diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the Patient until resolution of symptoms. The amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). The following prophylactic premedications are recomme nded for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up t o 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following in itial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae [eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indicated). Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infu sion of normal saline, and treat the Patient as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenh ydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Patient should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow thei r institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor Patient until recovery from symptoms. In the case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or generalized pruritis within 1 week a fter treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids). 7.4.2 Adverse reactions related to Carboplatin The reference document for definition of expectedness is the the European Union (EU) Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) CARBOPLATINE HOSPIRA 10 mg/ml sol inj p perf.

It will include detailed information on the analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures and the definitions of major protocol deviations. Sample size consideration The primary endpoint of the phase III is overall survival. The study is calibrated to detect a treatment effect hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65, translating in an improvement of 1 -year OS rate from 40% (control arm) to 55% (Nivolumab + Ipilimumab arm). A total o f 199 events observed at the time of the final analysis would have 85% power to show statistically significant log-rank test at a 2 -sided alpha level of 5%. Considering a recruitment duration of 24 months and a 18 months follow - up for the last included pat ient (estimated total duration of the study: 42 months), 242 patients will be randomized in the study (121 by arm). Randomization ratio 1:1 will be stratified according to Age (< 70 vs. ≥ 70 years) ,ECOG -PS status (0/1 vs. 2) and by histology (squamous ver sus non -squamous) . Interim analyses During the trial, one interim analysis for futility will be performed, permitting to early stop the trial, if no sufficient efficacy is shown. This analysis will be performed after that 33% of the expected events have o ccurred. Using planned enrollment rate, this analysis should be performed after inclusion of 171 patients (17 months after first included patient) (fig. 1). No adjustment of type I error was required. Stopping boundaries were defined according to Lan - DeMet s spending function to control type II error. Table 1 shows the futility boundaries. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will be organized to discuss the conduct of the study after analysis performed. Sample size calculation and interim analysis pl anning were performed using East® software (Cytel Inc. 1994 -2014), version 6.3.1 Table1: Futility boundaries Look Fraction of information P value HR futility bound 1 0.33 0.012 0.698 1.137 2 1 0.15 0.0025"

Definition of population • The Intent -to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all patients randomized in the trial, regardless of whether they actually received treatment. The treatment group s will be analyzed as randomized. • The Per Protocol (PP) population is a subgroup of the ITT population containing all patients who do not have any major protocol violation and received study treatment at least once. Major protocol violations will be define d in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). • The Safety population will include all randomized patients having received at least one dose of study treatment and one safety follow -up, whether withdrawn prematurely or not. All efficacy analysis will be perform ed on the ITT population. The safety data will be analyzed on the safety analysis set Endpoints • Primary endpoint : Overall survival Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. OS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, and will be compared between arms at a 2 -sided significance level of 5% ( Log-Rank test supported by a stratified Cox regression adjusted on randomization strata). Median OS per arm associated with its 95% confidence interval with be presented. • Secondary endpoint : • Survival rate at one year will be presented per arm. Associated 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided. • Objective response rate according to RECIST 1.1: ORR is defined as the rate of patients with an observed tumor response (CR or PR) as best response seen during all over the study treat ment period and evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. Patients without any tumor assessment following study treatment initiation and not died of neoplasic cause will be considered as non -evaluable patients. ORR rate will be presented by arm associated wit h its corresponding 95% CI and compared between arms using chi² or Fisher exact test if needed. Definition RECIST 1.1: Appendix 4. • Progression free survival : PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first progression assessment a ccording to RECIST version 1.1 or death (by any cause in the absence of progression). Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST assessment ."

As for OS, PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, and will be compared between arms at a 2 - sided 5% signi ficance level Log -Rank test. • Safety tolerability according to CTCAE version 4.0: The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events (AE). Descriptive statistics will be provided to evaluate the number of patients with at least : • One adverse events and the number of adverse events by arm, • One Serious AE, • One AE with grade 3 or above. Comparison between arms will be performed using chi² test or fisher exact test if needed. Adverse events of special interest should be described in addition to safety analysis based on system organ class and preferred term classifications • Quality of life according to EQ -5D and EORTC QLQ -ELD14 questionnaire s every 6 weeks: Quality of Life will be analyzed descriptively and according to the scoring man ual. Absolute and relative variation compared to randomization time point will be calculated by patient. Evolution during time will be compared between treatment arms • PD-L1 testing by immunochemistery (IHC) by local and central laboratories : Pronostic impact of PD -L1 on OS and PFS will be tested. Univariate and multivariate analysis will be implemented. Sub group analysis depending on PD -L1 level will be performed. • Geriatric mini data set ( restricted to patients ≥70 years old.): predictive impact of geriatric mini data set and its evolution over time on OS, PFS and toxicity. Univariate and multivariate analysis will be implemented. This analysis will be performed, using baseline geriatric characteristics included in the geriatric mini data set as stratification variables. To identify factors potentially influencing OS, PFS or toxicity, a multivariate Cox model will be constructed with stepwise variable selection. We’ll use univariate Cox models to select baseline variables (p=0·20) for the multivariate analysis. 9 RIGHT OF ACCESS TO D ATA AND SOURCE DOCUM ENTS 9.1. Access to data In compliance with GCP : - the sponsor is in charge of obtaining the agreement of all parties involved in the study to ensure direct access to all sites of study conduct, source dat a, source documents and reports with the aim of checking quality and of an audit by the sponsor, - investigators will make available to persons in charge of monitoring, checking of quality or audit of the study documents and individual data which are strictly necessary for such checking, in compliance with legislative and regulatory conditions in force (articles L.1121 -3 and R.5121 -13 of the French public health code). 9.2. Source documents Source data defined as all documents or original items which make it possible to demonstrate the existence or accuracy of data or of a finding recorded in the clinical study will be kept for 15 years by the investigator or by the hospital if it involves a hospital medical dossier. Source documents consist of a medi cal dossier, originals of laboratory test results, imaging examination reports, etc. 9.3. Confidentiality of data In compliance with conditions concerning confidentiality of data to which persons in charge of quality control of the research involving the human person study have access (article L.1121 -3 of the French public health code), in compliance with conditions pertaining to confidentiality of information in particular concerning the type of investigational medicinal products, the tests, persons who a re Patient s in the study and results obtained (article R. 5121 -13 of the French public health code), persons having direct access will take all necessary precautions with the aim of ensuring confidentiality of information pertaining to the investigational medicinal products, tests, the persons who are Patient s in the study and in particular concerning their identity as well as that of results obtained. These persons, in the same capacity as the investigators themselves, are Patient to professional secrecy ( according to conditions defined by articles 226 -13 and 226 -14 of the French penal code). During the study or at its end, data collected on persons who are Patient s in the study and forwarded to the sponsor by the investigators (or all other specialised par ticipants) will be made anonymous (deletion of Patient s’ names). They must not in any event clearly reveal the names of the persons concerned or their address."

The sponsor will make certain that each person who is a Patient in the study has provided his or her written agreement for access to his/her personal individual data and strictly necessary for quality control of the study. 10 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE A Clinical Research Associate (CRA) designated by the sponsor will ensure proper conduct of the study and the quality of data collected, in agreement with the Standard Operating Procedures applied in the CHU of Rennes and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice as well as legislative and regulatory conditions in fo rce. The investigator and members of his team agree to make themselves available at Quality Control visits carried out at regular intervals by the Clinical Research Associate. At these visits the following items will be reviewed: - informed consent, - complian ce with study protocol and procedures defined in it, - quality of data collected in the case report forms: accuracy, missing data, consistency of data with ""source"" documents (medical dossiers, appointment diaries, originals of laboratory test results, etc.) , - manag ement of possible products. In addition, the investigators agree to receive quality assurance audits performed by the sponsor as well as inspections performed by the Competent Authorities. All data, all documents and reports can be Patient ed to audi ts and regulatory inspections without being opposed by medical secrecy. 11 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 11.1. Regulatory and institutional review The protocol, information form and certificate of consent of the study will be submitted to the relevant independent ethics committee (IEC) for review. Notification of a favourable opinion from the IEC will be transmitted to the sponsor of the study and to the competent Author ity. An application for authoris ation will be sent by the sponsor to local regulatory authority prior to start of study. 11.2. Substantial changes In case of a substantial change made to the study protocol by the investigator, it will be approved by the sponsor. The latter must obtain prior to start of study a favourable opinion from t he ethics committee and authoris ation from the relevant health authority in the setting of their respective competence. Additional consent from persons participating in the study will be collected if necessary. 11.3. Information for patients and written informed co nsent form Patients will be completely and truly informed in terms which are understandable to them of the objectives and constraints of the study, the possible risks incurred measures of supervision and safety necessary, of their right to refuse to partic ipate in the study or of the possibility of retracting their agreement at any time. All this information is contained in an information and consent form given to the patient. Free, informed and written consent from the patient will be collected by the inve stigator, or a doctor representing him prior to final inclusion in the study. A copy of the information and consent form signed by both parties will be given to the patient; the investigator will keep the original of it. 12 DATA PROCESSING AND RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS AND DATA 12.1. Case report forms and data entry All information required by the study protocol must be recorded in the case report forms and an explanation must be provided for any missing data. Data must be collected progressively as obtained a nd recorded explicitly in the case report forms. An electronic case report form (e -CRF) will be made available and data entry will be made in centres through a WEB interface (Clinsight software, Ennov, Paris (75), France). It solely requires an internet c onnection and a browser. An aid document for use of this tool will be provided to investigators. The interface between the CRA and the investigator thus will be promoted, making possible the collection and control of data at a distance. Tests of control of consistency of data will be incorporated in electronic format. An audit function is incorporated in the e -CRF thus making it possible to follow any change in study data. This function also makes it possible to clearly identify the person who made a change as well as the date. A justification possibly can be incorporated in comment."
