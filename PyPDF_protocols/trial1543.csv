Background Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory joint disease associated with psoriasis and characterized b y heterogeneous musculoskeletal phenotypes that involve multiple domains including the peripheral joints, axial skeleton, tendon and ligament insertion sites (enthesitis) and digits (dact ylitis). PsA occurs in approximately 30% of psoriasis patients {Gladman 2005}. In the majority of cases (75%) psoriasis precedes joint disease, but in some cases (15%) the onset is synchronous and in 10% arthritis precedes psoriasis. I n the latter, unrecognized psoriasis may be found or there may be a history of widespread guttate psoriasis in childhood or a strong famil y history {Ritchlin 2017 }. PsA occurs with equal frequency in males and females. The arthritis in PsA commonly involves distal joints and has the tendency to distribute in a ray pattern where all the joints of a single digit are more likely to be affected. The presence of erythema over affected peripheral joints, asymmetrical spinal involvement, and enthesitis are also ty pical features of PsA {Gladman 2005} . PsA belongs to the group of spondy loarthropathies with spondy litis being present in up to 40% of patients. The extra-articular features observed in PsA are similar to other spondy loarthropathies including mucous membrane lesions, iritis, urethritis, diarrhea and aortic root dilatation, and association with Human L eukocy te Antigen B27 (HLA -B27) {Gladman 2005} . First-line treatment traditionally consists of NSAIDs and csDMARDs such as sulfasalazine (SSZ), methotrexate (MTX) and leflunomide (LEF). These drugs remain a mainstay of therap y where there is limited access to biological agents {Gossec 2012}. The arrival of anti- tumor necrosis factor (anti -TNF) agents over a decade ago dramaticall y increased the treatment armamentarium for PsA leading to improved outcomes for both skin and joint disease {Gladman 2007, Mease 2006 }. Nevertheless, anti -TNF agents do not work in all patients and response may diminish over time, partl y because of immunogenicit y {Mease 2013 }. Novel biologic agents with different mechanisms of action that target the interleukin(IL) -23 and IL- 17pathway s that promote skin and joint inflammation as well as oral agents including janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and the phosphodiesterase E4 inhibitor, apremilast, have recentl y become available as therapeutic options for PsA as well {Ritchlin 2016 }. Several key cytokines in the IL - 23 /IL-17 pathway s promote skin and joint inflammation through signaling via the JAK pathway . Activated JAKs recruit and activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STATs) which in turn drive gene transcripti on {O'Shea 1997}. In December 2017, tofacitinib (Xeljanz®) became the first JAK inhibitor to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatm ent of adult patients with PsA. Tofacitinib is a small molecule, has strong binding affinity for JAK1 and JAK3, and weaker affinity for JAK2. The extensive pre -clinical and clinical development programs demonstrated its mechanisms of action via anti- inflam matory and immunosuppressive effects. The drug proved to be efficacious in treating the signs and symptoms of PsA. However, the observed side effects and risk profile of tofacitinib are similar to those of several existing anti- rheumatic agents with cy topenias, elevated"

Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 21 17 April 2020levels of liver function enzy mes, increased total cholesterol levels, with increase in LDL typicall y exceeding those for HDL, and increased risk for infections including serious and opportunistic infections. At higher doses, tofacitinib treatment was associated with anemia, which is thought to be linked to inhibition of JAK2 { Gladman 2017, Mease 2017a , Mease 2017b}. While the pan- JAK inhibitor tofacitinib has shown an earl y onset of action and long-term efficacy in PsA, limitations of therap y include side effects potentiall y mediated b y its effect on JAK2 and JAK3. This highlights the need for more selective and targeted therapies with improved immunomodulatory and hematologic effects. JAK1 is thought to be an integral part of PsA pathogenesis due its role in transmitting inflammatory cytokine signaling. Hence, targeted inhibition of JAK1 has great potential for the treatment of PsA with an improved safety and side effect profile. 1.2. Filgotinib 1.2.1. General Information Janus kinases are intracellular cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases (TYKs) that transduce cy tokine signaling from membrane receptors through STAT to the nucleus of cells. JAK inhibitors block the signaling of various cytokines, growth factors, and hormones, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL -6.Four different types of JAKs are known, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 which co- interact with different sets of membrane receptors. Inhibition of JAKs is a promising therapeutic option for a range of inflammatory conditions including RA, UC, and Crohn’s disease (CD). Filgotinib (GS -6034, formerly GLPG0634) is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1. The compound has shown good preliminary efficacy in PsA {Mease 2018 }, anky losing spondy litis {van der Heijde 20 18}, RA and CD patients in Phase 2 ( filgotinib IB ) . In a Phase 3 RA study with subjects who failed prior biologic therap y,filgotinib achieved all primary and key secondary endpoints {Genovese 2018 }. Additionally , filgotinib is currently under assessment in ongoing Phase 3 RA , UC, CD studies ( clinicaltrials.gov ). In humans, filgotinib is metabolized to form one major active metabolite GS -829845 (formerl yG254445). Though the potency of this metabolite is lower than t he parent molecule, the overall exposure and peak plasma concentration in humans is higher than seen in all tested animal species. As a consequence, dedicated pharmacology and toxicology studies have been performed with GS- 829845. Results from pharmacody namics (PD) testing in healthy volunteers suggest that the clinical activity of filgotinib could result from the combination of the parent molecule and the metabolite. For further information on filgotinib, refer to the current investigator’s brochure (IB) for filgotinib."
21,page_21,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4566 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 17 April 20201.2.2. Preclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology Filgotinib and its metabolite, GS -829845 have been extensively characterized in nonclinical studies. This program includes cellular assay s demonstrating potency and selectivity of the compound against JAK1; efficacy studies in rats and mice; repeat dose toxicity studies (up to 26weeks in the rat and 39weeks in the dog), in vitro and in vivo safet y pharmacology and genetic toxicology studies, and reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits. Ad ditional toxicology studies conducted include phototoxicity studies and dose -range finding studies in support of a definitive rat juvenile toxicity study and a 6month carcinogenicity study in transgenic (TgrasH2) mice. A 2-year rat oral carcinogenicity study as well as the pre -and post-natal development toxicity study in rats were completed . 1.2.2.1. Primary and Secondary Pharmacology Filgotinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP )-competitive inhibitor of JAK1. I t is highl y selective for inhibition of JAK1 over 451 other kinases evaluated in vitro. In cellular assays, it inhibits JAK /STAT -driven processes with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values from 179 nM onwards. In human whole blood, JAK1 is inhibited by filgotinib with an I C50 of 629 nM and exhibits approximately 30-fold selectivity over JAK2. Filgotinib demonstrated significant efficacy in the rat collagen -induced arthritis (CI A) model as well as in the mouse dextran sulphate sodium (DSS )-induced colitis model. Metabolite GS829845 exhi bits a similar JAK1 selectivity profile but is approximately 10to20-fold less potent than the parent filgotinib in in vitro assay s. GS -829845 was as effective asfilgotinib in the rat CIA model, but at doses that required a 10 -fold higher exposure. 1.2.2.2. Safet y Pharmacology Filgotinib and GS -829845 had no effects on the respiratory system and central nervous s ystem (CNS )up to respectivel y 40and 5 -fold the exposure in RA subjects given filgotinib 200 mgonce daily . Filgotinib and GS -829845 had no relevant effects on cardiovascular parameters (human ether - a-gogo related gene [hERG] and dog telemetry studies), apart from a slight non-adverse increase in heart rate and arterial pressure with GS 829845 at exposures 7 fold that of the C max insubjects with RA tr eated with 200 mgonce dail yfilgotinib. There were no relevant effects on ECG and QT. 1.2.2.3. Nonclinical Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion ( ADME ) Filgotinib demonstrates good oral bioavailability in mice, rats, dogs, and minipigs but less in monkey s. Plasma protein binding is low (<70%) in all species, including humans. The PK of filgotinib is generall y dose proportional without gender differences. No accumulation occurs with repeated dosing. The mean terminal half -life after oral administration is 4 and 5 hours (h) in rats and dogs, respectively."
22,page_22,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4566 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 17 April 2020In the rat, filgotinib showed a rapid and even distribution throughout the body . High concentrations were observed only in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and urinary bladder. Filgotinib does not pene trate into CNS tissues. The distribution of filgotinib indicates some affinity for melanin- containing tissues. Excretion is nearly complete within 72 h (mouse), 24 h (rat) and 48 h (dog) post -dosing. In the mouse, an average of 54.0 and 37.7% of the admini stered radioactivity was excreted in feces and urine, respectivel y. In the rat, fecal and urinary excretion accounted for 40% and 59% of the administered dose, respectively . In bile -duct cannulated rats bile secretion of about 15%. In the dog, fecal excret ion was the primary route of excretion, accounting for 59% of the administered dose, with urinary excretion accounting for 25%. In vitro metabolism studies in all species revealed one major metabolite (GS- 829845). The formation of GS -829845 is mediated by carbox ylesterases (CES) and is not dependent on cytochrome P450 (CYP). In vitro experiments have shown that drug -drug interactions with filgotinib and GS -829845 are unlikely . There is no inhibition or induction of CYPs or uridine 5’ -disphosphate glucuronos yltransferases (UGTs), and no relevant inhibition of key drug transporters, including the organic anion transporters (OATs) involved in the renal elimination of MTX, by filgotinib or GS-829845. 1.2.2.4. Nonclinical Toxicology In repeat oral dose toxicity studies in both rats and dogs, the primary target tissues identified for filgotinib were the l ymphoid tissues which areexpected based on the pharmacology of JAK inhibition. Additional filgotinib-related findings were observed in the male reproductive organs of both species, and in the incisor teeth of rats only. Effects on the l ymphoid sy stem were full y reversible. Testicular toxicity demonstrated partial reversibility ; however, sperm counts remained low. A dose of 200 mg/day of filgotinib results in an estimated mean clinical area under the curve ( AUC )of2.80 μg∙h /mL, which represents an exposure margin of 2.3, 1.8, and 3.4-fold when considering the mean AUC in male dogs at the no -observed- effect -levels (NOELs) in the 26week and 39week chronic toxicity studie s, and the 39 week targeted exposure toxicity study , respectivel y. GS-829845 related findings in general repeat dose toxicity studies were similar to those of the parent filgotinib ; however, no testicular toxicity was noted following administration of GS-829845. Filgotinib and GS -829845 were non -genotoxic when evaluated in the bacterial mutagenicit y assay , the in vitro mouse ly mphoma mutagenicit y assay , and the rat bone marrow micronucleus assay ."

Administration of filgotinib did not affect female fertility , butimpaired fertility was observed in male rats at exposures approximately 15 -fold the human exposure at 200 mgof filgotinib in subjects with RA. GS -829845 did not have an y effects on fertility parameters in either male or female rats. In an in vitro phototoxicity study in 3T3cells, the metabolite GS -829845 was positive for phototoxic potential and results with filgotinib were equivocal. A follow -up in vivo rat phototoxicity assay revealed a lack of phototoxic potential for both compounds. 1.2.3. Clinical Trials of Filgotinib Comprehens ive data from the Phase 1 and 2 programs are available to support development into Phase 3. A n overview of exposure and clinical studies conducted with filgotinib is available in the IB. Phase 2 Filgotinib PsA Study GLGP0634- CL-224(EQUATOR) The EQUATOR study was a randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 trial that enrolled adults with active moderate to severe PsA fulfilling Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis ( CASPAR ), active or documented history of plaque psoriasis, and an in adequate response or intol erance to at least one csDMARD. Subjects were randomized to receive either placebo or f ilgotinib 200 mg once dail y for 16weeks. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate efficacy of filgotinib compared to placebo at W eek16. The percentage of A CR20 responders was statistically significantl y higher in filgotinib group at Week16 compared to placebo. Subjects with previous TNFi therapy had a similar ACR20 response compared to the rest of the stud y population. The percentage of ACR50 and 70responders was also statist ically significantl y higher at W eek16 compared to placebo. A dose response was observed for all three parameters. Starting at W eek1 response was observed for ACR20 and ACR50 in the filgotinib group and remained statistically significant ly superior to placebo through W eek16. Subjects receiving filgotinib also demonstrated significantly higher clinical efficacy compared to placebo at W eek16 with additional PsA assessments including Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis ( DAPSA ) score, Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria ( PsARC )response, PASDAS , and SPARCC Enthesitis I ndex. The filgotinib group achieved improvement in skin manifestations of disease as demonstrated by the PASI75 score and the pruritus numeric r ating scale, both of which were statistically signif icantl y better than placebo at W eek16. Patient reported outcomes including the HAQ -DI, FACIT -Fatigue, and PsA related pain intensit y also improved with filgotinib at Week 16 compared to placebo."

Six subjects had an event that was grade 3 or 4. The most frequentl y occurring events were na sophary ngitis and headache, occurring at similar proportions in each group. One serious treatment -emergent AE was reported in each group (pneumonia [filgotinib] and hip fracture after a fall [placebo]). The SAE of pneumonia was a fatal event. No gastric pe rforations, malignancies, ly mphomas, venous thromboembolic events, opportunistic infections, or cases of active tuberculosis (TB) were reported. There was one case of herpes zoster confined to a single dermatome in the filgotinib group. The incidence of in fections was similar between the two groups. Phase 3 Filgotinib R heumatoid A rthritis Study GS -US-417-0302 (FINCH 2) FINCH 2 was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, add- on, Phase 3 study in adult male and female subjects with active RA despite csDMARD(s) therapy (i.e.MTX, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide) who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to at least 1 bioDMARD. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive once dail y filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, or placebo fo r 24weeks all in the context of a stable dose of permitted csDMARD(s). The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 12. At Week 12, an ACR20 response was achieved by significantl y more subjects receiving filgo tinib 200 mg or 100 mg than placebo (66.0 %, 57.5 %and 31.1%, respectively ; both p<0.001). The reduction from Baseline in HAQ -DI at Week 12 was greater in the filgotinib 200mg and 100 mg groups compared to the placebo group ( -0.55 and -0.48 vs -0.23, respectivel y; both p<0.001). Other key secondary endpoints, including SF -36v2 and FACIT - Fatigue, were also met at both filgotinib doses. The safet y profile was consistent with data from the Phase 2 studies with filgotinib. AE rates were similar for filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg and placebo groups (69.4% and 63.4% vs 67.6%, respectively ) as were rates of s erious adverse events ( SAEs)(4.1%, 5.2% and 3.4%, respectively . There were 4 cases of uncomplicated herpes zoster (2 in each filgotinib group). The re was one non- serious AE of retinal vein occlusion in the filgotinib 200 mg group; no other venous thrombotic events were reported. Two adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE s) were reported: one subarachnoid hemorrhage in the placebo group and one myocardial ischemia in the filgotinib 100 mg group. There were no cases of opportunistic infection /active TB, malignancy , GI perforation or death. 1.3.

Rationale for This Study Therapeutic options for the treatment of PsA have increased dramatically over the past 15years resulting in markedly improved outcomes for skin and joint di sease {Gladman 2007, Mease 2006}. The arrival of anti -TNF agents represented a major treatment advance because these therapies are very effective for skin and all of the musculoskeletal domains of PsA. Despite of significant uptake in the use of anti- TNF agents, tolerability due to allergic and autoimmune reactions, loss of response due to immunogenicity and increased risk of infections /opportunistic infections remain problematic {Mease 2013 }. Agents with different mechanisms of action that target the IL-23 / IL-17 pathway s have recentl y become available. Use of these biological parenterall y administered agents has led to marked skin clearance, while musculoskeletal symptoms improvement, the effect observed is similar to that with anti- TNF agents. Apremilast, an oral inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) offers modest response in the skin and joint symptoms with few safety signals. Therefore, there is still a need for simple, orall yadministered agents with novel and targeted mechanisms of action that can effectively improve PsA outcome in all of its domains, and which are well -tolerated and have an acceptable safet y profile. Tofacitinib, an orall y administered JAK1 /JAK3 inhibitor, is approved for use in patients with PsA based on the data from two Phase 3 studies in subjects with PsA. In the Phase 3 study evaluating tofacitinib versus placebo in subjects with active PsA and previous inadequate response to TNF inhibi tors, the ACR20 responses were 50% with the 5 mg dose of tofacitinib as compared with 24% with placebo ( p<0.001) after 3 months of treatment. In the Phase 3 study evaluating tofacitinib versus placebo and adalimumab in patients with active PsA and inadequa te response to csDMARDs, the ACR20 response rate at month 3 was50% in the 5 mg tofacitinib group as compared with 33% in the placebo group ( p= 0.01). Safet y results were similar across the two studies in regards to the number and category of AEs. Both st udies reported cases of herpes zoster, serious infections and malignancy in the subjects exposed to tofacitinib {Gladman 2017, Mease 2017a }. The JAK1 selective inhibitor filgotinib targets an intracellular t yrosine kinase dy sregulated in subjects with inflammatory disorders including PsA. Filgotinib is a small molecule for oral dail y administration that demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating the signs and symptoms of active PsA in a Phase 2 study as well as other inflammatory disorders inc luding RA. 1.4.1. Rationale for Study Design Study GS-US-431- 4566 is a randomized, double -blind, placebo and adalimumab -controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safet y of 2 doses of filgotinib administered once dail y in subjects with active PsA despite previ ous non- biologic DMARD therapies: csDMARDs, apremilast, and /or NSAID(s). The study consists of 2 parts: Part 1: T he Main Study ,is from Screening through the Week 16 Visit Part 2: L TE immediatel y follows Part 1 and starts after the Week 16 Visit continuing for 2years Total study duration is ~ 2.25 years."
26,page_26,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4566 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 17 April 2020The objectives of the study are to evaluate the effect of filgotinib compared to placebo and adalimumab on the signs and sy mptoms, phy sical function, and quality of life in PsA. Safety and tolerability of filgotinib will also be assessed. Treatment duration of 12 weeks to assess the primary endpoint is considered optimal to evaluate the potential benefit of filgotinib on a variety of musculoskeletal sy mptoms of PsA. The effect of filgotinib on the arthritis component is expected to be fast (in previous studies with filgotinib in RA, ACR20 plateaued at Week 8). However, the effect on enthesitis and dact ylitis requires longer duration of treatment as observed in recently published studies with other compounds. The duration of placebo will be limited. All subjects in the placebo arm will be reallocated in a blinded manner 1:1 to 100 mg or 200 mg of filgotinib at Week 16. Given the slowly progressive nature of PsA , 16weeks of placebo on accepted background therapy is considered both clinicall y and ethicall y appropriate and allows an acceptable time period in which to assess initial response to therap y. The use of placebo is critical in evaluating subject reported and s ubjective outcomes, which can be highl y variable and influenced b y placebo therap y. The placebo effect is well-established in PsA studies and inclusion of the placebo arm is critical to evaluation of the overall risk- benefit profile of added filgotinib the rapy. Finall y, the provision of best supportive care in the context of the trial, as well as the limited duration and eventual opportunity for subjects to transition to filgotinib, make the use of placebo ethically acceptable for the specified duration. This study includes an active comparator, adalimumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor α (TNF -α). The inclusion of the active comparator will allow comparison of the efficacy and safet y of filgotinib to an approved and frequentl y prescribed product indicated for use in this patient population. The study eligibility criteria are consistent with those of recent clinical trials evaluating novel investigational treatments for PsA. Subjects should meet the CASPAR criteria for PsA. Subje cts are required to have active disease defined as ≥3swollen and ≥3 tender joints at both Screening and Day 1Visits. In addition, subjects are required to have a history of or active psoriasis lesion. The study duration of ~2. 25years allows sufficient t ime for demonstrating the safet y and tolerability of therap y, reduction in disease activity, and confirmation that clinical benefit is sustained over time. 1.4.1.1. Rationale for Outcome Measures The ACR response s, MDA, and PASDAS are considered reliable measure s of response to treatment and disease activity in subjects with PsA. The psoriasis disease activity will be assessed b y the PASI50, PASI 75, PASI90, PASI 100 and PhGAP. Psoriatic nail involvement will be recorded b y using the mNAPSI . Several other disease acti vity measures will be assessed including SPARCC Enthesitis I ndex andLEI (forenthesitis), L DI(for dacty litis), , and PhGADA . CCI -"

Assessing the change in economic impact (WPAI -PsA),and Healthcare Resource Utilization Questionnaire ( HCRU )) of PsA over the course of the study provides insight into the subject’s ability to work and other daily activities as well as the impact on the burden of healthcare resources. 1.4.2. Rationale for Dose Selection Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive filgotinib (100 mg or 200 mg), active comparator (adalimumab), or placebo. Thedoses of filgotinib chosen for evaluation in this study , 100mg and 200 mg once daily , are supported b y a combination of safet y and efficacy data from Phase 1 and 2 studies in the clinical development program, and the known dose - pSTAT1 inhibition relationship of filgotinib . In two Phase 2a studies in subjects with RA (Study GLPG0634- CL-201 and -202), dosing with filgotinib was well tolerated and achieved a high level of efficacy at a 200 mg dail y dose (ACR20 response of 75 -92% at Week 4). Administration of a higher filgotinib dose (300 mg) did not demonstrate greater efficacy , therefore, the highest dose to be tested in this study will be 200mg once dail y.In two Phase 2b studies, filgotinib at daily doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200mg, administered in addition to a background therap y with MTX (GL PG0634 -CL-203) or as monotherap y (GLPG0634 -CL-204) was shown to be safe and efficacious in subjects with moderatel y to severel y active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX alone. In the Phase 2 PsA study (GLPG0634- CL-224), filgotinib 200 mg once dail y was well tolerated and achieved a high level of efficacy at a 200 mg dail y dose as well (ACR20 response rate of 80% at Week 16). Exposure -response anal ysis based on data from all Phase 2 studies indicated a dose -dependent increase in efficacy (ACR20 / 50 / 70, D isease Activity Score 28(DAS28) [ C-reactive protein (CRP )]), with a plateau at the 200 mg total daily dose on the dose -response curve. Additionall y, in Study GLPG0634 -CL-203, no statistically significant difference in efficacy was observed at 200mg dail y dose, administered as 200 mg once daily or 100 mg twice daily . These results are consistent with the relationship observed between filgotinib exposures and pSTAT1 activation (ex-vivo) following single and multiple filgotinib doses, where maximal inhibition of pSTAT1 (~78%) was achieved at or above 200 mg total daily dose and intermediate inhibition (~47%) at 100mg {Namour 2015}. Safety data collected across Phase 2 clinical studies showed no dose -dependent trends in the incidence of AEs or SAEs, including infections, or laborat ory abnormalities with the exception of a numerical increase in select gastrointestinal AEs (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and upper abdominal pain). This numerical increase was observed in the 200 mg compared to the 100mg dose. However, the over all frequency was low and clinical relevance is unknown. Filgotinib, administered at a dose of 100 mg or 200 mg dail y,was found to be safe and well tolerated. The safet y profile was consistent with that observed for an immunomodulatory compound a dminister ed to subjects with RA."
28,page_28,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4566 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 17 April 2020Overall, the 100 mg and 200 mg once daily dos ingregimens have been proposed based on the known dose -pSTAT1 inhibition relationship of filgotinib andthe clinical experience ( safet y and efficacy ) with PsA and RA subjects in Phase 2 studies. Inclusion of twodoses in the proposed Phase 3 trials will enable establishment of an appropriate nominal dose for the treatment of PsA and determine the regimen with the most favorable risk / benefit profile in these populations. 1.5. Risk /Benefit A ssessment for the S tudy As of June 2018, 6605 subjects have received filgotinib either as single doses or multiple doses, and 1278 subjects have received daily filgotinib for >1 year. In general, filgotinib has been safe and well tolerated in all populatio ns studied. I n addition to PsA, large P hase 3 programs in RA, CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) are currentl y ongoing as well. Nonclinical studies in rats and dogs identified the testes and ly mphoid tissue as target organs for filgotinib in long term repeat-dose toxicity studies. I n both species, histopathological changes in the testes included germ cell depletion and degeneration, with reduced sperm content and increased cell debris in the epididy mis and reduction in fertility in rats. The dog was determined to be the most sensitive species. A dose of 200 mg/day of filgotinib results in an estimated mean clinical AUC of 2.8 μg∙h / mL, which represents an exposure margin of 2.3, 1.8, and 3.4-fold when considering the mean AUC in male dogs at the NOELs in the 26week and 39week chronic toxicity studies, and the 39 week targeted exposure toxicity study , respectivel y. Decreased l ymphocy tes observed in nonclinical studies have not been shown in clinical studies. Filgotinib has shown an increased risk of embry ofetal malformations at exposures similar to human doses; the use of highl y effective contraception in the subject population will be implemented in the study to mitigate this risk. No clinically relevant impa ct on cardiovascular parameters (including vital signs and ECG), respiratory or neurologic function has been observed in Phase 1 and 2trials of filgotinib , including a dedicated Phase 1 study to evaluate the effect of filgotinib on the QT /QTc interval in healthy subjects. The QT study evaluated filgotinib at doses of 200 mg and 450 mg; neither dose led to prolongation in the QTc interval or was associated with clinically significant ECG changes. In Phase 2 trials in RA, filgotinib was well tolerated. In the RA studies (including the open label extension DARWIN 3), infections were reported more commonly in the filgotinib groups, including serious infections leading to hospitalization, and even death. The most common sy stem organ classes with AEs were infec tions and infestations, and GI disorders. Dose dependent decreases in the Phase 2b studies were observed in mean neutrophil counts and platelet counts (but mean changes in both remained within normal laboratory reference ranges) and there were no decreases in lymphocy tes or l ymphocyte subsets. Hemoglobin levels slightl y improved (increased) with filgotinib treatment, confirming that no anemia was induced. Mild and clinically insignificant serum creatinine increases were noted in both Phase 2b studies, with stabilization by Week 24. Neutrophil decreases (in the RA population) and a potential increased risk of infection may be considered risks consistent with the mechanism of JAK inhibition."
29,page_29,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4566 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 30 17 April 2020Overall clinical findings and laboratory changes are consistent with selective JAK1 inhibition and based on Phase 2 data the expected benefit of using filgotinib as proposed in this study is considered to outweigh any associated risks. Adalimumab is a TNFα inhibitor that is indicated and commonly used in the target population of this trial with well -established safet y and efficacy profile (Humira (US) Package Insert, Humira (EU)Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) ). The dose and duration of adalimumab treatment proposed in this study are in line with posology approved globall y (Humira US P ackage Insert , Humira EU SmPC). Risks associated with the use of adalimumab are well characterized, and are described in approved local product information. Adalimumab is associated with an increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, my cobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported with TNFα inhibitors. Reactivation of latent TB has been reported. All subjects will be tested for TB before stud y start as outlined in the exclusion criteria and will be carefully monitored for signs and s ymptoms of infection during and after the study . Study drug will be discontinued for serious infections as outlined in Section 3.5. An increase of nonmelanoma skin cancers, hematologic cancers and a potential increase of other cancers have been reported with use of TNFα inhibitors. Subjects will undergo regular assessments, including physical examination and hematological assessments. TNFα inhibitors are commonly used as first line therap y in this patient population. Their efficacy has been well established. Overall, the benefit of using adalimumab as proposed in this study is considered to outweigh any associated risks. An independent Data Monitoring C ommittee (DMC) appointed to monitor the study (with the initial DMC data review after the first 100 subjects across the program, Study GS-US-431-4566 and Study GS-US-431- 4567, complete 12 weeks of treatment) will provide an additional level of risk mitigation. The overall risk / benefit balance of this study is considered favorable. For additional information about the risks of filgotinib, reference is made to the investigator brochure. 1.6.

After the Week 16 Visit investigators will not receive an alert for subject s with <20% improvement; however, clinical judgement should be used to decide if the subject is not clinically improving and requires rescue therap y. The following medications are recommended as rescue therapy options to add or modify after Week 16 : NSAI Ds,opiate analgesics, csDMARDs, corticosteroids, and bioDMARDs .Subjects must discontinue study at time of bioDMARD initiation. Starting at the Week 24 Visit, subjects who have <10% improvement from Day 1 in the TJC68 or SJC66 at two consecutive visits despite stable background PsA therap y should discontinue both study drug and study and adjust any PsA treatment as deemed appropriate by the investigator. Sites will beassist edwith this by receiving a discontinuation of study alert when subjects reach th is threshold at any time from the Week 24 Visit through the end of the study . In case s where a subject has had recent modification of PsA therap y requiring time for further assessment , the investigator should use clinical judgement to decide if subjects should continue study drug and stud y despite receiving the discontinuation alert. Subjects who discontinue study drug at any point during the LTE should also exit the study . 5.4.1.2. Special Circumstances for Corticosteroids , Hyaluronate Therap y,and Biologics At any time during the study i f there is a need for the use of additional corticosteroids (oral, parenteral, inhaled or other) for the treatment of an AE (e.g.asthma exacerbation, allergy , or anaph ylaxis reaction , etc. ) , it should be discussed with the Gilea d Medical Monitor or its designee in advance, as much as possible, as well as the possible discontinuation of study drug and/or the study . The AE and medications administered willbe documented in the eCRF."

Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 56 17 April 2020During the LTE subjects may receive intra-articular corticosteroids or h yaluronate therap y for treatment of PsA if needed. The dose of corticosteroid injected should not exceed the equivalent dose of triamcinolone 80mg suspension. For the analy sis of the SJC66 and TJC68, these joints will b e considered “not assessable” for 3 months from the time of the intra- articular injection and should be documented . Concomitant biologics not given for the treatment of an inflammatory art hropathy (i. e. given for osteoporosis) may be allowable after written approval from the Gilead M edical Monitor or designee. 5.4.2. Concomitant Medications: Non -PsA Related Non-PsA related therap y such as h ormone replacement therapy , thyroid replacement, and other chronic therapies (such as those for well- controlled diabetes or h ypertension) are permitted during the stud y, and should be kept at a stable dose and regimen, as much as possible. Vitamin, mineral ,or herbal supplementations are permitted during the study per judgment of investigator, and should be kept at a stable dose and regimen, as much as possible. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use highl y effective birth -control methods as outlined in Appendix 3. The use of contraceptives will be recorded in the Concomitant Therap y section of the eCRF. Applicable procedures and treatment guidance based on package inserts will be followed. 5.4.3. Prohibited Concomitant Medications Prohibited concomitant me dications at the time of randomization, with applicable washout period s, are included inthe Exclusion Criteria (Section 4.3). Prohibited concomitant medications during the course of the stud y are as follows: Throughout the entire study unless required for rescue therapy after the Week 16Visit : Intra -articular or parenteral corticosteroids Intra -articular h yaluronate injections Small molecule immunomodulators that were not alread y started at the time of study enrollment (i .e.subject cannot start methotrexate, hy droxychloroquine, etc., as a new concomitant medicati on after Day 1unless required for rescue therapy after the Week 16 Visit ) Ultraviolet light therap y BioDMARDs (e.g. etanercept, g olimumab, abatacept, secukinumab , etc.) If required for rescue therap y per i nvestigator judgment , subjects must discontinue study at time of bioDMARD initiation. B -cell depleting agents (e.g. rituximab, etc.) If required for rescue therap y per investigator judgment , subjects must discontinue study at time of B-cell depleting agent initiation."

Vaccin e Guidelines Prior to study participation, it is recommended that the subjec t’svaccinations be brought up to date according to local vaccination standards. The varicella vaccine is of particular importance for immunocompromised patients. Live or attenuated vaccines (including, but not limited to varicella and inhaled flu vaccine) are prohibited ≤30 days of the Day 1Visit , throughout the study , and for 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug . Subjects should be advised to avoid routine household contact with persons vaccinated with live/attenuated vaccine components. Astudy subject’s exposure to household contacts should be avoided for the below state d time periods: Varicella or attenuated typhoid fever vaccination –avoid contact for 4 weeks following vaccination Oral polio vaccination –avoid contact for 6 weeks following vaccination Attenuated rotavirus vaccine –avoid contact for 10 days following vaccination Inhaled flu vaccine –avoid contact for 1 week following vaccination Inactivated vaccines (such as inactivated flu vaccines) should be administered according to local vaccination standards whenever medicall y appropriate; however, there are no a vailable data on the concurrent use of filgotinib and its impact on immune responses following vaccination . 5.5. Accountability for Study Drugs The investigator is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability of all used and unused study drugs . This includes acknowledgement of receipt of each shipment of study drugs (quantity and condition). All used and unused study drugs dispensed to subjects must be returned to the site."

STUDY PROCEDURES The study procedures to be conducted for each subject enrolled in the study are presented in tabular form in Appendix 2. Assessments that need specific attention are described in the text that follows. The investigator must document an y deviation from protocol procedures and notify the Sponsor or designee . 6.1. Part1 –Main Study (Screening thr ough Week 16 Visit) 6.1.1. Screening Visit Entry into screening does not guarantee enrollment into the study . In order to manage the total trial enrollment, Gilead, at its sole discretion, may suspend screening and /or enrollment at an y site or trial -wide at any time. Subjects will be screened ≤28days before randomization to determine eligibility for participation in the study . Study assessments will be completed as specified in the Study Procedures Table (Appendix 2). Prior to any assessments being performed ,a written consent must be obtained. Subjects meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will return to the clinic ≤ 28days after screening f or randomization into the study . 6.1.1.1. MRI Investigation Subjects meeting all of the Main Study inclusion criteria and none of the Main Study exclusion criteria may be entered into an MRI investigation if all MRI inclusion and none of the MRI exclusion criteria are met. Subjects participating in the MRI investigation must have an acceptable baseline MRI as per the central review. Subject ’s MRI s should only be taken after all other eligibility criteria within the main study have been met. To allow for scheduling and reading of images, the screening period may be extended to 42 days, in these cases only . A single repeat MRI may be done if determined required b y central review and must be completed before the Day 1 Visit. See Section 4.5for additional information on MRI screen failures. 6.1.2. Day 1 Visit Study assessments will be completed as specified in the Study Procedures Table ( Appendix 2). At the end of the visit, subjects will be randomized .Refer to App endix 7for how day s of treatment are numbered."

Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 60 17 April 2020Subjects will be randomly allocated to a dosing group according to a pre -specified randomization scheme prepared b y an independent statistician. Once confirmed eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized using a computerized IXRS system. Randomization will be stratified b y geographic region, concurrent use of csDMARDs and / or apremilast at randomization (yes or no). For each subject at each visit, the clinic will contact the IXRS system and for the appropriate kit number to be dispensed. The kit will contain the relevant study drugs for the period until the next dispensation visit. Female subjects of child bearing potential will be provided at- home pregnancy tests for use at the Safety Follow -up Visit or as needed. 6.1.3. Week 2Visit through Week 16 Visit Study assessments will be completed as specified in the Study Procedures Table ( Appendix 2). For the first 16weeks of study participation, subjects who temporaril y interrupt or permanently discontinue blinded study drug for any reason are to continue with study visits and assessmen ts through the Week 16Visit, unless the subject withdraws consent, is lost to follow -up, and /or continuation in the study is medically contraindicated, per investigator’s judgment. The Week 16 Visit will be their last in- clinic visit. 6.2. Part2 -LTE (Afte r the Week 16Visit and up to 2years) After completion of the Main Study , subjects who have not permanently discontinued study drug will continue on to the LTE as follows: Those who were assigned to the filgotinib groups will continue on the same study drug assignments. Those who were assigned to the placebo or active comparator groups will be reassigned 1:1 in a blinded fashion to filgotinib 100 mg or 200 mg once dail y. Study assessments will be completed as specified in the Study Proced ures Table ( Appendix 2). 6.3. Early Termination (ET) Visit If a subject discontinues the study early either during the Main Study or during the LTE, every attempt should be m ade to perform the required study -related ET procedure sand Safet y Follow -up Visit procedures as specified in the Study Procedures Table ( Appendix 2)."

Definitions of Adverse Events, Adverse Reactions, and Serious Adverse Events 7.1.1. Adverse Events An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal product ,which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with th e treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and / orunintended sign, sy mptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not cons idered related to the medicinal product. AEs may also include pre -or post-treatment complications that occur as a result of protocol specified procedures, lack of efficacy , overdose, drug abuse /misuse reports , or occupational exposure . Pre-existing events that increase in severity or change in nature during or as a consequence of participation in the clinical study will also be considered AEs. An AE does not include the following: Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery , endoscopy , tooth extractio n,andtransfusion. The condition that led to the procedure may be an adverse event and must be reported Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before the Screening Visit that do not worsen Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( e.g.hospitalization for elective surgery , social and /or convenience admissions) Overdose without clinical sequelae (see Section 7.7.1 ) Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol -associated procedure is not an AE. I t is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented on the medical history eCRF. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event that, at an y dose, results in the following: Death Life-threatening ( NOTE : The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that h ypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)"
69,page_69,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4566 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 70 17 April 2020In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Persistent or significant disability /incapacit y A congenital anomal y /birth defect A medicall y important event or reaction: such events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes constituting SAEs. Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised to determine whether such an event is a reportable under expedited reporting rules. Examples of medically important events include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; and development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from c ontaminated medicinal product will be considered a medicall y important event and subject to expedited reporting requirements. 7.1.3. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalit ies without clinical significance are not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (e .g.clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinaly sis) that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to study drug interruption, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. I n addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e.g. electrocardiogram, X-rays, vital signs) that are associated with signs and /or sy mptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a sy ndrome, record the s yndrome or diagnosis (e .g. anemia), not the laboratory result (i .e.decreased hemoglobin). For specific information on handli ng of clinical laboratory abnormalities in this study , please refer to Section 7.5. 7.2. Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causality and severity , and for final review and confirmation of accuracy of event information and assessments. 7.2.1. Assessment of Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures The investigator or qualif ied subinvestigator is responsible for assessing the relationship to study drug therapy using clinical judgment and the following considerations: No: Evidence exists that the AEhas an etiology other than the study drug . For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (e .g.pre-existing condition, underl ying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication). Yes: There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational medicinal product."
70,page_70,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4566 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 71 17 April 2020It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causall y related in the context of AE reporting. The relationship to study procedures (e.g. invasive procedures such as venipuncture or biops y) should be assessed using the following considerations: No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study procedure. Yes: The adverse event occurred as a result of protocol procedures, (e .g. venipuncture). 7.2.2. Assessment of Severity The severit y of AEs will be graded using the modified Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ), version 5.0. For each episode, the highest grade attained should be reported.

The investigator should notify the IRB /IEC of SUSAR reports as soon as is practical, where this is required b y local regulatory agencies, and in accordance with the local institutional policy . 7.5. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalities are usuall y not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (e . g.clinical chemistry , hematology, and urinal ysis) independent of the underly ingmedical condition that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to investigational medicinal product interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE or SAE, as applicable. In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e .g.ECG , X-rays, vital signs) that are associated with signs and /or sy mptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described in Sections 7.1.1 and7.1.2. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a s yndrome, record the sy ndrome or diagnosis (i .e.anemia) not the laboratory result (i .e.decreased hemoglobin). Adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Severity should be recorded and graded according to the CTCAE Versio n 5.0, which can be found at: https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R eference_8.5x11.pdf For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the clinical severit y in the context of the underly ing conditions; this may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality .

Definitions of Special Situations Special situation reports include all reports of me dication error, abuse, misuse, overdose, occupational exposure, drug interactions, exposure via breastfeeding, unexpected benefit, transmission of infectious agents via the product, counterfeit o rfalsified medicine, and pregnancy regardless of an associat ed AE. Medication error is an y unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, preparation for administration or administration of an investigational product while the medication is in the control of a health care professional, patient, or consumer. M edication errors may be classified as a medication error without an AE, which includes situations of missed dose; medication error with an AE; intercepted medication error; or potential medication error. Abuse is defined as persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of an investigational product by a subject. Misuse is defined as an y intentional and inappropriate use of an investigational product that is not in accordance with the protocol instructions or the local prescribing information. Anoverdose is defined as an accidental or intentional administration of a quantity of an investigational product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose as per protocol or in the product labeling (as it applies t o the daily dose of the subject in question). In cases of a discrepancy in drug accountability , overdose will be established only when it is clear that the subject has taken the excess dose(s). Overdose cannot be established when the subject cannot account for the discrepancy except in cases in which the investigator has reason to suspect that the subject has taken the additional dose(s)."

Drug interaction is defined as an y drug/drug, drug/food, or drug/device interaction. Unexpected benefit is defined as an unintended therapeutic effect where the results are judged to be desirable and beneficial. Transmission of infectious agents is defined as any suspected transmission of an infected agent through a GSI investigational product. Counterfeit or falsified medicine is defined as a ny investigational product with a false representation of: a) its identity , b) its source, or c) its history . 7.7.2. Instructions for Reporting Special Situations 7.7.2.1. Instructions for Reporting Pregnancies The investigator should report pregnancies in female study subjects that are identified after initiation of study medication and throughout the study , including the post study drug follow - up period, to Gilead PVE using the pregnancy report form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the pregnancy . Refer to S ection 7.3and the eCRF completion guidelines for full instructions on the mechanism of pregnancy reporting. The pregnancy itself is not considered an AE nor is an induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy without med ical reasons. Any premature termination of pregnancy (e.g. a spontaneous abortion, an induced therapeutic abortion due to complications or other medical reasons) must be reported within 24 hours as an SAE. The underl ying medical reason for this procedure s hould be recorded as the AE term. A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and w ill be reported as described in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2. Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy outcome post study must be reported to Gilead PVE . The subject should receive appropriate monitoring and care until the conclusion of the pregnancy . The outcome should be reported to Gilead PVE using the pregnancy outcome report form.

Non-inferiorit y Test The non- inferiority hypothesis based on the response rate of ACR20 at Week 12 (Appendix 6) will be tested using the 3 -arm design approach proposed by {Liu 2014 }, which utilize the data collected from the placebo, filgotinib, and adalimumab groups. The traditional non- inferiorit y null hy pothesis is    :   −   ≤ −  where :   is the response rate for the treatment group (i.e.filgotinib),   is the response rate for the active control group (i.e. adalimumab), and  is the non-inferiorit y margin, where  = (1 – )(   –  ) is usually estimated from historical data and   is the response rate for the placebo group. For the 3- arm design, the null h ypothesis can be equivalently transformed to   :           ≤  . For this hy pothesis testing, the response rates for the active control and placebo groups are estimated from the study data. A value of 0.5 is selected for , imply ing that the treatment is “at least as good as or non- inferior t o” the active control {Koch 1999 }. 8.5.3. Hypothesis Testing Strategy The graphical approach to sequentially rejective multiple test procedures ( Appendix 6and Appendix 7) will be used to control a famil y wise type I error rate at 5% (i.e. α = 0.05). Within each filgotinib dosing regimen, the primary h ypothesis will be first tested at α/2. If the primary hypothesis is rejected, then the next secondary hypothesis in the same filgotinib dosing regimen will be tested at α/2. Testing of the h ypotheses happens sequentially in the same filgotinib dosing regimen. Once all h ypotheses within the same filgotinib dosing r egimen are rejected, then the respective α/2 can be passed on to the other regimen’s h ypotheses, that is, all hypotheses in the other filgotinib dosing regimen will be tested at α level. The order of the key secondary hypotheses will be specified in the SAP. 8.6. Safety Analysis All safet y anal yses will be performed using the Safety Anal ysis Set. Safet y will be evaluated b y assessments of clinical laboratory tests, phy sical examinations, vital signs measurements at various time points during the stud y, and b y the documentation of AEs.

Confidentiality The investigator must assure that subjects’ anon ymity will be st rictly maintained and that their identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only an identification code and an y other unique identifier (s) as allowed by local law (such as y ear of birth) will be recorded on an y form or biological sample submitted to the Sponsor, I RB/IEC,or laboratory . Laboratory specimens must be labeled in such a way as to protect subject identity while allowing the results to be recorded to the proper subject. Refer to specific laboratory instructions . NOTE: The investigator must keep a screening log showing codes, names, and addresses for all subjects screened and for all subjects enrolled in the trial. Subject data will be processed in accordance with all applicable regulations. The investigator agrees that all information received from Gilead, including but not limited to the investigator brochure, this protocol, eCRF , the study drug , and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive propert y of Gilead during the con duct of the study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to an y third party (except emplo yees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by law) without prior written consent from Gilead. The investigator furthe r agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure b y any employee or agent of the stud y site to any third party or otherwise into the public domain. 9.1.6. Study Files and Retention of Records The investigator must maintain adequate and accura te records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified into at least the following two categories: (1) investigator’s study file, and (2)subject clinical so urce documents. The investigator’s stud y file will contain the protocol /amendments, eCRF and query forms, IRB /IECand governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other a ppropriate documents and correspondence. The required source data should include sequential notes containing at least the following information for each subject: Subject identification (name, date of birth, gender); Documentation that subject meets eligibi lity criteria, i .e.history , phy sical examination, and confirmation of diagnosis (to support inclusion and exclusion criteria); Documentation of the reason(s) a consented subject is not enrolled Participation in study (including study number); Study discus sed and date of informed consent;"

All clinical study documents must be retained b y the investigator until at least 2 years or according to local laws, whichever is longer, after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (i.e.United States, Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or planned marketing applications in an I CH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been notified. Investigators may be required to retain documents longer if specified by regulatory requirements, by local regulations, or by an agreement with Gilead. The investigator must notify Gilead before destro ying any clinical study records. Should the investigator wish to assign the stud y records to another part y or move them to another location, Gilead must be notified in advance. If the investigator cannot provide for this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and Gilead to store these records securel y awa y from the site so that they can be returned sealed to the investigator in case of a n inspection . When sour ce documents are required for the continued care of the subject, appropriate copies should be made for storage away from the site. 9.1.7. Case Report Forms For each subject consented, an eCRF will be completed by an authorized study staff member whose training fo r this function is documented according to study procedures. eCRF should be completed on the day of the subject visit to enable the Sponsor to perform central monitoring of safet y data. The Eligibility Criteria eCRF should be completed onl y after all data related to eligibility have been received. Subsequent to data entry , a study monitor will perform source data verification within the Electronic Data Capture ( EDC) system. Original entries as well as any changes to data fields will be stored in the audit trail of the sy stem. Prior to database lock (or any interim time points as described in the clinical data management plan), the investigator will use his/her log in credentials to confirm that the forms have been reviewed, and that the entries accuratel y reflect the information in the source documents.

Pregnancy Precautions, Definition for Female of Childbearing Potential, and Contraceptive Requirements Theadministration of filgotinib in embry o-fetal animal development studies resulted in decreased numbers of viable rat fetuses, increased resorptions, and visceral and skeletal malformations. Similar effects were noted in the rabbit. A safet y margin relative to human exposure has not been identified. Pregnancy is contraindicated during use of filgotin ib. For participation in this study , all subjects of childbearing potential must agree to the use of highly effective contraception as outlined below. In additio n, women of childbearing potential should have a urine pregnancy test every 4weeks during the stud y. 1)Definitions a.Definition of Childbearing Potential For the purposes of this study , a female born subject is considered of childbearing potential following the initiation of pubert y (Tanner stage 2) until becoming post -menopausal, unless permanentl y sterile or with medically documented ovarian failure. Women are considered to be in a postmenopausal state when they are >54years of age with cessation of previo usly occurring menses for >12 months without an alternative cause. In addition, women of an y age with amenorrhea of >12months may also be considered postmenopausal if their follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level is in the postmenopausal range (as define d by central laboratory reference ranges) and they are not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therap y. Permanent sterilization includes hy sterectomy , bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral salpingectomy in a female subject of an y age. Bilat eral tubal ligation is not considered permanent sterilization. Women who do not meet below criteria for being post -menopausal, are not permanentl y sterile, or do not have medically documented ovarian failure must have pregnancy testing as outlined by the protocol. Investigator and the Sponsor may re-evaluate a subject’s childbearing potential during the study (including the use of FSH values if appropriate). b.Definition of Male Fertility For the purposes of this study , a male born subject is considered ferti le after the initiation of puberty unless permanently sterile b y bilateral orchidectomy or medical documentation of permanent male infertility. Vasectom yalone is not considered permanent sterilization."

Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 104 17April 20202)Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects a.Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception Filgotinib is contraindicated in pregnancy as there is a possibility of human teratogenicit y /fetotoxicity in early pregnancy based on non- clinical data. Data from a drug -drug interaction study of filgotinib and hormonal contraceptives demonstrated that filgotinib does not alter the pharmacokinetics of representative hormonal contraceptives levonorgestrel /ethiny l estradiol. For male subjects, male condom should be used; for their female partners o f childbearing potential, an accepted contraceptive method should also be considered. Details are outlined below. Please refer to the latest version of the filgotinib investigator’s brochure for additional information. b.Contraception for Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential The inclusion of female subjects of childbearing potential requires the use of highl y effective contraceptive measures. Women must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on the Day 1 Visit prior to randomization. Pregnancy tests will be performed at monthly intervals thereafter. In the event of a delay ed menstrual period (>one month between menstruations), a pregnancy test must be performed to rule out pregnancy . This is true even for wom en of childbearing potential with infrequent or irregular periods. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraceptive methods below from Screening until either 35 day s following the last dose of oral study drug or the contraception duration specified in the local adalimumab (HUMIRA®) label following the last dose of injected stud y drug (whichever is later) . Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential (e.g. heterosexual intercourse) . Abstinence is an accep table method of contraception only when it is in line with the subject’s preferred and usual lifesty le. Or Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed below (asapproved and available per local standards): Intrauterine device (IUD) with a failure rate of <1% per y ear Tubal sterilization Essure micro- insert sy stem (provided confirmation of success 3 months after procedure) (Not approved in Japan) Vasectom y in the male partner (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner and had confirmation of surgical success at least 3 months after procedure, with documentation of sperm -free ejaculate)"
104,page_104,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4566 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 105 17April 2020These above described methods are considered preferred methods of highly effective contraception in this protocol. Female subjec ts who wish to use a hormonall y based method must agree to use it in conjunction with a barrier method (used either b y the female subject or b y her male partner) . Female subjects who utilize a hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods mu st have consistently used the same method for at least three months prior to study dosing. Hormonally - based contraceptives and barrier methods permitted for use in this protocol are as follows: Hormonal methods (subject must agree to use with a barrier method, preferably , with a male condom) Oral contraceptives (either combined estrogen / progestin or progesterone only ) Injectable progesterone (Not approved in Japan) Subdermal I mplants of levonorgestrel (Not approved in Japan) Transdermal contraceptive patch (Not approved in Japan) Contraceptive vaginal ring Barrier methods (subject must agree to use with a hormonal method) Male or female condom (with or without spermicide) Diaphragm with spermicide (Not approved in Japan) Cervical cap with spermicide (Not a pproved in Japan) Sponge with spermicide (Not approved in Japan) All female subjects must also agree to refrain from egg donation and in vitro fertilization during studyparticipation and until either 35 day s following the last dose of oral study drug or the contraception duration specified in the local adalimumab (HUMIRA®) label following the last dose of injected stud y drug (whichever is later) . 3) Contraception Requirements for Male Subjects It is theoreticall y possible that a relevant s ystemic concentration may be achieved in a female partner from exposure to the male subject’s seminal fluid. Therefore, male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use condoms during study participation and for 90daysafter the last study drug dose. Female partners of male study subjects should consider using one of the above methods of contraception as well. Male subjects must also agree to refrain from sperm donation during treatment and until at least 90days after the end of dosing."
105,page_105,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4566 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 106 17April 20204) Unacceptable Birth Control Methods Birth control methods that are unacceptable include periodic abstinence ( e.g.calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides onl y, and lactational ame norrhea method (LAM). Female condom and male condom should not be used together. 5) Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Pregnancy Subjects will be instructed to notify the investigator if they become pregnant at any time during the study , or if they become pregnant within 35 days of last study drug dose. Subjects who become pregnant or who suspect that they are pregnant during the stud y must report the information to the investigator and discontinue all the study drug simmediately . These subjects will be asked to continue i n the study without taking stud y drug through the completion of the main study .Male s ubjects whose partner has become pregnant or suspects she is pregnant during the study or up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug are to report the information to the investigator. Instructions for reporting pregnancy , partner pregnancy , and pregnancy outcome are outlined in Section 7.7.2.1. 6)Pregnancy Testing All females of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy testing every 4weeks during the dosing period through the Safet y Follow -up Visit (28 -35days after their last dose of study drug ). During the perio ds where study visits are every 6-8weeks, women should continue to have pregnancy tests every 4weeks, using home pregnancy urine tests that will be provided to them. The site will call the subject every 4weeks to obtain results of these pregnancy tests and will record the information in the source documents and eCRF . If a positive urine pregnancy test is reported, the subject will be asked to return to the clinic for a confirmatory serum pregnancy test."

Dactylitis occurs in 16-48% of cases of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Acute dactylitis has been shown to be a clinical indicator ol disease severity in PsA; conversely, chronic. non-tender diffuse dactylitic swelling may be less clinically significant (2). Dactylitis is due to inflammation in the majority of tissues in the digit- the tendon sheaths , joints, bones and soft-tissues in between (3). Recurrent dactylitis, often in the same digit(s), may be the only clinical manifestation of PsA. The only validated tool for assessing dactyli tis is the Leeds Dactylometer (4). The validity of this instrument has been assessed using the OMERACT filter . The instrument and tool J:!ave demonstrated good evidence of responsi Y~ i'iS in a clinical trial (5).1 n addition. the instrume nt incorporates a definition of dactyliti srfa 10% difference in the ratio of circumfere nce o tAe affected digit to the contralateral digit).

How to use the Leeds Dactylom eter The fingers and toes are visually inspected by the examiner . Those digits which look dactylitic are measured. 2. slip the loop of the Dactylometer around the base of the digit adjacent to the web space. Pull the indicator stlip tight so that the base of the digit blanches slightly (see illustration) The collar of the device should be finn ly pressed against the base oflhe digit, as illustrated. 3. Record the circumference in mm on the Dactylom eter record sheet 4. Repeatthe procedure on the contralateral digit 5. If both ipsilateral and contralateral digits are thought to be dactyitic then use the reference range (given at the foot of the sheet) as the comparator . 6. Only record the digits with a 10% difference in circumference 7. Squeeze the digit tefweenthejoints and record the tenderness as indicated 8.
