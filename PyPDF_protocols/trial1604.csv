Investigator(s) : Multicenter study. Site(s) and r egion(s): It is anticipated that the study will be conducted in approximately 19 count ries. Regions will include North America; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. Approximately 210sites will be utilized. Study period (planned): 2018 to 2021Clinical phase: 3 Objectives: Coprimary: The coprimary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in subjects with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD) in: Inducing clinical remission based on2-item patient -reported outcome (PRO) ( abdominal pain severity and very soft stool /liquid stool frequency ) Inducing endoscopic response based on centrally read colonoscopy. Key secondary : To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission as measured by CDActivity Index CDAI To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing enhanced endoscopic response based on centrally read colonoscopy To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission based on abdominal pain severity and very soft stool/liquid stool frequency (alternate thresholds ) To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical response based on patient -reported clinical signs and sympt oms (as measured by 2 -item PRO) To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical r emission based on patient -reported clinical signs and symptoms (as measured by 2 -item PRO) as well as inducing endoscopic response based on centrally read colonoscopy in the same subject To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing endoscopic healing bas ed on centrally read colonoscopy. Other s econdary: To evaluate the sa fety and tolerability of SHP647 To evaluate the effect of SHP647 induction treatment on other clinical outcomes (clinical response defined by CDAI, or clinical remission over time ,or cha nge f rom baseline in frequency in CD -related clinical parameters) To evaluate the effect of SHP647 induction treatme nt on other endoscopic outcomes To evaluate the effect of SHP647 on health -related quality of life (HRQL) ( as measured by the Inflammatory B owel Disease Questionnaire [ IBDQ ]and the Short Form -36 Health Survey [SF -36]) For non-commercial use only"
14,page_14,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 14 Protocol SHP647 -305 15Dec2017 To evaluate the effect of SHP647 on incidence of hospitalizations and total inpatient days To evaluate the impact of SHP647 on incidence of CD- related and other surgeries. Rationale: This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subjects with moderate to severe CD. The CD clinical development program includes 3 com pleted studies: 1 Phase 1 study (A7281008) and 2 Phase 2 studies (A7281006 and A7281007). The SHP647 dose selection (25 and 75 mg) for this study isbased on data from the se3previous studies, which evaluated the activity of SHP647 in adult patients with moderately to severely active C D based on CDAI scores betw een 220 and 450. The Phase 1 study ( A7281008, TOSCA) and Phase 2 studies (A7281006, OPERA ; and A7281007, OPERA II [long -term safety study] )that investigated the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of SHP647 support further clinical development of SHP647 using subcutaneous ( SC)administration in subjects w ith moderate to severe CD . Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration: The test product is SH P647 ( a fully human immunoglobulin G2 kappa antihuman mucosal address in cell adhesion molecule [MAdCAM] monoclonal antibody), which will be provided as a sterile aqueous buffer ed solution for SCadministration in a glass prefilled syringe ( PFS)with a fixed needle. Each PFS contains 1 mL of SHP647 solution at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 or 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current SHP647 investigator’s brochure (IB). The reference product is placebo, which will be provided in a PFS w ith a fixed needle containing 1 mL of placebo solution for SC administration. The placebo solution will contain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain SHP647. Methodology: This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subjects w ith moderate to severe CD . A total of 1032 subjects (387 subjects in the 25 mg SHP647 treatment group, 387 subjects in the 75 mg SHP647 treatment group, and 258 subjects in the placebo group) are planned for enrollment into the study . Subjects must be at least 16 years of age and no more t han 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form . The study consists of a screening period up to 6 w eeks and a 16 -week treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects w ill be randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatment s (25 mg SHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or placebo) in a 3:3:2 ratio. Randomization will be stratified based upon the subject’s status of prior antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment (naïve or experienced), glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoids at b aseline versus not on glucocorticoids at baseline), and Simple Endoscopic Score for CD ( SES-CD)at baseline (SES -CD ≥17 or SES-CD <17). Subjects w ill receive SC injections of SHP647 or placebo, using a PFS, on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and Week 12 (Visit 6). Subjects w ill undergo efficacy, , , safety, and health outcome assessments at these visits . At the end of the 16 -week treatment period, subjects w ill be offered the opportunity to participat e in either a double- blind maintenance study (SHP647 -307; for subjects who fulfil lthe entry criteria ) or a long -term safety extension (LTS) study (SHP647 -304; for subjects w ho do not fulfil lthe entry criteria for S tudy SHP 647-307). Subjects who withdraw early from the 16 -week treatment period or w ho do not wish to enter the maintenance study (SHP647 -307) or LTS study (SHP647 -304) w ill continue into a 16 -week safety follow -up period. Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigational produ ct treatment i n the induction studies (SHP647 -305 or SHP647 -306) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance study or LTS study . A planned interim analysis for the coprimary endpoints will take place after approximately the first 50% of all randomized subjects in both the SHP647 -305 and SHP647 -306 studies have either completed the studies or have prematurely withdra wn from the studies. The sample size will be reassessed as part of this interim analysis . For non-commercial use only"

Endpoints and statistical analysis: Analysis s ets: The screened set w ill consist of all subjects who have signed an informed consent document. The randomized set will consist of all subjects in the screened set for whom a randomization number has been assigned. The safety set will consist of all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of investigational product. The full- analysis set (FAS) will consist of all subjects in the randomized set who have received at least 1 dose of investigational product. The per- protocol set w ill consist of all subjects in the FAS who do not have protocol deviations that may affect the coprimary efficacy endpoints. The completer set will consist of all subjects in t he FAS who have completed the Week 16 assessment for this study. Coprimary efficacy e ndpoint s: The coprimary efficacy endpoints are: Clinical remission at the Week 16 visit as defined by the follow ing: 2 -item PRO subscores of average worst daily abdominal pain ≤3 (based on 11 -point NRS) over the 7 most recent days and average daily stool frequency ≤2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the BSFS over the 7most recent days. The 7 most recent days may or may not be contiguous during the 10 days of data collection before colonoscopy preparation, depending on days to be excluded because of missing data. If fewer than 7 days are available, the endpoint will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5 days are available, the endpoint will be treated as missing . Endoscopic response at Week 16 as measured by a decrease in SES -CD of at least 25% from baseline. The coprimary efficacy endp oints, clinical remission at the Week 16 visit and endoscopic response at the Week 16 visit, will each be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75 mg SHP647) to the placebo group using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test stratified by status of prior anti -TNF treatm ent, glucocorticoid use, and SES -CD at baseline for each of the stages of the study (stage 1 includes subjects whose primary efficacy data are used in the interim analysis and stage 2 includes all other subjects. Note: cl assification of stage 1 and stage 2 is based on the time of randomization rather than the time of study completion or termination). Subjects with missing data at the Week 16 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders . Weighted inverse n ormal p-value combination methods are used to combine the p-values from stage 1 and stage 2 through the following formula: C(p 1, p2) = 1 –Φ[w 1Φ-1(1-p1)+ w 2Φ-1(1-p2)] Where p 1, p2 are the p -values computed from the CMH chi -square test for each stage, w i2= n i/(n1 + n 2), n 1 and n 2are the preplanned stage -wise sample sizes that are fixed at the time of the interim analysis based on an original total sample size, and Φ denotes the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution (Bretz ,et al. , 2009a ). Given that there is no possibility of stopping early for efficacy, that any potential stopping for futility of either or both doses of SHP647 is nonbinding, and that weights are prespecified, the test statistic C(p 1, p2) can be compared aga inst the nominal alpha level to assess statistical significance (Chang, 2008).

17,page_17,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 Protocol SHP647 -305 15Dec2017 The coprimary endpoints will each be tested by the following hypothesis: H0: δ= 0 H1: δ≠ 0 Where δis the common treatment difference across strata. The common treatment difference is a weighted average of the stratum -specific treatment differences. The global family -wise type I error rate ( FWER )for the statistical tests of the coprim ary and key secon dary endpoints will be strongly controlled at .05 (2 -sided). To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz et al. (2009 b) will be utilized to propagate α from the coprimary endpoints to the key secondary endpoints and betw een the 2 SHP647 treat ment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2- sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the coprimary endpoints (P) and alpha is propagated in a hierarchical manner to each of the 6key secondary endpoints (K1 –K6) within a pairw ise treatment comparison. In order to pass alpha betw een the coprimary endpoints and the first key secondary endpoint, both coprimary endpoints must attain statistical significance . Key secondary e fficacy endpoints: The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: Clinical remission at the Week 16 visit as measured by a CDAI score of <150. Enhanced endoscopic response at Week 16 as measured by a decrease in SES -CD of at least 50% from baseline. Clinical remission at the W eek16 visit as defined by the follow ing: 2 -item PRO subscores of average worst daily abdominal pain ≤1 (based on the 4 -point scale) over the 7 most recent days and average daily stool frequency ≤3 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in t he BS FS over the 7 most recent days. The 7 most recent days may or may not be contiguous during the 10 days of data collection before colonoscopy preparation, depending on days to be excluded because of missing data. If fewer than 7 days are available, the endpoint will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5 days are available, the endpoint will be treated as missing . Clinical response at the Week 16 visit as measured by the 2-item PRO and defined as meeting at least 1 of the following 2 criteria: oA decrease of ≥30% and at least 2 points from baseline in the average daily worst abdominal pain over the 7 most recent days*, with the average daily stool frequency of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) either: (a) Not w orsening from baseline and/or (b) Meeting the criteria for clinical remission, ie, 2- item PRO subscore of average daily stool frequency ≤2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the BSFS over the 7 most recent days* oA decrease of ≥30% from baseline in the average daily stool frequency of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the BSFS over the 7 most recent days *, with the average daily w orst abdominal pain either: (a) Not w orsening from baseline and/or (b) Meeting the criteri a for clinical remission, ie, 2-item PRO subscore of average w orst daily abdominal pain ≤3 (based on 11 -point NRS) over the 7 most recent days * *Note: The 7 most recent days may or may not be contiguous during the 10 days of data collection before colonoscopy preparation, depending on days to be excluded because of missing data.

BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing disease marked b y granulomatous inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although the terminal ileum and right colon are the most commonly involved sites, CD can affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the perianal region. Inflammation is typically transmural (full -thickness), segmental, and discontinuous, and symptoms are predominantly determined by the part of bowel or organ involved. Patients typicall y present with symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, which may be persistent and lead to anemia, and weight loss due to pain on eating and malabsorption. As the disease progresses, extraintestinal manifestations and associated conditions can develop, including bowel obstruction, fistulas, and stenosis, as well as painful skin ulcerations, ey e pain, and arthritis. The incidence of CD is estimated to be up to 12.7 cases per 100,000 persons per year in Europe and up to 20.2 cases per 100,000 pers ons per year in North America. No clear difference in incidence has been observed between men and women. Although CD can occur at an y age, peak incidence has been observed in the second to fourth decades o f life, with a second modest rise in incidence in the latter decades of life (Molodeck y et al., 2012). Crohn’ s disease is a lif elong condition with a serious effect on quality of life. The traditional approach to therap y of CD has been the step -up approach usuall y represented as a p yramid where, progressing from mild to severe disease, therapeutic choices proceed step by step from less potent drugs at the base of the p yramid to more potent but also more toxic drugs at the top. Current treatment primarily consists of s ymptomatic managemen t with dietary modifications, 5-aminosalicy lic acid (5 -ASA), opiates (loperamide), s ystemic gluc ocorticoids, immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine [AZA] , 6-mercaptopurine [ 6-MP], methotrexate [MTX]), and biologi c therap y with anti -tumor necrosis factor ( TNF )agents or anti-integrin agents. Despite recent advances, there is still an unmet need for a safe, effective, and durable pharmacological treatment that will induce and maintain clinical remission . 1.2 Product Background and Clinical Information The selectivit y of l ymphocy te homing to specialized ly mphoid tissue and mucosal sites of the GI tract is in fluenced b y the endothelial expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM). MAdCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin super family of cell adhesion molecules and is mostly expressed on the cell surface of high endothelial venules of organiz ed intestinal ly mphoid tissue such as Pey er’s patches and mesenteric ly mph nodes (Shyjan et al., 1996 ; Briskin et al., 1997 ; Liaskou et al., 2011). MAdCAM play s a role in gut immune surveillance, and also appears to facilitate excessive ly mphocy te infi ltration under conditions of chronic GI inflammation. The α 4β7integrin is the recognized ligand for MAdCAM, and expression of this ligand on populations of CD4+and CD8+T cells, as well as on subsets of Bcells, distinguishes them as unique gut homing lymphocy tes.

STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 2.1 Rationale for the Study SHP647, a fully human IgG 2κantihuman MAdCAM monoclonal antibody , is under development for the treatment of CD. SHP647 prevents the binding of 47+lymphocy tes to MAdCAM -expressing sites with high affinity and selectivity . Principal sites of MAdCAM expression on normal tissue include intestine, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, spleen, and to a lesser extent lung, liver, and bladder but not the central nervous s ystem (CNS) ( Steffen et al., 1996). Although selective targeting of the MAdCAM receptors is a novel approach, the basic interference of l ymphocyte homing by preventing the binding of these 47+lymphocy tes to the MAdCAM receptor and the resultant efficacy in CD is well established (Sandborn et al., 2013 ). SHP647 is differentiated from other molecules targeting the 47-MAdCAM mediated lymphocy te trafficking used for the treatment of CD in that SHP647 blocks the interaction of 47+lymphocy tes with the MAdCAM receptor by selectivel y binding to MAdCAM on the endothelial cells surface in the gut (and related tissues) while the other molecules target the integrins on the infiltrating l ymphocy tes. Additionally , SHP647 does not bind to t he vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM); therefore, SHP647 is not expected to affect lymphocyte homing or surveillance in the CNS orto be an effective treatment for multiple sclerosis . This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subjects with moderate to severe CD. The CD clinical development program includes 3 completed studies: 1 Phase 1 study (A7281008) and 2 Phase 2 studies (A7281006 and A7281007). Study A7281006 (OPER A)was a parallel, dose -ranging, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study in which SHP647 was given as 3 subcutaneous ( SC)dose levels (22.5, 75, and 225 mg) once every 4 weeks ( Q4W )over an 8 -week period. SHP647 was generall y safe and well tolerated and t here were no deaths. Three placebo-treated subjects and 9 subjects in the 22.5, 75, and 225 mg SHP647 groups discontinued treatment due to adverse events ( AEs). Most treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs )were mild or moderate in severit y. Median serum concentrations of SHP647 increased with increasing dose. Positive antidrug antibodies ( ADA) status did not appear to impact exposure to SHP647. The CD Activity Index ( CDAI )was the primary instrument to assess the efficacy of SHP647; no statistically significant differences were noted between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm. Therefore, t he study did not meet its primary endpoint. However, post hoc anal ysis indicated increased remission rates in subjects in the 22.5 mg or 75 mg treatment arms who had higher serum concentrations of high-sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP ) or higher scores of Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES- CD) at baseline. Study A7281008 (TOSCA )was an open- label multi- center, Phase 1 seque ntial cohort study that evaluated the effects of a maximum induction dose of SHP647 on CNS sy stem immune surveillance .

The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline (pretreatment) in absolute ly mphocy te count in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF)in subj ects with IBD after receiving 3doses of 225 mg SHP647. The mean percent agechange from baseline in absolute ly mphocy tes in CSF was 61.76% with a median change of 35.2% (range : -70.2% to 267.8%). The post-treatment L P/pretreatment L P geometric mean ratio for CSF l ymphocy tes was 1.33 with the lower bound of the 80% confidence interval ( CI)=1.13, which was greater than 0.5, supporting rejection of the null h ypothesis (ie, that the percent decrease in total lymphocytes counts after treatment would be ≥50% (equivalent to the geometric mean ratio in total ly mphocy te counts being ≤0.5). This resul t supports the hy pothesis that SHP647 does not impair trafficking of lymphocy tes into the CNS and thus should not impair CNS immune surveillance. Study A7281007 (OPERA II) was a Phase 2 open -label extension study to provide additional long-term safet y data on subjects with moderate to severe CD who completed Study A7281006 or Study A7281008 and wished to continue to receive SHP647. SHP647 75 mg (with potential dose escalation to 225 mg) SC given every 4 weeks for 72 weeks was generall y well tolerated in sub jects with CD over the treatment period evaluated in this study . In subjects with positive ADA or neutralizing antibody (NAb) status, exposure to SHP647 was not affected. Serum concentrations of SHP647 in this study were consistent with what was predicted based on the Feeder Stud y A7281006. There were 2 deaths in the study : 1 subject died of multiple organ dysfunction sy ndromes in the treatment period and 1 subject died of metastatic neoplasm in the follow -up period . Neither death was reported as related to treatment with the study drug b y the investigators. The most frequentl y reported serious adverse event ( SAE ) was CD in either the treatment period or the follow -up period. The sy stem organ class with the most subjects experiencing TEAEs was GI disorders. Although Study A7281007 was not placebo controlled, the exploratory efficacy results (based on the modified H arvey Bradshaw Index ) indicated that the effect of SHP647 on disease activity was maintained over the duration of treatment . The SHP647 dose selection (25 and 75 mg) for this study isbased on data from the se3previous studies, which evaluated the activity of SHP647 in adult patients with moderatel y to severel y active CD based on CDAI scores between 220 and 450. The results of a post hoc anal ysis of remission rate b y baseline elevated serum concentration of hsCRP suggested that the greatest treatment effect was at a d ose of 22.5 mg. Similarly , post hoc anal ysis of remission rates by endoscopic severity assessed using the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES -CD) suggested best efficacy at a dose of 75 mg. Therefore, both dosage regimens 25 and 75 mg Q4W have been selected for the Phase 3 testing. The Phase 1 study ( A7281008, TOSCA) and Phase 2 stud ies (A7281006, OPERA ; and A7281007, OPERA II [long -term safety study ])that investigated the safet y, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of SHP647 support further clinical development of SHP647 using SC administration in subjects with moderate to severe CD.

STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Study Design and Flow Chart This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subjects with moderate to severe CD. At study initiation, a total of 1032 subjects ( 387 subjects in the 25 mg SHP647 treatmen t group, 387 subjects in the 75 mg SHP647 treatment group, and 258subjects in the placebo group ) are planned for enrollment into the study (Figure 1). Subjects must be at least 16 years of age and no more than 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form. The study consists of a screening p eriod up to 6 weeks and a 16- week treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments (25mgSHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or placebo) in a 3:3:2 ratio. Randomization will be stratified based upon the subject’s status of prior anti- TNF treatment (naïve or experienced), glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoids at baseline versus not on glucocorticoids at baseline ), and SES -CD at baseline (SES- CD≥17 or SES -CD <17). Subjects will receive SCinjecti ons of SHP647 or placebo, using a prefilled syringe (PFS), on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4(Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and Week 12 (Visit 6). Subjects will undergo efficacy , , safet y, and health outcome assessments at thes e visits and at the time points specified inTable 1. At the end of the 16 -week treatment period, subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in either a double -blind maintenance study (SHP647 -307; for subjects who fulfil lthe entry criteria) or a long -term safety extension (L TS) study (SHP647- 304; for subjects who do not fulfil lthe entry criteria for S tudy SHP 647-307) as shown in Figure 1. Subjects who withdraw early from the 16 -week treatment period or who do not wish to enter the maintenance study (SHP647 -307) or LTS study (SHP647 -304) will continue into a 16- week safet y follow-up period. Onl y those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647- 305 or SHP647 -306) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance stud y or LT S study . A planned interim anal ysis for the coprimary endpoints will take place after approximately the first 50% of all randomized subjects in both the SHP647- 305 and SHP647 -306 studies have either completed the studies or have prematurely withdra wn from the studies. The sample size will be reassessed as part of this interim analy sis. See Section 9.5for further details of the planned interim anal ysis. The overall study design is shown in Figur e 2.

Note: A planned interim analysis for the coprimary endpoints will take place after approximately the first 50% of all randomized subjects in both the SHP647 -305 and SHP647 -306 studies have either completed the studies or have prematurely withdrawn from the studies. 3.1.1 Rationale for Cop rimary Endpoint s In this stud y, clinical remission, as measured b y adecrease below prespecified thresholds in the 2-item PRO (a bdominal pain severit y and very soft stool/liquid stool frequency [ as shown in the Bristol Stool Form Scale , BSFS]) ,and enhanced endoscopic response ,as measured b y a decrease in SES -CD,will be the primary instruments to assess the efficacy of SHP647 . Rationale for Abdominal Pain Severity Abdominal pain is one of the most common sy mptoms of CD, with the cause likely to be multifactorial. In the CDAI, which was the most commonly used primary endpo int in CD studies in the past, the degree of abdominal pain was based on a 4 -point scale, with scores ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). However, th e new standard is to use the 11 -point numerical rating scale (NRS )instead for the degree of abdominal pain. The limitation is that the 4- point and the 11-point scales are not directl y comparable. Numerous studies across a variety of conditions have examined cutoff scores for mild, moderate, and severe pain based on the 11-point pain NRS, with the findings across studies generally converging on a cutoff score of 4 (reflecting the maximum score indicating mild pain) and a score of 5 (reflecting the minimum score indicating moderate pain). To ensure that clinical remission criteria for abdominal pain areboth clinicall y meaningful and fall definitively within the mild pain range on the NRS based on the literature, a remission subscore of ≤3 (a minimum improvement of at least 2 points is required for subjects who enter the st udy with moderate abdominal pain [ subscore of ≥5]) will be used as part of the coprimary endpoint s.

34,page_34,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 34 Protocol SHP647 -305 15Dec2017 This definition isfurther supported byastudy conducted inasimilar condition (irritable bowel syndrome) that examined the minimal clinically important d ifference on the 11 -point NRS for abdominal pain ( Spiegel et al., 2009 ) as well as post hocanalyses of the Phase 2 data from the SHP647 program (Study A7281006, OPERA). Rationale for Very Soft Stool /Liquid Stool F requency Diarrhea is the most common sign in the presentation of CD, affecting approximately 85% of patients with a diagnosis of CD. In the CDAI, the number of liquid or soft stools (each day for 7days) is used with a multiplier of 2 . The coprimary endpoint sfor clinical remission in studies SHP647 -305 and SHP647 -306 requires the use of a definition without any such multiply ing factor and will use the BSFS for defining the very soft or liquid stools according to types6 and 7, respectivel y. A retrospective study of PROs in CD based on data from randomized controlled studies using rifaximin and methotrexate showed that a mean dail y stool frequency score of ≤1.5 had an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of 0.79 ( Khanna et al., 2015 ) and provided a potential cutoff for defining remission as measured b y CDAI. In a recent study to select the att ributes determining overall disease severity and to rank the importance of and to score these individual attributes for both CD and UC based on specialist opinion , a sample of at least 10 loose stools per week was considered as an attribute contributing to overall disease severit y in CD (Siegel et al., 2016 ). Based on post hoc anal yses of the Phase 2 data in the SHP647 program (Study A7281006, OPERA) and by choosing the population of subjects satisfy ing the moderate to severe CD inclus ion criteria, various cutoffs were explored and a stool frequency ≤2.0 was found to be optimal in terms of treatment separation while still allowing for a reasonable threshold for remission. Based on these and other recent data that support this cutoff, an average dail y stool frequency ≤2 of ty pe 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) has been chosen as the stool frequency criteri onfor clinical remission. Endoscopic Response Endoscopic response is defined in 2 way s: 25% reduction in SES -CD score (“endoscopic response”) 50% reduction in SES -CD score (“enhanced endoscopic response”). “Endoscopic response” will be used as a coprimary endpoint and “enhanced endoscopic response” will be used as a key secondary endpoint in this study as these magnitudes of changes are likel y tobe clinically relevant. Mucosal healing or “e ndoscopic healing” is considered to be a pivotal long -term target in the treatment of C D; however, partial healing or endoscopic response may also provide benefits. Endoscopic response can be an im portant indicator that the mucosal inflammation has decreased as an effect of the investigational product. Some treatments may result in a partial initial response, even though at a later stage a complete response may occur. Median duration of remission af ter 1 year treatment with infliximab was similar in subjects achieving complete absence of mucosal ulcer to subjects who achieved significant but incomplete mucosal healing (D'Haens et al., 2002 ).

35,page_35,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 Protocol SHP647 -305 15Dec2017 Thebenefit ofendoscopic response wasalsoshown in theSONI Cstudy ;the presence of endoscopic response (defined in that study as at least a 50% decrease in endoscopic score at Week 26 of treatment) identified subjects most likely to be in corticosteroid -free clinical remission at Week 50 (Ferrante et al., 2013 ). The proportion of patients requiring major abdominal surgery in a single -center cohort stud y with infliximab was simi lar with complete healing or with partial healing. ( Schnitzler et al., 2009 ; Panaccione et al., 2013). Subjects with such a treatment response should be identified b y endoscopic assessment in order not to misclassify them as nonresponders and underestimate the response to the treatment . 3.1.2 Rationale for Key Secondary Endpoint s Clinical Remission Defined by CDAI Score Conventionally , a CDAI score of <150 has been used to define clinical remission. While there has been widespread use of the CDAI over a long period of time, the items do not contribute equally to the score, and sy mptom items reported by subjects are not specific for CD and are not sensitive for inflammation seen at colonoscop y. There has been movement away from using the CDAI by regulatory authorities to the use of PROs and objective measures of disease such as endoscop y (Williet et al., 2014 ).However, for benchmarking or for comparative effectiveness purposes , CDAI endpoints are expected to be used. Although this has been the established gold -standard for clinical remission to date , CDAI suffers from requiring complex calculatio ns across 8 individual items including subjective elements. Clinical Remission Defined by Average Worst Daily Abdominal Pain ≤1 (Based on the 4 -point Scale) and Average Daily Stool Frequency ≤3 of Ty pe 6/7 The CDAI has been the traditionally used measure t o assess clinical response and clinical remission in CD. I n the CDAI , the degree of abdominal pain is one of 8 variables and is used with a multiplier of 5 in the overall score. Importantly , it is based on a 4 -point scale, with scores ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). With the shift to the new endpoint as evident from the coprimary endpoint of clinical remission in this study , it is still important to allow for a frame of reference to the existing standard for response, based on the CDAI components. A da ily average abdominal pain threshold of ≤1 will help achieve this as 1 on the 4- point scale corresponds to mild abdominal pain. Although direct mapping between the scales has not been established, this will approximate to a score of 3 on the 11 -point NRS s cale, as this falls within the mild pain range on the NRS based on the literature. Based on post hoc anal yses of the Phase 2 data in the SHP647 program, regulatory requirements, andtreatment separation assumptions, a threshold for the average dail y stool frequency ≤2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) was chosen for the co primary endpoint of clinical remission. However, given the limited data available for this endpoint, recent evidence from literatu re suggesting that thresholds ≤3 are likel y to be quite stringent (Sandborn et al., 2017 ), and the refractory natur e of the disease in those with moderate to severe CD, it is also important to assess the effects of treatment using a more realistic measure. Hence, for this key secondary endpoint of clinical remission, average daily stool frequency ≤3 of t ype 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) has been chosen as the appropriate threshold .

36,page_36,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 36 Protocol SHP647 -305 15Dec2017 Clinical Response The goal of measuring clinical remission is to have a sensitive clinical measure to assess the complete absence of s ymptoms or the stabilization of noninflammatory symptoms. However, as response and remission are considered to be on a continuum of improvement or response to treatment, clinical remission is generall y the chosen measurement over clinical response. Therefore, clinical remission is used as coprimary endpoint and clinical response is used as a keysecondary endpoint in this study . Clinical response is defined in Section 9.8.2.1. For both clinical response criteria, an additional requirement is that the s ymptom not being used to assess clinical response (ie , abdominal pain severit y or very soft stool/liquid stool frequency) must remain unchanged/not worsen from the baseline score, or meet the criteria for clinical remission for that i tem of the 2 -item PRO (either a 2-item PRO subscore of average dail y stool frequency ≤2 of t ype 6/7 [very soft stools/liquid stools] as shown in the BSFS or average worst daily abdominal pa in ≤3 [based on 11- point NRS] over the 7 most recent day s). The rationale for needing to meet at a minimum clinical response definition for ei ther abdominal pain severit y or very soft stool/liquid stool frequency (and not necessarily both) is based on the supposition that a lack of improvement in 1of these sy mptoms is not necessarily an indicator of eventual lack of response (as assessed b y the stricter clinical remission criterion). Based on Phase 2 data, it has been observed that the magnitude of placebo response rate can be higher for abdominal pain than for stool frequency . Therefore, the additional criterion of at least a 2- point decrease i n abdominal pain severity from baseline is required for assessing clinical response for abdominal pain. Overall, the definition of clinical response used for this study has been chosen to allow for the maximal pool of subjects to be assessed for the effect of treatment and, if appropriate, the continuation of therap y in the maintenance stud y (SHP647 -307). Composite Score Endpoint of B oth Clinical Remission by 2-item PRO and Endoscopic Response at Week 16 In theory , as the degree of inflammation decreases due to the effect of treatment, both clinical signs and s ymptoms of CD as well as endoscopic appearance can improve. However, in any given subject, the rates of clinical improvement and endoscopic improvement may not be the same. There are reasons for this d iscrepancy when evaluating clinical and endoscopic improvement in the same time period, including clinical sy mptoms not being well correlated to the mucosal inflammation. Due to the transmural feature of the disease, s ymptoms can correspond to the inflamma tion in some of the other gut lay ers as well. Previous clinical studies and clinical observations indicate that the improvement of clinical signs and sy mptoms and the improvement in endoscopic appearance may not go hand in hand. Significant clinical improv ement can precede significant endoscopic improvement. The healing process of the gut mucosa may take a long time and may depend on the baseline severit y of the endoscopic appearance, which may not be in line with the actual baseline severity of the sy mptom s. Therefore, when evaluating clinical remission together with endoscopic endpoints, improvement in endoscopic scores could be more relevant than evaluating mucosal healing in the induction phase.

37,page_37,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 37 Protocol SHP647 -305 15Dec2017 Forthese reasons, thekeysecondary composite endpoint (whichtakes intoaccount both clinical and endoscopic response to treatment in the same subject) consists of the evaluation of the clinical remission together with the endoscopic response. Complete Endoscopic Healing Endoscopic healing will be defined in 2 ways: Endoscopic healing defined by SES -CD ≤4 and at least a 2-point reduction versus baseline (Visit 2) and no subscore >1 in any individual variable Complete endoscopic healing defined by SES -CD=0 -2. There is no uniformly accepted definition for endoscopic healing in CD and several diff erent terminologies are used to describe the same endoscopic appearance defined by a certain endoscopic score (eg, endoscopic remission and mucosal healing) . Endoscopic healing or mucosal healing is predominantly defined b y the absence of mucosal ulcerations in CDduring endoscopic assess ment of intestinal inflammation (Atrey a and Neurath , 2017 ). The International Organization for the study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease technical review on endoscopic indices for CD clinical studies defined com plete endoscopic healing as SES -CD=0 -2 (Vuitton et al., 2016 ). Some studies introduced SES -CD≤4 as “endoscopic remission”. The more stringent endpoint of “complete endoscopic healing” will be used as a key secondary endpoint in this study . Even in case of complete endoscopic healing, there may still be ongoing histological activity in man y cases and it may not alw ays reflect healing of all lay ers of the tissue, as endoscop y onl y addresses mucosal rather than transmural healing (Atrey a and Neurath, 2017 ). The importance of inducing endoscopic healing is that it may be associated with long-term symptomatic remission; longer relapse -free interval; reduced frequency of hospitalizations, complications , and surgical resections; and the potential for a significant improvement in quality of life (Peyrin-Biroulet et al., 2011 ). 3.2 Duration and Study Completion Definition Each subject’s final visit in this study may be at the end of the treatment period (Week 16), if continuing to Study SHP647 -307 or SHP647 -304, or at the end of the safety follow -up period (Week 32),if not continuing to either of these studies.

Subjects should inform the investigator of an y changes to their smoking habits during the stud y(including starting or stopping smoking) . Use of nicotine patches should be recorded as concomitant medication (Section 5.2.1 ). 4.4 Reproductive Potential The potential effects of SHP647 on embry ofetal or postnatal development have not y et been assessed in animals or humans; these will be assessed in future studies. To minimize the risk of unintentional exposure of the embry o or fetus in the clinical study , all sexually active male and female subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are biologically capable of having children and with their partners are at risk of pregnancy , must agree to use an appropriate form of contraception, in accordance with t he package instructions/leaflet, for the duration of the active treatment period and for at least 16 weeks after the last dose of investigational product . True abstinence is considered to be a highl y effective contraception (ie, a method that results in a failure rate of <1% per year) when it is in line with the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to investiga tional product, and withdrawal are not appropriate methods of contraception. During the screening visit, the investigator or designee in consultation with the subject will confirm the subject’s childbearing potential status. For subjects of childbearing po tential, it must be confirmed and documented that the subject has selected the most appropriate method of contraception from the permitted list of contraception methods. Subjects must affirm the consistent and correct use of at least one of the seselected methods. Regular contraception check discussions will take place at the time points specified in Table 1(ie, at each site visit) and will be documented. In addition, the subject must be instructed to call the site immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected. 4.4.1 Contraceptive Methods for Female Study Subjects Sexually active females of childbearing potential must alread ybe using a highl yeffective form of contraception, and must be advised to use appropriate contraceptives throughout the stud y period and for 16 weeks following the last dose of investigational product. If hormonal contraceptives are used they should be administered according to the package insert. Female subjects should be in one of the following categories: Postmenopausal (12 consecutive months of spontaneous amenorrhea and  51years of age); postmenopausal status should be confirmed by follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) testing. Surgicall y sterile (having undergone one of the following surgical acts: hy sterectom y, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectom y or bilateral salpingectom y) and at least 6weeks poststerilization or has medicall y confirmed ovarian failure.

Each PFS contains 1 mL of SHP647 solution at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 or 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current SHP647 IB. The reference product is placebo, which will be provided in a PFS with a fixed needle containing 1mL of placebo solution for SC administration. The placebo solution will contain the same steril e aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain SHP647. 6.1.1 Blinding the Treatment Assignment The placebo s yringes and solution will match the SHP647 sy ringes in appearance. The fill volume for all sy ringes will be the same. 6.2 Administration of Investigational Products 6.2.1 Interactive Response Technology for Investigational Product Management An interactive response technology (IRT) s ystem will be used for screening and enrolling subjects, recording subject visits, randomization, investigational product supply dispensation and management, inventory management and suppl y ordering, investigational product expiration tracking and management, and emergency unblinding. Please refer to the Study Manual for additional details regarding the IRT s ystem. 6.2.2 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment This is a double -blind, placebo- controlled stud y. The actual treatment given to individual subjects is determined by a randomization schedule. Eligible subjects will be random ized in a ratio of 3:3:2 via a computer- generat ed randomization schedule to receive SC injections of 25 mg SHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or placebo, respectivel y. The randomization will be performed centrall y and stratified by status of prior anti -TNF therap y (2 strata: naïve versus experienced), glucocorticoi d use at baseline (2strata: on glucocorticoids at baseline versus not on glucocorticoids at baseline), and SES-CD at baseline (2strata: SES-CD≥17 at baseline versus SES -CD <17 at baseline ). To ensure that the allocation of subjects with prior anti- TNF therapy exposure is similar to that observed in previous studies, the percentage of subjects with prior exposure to treatment with anti-TNF therap y exposure will be capped at 60% of the sample population. There will be no cap on the number of anti- TNF naïve subjects randomized . Subject numbers are assigned to all eligible subjects as they consent to take part in the study . Within each site (numbered uniquely within a protocol), the subject number will be assigned to subjects according to the sequence of pre sentation for study participation.

Individual subject treatment will be automatically assigned by the IRT s ystem. Investigational product packaging identification numbers, separate from randomization numbers/unique identifiers, may also be assigned to subjects for specific treatment assignment as dictated b y the study. In these cases, the same investiga tional product packing identification number may not be assigned to more than 1 subject . 6.2.3 Dosing Investigational product (SHP647 or placebo) will be administered subcutaneously by qualified site personnel Q4W (Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12). See Section 7.2for the timing of dosing relative to other procedures. Investigational product should be administered in the anterolateral right or left thigh. If there are clinical reasons wh y the investigational product cannot be administered in the thigh , the investigational product may be administered in the deltoid area or abdomen with appropriate documentation. The location of the investigational product administration will be recorded. After the first administration of investigational product, the subject must be observed by a member of the stud y staff for at least 30 minutes (the total duration should be determined at the discretion of the investigator). For subsequent administrations, observation of the subject is at the discretion of the investigator. Injection site and allergic reaction monitoring should be completed by a member of the study staff. Investigator -directed delay s in dosing due to abnormal laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the subject should continue with the treatment. Onl y those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -305 or SHP647 -306) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance stud y or LT S study . The investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all investigational product is dispensed by qualified staff members. 6.2.4 Unblinding the Treatment Assignment Whenever possible, the investigator or subinvestigator should contact the Shire phy sician and/or assigned medical monitor before breaking the blind. I t is understood that in an emergency situation it may not be possible to communicate with the study team before breaking the blind. The safet y of the subject should be of primary concern. When the blindi ng code is broken the reasons must be full y documented. In the event that the treatment assignment is broken, the date, the signature of the person who broke the code, and the reason for breaking the code are recorded on the IRT and the source documents. U pon breaking the blind, the subject is withdrawn from the study , but should be followed up for safet y purposes. The IRT will notify the relevant personnel in the event of an y code break.

STUDY PROCEDURES 7.1 Study Schedule The investigator may schedule visits (unplanned visits) in addition to those listed on the schedule of assessments (Table 1), in order to conduct evaluations or assessments required to protect the wellbeing of the subject. 7.1.1 Screening Period 7.1.1.1 Screening Visit (Visit 1) Subjects will be screened within 6 weeks before the first dose of investigational product to determine eligibility to participate in the stud y and to perform the other assessments and procedures specified in Table 1. Each subject or subject’s parent or legall y authorized representative must participate in the informed consent process and provide written informed consent/as sent before any assessments or procedures specified in the protocol are performed. Screening assessments willtake place over more than 1 day (at least 2 visits will be necessary to complete the screening evaluations, including colonoscopy ). A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent or assent, as applicable (and whose parents or legally authorized representatives have given informed consent, as applicable), failed to meet the inclusion criteria and/or met at least one of the exclusion criteria, and has not been randomized or administered investigational product. A subject may be rescreened if their condition has changed and they may potentially be eligible. Subjects may be rescreened 1 time only. Note: Screening laboratory tests, if considered b y the investigator to be transient and inconsistent with the subject’s clinical condition, may be repeated once during the screening period for confirmation. Results of repeated tests must be reviewed for eligibility before the screenin g colonoscop yprocedure. Hematology samples should be repeated if more than 3 weeks have elapsed before the day of colonoscop y to be able to use the hematocrit central lab oratory results for the CDAI score calculation at screening. Hematocrit must not be o lder than 3 weeks before the day of colonoscop y. Collection of the daily e -diary data must begin at least 14 days before colonoscopy preparation. Colonoscopy preparation will be according to local routine . Colonoscopy must be performed on all subjects after the majorit y of other eligibility criteria (eg,laboratory values and 2 -item PRO and CDAI scores ) aremet. It must be performed during the screening period within 5 to7days before baseline (Visit2), to allow for adequate e -diary data collection for the 2-item PRO and CDAI scoresand to obtain the centrally read endoscopic subscore to verify the subject’s eligibility (Section 7.2.2.4). If the calculated CDAI scores is <220 or>450, the subject will be considered a screen failure and should not pr oceed with the colonoscop y preparation and/or the colonoscop y. All colonoscopies will be evaluated using the SES-CD ( Appendix 2). For non-commercial use only"
59,page_59,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 59 Protocol SHP647 -305 15Dec2017 If a subject has had the following procedures performed as a part of standard medical care within 12 w eeks before screening (Visit 1), these procedures do not need to be repeated as a part of screening: Chest x -ray Documented negative PPD test or IGRA for TB. 7.1.1.2 Baseline Visit (Visit 2, Week 0) The baseline visit (Visit 2) will take place on Day 1 (Week 0). The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1will be performed. After eligibility has been reconfirmed and all baseline procedures and assessments have been completed, each subject will be randomized to receive 1 of the 3 treatments as described in Section 6.2.2 and the first dose of investigational product will be administered. Results of the baseline laboratory tests are not required for investigational product administration but must be reviewed as soon as possible thereafter. 7.1.2 Treatment Period 7.1.2.1 Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) Visits 3, 4, 5 , and 6 are sc heduled to take place on Day 14±3days (Week 2), Day 28±3days (Week 4), Day 56±3days (Week 8), and Day 84±3days (Week 12), respectivel y. The assessments and procedures specified inTable 1will be performed. 7.1.2.2 Final On -treatment Visit : Visit 7, Parts 1, 2, and 3 (Week 16/Early Termination ) The Week 16/ET visit (Visit 7) consists of 3parts. Part 1 of Visit 7 should be scheduled 1to 3day( s)before Part 2; t his will allow for blood samples to be taken before starting the colonoscopy preparation and before the colonoscopy procedure at Part 2 of the visit .The Week 16/ET assessments and procedures that will take place during Part 1 are specified in Table 1. Par t 2 of Visit 7 should be scheduled preferabl y within 5 to 7 day s before Part 3; this will allow sufficient time to obtain the data from the centrally read colonoscop y. The Week 16/ET assessments and procedures th at will take place during Part 2are specifi ed in Table 1. Part3 of Visit 7 will take place on Day 112±3days. The Week 16/ET assessments and procedures that will take place during Part 3are specified in Table 1. At Part 3 of Visit 7, after review of CD assessments, health outcome assessments, and safet y assessments, it will be determined whether the subject should enroll in the maintenance (SHP647 -307) or LTS (SHP647- 304) studies or enter the follow- up period of this study . Entry into the maintenance or LTS studies is dependent upon whether the subject fulfills the efficacy entry criteria of the maintenance study (SHP647 -307), including achieving endoscopic and/or clinical response , and whether the subject agrees to participate.

The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1will be performed, includ ing query ing for SAEs, AEs, and concomitant medications and treatments . All AEs and SAEs that are not resolved at the time of this visit will be followed to closure (Section 8.1). Subjects who are proceeding to the maintenance or LTS studies will not enter the safety follow -up period. 7.1.4 Additional Care of Subjects after the Study No after care is planned for this study . 7.2 Study Evaluations and Procedures Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol - required tests and procedures are completed as descri bed. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside the control of the investigator, which may make it unfeasible to perform the test s and procedures . In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessar y to ensure the safet y and well being of the subject. When timing of procedures and assessments coincide, the following order should be followed: Health outcome and patient -reported questionnaires Vital signs and ECG Laboratory sample collection Investigational product administration Colonoscopy isperformed at a separate visit (Section 7.2.2.4).

Subjects will enter data on CD signs and s ymptoms items using the e -diary ,which will be provide d to subjects at the start of the stud y. Compliance will be assessed by site staff at each visit. The site staff willinstruct the subject on the appropriate use of the e -diary when compliance is below 80% (eg,<23 out of 28 e -diary entries) .If 70% compliance cannot be achieved after repeated instructions during the screening period , noncompliant subjects will be automatically noneligible as they will not fulfill inclusion criterion 1 (Section 4.1). Subjects will be asked to record the following sign s and sy mptom data, as experienced over the previous 24 hours, in the e -diary : Abdominal pain severit y(numeric rating scale [NRS]) Very soft stool/liquid stool frequency (as shown by BSFS type 6/ 7) Total stool frequency Rectal bleeding frequency Rectal ur gency frequency Nausea severit y Vomiting frequency Incontinence frequency Abdominal pain used in CDAI General wellbeing. The first 2 items (abdominal pain severit y and very soft stool/liquid stool frequency) will be used to calculate the 2 -item PRO. The 2-item PRO will be calculated using the following criteria: Screening: the 2- item PRO will be calculated based on the 7 most recent day s during the 10days of data collection before the colonoscopy preparation. If 7 out of the 10 most recent day s are not a vailable, then the 2-item PRO cannot be calculated for the subject at screening. Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6: the 2 -item PRO will be calculated based on the 7 most recent day s during the 10 days of data collection before the visit. I f fewer than 7 days are avail able, the 2-item PRO will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5days are available, the 2 -item PRO will be treated as missing.

If fewer than 7 days are available, the 2 -item PRO will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5 days are available, the 2- item PRO will be treated as missing. For all 2 -item PRO calculations, the 7 most recent day s may or may not be contiguous during the 10days of data collection depending on day s to be excluded because of missing data. ThePRO -CD daily e-diary is presented in Appendix 2 . 7.2.2.2 Simple Endoscopic Scor e for Crohn’s Disease The SES -CD will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1.The SES-CDscore at baseline (Visit 2) and at Week 16 /ET will be calculated using subscores of each of the segments investigated and centrally read from the colonoscopies performed at screening (Visit 1, Part 2) and Week 16 (Visit 7, Part 2), respectivel y. The SES -CD is a simple scoring s ystem based on 4 endoscopic variables (presence and size of ulcers, proportion of surface covered b y ulcers, proportion of affected surface, and presence and severit y of stenosis [narrowing] ) measured in the same 5 ileocolonic segments as the CD index of severit y. Overall, values on the SES -CD range from 0 to 56, with higher values indicating more severe disease. The 4 endoscopic variables are scored from 0 to 3 in each bowel segment (ileum, right/transverse/left colon, and rectum): Presence and size of ulcers (none =score 0; diameter 0.1 –0.5 cm=score 1; 0.5–2 cm=score 2; diameter >2 cm= score 3) Extent of ulcerated surface (none = 0; <10% =1; 10% –30% = 2; >30% = 3); extent of affected surface (none = 0; <50% =1; 50% –75% = 2; >75% =3) Presence and t ype of narrowings (none = 0; single, can be passed =1; multiple, canbepassed =2; cannot be passed = 3). A complete colonosc opy is required (including visualization of the terminal ileum). Themaximum stenosis score in a segment distal to another evaluable segment cannot exceed 2, so that the stenosis scores cannot exceed a total of 11 ( Reinisch et al., 2017 ) . Evidence of active inflammation and ulceration is required at screening (Visit 1), in the form of a centrall y read score of at least 1 in one or more ileocolonic segments in the Presence of Ulcers component of the SES -CD, as well as a total score of >6. Study videos will be scored separatel y by 2 central readers w ho are blinded to the treatment. Ifthe central readers’ scores are not in agreement, there will be a third adjudication read to select the correct read from the first 2 scores. Results of the central reading of the videos will be communicated to sites within 5 business day s. For the evaluat ion of efficacy , in cases where 1 or 2 segments cannot be fully evaluated b y central endoscopic readers, ileocolonic segments that are evaluable during screening (Visit 1) and Week 16/ET (matching segments approach) will be utilized.

The CDAI score at screening (Visit 1, Part 2) will be calculated using the following: Components 1 to 3 from subject- reported PRO -CD daily e-diary data collected >10days before the start of colonoscopy preparation using the same most recent 7 of 10 day s as described for the 2 -item PRO (Section 7.2.2.1 ) and Components 4 to 8 (weight, medica l and ph ysical examination, use of diarrhea treatment, and hematocrit value) collected during screening (Visit 1) Part 1. Note: Hematology samples should be repeated if more than 3 weeks have elapsed before the day of colonoscop y to be able to use the hema tocrit central laboratory results for the CDAI score calculation at screening. Hematocrit must not be older than 3 weeks before the day of colonoscop y. The CDAI scores at Visits 4, 5, and 6 will be calculated using the following : Components 1 to 3 from sub ject-reported PRO -CD daily e-diary data collected >10days before the visit using the same most recent 7 or 10 day s as described for the 2 -item PRO (Section 7.2.2.1 ) and Components 4 to 8 (weight, medical and ph ysical examination, use of diarrhea treatment , and hematocrit value) collected at the visit. The CDAI score at the Week 16/ET visit will be calculated at Visit 7, Part 3 (after all evaluations are complete), using the following : Component s 1 to 3 from subject- reported PRO -CD daily e-diary data collected >10days before the start of colonoscopy preparation using the same most recent 7 or 10 day s as described for the 2 -item PRO (Section 7.2.2.1 )and Components 4 to 8 (weight, medical and ph ysical examination, use of diarrhea treatment, and hematoc rit value ) collected at Part 1 and Part 3 of the Week 16/ET visit, where assessed .

T ypically, the standard dose of a bowel preparation is split between the day before and the morning of the procedure. In this study , bowel preparation and colonoscopy are to be conducted per local routine; however, sodium phosphate based preparations should be avoided, as such regimens can produce mucosal changes that mimic IBD. In general, a complete colonoscopy should be performed; this include svisualization of the rectum, sigmoid colon, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, ileocecal valve, and the terminal ileum. At screening , anincomplete colonoscopy will not be accepted ; only a few exceptions wi ll be evaluated on a case b y case basis (e g. presence of impassable narrowing without any clinical signs of bowel obstruction and when the same time the invest igated segments provide the SES-CD score required for inclusion) . Similarly ,a complete colonoscop y is the aim at Week 16/ET ,with the exception of the presence of impassable stenosis or other CD -related complications as cause of failure to complete the colono scopy procedure. The position of the endoscope will be based on the length of the instrument at various levels of insertion as well as the morphological features of the intestine as seen during colonoscop y. Toachieve consistency in capturing and assessing endoscopic video recordings, each participating site will use an integrated hardware/software solution and associated tools for the capture and transmission of endoscop y video recordings for central reading. Nonreadable endoscopic images, as assessed b y the investigator, should not be sent for central reading. The colonoscop y report and any photographs and/or video recordings taken during the procedure per local custom should be filed in the subject’s medical record. During the colonoscop yat screening (Visit 1, Part 2)and Week 16/ET , 10 biopsies will be collected from the most inflamed area of the mucosa : 2samples each from the ileum, the 3segments of the colon ,and the rectum .Colonoscopy and biops y procedures will be defined in a colonoscop yinstru ctions manual and/or reference card(s), on which all sites will be trained. Colonoscopy results will be reviewed by a central reader. (Appendix 2). Biopsies for conventional histologic assessment will be collected in formalin and shipped to the central laboratory .

Given these differences, no attempt will be made to reconcile any apparent discrepancies between observed or volunteered AEs and data from neurological assessment collected from subjects. Investigators may determine if any finding on neurological testing constitutes an AE. Adverse event incidence rates will not be calculated from these neurological ev aluation data but rather from the AE information recorded b y the investigator. 7.2.3.4 Adverse Event Collection At each stud y visit, subjects will be questioned in a general way to ascertain if AEs have occurred since the previous visit ( eg,“Have you had an y heal th problems since your last visit?”) .

Additional collection times or changes to collection times will be permitted, as necessary to ensure appropriate collection of safety data. Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature. Single measurements of sitting blood pressure will be recorded at each time point. Blood pressure should be determined by cuff with the subject’s arm supported at the level of the heart and recorded to t he nearest mm Hg using the same method, the same arm (preferabl y the dominant arm), and the same position throughout the study . Respiratory rate will be measured with the subject in a comfortable position.

ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSES SMENT 8.1 Definition of Adverse Events, Period of Observation, Recording of Adverse Events An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigat ional) product (International Council for Harmonisation [ ICH]Guidance E2A [1995 ]). All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent and/or assent is signed until the end of the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.3 .This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the study , regardless of whether or not investigational product is administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of symptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each s ymptom sho uld be listed individually . All AEs should be captured in the subject’s source document. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured in the subject’s source document. All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilizati on achieved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event. Worsening of pretreatment events, after initiation of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia before dosing of investigational product, but the dyspepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investig ational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded in the subject’s source document). The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic interven tion. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantl y affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention . For non-commercial use only"
75,page_75,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 75 Protocol SHP647 -305 15Dec2017 8.1.2 Relationship Categorization A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused b y the investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related.” Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.” The causality assessment must be documen ted in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. Not relatedThe event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying medical condit ion, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event. 8.1.3 Outcome Categorization The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the stud y in the eCRF. Outcomes are as follows: Fatal Not recovered/Not resolved Recovered/Resolved Recovered/Resolved with sequelae Recovering/Resolving Unknown. 8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as the y are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be recorded as an AE if the investigator considers s uch sy mptoms of disease progression related to the investigational product .

76,page_76,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 76 Protocol SHP647 -305 15Dec2017 8.1.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations A change in the value of a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG assessment can represent an AE if the change is clinically relev ant or if, during treatment with the investigational product, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of an alread y abnormal value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration. If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG values which were not present at the pretreatment value observed closest to the start of study treatment, further investigations shou ld be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinicall y significant and therefore represents an AE. 8.1.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up peri od stated in Section 7.1.3. Any report of pregnancy for any female study participant or the partner of a male study participant must be reported within 24 hours to Shire Global Drug Safet y using the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. A cop y of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form (and any applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. The pregnant female study participant must be withdrawn from the study . Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ob tain this information within 30calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar day s postpartum. Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and must be reported using th e Shire Clinical Stud y Serious Adverse Event and Non serious AEs Required by the Protocol Form. Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SAE. In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study Se rious Adverse Event and Nonserious AEs Required by the Protocol Form as well as the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form.

Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these resu lt in an SAE. The categories below are not mutua lly exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category . Abuse –Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a nonmedical purpose (eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that may be detrimental to the individual and/or society Misuse –Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at any dose (Note: T his includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as directed at the dose prescribed by the protocol) Overdose –Intentional or unintentional administration of investigational product at a dose interval that is less than 2 weeks between doses Medication Error –An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of an investigational product. For studies, medication err ors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below. Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportable as medication errors. Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation. The administration and/or use of the unassigned treatment is/are alway s reportable as a medication error. The administration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered as a reportable medication error. There is no specific antidote for overdose with SHP647. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. 8.1.8 Unexpected Adverse Event An unexpected AE is an AE whose nature, severity , specificit y, or outcome is not consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the r eference safety information (RSI ). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product, but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation. The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor using the IB as the RSI .

Note: I mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an ED or at home; blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatien t hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abus e. 8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow-up period stated in Section 7.1.3 and must be reported to Shire Global Drug Safety andthe CRO/Shire medical monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by the investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to Shire Global Drug Safety within 24 hours of the first awareness of the even t. 8.2.5 S erious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the date the ev ent is considered chronic. In the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y. In addition, any signs or sy mptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed con sent form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 8.2.6 Fatal Outcome Any SAE that results in the subject’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resoluti on date recorded. For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product).

DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS 9.1 Data Collection The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information required by the protocol in the eCRF. A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy . Discrepancies between source data and data entered in the eCRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by authorized site personnel. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initia tion visit and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once a subject is randomized , it is expected that site personnel will complete the eCRF entry within approximately 3business day s of the subject’s visit. 9.2 Clinical Data Management Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management plan. Quality control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner . 9.3 Data Handling Considerations Data that may potentiall y unblind the treatment assignment (ie, investigational product serum concentrations, antibodies to investigational product, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparation/accountability data) will be handled with special care during the data cleaning and review process. These data will be handled in such a way that, before unblinding, any data that may unblind study team personnel will be presented as blinded information or otherwise will not be made available. If applicable, unblinded data may be made available to quality assurance representatives for the purposes of conducting independent drug audits. 9.4 Statistical Analys is Process The study will be anal yzed by the sponsor or its agent . The statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study information such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. The SAP will also include a description of how missing, unused and spuriou s data will be addressed. The SAP will be finalized before unblinding to preserve the integrity of the statistical analy sis and study conclusions. For non-commercial use only"

For continuous variables, the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values will b e presented. 9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Data Monitoring Committee A planned interim anal ysis for the co primary endpoints will take place after approximately the first 50% of all randomized subjects in both the SHP647 -305 and SHP647 -306 studies have either completed the studies or have prematurely withdrawn from the studies . Recruitment will not pause for this interim anal ysis. The purpose of the unblinded interim analy sis is to reassess the appropriateness of the premises used for the coprimary endpoints when the study was designed. There is no possibility to stop earl y for overwhelming efficacy as the studies must continue in order to enroll an appropriate number of subjects in the SHP647 -307 study . The reassessment of sample size will b e performed using conditional power methods. Results at the interim analy sis may be futile for one or both of the SHP647 doses and lead to the discontinuation of that dose for CD or the SHP647 CD program . Full details of the interim analysis, the guideline s for increasing the sample size, and futility rules to stop a dose will be included in a prespecified interim analy sis SAP. The interim analysis SAP will be finalized before the interim anal ysisis conducted . The planned interim analysis will be conducted by an external independent statistical group and given to the independent Interim Anal ysis Review Committee ; the individuals involved in the day-to-day conduct of the study will not be involved in the interim anal ysis nor have access to the results of the interim anal ysis. The sponsor will only be notified b y the Interim Analy sis Review Committee of recommendations to modify the SHP647 CD program according to the guidelines specified in the interim anal ysis SAP. An external DMC will be established to revie w the overall safety of the study subjects on an ongoing basis. The DMC will be responsible for the ongoing monitoring of safet y of subjects enrolled in the study according to the DMC charter. Recommendations made by the DMC to alter the conduct of the stu dy or to amend the protocol will be forwarded to Shire for review and for a final decision. Shire or its designee will notify investigative sites and regulatory authorities as appropriate, of DMC recommendations (which may include summaries of aggregate an alyses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints).

Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2- sided) for each of the pairwise treatment compari sons for the coprimary endpoint s. Therefore, the power analy sis and sample size estimation was calculated based on the chi -square test of proportio ns using nQuery Advisor® Version 7.0 (Statistical Solutions L td, Cork, Ireland) for an individual SHP647 dose compared to placebo. Power calculations are made based on a ssuming a .025 (2 -sided) significance level for each pairwise treatment comparison, 1720 subjects will be screened to random ize1032 subjects in a 3:3:2 allocation ratio: 387 subjects in the 25 mg SHP647 treatmen t group, 387 subjects in the 75mg SHP647 treatment group, and 258 subjects in the placebo group .These numbers of subjects would y ield an approximately 93% power to detect individual pairwise treatment difference in the first coprimary efficacy endpoint, clinical remission by 2-item PRO at W eek16, of 10% (17.5% SHP647 versus 7.5% placebo). Expected clinical remission rates b y 2-item PRO at Week 16 are based on observed rates from a post hoc anal ysis of the A7281006 study and placebo remission rates from literature (Sandborn et al., 2017 ). No adjustment for missing data is required in these sample size calculations as subjects with missing data for clinical remission by 2-item PRO at Week 16 are imputed as failures and the above rates ac count for these subjects. With the 1032 subjects in allocation noted above, this number of subjects would y ield an approximately 94% power to detect individual pairwise treatment difference in the other coprimary efficacy endpoint, endoscopic response at W eek 16, of 12 .5% (2 7.5% SHP647 versus 15% placebo). Expected endoscopic response rates at Week 16 are based on observed rates from a post hoc anal ysis of the A7281006 study and also endoscopic response rates from literature (Sandborn et al., 2017 ). No adjustment for missing data is required in these sample size calculation s as subjects with missing data for endoscopic re sponse at Week 16 are imputed as failures and the above rates account for these subjects. The overall power for the coprimary endpoints will be approximately 87% assuming no correlation between the tests on the endpoints and approximately 90% assuming a correlation of 0.4. With the sample size of 1032 subjects , Table 5provides the power for detecting a treatment difference between a SHP647 treatment group and the placebo group for the key secondary endpoints .

Iffewer than 7 days are available, the endpoint will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 day s. If fewer than 5 day s are available, the endpoint will be treated as missing . Endoscopic response at Week 16 as measured b y a decrease in SES -CD of at least 25% from baseline. The coprimary efficacy endpoints, clinical remission at the Week 16 visit and endoscopic response at the Week 16 visit, will each be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75mg SHP647) to the placebo group using a Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test stratified by status of prior anti -TNF treatment, glucocorticoid use, and SES -CD at baseline for each of the stages of the study (stage 1 includes subjects whose primary efficacy data are used in the interim anal ysisandstage 2includes all other subjects. Note: classification of stage 1 and stage 2 is based on the time of randomization rather than the time of study completion or termination). Subjects with missing data at the Week 16 visit will be considered failures and counte d as nonresponders . Weighted inverse normal p -value combination methods are used to combine the p -values from stage 1 and stage 2 through the following formula: C(p 1, p2) = 1 –Φ[w 1Φ-1(1-p1)+ w 2Φ-1(1-p2)] Where p 1, p2 are the p -values computed from the CMH chi -square test for each stage, wi2= n i/(n1+ n 2), n 1 and n 2are the pre planned stage -wise sample sizes that are fixed at the time of the interim anal ysis based on an original total sample size, and Φ denotes the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution ( Bretz et al., 2009a ).Given that there is no possibility of stopping earl y for efficacy, that any potential stopping for futility of either or both doses of SHP647 is nonbinding, and that weights are prespecified, the test statistic C(p 1, p2) can b e compared against the nomina l alpha level to assess statistical significance ( Chang and Chow, 2008 ). The coprimary endpoint swill each be tested b y the following h ypothesis: H0: δ= 0 H1: δ≠ 0 Where δis the common treatment difference across strata.

Sensitivity analy ses to explore the impact of missing data on the coprimary efficacy endpoint s and key secondary endpoints will be conducted. These anal yses may compare imputations of the missing values which favor placebo (eg, worst case) and/or imputations which favor active treatment (eg, best case). In addition, imputation methods based on info rmative missingness and other missing data mechanisms may be performed. Additional sensitivity analy ses will also be conducted using the per -protocol set and the completer set. Additional analy ses may be developed in the SAP. All sensitivity anal yses will be described in the SAP. Prespecified subgroup analy ses are planned for the coprimary endpoints including, but not limited to gender, prior anti -TNF treatment, glucocorticoid use at baseline, SES -CD at baseline, region, age group, randomization stratum, an d other important subgroups. A full list of important subgroups will be described in the SAP. Within subgroups, efficacy endpoints will be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg SHP647 and 75 mg SHP647) with the placebo group using a chi -square te st. The estimate of the treatment difference, along with the corresponding Newcombe (h ybrid -score) 95% CI and chi -square test p -value, will be presented. Statistical Testing and Protection of the Ty pe I Error The global FWER for the statistical tests of th e coprimary and key secondary endpoints will be strongl y controlled at .05 (2 -sided). To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz et al. (2009b )will be utilized to propagate α from the coprimary endpoints to the keysecondary endpoints and between the 2 SHP647 treatment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2 -sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the coprimary endpoint s (P) and alpha is propagated in a hierarchical manner to each of the 6key secondary endpoints (K1–K6 ) within a pairwise treatment comparison. In order to pass alpha between the coprimary endpoints and the first key secondary endpoint, both coprimary endpoints must attain statistical significance.

Additionally , Shire adhe res to external guidelines (eg,Good Publication Practices 2) when forming a publication steering committee, which is done for large, multicenter Phase 2 –4 and certain other studies as determined by Shire. The purpose of the publication steering committee is to act as a noncommercial body that advises or decides on dissemination of scientific stud y data in accordance with the scope of this policy. All publications relating to Shire p roducts or projects must undergo appropriate technical and intellectual propert y review, with Shire agreement to publish before release of information. The review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’s proprietary information existing either at the commencem ent of the study or generated during the study .

Note: Variable 5: This variable covers taking medication for symptomatic relief from diarrhea, eg, bulking agents, opiates etc. Variable 7: Absolute deviation of hematocrit is the difference in hematocrit from standard. A male subject with a hematocrit of 40% has an absolute deviation of 7. Each percentage deviation has a value of 6 points. If hematocrit subtotal is <0, enter 0. Variable 8: This variable is based on Metropolitan Life Tables (these are programmed into the ePRO device). Percent deviation from standard w eight is (1 - weight/standard weight) × 100; therefore, positive percent deviation represents weight loss, which adds points to the CDAI. Percentage deviation from standard weight = 1 point for each percent deviation. I f body weight subtotal is less than -10, enter -10. CDAI Interpretation :  0-149 points: Asymptomatic remission (Note: subjects requiring steroids to remain asymptomatic are not considered to be in remission but are referred to as being “steroid dependent”)  150-220 points: Mild to moderate active CD  221-450 points: Moderate to severe active CD  >451 points: Severely active to fulminant disease.

Investigator(s): Multicenter study. Site(s) and region(s): It is anticipated that the study will be conducted in approximately 19 countries. Regions will include North America; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. Approximately 210 sites will be utilized. Study period (planned): 2018 to 2021Clinical phase: 3 Objectives: Coprim ary: The coprimary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in subjects with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD) in: Inducing clinical remission based on 2 -item patient -reported outcome (PRO) (abdominal pain severity and very soft sto ol/liquid stool frequency) Inducing endoscopic response based on centrally read colonoscopy. Key secondary: To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission as measured by CD Activity Index CDAI To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing enhanced endoscopic response based on centrally read colonoscopy To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission based on abdominal pain severity and very soft stool/liquid stool frequency (alternate thresholds) To evaluate the e fficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical response based on patient -reported clinical signs and symptoms (as measured by 2 -item PRO) To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission based on patient -reported clinical signs and symptoms (as me asured by 2 -item PRO) as well as inducing endoscopic response based on centrally read colonoscopy in the same subject To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing endoscopic healing based on centrally read colonoscopy. Other secondary: To evaluate the sa fety and tolerability of SHP647 To evaluate the effect of SHP647 induction treatment on other clinical outcomes (clinical response defined by CDAI, or clinical remission over time, or change from baseline in frequency in CD -related clinical parameters) To evaluate the effect of SHP647 induction treatment on other endoscopic outcomes To evaluate the effect of SHP647 on health -related quality of life (HRQL) (as measured by the Inflammatory Bow el Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ] and the Short Form -36 Health Survey [SF-36]) To evaluate the effect of SHP647 on incidence of hospitalizations and total inpatient days To evaluate the impact of SHP647 on incidence of CD -related and other surgeries.

155,page_155,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 SHP647 -305 Protocol Am endment 1 SHP647 21Aug 2018 Rationale: This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subjects with moderate to severe CD. The CD clinical development program includes 3 com pleted studies: 1 Phase 1 study (A7281008) and 2 Phase 2 studies (A7281006 and A7281007). The SHP647 dos e selection (25 mgand 75 mg) for this study is based on data from these 3 previous studies, which evaluated the activity of SHP647 in adult patients with moderately to severely active CD based on CDAI scores between 220 and 450. The Phase 1 study ( A728100 8, TOSCA) and Phase 2 studies (A7281006, OPERA; and A7281007, OPERA II [long -term safety study]) that investigated the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of SHP647 support further clinical development of SHP647 using subcutaneous (SC) administration in subjects with moderate to severe CD. Investigational product, dos e, and m ode of administration: The test product is SHP647 (a fully human immunoglobulin G2 kappa antihuman mucosal address in cell adhesion molecule [MAdCAM] monoclonal antibody), which will be provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution for SCadministration in a glass prefilled syringe ( PFS) w ith a fixed needle. Each PFS contains 1 mL of SHP647 solution for injection at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 mgor 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current SHP647 investigator’s brochure (IB). The reference product is placebo, which will be provided in a PFS w ith a fixed needle containing 1 mL of placebo solution for SC administration. The placebo solution will contain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain SHP647. Methodology: This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission and endoscop ic response in subjects w ith moderate to severe CD. A total of 1032 subjects (387 subjects in the 25 mg SHP647 treatment group, 387 subjects in the 75 mg SHP647 treatment group, and 258 subjects in the placebo group) are planned for enrollment into the stu dy. Subjects must be at least 16 years of age and no more than 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form. The study consists of a screening period up to 6 w eeks and a 16 -week treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects w ill be randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments (25 mg SHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or placebo) in a 3:3:2 ratio. Randomization will be stratified based upon the subject’s status of prior antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment (naïve or experience d), glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoids at baseline versus not on glucocorticoids at baseline), and Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES -CD) at baseline (SES -CD ≥17 or SES -CD <17). Subjects w ill receive SC injections of SHP647 or placebo, usi ng a PFS, on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and Week 12 (Visit 6). Subjects will undergo efficacy, , safety, and health outcome assessments at these visits. At the end of the 16 -week treatment per iod, subjects w ill be offered the opportunity to participate in either a double- blind maintenance study (SHP647 -307; for subjects who fulfill the entry criteria) or a long -term safety extension (LTS) study (SHP647 -304; for subjects w ho do not fulfill the e ntry criteria for Study SHP647 -307). Subjects who withdraw early from the 16 -week treatment period or w ho do not wish to enter the maintenance study (SHP647 -307) or LTS study (SHP647 -304) will continue into a 16 -week safety follow -up period. Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -305 or SHP647 -306) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance study or LTS study. A planned interim analysis for the coprimary endpoints will take place after approximately the first 50% of all randomized subjects in both the SHP647 -305 and SHP647 -306 studies have either completed the studies or have prematurely withdrawn from the studies. The sample size will be reassessed as part of this interim a nalysis. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria: Subjects must meet all of the follow ing inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study. 1.Subjects and/or their parent or legally authorized representative must have an understanding, ability, and willingness to fully comply with study procedures and restrictions. 2.Subjects must be able to voluntarily provide w ritten, signed, and dated (personally or via a legally authorized representative) informed consent and assent as a pplicable to participate in the study.

The safety set will consist of all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of investigational product. The full- analysis set (FAS) will consist of all subjects in the randomized set who have received at least 1 dose of investigational product. The per- protocol set w ill consist of all subjects in the FAS who do not have protocol deviations that may affect the coprimary efficacy endpoints. The completer set will consist of all subjects in the FAS who have completed the Week 16 assessment for this study. Coprim ary efficacy endpoints: The coprimary efficacy endpoints are: Clinical remission at the Week 16 visit as defined by the follow ing: 2 -item PRO subscores of average worst daily abdominal pain ≤3 (based on 11 -point NRS) over the 7 most recent days and average daily stool frequency ≤2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the BSFS over the 7 most recent days. The 7 most recent days may or may not be contiguous during the 10 days of data collection before colonoscopy preparation, depending on days to be excluded because of missing data. If fewer than 7 days are available, the endpoint will be calculated on all available mo st recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5 days are available, the endpoint will be treated as missing. Endoscopic response at Week 16 as measured by a decrease in SES -CD of at least 25% from baseline. The coprimary efficacy endpoints, clinical remission at th e Week 16 visit and endoscopic response at the Week 16 visit, will each be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75 mg SHP647) to the placebo group using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test stratified by status of prior anti -TNF tr eatment, glucocorticoid use, and SES -CD at baseline for each of the stages of the study (stage 1 includes subjects whose primary efficacy data are used in the interim analysis and stage 2 includes all other subjects. Note: classification of stage 1 and stage 2 is based on the time of randomization rather than the time of study completion or termination). Subjects w ith missing data at the Week 16 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders . Weighted inverse normal p -value combination methods are used to combine the p -values from stage 1 and stage 2 through the following formula: C(p 1, p2) = 1 –Φ[w 1Φ-1(1-p1)+ w 2Φ-1(1-p2)] Where p 1, p2 are the p -values computed from the CMH chi -square test for each stage, w i2= n i/(n1 + n 2), n 1 and n 2are the preplanned stage -wise sample sizes that are fixed at the time of the interim analysis based on an original total sample size, and Φ denotes the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution (Bretz, et al., 2009a). Given that there is no possibility of stopping early for efficacy, that any potential stopping for futility of either or both doses of SHP647 is nonbinding, and that weights are prespecified, the test statistic C(p 1, p2) can be compared against the nominal alpha lev el to assess statistical significance (Chang, 2008). The coprimary endpoints will each be tested by the following hypothesis: H0: δ= 0 H1: δ≠ 0 Where δis the common treatment difference across strata. The common treatment difference is a weighted average of the stratum -specific treatment differences. For non-commercial use only"

To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz et al. (2009b) w ill be utilized to propagate α from the coprimary endpoints to the key secondary endpoints and betw een the 2 SHP647 treat ment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2- sided) for each of the pairw ise treatment comparisons for the coprimary endpoints (P) and alpha is propagated in a hierarchical manner to each of the 6 key secondary endpoints (K1 –K6) w ithin a pairwise treatment comparison. In order to pass alpha betw een the coprimary endpoints and the first key secondary endpoint, both coprimary endpoints must attain statistical significance . Key secondary efficacy endpoints: The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: Clinical remission at the Week 16 visit as measured by a CDAI score of <150. Enhanced endoscopic response at Week 16 as measured by a decrease in SES -CD of at least 50% from baseline. Clinical remission at the Week 16 visit as defined by the follow ing: 2 -item PRO subscores of average daily abdominal pain ≤1 (based on the 4 -point scale) over the 7 most recent days and average daily stool frequency ≤3 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the BS FS over the 7 most recent days. The 7 most recent days may or may not be contiguous during the 10 days of data collection before colonoscopy preparation, depending on days to be excluded because of missing data. If fewer than 7 days are available, the endp oint will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days.

BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing disease marked b y granulomatous inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although the terminal ileum and right colon are the most commonly involved sites, CD can affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the perianal region. Inflammation is ty pically transmural (full-thickness), segmental, and discontinuous, and symptoms are predominantly determined b y the part of bowel or organ involved. Patients typicall y present with symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, which may be persistent and lead to anemia, and weight loss due to pain on eating and malabsorption. As the disease progresses, extraintestinal manifestations and associated conditions can develop, including bowel obstruction, fistulas, and stenosis, as well as pai nful skin ulcerations, ey e pain, and arthritis. The incidence of CD is estimated to be up to 12.7 cases per 100,000 persons per year in Europe and up to 20.2 cases per 100,000 persons per year in North America. No clear difference in incidence has been obs erved between men and women. Although CD can occur at an y age, peak incidence has been observed in the second to fourth decades of life, with a second modest rise in incidence in the latter decades of life ( Molodeck y et al. , 2012). Crohn’s disease is a lifelong condition with a serious effect on quality of life. The traditional approach to therapy of CD has been the step -up approach usuall y represented as a p yramid where, progressing from mild to severe disease, therapeutic choices proceed step by step from less potent drugs at t he base of the p yramid to more potent but also more toxic drugs at the top. Current treatment primarily consists of s ymptomatic management with dietary modifications, 5-aminosalicy lic acid (5 -ASA), opiate anti diarrheal drugs (loperamide), s ystemic glucocor ticoids, immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine [AZA], 6- mercaptopurine [6- MP], methotrexate [MTX]), and biologic therap y with anti -tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or anti-integrin agents. Despite recent advances, there is still an unmet need for a safe, effec tive, and durable pharmacological treatment that will induce and maintain clinical remission. 1.2 Product Background and Clinical Information The selectivit y of l ymphocy te homing to specialized ly mphoid tissue and mucosal sites of the GI tract is influenced b ythe endothelial expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM). MAdCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin super family of cell adhesion molecules and is mostly expressed on the cell surface of high endothelial venules of organized intestin al lymphoid tissue such as Pey er’s patches and mesenteric ly mph nodes (Shyjan et al., 1996; Briskin et al., 1997 ; Liaskou et al., 2011). MAdCAM play s a role in gut immune surveilla nce, and also appears to facilitate excessive ly mphocy te infiltration under conditions of chronic GI inflammation. The α 4β7integrin is the recognized ligand for MAdCAM, and expression of this ligand on populations of CD4+and CD8+T cells, as well as on subsets of Bcells, distinguishes them as unique gut homing lymphocy tes.

SHP647 binds MAdCAM with high affinit y and selectivity that prevents the binding of α 4β7+lymphocy tes to MAdCAM expressing sites in the high endothelial venules of the GI tract. 1.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment SHP647 has been evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies in subjects with CD and UC. In Study A7281006 in subjects with CD, induction treatment with SHP647 did not meet the primary endpoint; no statistically significant differences were observed between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm in CD Activity Index ( CDAI )-70 response rate at Week 8 or Week 12. Post hoc analyses did suggest evidence of drug effect in subjects with a higher inflammat ory state at baseline (as indicated by higher serum CRP concent rations or higher endoscopic disease activity as measured b y SES-CD). In Study A7281009 in subjects with UC, induction treatment with SHP647 at doses of 7.5 mg, 22.5 mg, or 75 mg every 4 weeks resulted in significantl y higher proportions of subjects in rem ission at Week 12 based on total May o score (both local and central read) when compared with placebo treatment. In the induction study A7281006 in subjects with CD, compared to placebo, nominally statistically significant decreases were observed in the 75 mg group at Week 8 and in the 22.5 mg and 75 mg groups at Week 12. Generall y, decreases from baseline in hsCRP were observed in all 3 active treatment groups (7.5 mg, 22.5 mg,and 75 mg)over the 12 -week induction period. Compared to placebo, nominall y statistically significant decreased in hsCRP were observed in all 3 active treatment groups at Week 12. There was no evidence of a dose response for either of these parameters. A nominally statistically significant increase was observed in circulating β7 + central memory T lymphocytes at Week 8 and Week 12, consistent with the predicted mechanism of action. In the UC induction study , A7281009, decreases in fecal calprotectin were observed in all groups, including placebo; however, there were no nominally statistically significant differences in the decrease in fecal calprotectin between an y dose level of SHP647 and placebo. Decreases in hsC RP were also observed in all 4 treatment groups; however, other than the 75 mg dose group at Week 12, no nominally signi ficant differences were observed in active treatment vs placebo . The most common SAEs across all studies were CD and UC. In Study A7281006, the randomized, placebo -controlled induction study in CD, treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs )were most common ly reported within the GI disorders sy stem organ class ( SOC ) followed b y the infections and infestations SOC. The most common all -causality TEAEs were CD (worsening and progression of underl ying disease), followed by pyrexia, headache, and arthralgia, all of which had similar incidences in the placebo treatment group when compared with the active treatment groups. In Study A7281009, the randomized, placebo -controlled induction study in UC, TEAEs were most commonly reported within the GI disorders SOC follow ed by the infections and infestations SOC. The most common all -causality TEAE was headache, followed b y abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, UC (worsening and progression of underly ing disease), and nausea, all with similar incidence between placebo- and drug -treated subjects.

In S tudy A7281007, the most common all -causalit y TEAE was CD (worsening or progression), arthralgia, nasopharyngitis, and abdominal pain. In Study A7281010, the most common all -causality TEAEs have been UC (worsening or progression), arthralgia, and nasophary ngitis. SHP647 appears to be generall y well tolerated, with the majority of TEAEs distributed at similar frequencies among treatment arms with only peripheral edema, gastroenteritis, and arthralgia more frequently reported in SHP647 -than placebo -treated subjects in the pooled induction studies. I n the placebo -controlled induction studies, nasophary ngitis was not reported more frequentl y in SHP647 -than placebo -treated subjects, but occurred at relatively high frequency during long -term safet y studies. SHP647 does not appear to be associated with impaired central nervous s ystem ( CNS ) immune surveillance. No case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y (PML )or my ocarditis has been reported. SHP647, in doses of 7.5 mg, 22.5 mg, and 75 mg, appears to increase the rate of remission in subjects with UC, and may have an effect in patients with CD who have greater evidence of inflammation based on biomarker or endoscopic data.

STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 2.1 Rationale for the Study SHP647, a fully human IgG 2κantihuman MAdCAM monoclonal antibody , is under development for the treatment of CD. SHP647 prevents the binding of 47+lymphocy tes to MAdCAM -expressing sites with high affinity and selectivity . Principal sites of MAdCAM expression on normal tissue include intestine, pancreas, stom ach, esophagus, spleen, and to a lesser extent lung, liver, and bladder but not the CNS ( Steffen et al., 1996 ). Although selective targeting of the MAdCAM receptors is a novel approach, the basic interference of l ymphocyte homing by preventing the binding of these 47+lymphocy tes to the MAdCAM receptor and the resultant efficacy in CD is well established ( Sandborn et al., 2013 ). SHP647 is differentiated from other molecules targeting the 47-MAdCAM mediat ed lymphocy te trafficking used for the treatment of CD in that SHP647 blocks the interaction of 47+lymphocy tes with the MAdCAM receptor by selectivel y binding to MAdCAM on the endothelial cells surface in the gut (and related tissues) while the other mo lecules target the integrins on the infiltrating l ymphocy tes. Additionally , SHP647 does not bind to the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM); therefore, SHP647 is not expected to affect lymphocyte homing or surveillance in the CNS or to be an effective t reatment for multiple sclerosis. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subjects with moderate to severe CD. The CD clinical development program includes 3 completed st udies: 1 Phase 1 study (A7281008) and 2 Phase 2 studies (A7281006 and A7281007). Study A7281006 (OPERA) was a parallel, dose -ranging, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study in which SHP647 was given as 3 subcutaneous (SC) dose levels (22.5 mg, 75mg, and 225 mg) once every 4 weeks (Q4W) over an 8- week period. SHP647 was generall y safe and well tolerated and there were no deaths. Three placebo -treated subjects and 9 subjects in the 22.5 mg, 75mg, and 225 mg SHP647 groups discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity . Median serum concentrations of SHP647 increased with increasing dose. Positive antidrug antibodies (ADA) status did not appear to impact exposure to SHP647. The CDAI was the primary instrument to assess the efficacy of SHP647; no statistically significant differences were noted between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm. Therefore, the stud y did not meet its primary endpoint. However, post hoc anal ysis indicated increased remission rates in subjects in the 22.5 mg or 75 mg treatment arms who had higher serum concentrations of high- sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) or higher scores of Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES- CD) at baseline. Study A7281008 (TOSCA) was an ope n-label multi- center, Phase 1 sequential cohort study that evaluated the effects of a maximum induction dose of SHP647 on CNS sy stem immune surveillance.

The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline (pretreatment) in absolute ly mphocy te count in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in subjects with IBD after receiving 3doses of 225 mg SHP647. The mean percentage change from baseline in absolute lymphocy tes in CSF was 61.76% with a median change of 35.2% (range: - 70.2% to 267.8%). The post-treatment L P/pretreatment L P geometric mean ratio for CSF l ymphocy tes was 1.33 with the lower bound of the 80% confidence interval (CI)=1.13, which was greater than 0.5, supporting rejection of the null h ypothesis (ie, that the percent decrease in total lymphocytes counts after treatment would be ≥50% (equivalent to the geometric mean ratio in total ly mphocy te counts being ≤0.5). This result supports the hypothe sis that SHP647 does not impair trafficking of lymphocy tes into the CNS and thus should not impair CNS immune surveillance. Study A7281007 (OPERA II) was a Phase 2 open -label extension study to provide additional long-term safet y data on subjects with mode rate to severe CD who completed Study A7281006 or Study A7281008 and wished to continue to receive SHP647. SHP647 75 mg (with potential dose escalation to 225 mg) SC given every 4 weeks for 72 weeks was generall y well tolerated in subjects with CD over the treatment period evaluated in this study . In subjects with positive ADA or neutralizing antibody (NAb) status, exposure to SHP647 was not affected. Serum concentrations of SHP647 in this study were consistent with what was predicted based on the Feeder St udy A7281006. There were 2 deaths in the study : 1 subject died of multiple organ dysfunction sy ndromes in the treatment period and 1 subject died of metastatic neoplasm in the follow -up period. Neither death was reported as related to treatment with the st udy drug b y the investigators. The most frequentl y reported SAE was CD in either the treatment period or the follow -up period. The s ystem organ class with the most subjects experiencing TEAEs was GI disorders. Although Study A7281007 was not placebo contro lled, the exploratory efficacy results (based on the modified Harvey Bradshaw Index) indicated that the effect of SHP647 on disease activity was maintained over the duration of treatment . The SHP647 dose selection (25 mgand 75 mg) for this study is based on data from these 3previous studies, which evaluated the activity of SHP647 in adult patients with moderatel y to severel y active CD based on CDAI scores between 220 and 450. The results of a post hoc analysis of remission rate by baseline elevated serum concentration of hsCRP suggested that the greatest treatment effect was at a dose of 22.5 mg. Similarly , post hoc analy sis of remission rates by endoscopic severity assessed using the SES -CD suggested best efficacy at a dose of 75 mg. Therefore, both dosag e regimens 25 mgand 75 mg Q4W have been selected for the Phase 3 testing . The Phase 1 study (A7281008, TOSCA) and Phase 2 studies (A7281006, OPERA; and A7281007, OPERA II [long -term safety study ])that investigated the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacod ynamic properties of SHP647 support further clinical development of SHP647 using SC administration in subjects with moderate to severe CD.

STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Study Design and Flow Chart This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of SHP647 in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subjects with moderate to severe CD. At st udy initiation, a total of 1032 subjects ( 387 subjects in the 25 mg SHP647 treatment group, 387 subjects in the 75 mg SHP647 treatment group, and 258 subjects in the placebo group ) are planned for enrollment into the study (Figure 1). Subjects must be at l east 16 years of age and no more than 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form. The study consists of a screening period up to 6 weeks and a 16- week treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments (25mgSHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or placebo) in a 3:3:2 ratio. Randomization will be stratified based upon the subject’s status of prior anti -TNF treatment (naïve or experienced), glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocort icoids at baseline versus not on glucocorticoids at baseline), and SES -CD at baseline (SES -CD≥17 or SES -CD <17). Subjects will receive SCinjections of SHP647 or placebo, using a prefilled sy ringe (PFS), on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4(Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and Week 12 (Visit 6). Subjects will undergo efficacy , , , safet y, and health outcome assessments at these visits and at the time points specified in Table 1. At the end of the 16 -week treatment period, subjects wil l be offered the opportunity to participate in either a double -blind maintenance study (SHP647 -307; for subjects who fulfill the entry criteria) or a long- term safety extension (L TS) study (SHP647 -304; for subjects who do not fulfill the entry criteria for Study SHP647- 307) as shown in Figure 1. Subjects who withdraw early from the 16 -week treatment period or who do not wish to enter the maintenan ce study (SHP647 -307) or LTS study (SHP647- 304) will continue into a 16- week safet y follow-up period. Onl y those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -305 or SHP647 -306) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance stud y or LT S study . A planned interim anal ysis for the coprimary endpoints will take place after approximately the first 50% of all randomized subjects in both the SHP647- 305 and SHP647 -306 studies have either completed the studies or have prematurely withdrawn from the studies.

Rationale for Abdominal Pain Severity Abdominal pain is one of the most common sy mpto ms of CD, with the cause likely to be multifactorial. In the CDAI, which was the most commonly used primary endpoint in CD studies in the past, the degree of abdominal pain was based on a 4 -point scale, with scores ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Howe ver, the new standard is to use the 11 -point numerical rating scale (NRS) instead for the degree of abdominal pain. The limitation is that the 4 -point and the 11-point scales are not directl y comparable. Numerous studies across a variety of conditions have examined cutoff scores for mild, moderate, and severe pain based on the 11 -point pain NRS, with the findings across studies generally converging on a cutoff score of 4 (reflecting the maximum score indicating mild pain) and a score of 5 (reflecting the mi nimum score indicating moderate pain). To ensure that clinical remission criteria for abdominal pain are both clinicall y meaningful and fall definitively within the mild pain range on the NRS based on the literature, a remission subscore of ≤3 (a minimum i mprovement of at least 2 points is required for subjects who enter the stud y with moderate abdominal pain [subscore of ≥5]) will be used as part of the coprimary endpoints.

178,page_178,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 42 SHP647 -305 Protocol Amendment 1 SHP647 21Aug 2018 This definition isfurther supported byastudy conducted inasimilar condition (i rritable bowel syndrome) that examined the minimal clinically important difference on the 11 -point NRS for abdominal pain ( Spiegel et al., 2009 ) as well as post hoc anal yses of the Phase 2 data from the SHP647 program (Study A7281006, OPERA). Rationale for Very Soft Stool/L iquid Stool Frequency Diarrhea is the most common sign in the presentation of CD, affecting approximately 85% of patients with a diagnosis of CD. In the CDAI, the number o f liquid or soft stools (each day for 7days) is used with a multiplier of 2. The coprimary endpoints for clinical remission in studies SHP647 -305 and SHP647 -306 requires the use of a definition without any such multiply ing factor and will use the BSFS for defining the very soft or liquid stools according to t ypes 6 and 7, respectivel y. A retrospective study of PROs in CD based on data from randomized controlled studies using rifaximin and methotrexate showed that a mean dail y stool frequency score of ≤1.5 had an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of 0.79 ( Khanna et al., 2015 ) and provided a potential cutoff for defining remission as measured b y CDAI. In a recent study to select the attributes determining overall disease severity and to rank the importa nce of and to score these individual attributes for both CD and UC based on specialist opinion, a sample of at least 10 loose stools per week was considered as an attribute contributing to overall disease severit y in CD ( Siegel et al., 2016 ). Based on post hoc anal yses of the Phase 2 data in the SHP647 program (Study A7281006, OPERA) and by choosing the population of subjects satisfy ing the moderate to severe CD inclusion criteria, various cutoffs were explored and a stool frequency ≤2.0 was fo und to be optimal in terms of treatment separation while still allowing for a reasonable threshold for remission. Based on these and other recent data that support this cutoff, an average dail y stool frequency ≤2 of ty pe 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools ) has been chosen as the stool frequency criterion for clinical remission. Endoscopic Response Endoscopic response is defined in 2 ways: 25% reduction in SES -CD score (“endoscopic response”) 50% reduction in SES -CD score (“enhanced endoscopic response”). “Endoscopic response” will be used as a coprimary endpoint and “enhanced endoscopic response” will be used as a key secondary endpoint in this study as these magnitudes of changes are likel y to be clinically relevant. In the recent trial with upadacitinib, the magnitude of difference between the different doses of the active drug and placebo at Week 16 was reported to be 9-36% for endoscopic response and 10 -20% for enhanced endoscopic response ( Sandborn et al., 2017 ). In the post hoc anal ysis of the Phase 2 OPERA study with SHP647 the magnitude of difference between the active treatment arms and placebo showed a similar pattern (higher for the endoscopic response than for enhanced endoscopic response) ( D'Haens et al., 2018 ). Mucosal healing or “endoscopic healing” is considered to be a pivotal long -term target in the treatment of C D; however, partial healing or endoscopic response may also provide benefits. Endoscopic response can be an important indicator that the mucosal inflammation has decreased as an effect of the investigational product. For non-commercial use only"

Median duration of remission after 1 year treatment with infliximab was similar in subjects achieving complete absence of mucosal ulcer to subjects who achieved significant but incomplete mucosal healing ( D'Haens et al., 2002). Thebenefitofendoscopic response wasalsoshown in theSONI Cstudy ;the presence of endoscopic response (defined in that study as at least a 50% decrease in endoscopic score at Week 26 of treatment) identified subjects most likely to be in corticosteroid -free c linical remission at Week 50 (Ferrante et al., 2013 ). The proportion of patients requiring major abdominal surgery in a single -center cohort stud y with infliximab was similar with complete healing or with partial healing. ( Schnitzler et al., 2009; Panaccione et al., 2013). Subjects with such a treatment response should be identified by endoscopic assessment in order not to misclassify them as nonresponders and underestimate the response to the treatment. 3.1.2 Rationale for Key Secondary Endpoints Clinical Remission Defined by CDAI Score Conventional ly, a CDAI score of <150 has been used to define clinical remission. While there has been widespread use of the CDAI over a long period of time, the items do not contribute equally to the score, and sy mptom items reported by subjects are not specific for C D and are not sensitive for inflammation seen at colonoscop y. There has been movement away from using the CDAI by regulatory authorities to the use of PROs and objective measures of disease such as endoscop y (Williet et al., 2014 ). Howeve r, for benchmarking or for comparative effectiveness purposes, CDAI endpoints are expected to be used. Although this has been the established gold -standard for clinical remission to date, CDAI suffers from requiring complex calculations across 8 individual items including subjective elements. Clinical Remission Defined by Average Daily Abdominal Pain ≤1 (Based on the 4- point Scale) and Average Daily Stool Frequency ≤3 of Ty pe 6/7 The CDAI has been the traditionally used measure to assess clinical response a nd clinical remission in CD. I n the CDAI , the degree of abdominal pain is one of 8 variables and is used with a multiplier of 5 in the overall score. Importantly , it is based on a 4 -point scale, with scores ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). With the shi ft to the new endpoint as evident from the coprimary endpoint of clinical remission in this study , it is still important to allow for a frame of reference to the existing standard for response, based on the CDAI components. A daily average abdominal pain t hreshold of ≤1 will help achieve this as 1 on the 4- point scale corresponds to mild abdominal pain. Although direct mapping between the scales has not been established, this will approximate to a score of 3 on the 11 -point NRS scale, as this falls within t he mild pain range on the NRS based on the literature. Based on post hoc anal yses of the Phase 2 data in the SHP647 program, regulatory requirements, and treatment separation assumptions, a threshold for the average dail y stool frequency ≤2of type 6/7 (ve ry soft stools/liquid stools) was chosen for the coprimary endpoint of clinical remission. For non-commercial use only"
180,page_180,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 44 SHP647 -305 Protocol Am endment 1 SHP647 21Aug 2018 However, given thelimited data available forthisendpoint, recent evidence from literature suggesting that thresholds ≤3 are likel y to be quite stringent ( Sandborn et al., 2017 ), and the refractory nature of the disease in those with moderate to severe CD, it is also important to assess the effects of treatment using a more realistic measure. Hence, for this key secondary endpoint of clinical remission, average daily stool frequency ≤3 of ty pe 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) has been chosen as the appropriate thre shold. Clinical Response The goal of measuring clinical remission is to have a sensitive clinical measure to assess the complete absence of s ymptoms or the stabilization of noninflammatory symptoms. However, as response and remission are considered to be o n a continuum of improvement or response to treatment, clinical remission is generall y the chosen measurement over clinical response. Therefore, clinical remission is used as coprimary endpoint and clinical response is used as a keysecondary endpoint in t his study . Clinical response is defined in Section 9.8.2.1. For both clinical response criteria, an additional requirement is that the s ymptom not being used to assess clinical response (ie, abdominal pain severit y or very soft stool/liquid stool frequency ) must remain unchanged/not worsen from the baseline score, or meet the criteria for clinical remission for that item of the 2 -item PRO (either a 2-item PRO subscore of average dail y stool frequency ≤2 of t ype 6/7 [very soft stools/liquid stools] as shown in the BSFS or average worst daily abdominal pain ≤3 [based on 11- point NRS] over the 7 most recent day s). The rationale for needing to meet at a minimum clinical response definition for either abdominal pain severit y or very soft stool/liquid stool freque ncy (and not necessarily both) is based on the supposition that a lack of improvement in 1 of these sy mptoms is not necessarily an indicator of eventual lack of response (as assessed b y the stricter clinical remission criterion). Based on Phase 2 data, it has been observed that the magnitude of placebo response rate can be higher for abdominal pain than for stool frequency . Therefore, the additional criterion of at least a 2- point decrease in abdominal pain severity from baseline is required for assessing c linical response for abdominal pain. Overall, the definition of clinical response used for this study has been chosen to allow for the maximal pool of subjects to be assessed for the effect of treatment and, if appropriate, the continuation of therap y in t he maintenance stud y (SHP647 -307). Composite Score Endpoint of Both Clinical Remission by 2-item PRO and Endoscopic Response at Week 16 In theory , as the degree of inflammation decreases due to the effect of treatment, both clinical signs and s ymptoms of C D as well as endoscopic appearance can improve. However, in any given subject, the rates of clinical improvement and endoscopic improvement may not be the same. There are reasons for this discrepancy when evaluating clinical and endoscopic improvement in t he same time period, including clinical sy mptoms not being well correlated to the mucosal inflammation. Due to the transmural feature of the disease, s ymptoms can correspond to the inflammation in some of the other gut lay ers as well. Previous clinical stu dies and clinical observations indicate that the improvement of clinical signs and sy mptoms and the improvement in endoscopic appearance may not go hand in hand.

181,page_181,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 45 SHP647 -305 Protocol Amendment 1 SHP647 21Aug 2018 Significant clinical improvement can precede significant endoscopic improvement. The healing process of the gut mucosa may take a long time and may depend on the baseline severit y of the endoscopic appearance, which may not be in line with the actual baseline severit y of the symptoms. Therefore, when evaluating clinical remission together with endo scopic endpoints, improvement in endoscopic scores could be more relevant than evaluating mucosal healing in the induction phase. For these reasons, thekeysecondary composite endpoint (which takes into account both clinical and endoscopic response to treatment in the same subject) consists of the evaluation of the clinical remission together with the endoscopic response. Complete Endoscopic Healing Endoscopic healing will be defined in 2 way s: Endoscopic healing defined by SES -CD ≤4 and at least a 2-point reduction versus baseline (Visit 2) and no subscore >1 in an y individual variable Complete endoscopic healing defined b y SES -CD=0 -2. There is no uniforml y accepted definition for endoscopic healing in CD and several different terminologies are used to describe the same endoscopic appearance defined by a certain endoscopic score (eg, endoscopic remission and mucosal healing). Endoscopic healing or mucosal healing is predominantly defined b y the absence of mucosal ulcerations in CD during endoscopic asses sment of intestinal inflammation ( Atrey a and Neurath, 2017 ). The International Organization for the study of Inflammatory Bowe l Disease technical review on endoscopic indices for CD clinical studies defined complete endoscopic healing as SES -CD=0 -2 (Vuitton et al., 2016 ). Some studies introduced SES -CD≤4 as “endoscopic remission”. The more stringent endpoint of “complete endoscopic healing” will be used as a key secondary endpoint in this study . Even in case of complete endoscopic healing, there may still be ongoing histological activity in man y cases and it may not always reflect healing of all layers of the tissue, as endoscop y onl y addresses muco sal rather than transmural healing (Atrey a and Neurath, 2017 ). The importance of inducing endoscopic healing is that it may beassociated with long -term symptomatic remission; longer relapse -free interval; reduced frequency of hospitalizations, complications, and surgical resections; and the potential for a significant improvement in quality of life ( Peyrin-Biroulet et al., 2011 ). 3.2 Duration and Study Completion Definition Each subject’s final visit in this study may be at the end of the treatment period (Week 16), if continuing to Study SHP647 -307 or SHP647 -304, or at the end of the safety follow -up period (Week 32), if not continuing to either of these studies.

INVESTIGATIONAL PROD UCT 6.1 Identity of Investigational Product The test product is SHP647 (a full y human IgG 2kantihuman MAdCAM monoclonal antibody ), which will be provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution for SC administration in a glass PFS with a fixed needle. Each PFS contains 1 mL of SHP647 solution for injection at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 mgor 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current SHP647 IB. The reference product is placebo, which will be provided in a PFS with a fixed needle containing 1mL of placebo solution for SC administration. The placebo solution will contain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain SHP647. 6.1.1 Blinding the T reatment Assignment The placebo s yringes and solution will match the SHP647 sy ringes in appearance. The fill volume for all sy ringes will be the same. 6.2 Administration of Investigational Products 6.2.1 Interactive Response Technology for Investigational Product Management An interactive response technology (IRT) s ystem will be used for screening and enrolling subjects, recording subject visits, randomization, investigational product supply dispensation and management, inventory management and suppl y ordering, inv estigational product expiration tracking and management, and emergency unblinding. Please refer to the Study Manual for additional details regarding the IRT s ystem. 6.2.2 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled stud y. The a ctual treatment given to individual subjects is determined by a randomization schedule. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 3:3:2 via a computer -generated randomization schedule to receive SC injections of 25 mg SHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or plac ebo, respectivel y. The randomization will be performed centrall y and stratified by status of prior anti -TNF therap y (2 strata: naïve versus experienced), glucocorticoid use at baseline (2 strata: on glucocorticoids at baseline versus not on glucocorticoids at baseline), and SES-CD at baseline (2 strata: SES-CD≥17 at baseline versus SES -CD <17 at baseline). To ensure that the allocation of subjects with prior anti- TNF therap y exposure is similar to that observed in previous studies, the percentage of subjec ts with prior exposure to treatment with anti-TNF therap y exposure will be capped at 60% of the sample population. There will be no cap on the number of anti- TNF naïve subjects randomized. Subject numbers are assigned to all eligible subjects as they conse nt to take part in the study . Within each site (numbered uniquely within a protocol), the subject number will be assigned to subjects according to the sequence of presentation for study participation.

Individual subject treatment will be automatically assigned by the IRT sy stem. Investigational product packaging identification numbers, separate from ran domization numbers/unique identifiers, may also be assigned to subjects for specific treatment assignment as dictated b y the study. In these cases, the same investigational product packing identification number may not be assigned to more than 1 subject. 6.2.3 D osing Investigational product (SHP647 or placebo) will be administered subcutaneously by qualified site personnel Q4W (Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12). See Section 7.2for the timing of dosing relative to other procedures. Investigational product should be administ ered in the anterolateral right or left thigh. If there are clinical reasons wh y the investigational product cannot be administered in the thigh, the investigational product may be administered in the deltoid area or abdomen with appropriate documentation. The location of the investigational product administration will be recorded. After the first administration of investigational product, the subject must be observed b y a member of the stud y staff for at least 30 minutes (the total duration should be deter mined at the discretion of the investigator). For subsequent administrations, observation of the subject is at the discretion of the investigator. Injection site and allergic reaction monitoring should be completed by a member of the study staff. Investiga tor-directed delay s in dosing due to abnormal laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the subject should continue with the treatment. Onl y those subjects who complete the full course of investigational p roduct treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -305 or SHP647 -306) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance stud y or LT S study . The investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all investigational product is dispe nsed by qualified staff members. 6.2.4 Unblinding the Treatment Assignment Whenever possible, the investigator or subinvestigator should contact the Shire phy sician and/or assigned medical monitor before breaking the blind. I t is understood that in an emergency situation it may not be possible to communicate with the study team before breaking the blind. The safet y of the subject should be of primary concern. When the blinding code is broken the reasons must be full y documented. In the event that the treatment assignment is broken, the date, the signature of the person who broke the code, and the reason for breaking the code are recorded on the IRT and the source documents. Upon breaking the blind, the subject is withdrawn from the study , but should be followed up for safet y purposes. The IRT will notify the relevant personnel in the event of an y code break. Code -break information is held by the pharmacist/designated person at the site. For non-commercial use only"

Additional labels may be applied in order to meet local or institutional requirements, but must not: Contradict the clinical study label Obscure the clinical study label Identify the study subject by name. Additional labels may not be added without the sponsor’s prior written agreement. 6.3.2 Packaging Investigational product is packaged in the following labeled containers: PFS with nominal fill volume of 1 mL. The PFS will be pa ckaged in a labeled carton. Changes to sponsor -supplied packaging before dosing may not occur without prior written agreement by the sponsor . 6.3.3 Storage The investigator has overall responsibility for ensuring that investigational product is stored in a secur e, limited -access location. L imited responsibility may be delegated to the pharmacy or member of the stud y team, but this delegation must be documented. Investigational products are distributed by the pharmacy or delegated member of the study team. The pha rmacist or delegated team member will enter the unique subject identifier on the investigational product labels as they are distributed. Investigational product must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions. Temperature monitoring is require d at the storage location to ensure that the investigational product is maintained within an established temperature range. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study and that records are maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously by using either an in-house sy stem, a mechanical recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or by manual means, such that both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a speci fic time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. Such a device (ie, certified minimum/maximum thermometer) would require manual resetting upon each recording.

STUDY PROCEDURES 7.1 Study Schedule The investigator may schedule visits (unplanned visits) in addition to those listed on the schedule of assessments ( Table 1), in order to conduct evaluations or assessments required to protect the wellbeing of the sub ject. 7.1.1 Screening Period 7.1.1.1 Screening Visit (Visit 1) Subjects will be screened within 6 weeks before the first dose of investigational product to determine eligibility to participate in the study and to perform the other assessments and procedures specified in Table 1. Each subject or subject’s parent or legall y authorized representative must participate in the informed consent process and provide written informed consent/assent before any assessments or procedures specified in the protocol are performed. Scree ning assessments will take place over more than 1 day (at least 2 visits will be necessary to complete the screening evaluations, including colonoscopy ). A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent or assent, as applicable (and whose paren ts or legally authorized representatives have given informed consent, as applicable), failed to meet the inclusion criteria and/or met at least one of the exclusion criteria, and has not been randomized or administered investigational product. A subject ma y be rescreened if their condition has changed and they may potentially be eligible. Subjects may be rescreened 1 time only . Note: Screening laboratory tests, if considered b y the investigator to be transient and inconsistent with the subject’s clinical co ndition, may be repeated once during the screening period for confirmation. Results of repeated tests must be reviewed for eligibility before the screening colonoscop y procedure. Hematology samples should be repeated if more than 3 weeks have elapsed befor e the day of colonoscop y to be able to use the hematocrit central laboratory results for the CDAI score calculation at screening. Hematocrit must not be older than 3 weeks before the day of colonoscop y. Collection of the daily e-diary data must begin at le ast 10 days before colonoscopy preparation. Colonoscopy preparation will be according to local routine. Colonoscopy must be performed on all subjects after the majorit y of other eligibility criteria (eg,laboratory values and 2 -item PRO and CDAI scores) ar e met. It must be performed during the screening period within 5 to7days before baseline (Visit 2), to allow for adequate e -diary data collection for the 2 -item PRO and CDAI scores and to obtain the centrally read endoscopic subscore to verify the subjec t’s eligibility (Section 7.2.2.4). If the calculated CDAI scores is <220 or >450, the subject will be considered a screen failure and should not proceed with the colonoscop y preparation and/or the colonoscop y. All colonoscopies will be evaluated using the SES-CD ( Appendix 2 ). For non-commercial use only"

The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1will be performed. After eligibility has been reconfirmed and all baseline procedures and assessments have been completed, each subject will be randomized to receive 1 of the 3 treatments as described in Section 6.2.2 and the first dose of investigational product will be administered. Results of the baseline labo ratory tests are not required for investigational product administration but must be reviewed as soon as possible thereafter. 7.1.2 Treatment Period 7.1.2.1 Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 are scheduled to take place on Day 14±3days(Week 2), Day 28±3days (Week 4), Day 56 ±3 days (Week 8), and Day 84±3days (Week 12), respectivel y. The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1will be performed. 7.1.2.2 Final On -treatment Visit: Visit 7, Parts 1, 2, and 3 (Week 16/Early Termination) The Week 16/ET visit (Visit 7) consists of 3 parts. Part 1 of Visit 7 should be scheduled 1 to 3 day(s) before Part 2; this will allow for blood samples to be taken before starting the colonoscopy preparation and before the colonoscop y procedure at Part 2of the visit. The Week 16/ET assessments and procedures that will take place during Part 1 are specified in Table 1. Part2 of Visit 7 should be scheduled preferabl y within 5 to 7 day s before Part 3; this will allow sufficient time to obtain the data from the centrally read colonoscopy . The Week 16/ET assessments and procedures that will take place during Part 2 are specified in Table 1. Part3 of Visit 7 will take place on Day 112±3days. The Week 16/ET assessments and procedures that will take place dur ing Part 3 are specified in Table 1. At Part 3 of Visit 7, after review of CD assessments, health outcome assessments, and safet y assessments, it will be determined whether the subject should enroll in the maintenance (SHP647 -307) or LTS (SHP647 -304) studi es or enter the follow -up period of this study . Entry into the maintenance or LTS studies is dependent upon whether the subject fulfills the efficacy entry criteria of the maintenance study (SHP647 -307), including achieving endoscopic and/or clinical respo nse, and whether the subject agrees to participate.

During the safety follow -up period, the Week 24 visit (Visit 8) will take place on Day 168±7days, or 8 weeks ±7days after the subject’s last visit in the treatment period for subjects who are withdrawn earl y from the study. This visit will routinely be conducted b y telephone; however, as an exception, the visit can be performed as a study site visit if preferred. At the end of the safet y follow -up period, there will be a visit at the site on Day 224±7days, or 16weeks ±7days after the subject’s last visit in the treatment period for subjects who are withdrawn earl y from the study; this visit will form the Week 32 vi sit (Visit 9). The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1will be performed, including query ing for SAEs, AEs, and concomitant medications and treatments. All AEs and SAEs that are not resolved at the time of this visit will be followed to closure (Section 8.1). Subjects who are proceeding to the maintenance or L TS studies will not enter the safety follow -up period. 7.1.4 Additional Care of Subjects after the Study No aftercare is planned for this study . 7.2 Study Evaluations and Procedures Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside the control of the investigator, which may make it unfeasible to perform the tests and procedures. In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safet y and wellbeing of the subject.

Subjects will enter data on CD signs and s ymptoms items using the e- diary , which will be provided to subjects at the start of the stud y. Compliance will be assessed by site staff at each visit. The site staff willinstruct the subj ect on the appropriate use of the e -diary when compliance is below 80% (eg, <23 out of 28 e-diary entries) . If 70% compliance cannot be achieved after repeated instructions during the screening period, noncompliant subjects will be automatically noneligibl e as they will not fulfill inclusion criterion 1 (Section 4.1). Subjects will be asked to record the following signs and sy mptom data, as experienced over the previous 24 hours, in the e -diary : Abdominal pain severit y (NRS) Very soft stool/liquid stool frequency (as shown by BSFS ty pe 6/7) Total stool frequency Rectal bleeding frequency Rectal urgency frequency Nausea severit y Vomiting frequency Incontinence frequency Abdominal pain used in CDAI General wellbeing. The first 2 items (abdominal pain severit y and very soft stool/liquid stool frequency) will be used to calculate the 2 -item PRO. The 2 -item PRO will be calculated using the following criteria: Screening: the 2 -item PRO will be calculated based on the 7 most recent day s during the 10days of data collection before the colonoscopy preparation. If 7 out of the 10 most recent day s are not available, then the 2-item PRO cannot be calculated for the subject at screening. Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6: the 2 -item PRO will be calculat ed based on the 7 most recent day s during the 10 days of data collection before the visit. I f fewer than 7 days are available, the 2-item PRO will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5days are available, the 2 -item PRO wi ll be treated as missing.

For all 2 -item PRO calculations, the 7 most recent day s may or may not be contiguous during the 10days of data collection depending on day s to be excluded because of missing data. ThePRO -CD daily e-diary is presented in Appendix 2 . 7.2.2.2 Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease The SES -CD will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1. The SES -CD score at baseline (Visit 2) and at Week 16/ET will be calculated using subscores of each of the segments investigated and centrally read from the colonoscopies performed at screening (Visit 1, Part 2) and Week 16 (Visit 7, Part 2), respectivel y. The SES -CD is a simple scoring s ystem based on 4 endoscopic variables (presence and size of ulcers, proportion of surface covered b y ulcers, proportion of affected surface, and presence and severit y of stenosis [narrowing]) measured in the same 5 ileocolonic segments as the CD index of severit y. Ove rall, values on the SES -CD range from 0 to 56, with higher values indicating more severe disease. The 4 endoscopic variables are scored from 0 to 3 in each bowel segment (ileum, right/transverse/left colon, and rectum): Presence and size of ulcers (none =score 0; diameter 0.1 –0.5 cm=score 1; 0.5–2 cm=score 2; diameter >2 cm= score 3) Extent of ulcerated surface (none = 0; <10% =1; 10% –30% = 2; >30% = 3); extent of affected surface (none = 0; <50% =1; 50% –75% = 2; >75% =3) Presence and t ype of narro wings (none = 0; single, can be passed =1; multiple, canbepassed =2; cannot be passed = 3). A complete colonoscop y is required (including visualization of the terminal ileum). Themaximum stenosis score in a segment distal to another evaluable segment cannot exceed 2, so that the stenosis scores cannot exceed a total of 11 ( Reinisch et al., 2017 ). Evidence of active inflammation and ulceration is required at screening (Visit 1), in the form o f a centrall y read score of at least 1 in one or more ileocolonic segments in the Presence of Ulcers component of the SES -CD, as well as a total score of >6. Study videos will be scored separatel y by 2 central readers who are blinded to the treatment. Ift he central readers’ scores are not in agreement, there will be a third adjudication read to select the correct read from the first 2 scores. Results of the central reading of the videos will be communicated to sites within 5 business day s. For the evaluati on of efficacy , in cases where 1 or 2 segments cannot be fully evaluated b y central endoscopic readers, ileocolonic segments that are evaluable during screening (Visit 1) and Week 16/ET (matching segments approach) will be utilized.

The CDAI score at screening (Visit 1, Part 2) will be calculated using the following: Comp onents 1 to 3 from subject -reported PRO -CD daily e-diary data collected >10days before the start of colonoscopy preparation using the same most recent 7 of 10 day s as described for the 2 -item PRO (Section 7.2.2.1 ) and Components 4 to 8 (weight, medical an d physical examination, use of diarrhea treatment, and hematocrit value) collected during screening (Visit 1) Part 1. Note: Hematology samples should be repeated if more than 3 weeks have elapsed before the day of colonoscop y to be able to use the hematocr it central laboratory results for the CDAI score calculation at screening. Hematocrit must not be older than 3 weeks before the day of colonoscop y. The CDAI scores at Visits 4, 5, and 6 will be calculated using the following: Components 1 to 3 from subject -reported PRO -CD daily e-diary data collected >10days before the visit using the same most recent 7 or 10 day s as described for the 2 -item PRO (Section 7.2.2.1 ) and Components 4 to 8 (weight, medical and ph ysical examination, use of diarrhea treatment, and hematocrit value) collected at the visit. The CDAI score at the Week 16/ET visit will be calculated at Visit 7, Part 3 (after all evaluations are complete), using the following: Components 1 to 3 from subject -reported PRO -CD daily e-diary data collected >10days before the start of colonoscopy preparation using the same most recent 7 or 10 days as described for the 2 -item PRO (Section 7.2.2.1 ) and Components 4 to 8 (weight, medical and ph ysical examination, use of diarrhea treatment, and hematocrit value) collected at Part 1 and Part 3 of the Week 16/ET visit, where assessed.

T ypically, the standard dose of a bowel preparation is split between the day before and the morning of the procedure. In this study , bowel preparation and colonoscopy are to be conducted per local routine; however, sodium phosphate based preparations should be avoided, as such regimens can produce mucosal changes t hat mimic IBD. In general, a complete colonoscopy should be performed; this includes visualization of the rectum, sigmoid colon, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, ileocecal valve, and the terminal ileum. At screening, an incomplete colonoscop y will not be accepted; only a few exceptions will be evaluated on a case b y case basis (eg. presence of impassable narrowing without any clinical signs of bowel obstruction and when the same time the investigated segments provide the SES-CD score required for inclusion) . Similarly , a complete colonoscop y is the aim at Week 16/ET, with the exception of the presence of impassable stenosis or other CD -related complications as cause of failure to complete the colonoscop y procedure. The position of the endoscope will be based on the length of the instrument at various levels of insertion as well as the morphological features of the intestine as seen during colonoscop y. Toachieve consistency in capturing and assessing endoscopic video recordings, each participating s ite will use an integrated hardware/software solution and associated tools for the capture and transmission of endoscopy video recordings for central reading. Nonreadable endoscopic images, as assessed b y the investigator, should not be sent for central re ading. The colonoscop y report and any photographs and/or video recordings taken during the procedure per local custom should be filed in the subject’s medical record. During the colonoscop y at screening (Visit 1, Part 2)and Week 16/ET, 10 biopsies will be collected from the most inflamed area of the mucosa: 2 samples each from the ileum, the 3segments of the colon, and the rectum . Colonoscopy and biops y procedures will be defined in a colonoscop y instructions manual and/or reference card(s), on which all sites will be trained. Colonoscopy results will be reviewed b y a central reader. (Appendix 2Biopsies for conventional histologic assessment will be collected in formalin and ). shipped to the central laboratory .

ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSES SMENT 8.1 Definition of Adverse Events, Period of Observation, Recording of Adverse Events An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (includin g an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (International Council for Harmonisation [I CH] Guidance E2 A [1995]). All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent and/or assent is signed until the end of the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.3 . This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the study , regardless of whether or not investigational product is administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of symptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each s ymptom should be listed individually . All AEs should be captured in the subject’s s ource document. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured in the subject’s source document. All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her base line status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event. Worsening of pretreatment events, after initiation of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia before dosing of investigational product, but the dyspepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded in the subject’s source document). The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or thera peutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantl y affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. For non-commercial use only"
218,page_218,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 82 SHP647 -305 Protocol Amendment 1 SHP647 21Aug 2018 8.1.2 Relationship Categorization A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event m ay have been caused b y the investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related.” Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.” The causality assessment must be documented in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be exp lained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. Not relatedThe event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event. 8.1.3 Outcome Categorization The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the stud y in the eCRF. Outcomes are as follows: Fatal Not recovered/Not resolved Recovered/Res olved Recovered/Resolved with sequelae Recovering/Resolving Unknown. 8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be recorded as an AE if the investigator considers such symptoms of disease progression related to the investigational prod uct. 8.1.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations A change in the value of a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG assessment can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the investigational product, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of an alread y abnormal value.

If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG values which were not present at the pretreatment value observed closest to the start of study treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinicall y significant and therefore represents an AE. 8.1.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.3 . Any report of pregnancy for any female stu dy participant or the partner of a male study participant must be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department using the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. A copy of the Shire Investigational and Marke ted Products Pregnancy Report Form (and any applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. The pregnant female study participant must be withdrawn from the study . Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 30calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar day s postpartum. Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Nonser ious AEs Required by the Protocol Form. Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SAE. In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Nonserious AEs Required by the Protocol Form as well as the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. The test date of the first positive serum/urine β- hCG test or ultrasound result will determine the pregna ncy onset date. 8.1.7 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they result in an AE/SAE as described in Section 8.2. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. For non-commercial use only"

For studies, medication errors are r eportable to the sponsor only as defined below. Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportable as medication errors. Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation. The admi nistration and/or use of the unassigned treatment is/are alway s reportable as a medication error. The administration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered as a reportable medication error. There is no specific antidote for o verdose with SHP647. Treatment should be sy mptomatic and supportive. 8.1.8 Unexpected Adverse Event An unexpected AE is an AE whose nature, severity, specificit y, or outcome is not consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the reference sa fety information (RSI ). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product, but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring with the parti cular product under investigation. The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor using the IB as the RSI . This determination will include considerations such as the number of AEs previously observed, but not on the basis of what might be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of a product. 8.1.9 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is defined as any suspected adverse reaction to stud y treatment (ie, including active comparators) that is both serious and unexpected.

Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (Section 8.1.7) unless they result in an SAE. The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Nonserious AEs Required by the Protocol Form and verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the form with the corresponding source d ocuments (Note: Source documents are not to be sent unless requested) and fax or email the form to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department . A copy of the Shire Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Nonserious AEs Required b y the Protocol Form (and an y applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. 8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose: Results in death Is life - threatening. Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hy pothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Note: Hospitalizations, which are the result of elective or previou sly scheduled surgery for pre -existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, sh ould not be classified as SAEs. For example, anadmission forapreviousl yscheduled ventral hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; howeve r, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or previously scheduled surgery that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s).

Note: I mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and m ay require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an ED or at home; blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do n ot result in inpatient hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 7.1.3 and must be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department andthe CRO/Shire medical monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by the investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. 8.2.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resol ution Dates The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the date the event is considered chronic. In the ca se of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y. In addition, any signs or sy mptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent form, or leading up to the onse t date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 8.2.6 Fatal Outcome Any SAE that results in the subject’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. For an y SAE that r esults in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). Theinvestigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solely as a result of the subject’s death. For non-commercial use only"

Abnormal values in ALT concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver i njury are considered potential cases of drug -induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered important medical events. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury depends on t he subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who present with the following laboratory abnormalities per Table 5should be evaluated further to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values. The measur ement(s) should be re confirmed with another blood draw preferabl y within 48 -72 hours of the initial finding of potential concern. Please refer to lab manual for further instructions. Guidance for Dosing Interruption: Investigator -directed delay s in dosing due to abnormal laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the subject should continue with the treatment. Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induc tion studies (SHP647 -305 or SHP647 -306) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance stud y or L TS study .

DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS 9.1 Data Collection The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information required by the protocol in the eCRF. A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the eCRF data against the source data for c ompleteness and accuracy . Discrepancies between source data and data entered in the eCRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by authorized site personnel. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once a subject is randomized, it is expected that site personnel will complete the eCRF entry within approximately 3business day s of the subject’s visit. 9.2 Clinical Data Management Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management plan. Quality control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data a re to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner. 9.3 Data Handling Considerations Data that may potentiall y unblind the treatment assignment (ie, investigational product serum concentrations, antibodies to investigational product, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparation/accountability data) will be handled with special care during the data cleaning and review process. These data will be handled in such a way that, before unblinding, anydata that may unblind study team personnel will be presented as blinded information or otherwise will not be made available. If applicable, unblinded data may be made available to quality assurance representatives for the purposes of conducting independen t drug audits. 9.4 Statistical Analysis Process The study will be anal yzed by the sponsor or its agent . The statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study information such as subject disposition, d emographics and baseline characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. The SAP will also include a description of how missing, unused and spurious data will be addressed. The SAP will be finalized before unblindi ng to preserve the integrity of the statistical analy sis and study conclusions. For non-commercial use only"
227,page_227,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 91 SHP647 -305 Protocol Am endment 1 SHP647 21Aug 2018 All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS®software Version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute Inc, Cary , NC, US). Unless otherwise specified, summary tabulations will be presented b y treatment group. All data listings will be sorted by treatment group, site, and subject number, and will include the subject’s age, sex, and race. For categorical variables, the number and percentage of subjects within each category (with a category for missing data as needed) of the parameter will be presented. For continuous variables, the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values will be presented. 9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Data Monitoring Committee A planned interim anal ysis for the coprimary endpoints will take place after approximately the first 50% of all randomized subjects in both the SHP647- 305 and SHP647 -306 studies have either completed the studies or have prematurely withd rawn from the studies. Recruitment will not pause for this interim anal ysis. The purpose of the unblinded interim analy sis is to reassess the appropriateness of the premises used for the coprimary endpoints when the study was designed. There is no possibil ity to stop earl y for overwhelming efficacy as the studies must continue in order to enroll an appropriate number of subjects in the SHP647 -307 study . The reassessment of sample size will be performed using conditional power methods. Results at the interim analy sis may be futile for one or both of the SHP647 doses and lead to the discontinuation of that dose for CD or the SHP647 CD program. Full details of the interim analysis, the guidelines for increasing the sample size, and futility rules to stop a dose will be included in a prespecified interim analy sis SAP. The interim anal ysis SAP will be finalized before the interim anal ysis is conducted. The planned interim analysis will be conducted b y an external independent statistical group and given to the independent Interim Anal ysis Review Committee; the individuals involved in the day-to-day conduct of the study will not be involved in the interim anal ysis nor have access to the results of the interim anal ysis. The sponsor will only be notified b y the Interim Analy sis Review Committee of recommendations to modify the SHP647 CD program according to the guidelines specified in the interim anal ysis SAP. An external DMC will be established to review the overall safety of the study subjects on an ongoing basis. The DMC will be responsible for the ongoing monitoring of safet y of subjects enrolled in the study according to the DMC charter. Recommendations made by the DMC to alter the conduct of the study or to amend the protocol will be forwarded to Shire for revi ew and for a final decision. Shire or its designee will notify investigative sites and regulatory authorities as appropriate, of DMC recommendations (which may include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpo ints).

Anal yses of the data for DMC review will be conducted according to the DMC charter and DM C SAP. Because no formal hypothesis testing for safety assessments is planned, multiplicity concerns regarding repeated analyses are not applicable. 9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations Graphical methods are used to control the global family -wise type I error rate (FWER) at the .05level (2- sided) for the comparisons of the 2 SHP647 treatment groups with the placebo group. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the coprimar y endpoints. Therefore, the power analy sis and sample size estimation was calculated based on the chi -square test of proportions using nQuery Advisor® Version 7.0 (Statistical Solutions L td, Cork, Ireland) for an individual SHP647 dose compared to placebo. Power calculations are made based on assuming a .025 (2- sided) significance level for each pairwise treatment comparison, 1720 subjects will be screened to randomize 1032 subjects in a 3:3:2 allocation ratio: 387 subjects in the 25 mg SHP647 treatment gro up, 387 subjects in the 75mg SHP647 treatment group, and 258 subjects in the placebo group. These numbers of subjects would y ield an approximately 93% power to detect individual pairwise treatment difference in the first coprimary efficacy endpoint, clini cal remission by 2-item PRO at Week 16, of 10% (17.5% SHP647 versus 7.5% placebo). Expected clinical remission rates by 2-item PRO at Week 16 are based on observed rates from a post hoc anal ysis of the A7281006 study and placebo remission rates from litera ture (Sandborn et al., 2017 ). No adjustment for missing data is required in these sample size calculation s as subjects with missing data for clinical remission by 2-item PRO at Week 16 are imputed as failures and the above rates account for these subjects. With the 1032 subjects in allocation noted above, this number of subjects would y ield an approximately 94% power to detect individual pairwise treatment difference in the other coprimary efficacy endpoint, endoscopic response at Week 16, of 12.5% (27.5% SHP647 versus 15% placebo). Expected endoscopic response rates at Week 16 are based on observed rates from a post hoc anal ysis of the A7281006 study and also endoscopic response rates from literature (Sandborn et a l., 2017). No adjustment for missing data is required in these sample size calculations as subjects with missing data for endoscopic response at Week 16 are imputed as failures and the above rates account for these subjects. The overall power for the coprimary endpoints will be approximately 87% assuming no correlation between the tests on the endpoints and approximately 90% assuming a correlation of 0.4. With the sample size of 1032 subjects, Table 6provides the power for detecting a treatment differ ence between a SHP647 treatment group and the placebo group for the key secondary endpoints.

The 7 most recent days may or may not be contiguous during the 10 days of data collection before colonoscop y preparation, depending on days to be excluded because of missing data. Iffewer than 7 days are av ailable, the endpoint will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5 day s are available, the endpoint will be treated as missing. Endoscopic response at Week 16 as measured b y a decrease in SES -CD of at least 25% from baseline . The coprimary efficacy endpoints, clinical remission at the Week 16 visit and endoscopic response at the Week 16 visit, will each be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75mg SHP647) to the placebo group using a Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel (CM H) chi -square test stratified by status of prior anti -TNF treatment, glucocorticoid use, and SES -CD at baseline for each of the stages of the study (stage 1 includes subjects whose primary efficacy data are used in the interim anal ysis and stage 2 includes all other subjects. Note: classification of stage 1 and stage 2 is based on the time of randomization rather than the time of study completion or termination). Subjects with missing data at the Week 16 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonr esponders. Weighted inverse normal p -value combination methods are used to combine the p -values from stage 1 and stage 2 through the following formula: C(p 1, p2) = 1 –Φ[w 1Φ-1(1-p1)+ w 2Φ-1(1-p2)] Where p 1, p2 are the p -values computed from the CMH chi-square test for each stage, wi2= n i/(n1+ n 2), n 1 and n 2are the preplanned stage -wise sample sizes that are fixed at the time of the interim anal ysis based on an original total sample size, and Φ denotes the cumulative distribution function of the st andard normal distribution ( Bretz et al., 2009a ). Given t hat there is no possibility of stopping earl y for efficacy, that any potential stopping for futility of either or both doses of SHP647 is nonbinding, and that weights are prespecified, the test statistic C(p 1, p2) can be compared against the nominal alpha level to assess statistical significance ( Chang and Chow, 2008 ). The coprimary endpoints will each be tested b y the following h ypothesis: H0: δ= 0 H1: δ≠ 0 Where δis the common treatment difference across strata. The common treatment difference is a weighted average of the stratum -specific treatment differences. For non-commercial use only"

Sensitivity analy ses to explore the impact of missing data on the coprimary efficacy endpoints and key secondary endpoints will be conducted. These anal yses may compare imputations of the missing values which favor placebo (eg, worst case) and/or imputations which favor active treatment (eg, best case). In addition, imputation methods based on informative missingness and other missing data mechanisms may be performed. Additional sensitivity analy ses will also be conducted using the per -protocol set and the completer set. Additional analy ses may be developed in the SAP.

To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz et al. ( 2009b ) will be utilized to propagate α from the coprimar y endpoints to the keysecondary endpoints and between the 2 SHP647 treatment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2- sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the coprimary endpoints (P) and alpha is propagated in a hierarchical manner to each of the 6 key secondary endpoints (K1–K6) within a pairwise treatment comparison. In order to pass alpha between the coprimary endpoints and the first key secondary endpoint, both coprimary endpoints must at tain statistical significance. A graphical visualization of the αpropagation is presented in Figure 4. For non-commercial use only"

Note: Variable 5: This variable covers taking medication for symptomatic relief from diarrhea, eg, bulking agents, opiates et c. Variable 7: Absolute deviation of hematocrit is the di fference in hematocrit from standard. A male subject with a hematocrit of 40% has an absolute deviation of 7. Each percentage deviation has a value of 6 points. If hematocrit subtotal is <0, enter 0. Variable 8: This variable is based on Metropolitan Life Tables (these are programmed into the ePRO device). Percent deviation from standard weight is (1 - weight/standard weight) × 100; therefore, positive percent deviation represents weight loss, which adds points to the CDAI. Percentage deviation from standar d weight = 1 point for each percent deviation. If body weight subtotal is less than -10, enter -10. CDAI Interpretation :  0-149 points: Asymptomatic remission (Note: subjects requiring steroids to remain asymptomatic are not considered to be in remission bu t are referred to as being “steroid dependent”)  150-220 points: Mild to moderate active CD  221-450 points: Moderate to severe active CD  >451 points: Severely active to fulminant disease.

Local therapeutic standards and investigator judgment should be used. AMINOSALICYLATES Mesalamine (5- ASA) Inadequate response or loss of response: Although the use of mesalamine in UC is well established (eg, induction treatment up to 4.8 g/day up to 8 weeks) and based upon evidence - based criteria, its use in CD is not well established. Oral mesalamine has not consistently been demonstrated to be effective compared with placebo for induction of remission and achieving mucosal healing in patients with active CD. Similarly , topical mesalamine is of limited benefit in CD ( Lichtenstein et al., 2018). For the purpose of this study , inadequate response or loss of response is defined as signs and sy mptoms of persistently active disease despite a history of mesalamine use for at least 8 weeks at dail y doses of 4.8 g/day . Intolerance: defined as documented treatment discontinuation for AEs suspected to be related mesalamine treatment. As guidance, the US package insert of mesalamine lists the following AEs. Please check the respective latest label of your coun try as well ( Lialda®, 2018): Renal Impairment including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure.

Figure A1 Algorithm for C difficile Diagnosis Using the Quick Check Card Test If the Aler e Quik Chek card test is not available, then a diagnosis may be established by following either of the algorithms shown in Figure A2 (using PCR for toxin), Figure A3 using toxigenic culture) or Figure A4 (using toxigenic culture, followed b y PCR). The rati onale for the method in Figure A3 is that the majority of PCR tests are expected to be negative for toxin, thus obviating the need for the test at the central laboratory. The expected turnaround time at the central laboratory for a GDH card test is expecte d to be shorter than that for stool culture for Cdifficile at the local laboratory. The details of the sensitivity and specificity of these tests were reported b y Khanna ( Khanna et al., 2017 ). When medically reasonable, treatment decisions should be deferred until an etiology has been determined. When this is not feasible, management of sy mptoms should be dictated b y the clinical situation. For non-commercial use only"

When this is not feasible, management of sy mptoms should be dictated b y the clinical situation. If management requires a prohibited treatment (eg, intr avenous glucocorticoids for induction or maintenance studies) the subject should be withdrawn from treatment. If treatment has been deferred, once an etiology is determined (eg, C. difficile , disease exacerbation, Camp ylobacter), appropriate treatment shou ld be promptly implemented without waiting for a scheduled visit. I f the etiology is determined to be C. difficile , treatment guidelines conforming to the current I DSA recommendations for C. difficile infection (McDonald et al., 2018 )or the recent expert review on C. difficile infection in IBD (Khanna et al., 2017 )should be consulted. If C. difficile infection was identified, clinical improvement should be noted within about 5 days after the start of treatment. I f improvement does not occur, the etiology is most likely an IBD flare secondary to C. difficile and treatment failure assessment should proceed per the protocol. Another possible explanation is primary failure of C. difficile therapy which is unlikely . If an infectious etiology other than C difficile is identified, it should be managed as appropriate, with reference to current clinical guidelines (Shane et al., 2017 ). If any infectious etiology is determined, the site should contact the medical monitor to make him or her aware of the diagnosis and to discuss treatment and ongoing stud y participation.

To align product quality complaints language with current Shire template. Study Synopsis , Inclusion Criteria Section 4.1, Inclusion Criteria Section 7.1.1.1 , Screening Visit (Visit 1) Section 7.2.2, Efficacy Reordered inclusion criteria #4a, 4b and 4c so that the colonoscopy is last. Clarified that the subject must meet incl usion criteria #4a and 4b (CDAI score and PRO subscores) prior to the colonoscopy (criterion #4c) being performed. To clarify the order of assessments to prevent unnecessary colonoscopies being performed. Study Synopsis , Inclusion Criteria Section 4.1, Inclusion Criteria Section 4.4, Reproductive Potential Revised inclusion criterion #9 to add “highly effective methods for female and medically appropriate methods for male study subjects” in parentheses after “appropriate contraception”. Also added this language after the terms ‘appropriate form of contraception’ and ‘app ropriate method of contraception’ in Section 4.4. To clarify what is meant by appropriate contraception methods. Study Synopsis , Exclusion Criteria Section 4.2, Exclusion Criteria Revised exclusion criterion #6 to clarify that subjects with ob structive colonic stricture are excluded if it is clinically significant. Updated exclusion criteri on #6 to state that subjects who have undergone previous colonic resection or ileocolectomy are excluded unless it was at least 6 months before screening and they have at least 25 cm of colon remaining (previously all subjects who had undergone previous colonic resection were excluded.) To provide clarity regarding the exclusion around prior bowel surgeries. As ileocolectomy or partial colectomy is common in Crohn’s disease, the population previously defined in the protocol has been too restrictive and thus could not reflect the broader Crohn’s disease population. There is no reason to believe that ontamalimab would work differently after ileocolectomy or partial colectomy. The length of the remaining colon is required to be at least 25 cm in order to be able to evaluate and score the mucosal inflammation appropriately. For non-commercial use only"

314,page_314,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 Rationale: This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safe ty of ontamalimab in indu cing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subjects with moderate to severe CD. The CD clinical development program includes 3 completed studies: 1 Phase 1 study (A7281008) and 2 Phase 2 studies (A7281006 and A7281007). The ontamalimab dose selection (25 mg and 75 mg) for this study is based on data from these 3 previous studies, which evaluated the activ ity of ontamalimab in adult patients with moderately to severely active CD based on CDAI scores between 220 and 450. The Phase 1 study (A7281008, TOSCA) and Phase 2 studies (A7281006, OPERA; and A7281007, OPERA II [long-term safety study]) that investigated the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of ontamalimab support further clinical development of ontamalimab using subcutaneous (SC) administration in subjects with moderate to severe CD. Investigational product, dose, and mode of administration: The test product is ontamalimab (SHP647), which will be provided as a sterile aque ous buffered solution for SC administration in a glass prefilled syringe (PFS) with a fixed needle. Each PFS contains 1 mL of ontamalimab solution for injection at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 mg or 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current ontamalimab investigator’s brochure. The reference product is placebo, which will be provided in a PFS with a fixed needle containing 1 mL of placebo solution for SC administration. The placeb o solution will contain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain ontamalimab. Methodology: This is a Phase 3, randomized, doubl e-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-gr oup study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ontamalimab in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subjects with moderate to severe CD. A total of 1032 subjects (387 subjects in the 25 mg ont amalimab treatment group, 38 7 subjects in the 75 mg ontamalimab treatment group, and 258 subjects in the placebo group) are planned for enrollment into the study. Subjects must be at least 16 years of age and no more than 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form. The study consists of a screening period up to 6 weeks and a 16-week treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments (25 mg ontamalimab, 75 mg ontamalimab, or placebo) in a 3:3:2 ratio. Random ization will be stratified based upon the su bject’s status of prior antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment (naïve or experienced), glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoids at baseline versus not on glucocorticoids at baseline), and Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD) at baseline (SES-CD ≥17 or SES-CD <17). Subjects will receive SC injections of on tamalimab or placebo, using a PFS, on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and Week 12 (Visit 6). Subjects will unde rgo efficacy, , , safety, and health outcome assessments at these visits. At the end of the 16-week treatment period, subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in either a double-blind maintenance study (SHP647-307; for subjects who fulfill the entry criteria) or a long-term safety extension (LTS) study (SHP647-304; for subjects who do not fulfill the entry criteria for Study SHP647-307). Subjects who withdraw early from the 16-week treatment period or who do not wish to enter the maintenance study (SHP647-307) or LTS study (SHP647-304) will continue in to a 16-week safety follow-up period. Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647-305 or SHP647-306) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance study or LTS study. A planned interim analysis for the co primary endpoints will take place after approximately the first 50% of all randomized subjects in both the SHP647-305 and SHP647-306 studies have either completed the studies or have prematurely withdrawn from the studies. The sample size will be reassessed as part of this interim analysis. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria: Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study. 1. Subjects and/or their parent or legally authorized re presentative must have an understanding, ability, and willingness to fully comply with st udy procedures and restrictions.

Abdominal pain subscore ≥5 (average worst daily pain on the 11-point numerical rating scale [NRS]) AND abdominal pain subscore ≥ 2 (average daily pain on the 4-point abdominal pain variable of CD AI) over the 7 most recent days out of the 10 days before colonoscopy preparation (may or may not be contiguous) AND/OR ii. Average of the daily stool frequency subscore ≥4 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) over the 7 most recent days out of the 10 days before colonoscopy preparation (may or may not be contiguous). AND c. Presence of ulcerations that are characteristic to CD, as determined by a colonoscopy performed during screening, and as defined by the SES-CD >6 (SES-CD ≥4 for isolated ileitis) Note that the subject must be confirmed as mee ting the CDAI score and PRO subscore requirements before a colonoscopy is done. 5. Subjects must have a documented diagnosis (endoscopic with histology) of CD for ≥3 months before screening. Documented diagnosis is defined as: • A biopsy report in which the description of the histological findings is consistent with the CD diagnosis AND • A report documenting disease duration based upon prior colonoscopy. Note: If a biopsy report is not available in the source document at the time of scr eening, a biopsy must be performed during the screening colonoscopy and the histology report should be consistent with the CD diagnosis. If the histology description does not support the CD diagnosis at this time point, the subject should not be randomized. 6. Subjects must be willing and able to undergo a colonoscopy during screening after all other inclusion criteria have been met. 7. Subjects must have had an inadequate response to, or lost response to, or had an intolerance to at least 1 conventional treatment such as sulfasalazine or mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid [5-ASA]), glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants (azathioprine [AZA], 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], or methotrexate [MTX]), or anti-TNF (see Appendix 4 of the protocol for guidance).

Subjects with evidence of active or latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) or subjects with this history who have not completed a generally accepte d full course of treatment before baseline (Visit 2) are excluded. All other subjects must have either the Mantoux (purified protein derivative [PPD]) tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) performed. Subjects who have no history of previously diagnosed active or latent TB are excluded if they have a positive Mantoux (PPD) tuberculin skin test (ie ≥5 mm induration) or a positive IGRA (the latter to be tested at the site’s local laboratory ) during screening or within 12 weeks before screening. If the IGRA cannot be performed locally, a central laboratory may be used, with prior agreement fr om the sponsor. • An IGRA is strongly recommended for subjects with a prior Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination but may be used for any subject. Documentation of IGRA product used and the test result must be in the subject’s source documentation if perfo rmed locally. Acceptable IGRA products include QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus In-Tube Test. • If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may be repeated, and if a negative result is obtained, enrollment may proceed. In subjects with no history of treated active or latent TB, a positive test on repeat will exclude the subject.

This consultation must be included in source documentation. Results from a chest x-ray, taken within the 12 weeks before or during screening (Visit 1) must show no abnormalities suggestive of active TB infection as determined by a qualified medical specialist. Subjects with a prior diagnosis of active or latent TB are excluded unless both of the following criteria are met: • The subject has previously received an ad equate course of treatment for either latent (eg, 9 months of isoniazid or an acceptable alternative regimen, in a locale where rates of primary multidrug TB resistance are <5%. Subjects from regions with hi gher rates of primary multidrug TB resistance are excluded) or active (acceptable multidrug regimen) TB in fection. Evidence of diagnosis and treatment must be included in source documentation. Consultation with a pulmonary or infectious disease specialist to confirm adequate treatment (ie, subject would be acceptable for immunosuppressant [eg, anti-TNF] treatment without additional action) must be performed during the screening period. The consultation report must be included in source documentation prior to enrollment. • A chest x-ray performed within 12 weeks before screening (Visit 1) or during screening (Visit 1) indicates no evidence of active or recurrent di sease, and documentation of interpretation by a qualified medical specialist must be included in source documentation. 25. Subjects with a pre-existing demyelinating disorder su ch as multiple sclerosis or new onset seizures, unexplained sensory motor, or cognitive behavioral, neurological deficits, or significant abnormalities noted during screening. 26.

Subjects who are investigational site staff members or relatives of those site staff members or subjects who are Shire employees dir ectly involved in the conduct of the study. Maximum duration of subject involvement in the study: • Planned duration of screening period: Up to 6 weeks • Planned duration of treatment period: 16 weeks • Planned duration of follow-up period: 16 weeks. Endpoints and statistical analysis: Analysis sets: The screened set will consist of all subjects who have signed an informed consent document. The randomized set will consist of all subjects in the screened set for whom a randomization number has been assigned. The safety set will consist of all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of investigational product. The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all subjects in the randomized set who have received at least 1 dose of investigational product. The per-protocol set will consist of all subjects in the FAS who do not have predefined protocol deviations that may affect the coprimar y efficacy endpoints. The completer set will consist of all subjects in the FAS who have completed the Week 16 assessment for this study. Coprimary e fficacy endpoints: Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy analyses will be based on the FAS and subject s will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment, regardless of the treatment they actually received. The coprimary efficacy endpoints are: • Clinical remission at the Week 16 visit as defined by the following: 2-item PRO subscores of average worst daily abdominal pain ≤3 (based on 11-point NRS) over the 7 most recent days and average daily stool frequency ≤2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the BSFS over the 7 most recent days. The 7 most recent days may or may not be contiguous during the 10 days of data collection before colonoscopy preparation, depe nding on days to be excluded because of missing data. If fewer than 7 days are available, the endpoint will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5 days are available, the endpoint will be treated as missing. • Endoscopic response at Week 16 as measured by a decrease in SES-CD of at least 25% from baseline. The coprimary efficacy endpoints, clini cal remission at the Week 16 visit and endoscopic response at the Week 16 visit, will each be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75 mg ontamalimab) to the placebo group using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test stratified by status of prior anti-TNF treatment, glucocorticoid use, and SES-CD at baseline for each of the stages of the study (stage 1 includes subjects whose primary efficacy data are used in the interim analysis and stage 2 includes all other subjects. Note: classification of stage 1 and stage 2 is based on the time of randomization rather than the time of study completion or termination). Subjects with missing data at the Week 16 visit will be considered failures and co unted as nonresponders. Weighted inverse normal p-value combination methods are used to combine the p-values from stage 1 and stage 2 through the following formula: C(p 1, p2) = 1 – Φ[w 1 Φ-1(1-p 1)+ w 2 Φ-1(1-p 2)] For non-commercial use only"

Given that there is no possibility of stopping early for efficacy, th at any potential stopping for futility of either or both doses of ontamalimab is nonbinding, and that weights are prespecified, the test statistic C(p 1, p2) can be compared against the nominal alpha level to a ssess statistical significance (Chang and Chow, 2008). The coprimary endpoints will each be te sted by the follo wing hypothesis: H0: δ = 0 H1: δ ≠ 0 Where δ is the common treatment difference across strata. Th e common treatment difference is a weighted average of the stratum-specific treatment differences. The global family-wise Type I error rate (FWER) for the statistical tests of the coprimary and key secondary endpoints will be strongly controlled at .05 (2-sided). To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz et al. (2009b) will be utilized to propagate α from the coprimary endpoints to th e key secondary endpoints and between the 2 ontamalimab treatment group and placebo comparison s. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise tr eatment comparisons for the coprimary en dpoints (P) and alpha is propagated in a hierarchical manner to each of the 6 key secondary endpoints (K1–K6) within a pairwise treatment comparison. In order to pass alpha between the coprimary endpoints and the first key secondary endpoint, both coprimary endpoints must attain statistical significance. Key secondary efficacy endpoints: The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: • Clinical remission at the Week 16 visit as measured by a CDAI score of <150. • Enhanced endoscopic response at Week 16 as measur ed by a decrease in SES-CD of at least 50% from baseline. • Clinical remission at the Week 16 visit as defined by the following: 2-item PRO subscores of average daily abdominal pain ≤1 (based on the 4-point scal e) over the 7 most recent days and average daily stool frequency ≤3 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the BSFS over the 7 most recent days. The 7 most recent days may or may not be contiguous during the 10 days of data collection before colonoscopy preparation, depe nding on days to be excluded because of missing data. If fewer than 7 days are available, the endpoint will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5 days are available, the endpoint will be treated as missing. • Clinical response at the Week 16 visit as measured by the 2-item PRO and defined as meeting at least 1 of the following 2 criteria: o A decrease of ≥30% and at least 2 points from baseline in the average daily worst abdominal pain over the 7 most recent days*, with the average daily stool frequency of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) either: (a) Not worsening from baseline and/or (b) Meeting the criteria for clin ical remission, ie, 2-item PRO subscore of average daily stool frequency ≤2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the BSFS over the 7 most recent days* o A decrease of ≥30% from baseline in the average daily stool frequency of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the BSFS over the 7 most recent days*, with the average daily worst abdominal pain either: (a) Not worsening from baseline and/or (b) Meeting the criteria for clin ical remission, ie, 2-item PRO subscore of average worst daily For non-commercial use only"

329,page_329,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing di sease marked by granulomatous inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract . Although the terminal ileum and right colon are the most commonly involved sites, CD can affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the perianal region. Inflammation is typically transmural (full-thickness), segm ental, and discontinuous, and symptoms are predominantly determined by th e part of bowel or organ involved. Patients typically present with symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, which may be persistent and lead to anem ia, and weight loss due to pain on eating and malabsorption. As the disease progresses, extraintes tinal manifestations and asso ciated conditions can develop, including bowel obstruction, fistulas , and stenosis, as well as pain ful skin ulcerations, eye pain, and arthritis. The incidence of CD is estimated to be up to 12.7 cases per 100,000 persons per year in Europe and up to 20.2 cases per 100,000 persons per year in North America. No clear difference in incidence has been observed be tween men and women. Although CD can occur at any age, peak incidence has been observed in the second to fourth decades of life, with a second modest rise in incidence in the latter decades of life ( Molodecky et al., 2012 ). Crohn’s disease is a lifelong condition with a seri ous effect on quality of life. The traditional approach to therapy of CD has been the step -up approach usually represented as a pyramid where, progressing from mild to severe disease, therapeutic choices proceed step by step from less potent drugs at the base of the pyramid to more potent but also more toxic drugs at the top. Current treatment primarily cons ists of symptomatic management with dietary modifications, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), opiates (l operamide), systemic glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine [AZA], 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], methotrexate [MTX]), and biologic therapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents or anti-integrin agents. Despite recent advances, there is still an unmet need for a safe, effective, and durable pharmacological treatment th at will induce and maintain remission. 1.2 Product Background and Clinical Information The selectivity of lymphocyte homing to speciali zed lymphoid tissue and mu cosal sites of the GI tract is influenced by the endot helial expression of mucosal a ddressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM). MAdCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin super family of cell adhesion molecules and is mostly expressed on the cell surface of high endothelial venules of organized intestinal lymphoid tissue such as Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes ( Shyjan et al., 1996; Briskin et al., 1997 ; Liaskou et al., 2011 ). MAdCAM plays a ro le in gut immune surveillance, and also appears to facilitate ex cessive lymphocyte infiltration under conditions of chronic GI inflammation. The α 4β7 integrin is the recogni zed ligand for MAdCAM, and expression of this ligand on populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as on subsets of B cells, distinguishes them as unique gut homing lymphocytes.

Ontamalimab binds MAdCAM-1 with high affinity and selectivit y that prevents the binding of α4β7+ lymphocytes to MAdCAM-expressing sites in the high e ndothelial venules of the GI tract. 1.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment Ontamalimab has been evaluated in Phase 1 and Phas e 2 clinical studies in subjects with CD and ulcerative colitis (UC). In CD Study A7281006, induction with ontamalimab did not meet the primary endpoint; no statistically significant differences were observed between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm in CD Activity Index (CDAI)-70 response rate at Week 8 or Week 12. Post hoc analyses suggested evidence of drug effect in subjects with more inflammation at baseline, as indicated by highe r serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) or Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD). In UC Study A7281009, induction with ontamalimab at doses of 7.5 mg, 22.5 mg, or 75 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W) resulted in statistically significantly higher proportions of subjects in remission at Week 12 based on total Mayo score (both local and cen tral read) when compared with placebo treatment. In the induction study A7281006 in subjects wi th CD, compared to placebo, nominally statistically significant decreases in fecal calp rotectin were observed in the 75 mg group at Week 8 and in the 22.5 mg and 75 mg groups at Week 12. Generally, decreases from baseline in high-sensitivity (hs)CRP were observed in a ll 4 treatment groups ove r the 12-week induction period. Compared to placebo, nominally statisti cally significant decreases in hsCRP were observed in all 3 active treatment groups (22.5 mg, 75 mg, and 225 mg) at Week 12. There was no evidence of a dose response for either of these parameters. A nominally statistically significant increase was observed in circulating β 7+ central memory T lymphocytes at Weeks 8 and 12, consistent with the predicted mech anism of action. In the UC induction study, A7281009, decreases in fecal calpr otectin were observed in all groups, including placebo; however, there were no nominally statistically si gnificant differences in the decrease in fecal calprotectin between any dose level of ontamalimab and placebo. Decreases in hsCRP were also observed in all 4 treatment groups; however, ot her than the 75 mg dose group at Week 12, no nominally significant differences were observed in active treatment vs placebo. The most common serious adverse events (SAEs) across all studies were CD and UC. In Study A7281006, the randomized, placebo-controlled induction study in CD, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were most commonly re ported within the GI disorders system organ class (SOC) followed by the infections and infe stations SOC.

STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 2.1 Rationale for the Study Ontamalimab, a fully human IgG 2κ antihuman MAdCAM monoclonal antibody, is under development for the treatment of CD. Ontamalimab prevents the binding of α4β7+ lymphocytes to MAdCAM-expressing sites with high affinity and selectivity. Principal sites of MAdCAM expression on normal tissue include intestine, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, spleen, and to a lesser extent lung, liver, and bladder but not the CNS (Steffen et al., 1996 ). Although selective targeting of the MAdCAM receptors is a novel approach, the basic interference of lymphocyte homing by preventing the binding of these α4β7+ lymphocytes to the MAdCAM receptor and the resultant e fficacy in CD is well established ( Sandborn et al., 2013 ). Ontamalimab is differentiated from other molecules used for the treatment of CD in that it blocks the interaction of α 4β7+ lymphocytes with the MAdCAM receptor by selectively binding to MAdCAM in the gut (and related tissues) wherea s other molecules only target the integrins on the infiltrating lymphocytes. Additionally, onta malimab does not bind to the vascular cell adhesion molecule; therefore, ontamalimab is not expected to be an effective treatment for multiple sclerosis or affect lymphocyte homing or surveillance in the CNS. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ontamalimab in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subj ects with moderate to severe CD. The CD clinical development program includes 3 completed studies: 1 Phase 1 study (A7281008) and 2 Phase 2 studies (A7281006 and A7281007). Study A7281006 (OPERA) was a parallel, dose-ranging, randomi zed, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which ontamalimab was given as 3 subcutaneous (SC) dose levels (22.5 mg, 75 mg, and 225 mg) Q4 W over an 8-week period. Ontamalimab was generally safe and well tolerated and there were no deaths. Thr ee placebo-treated subjects and 9 subjects in the 22.5 mg, 75 mg, and 225 mg ontamalimab groups disc ontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Median serum concentrations of ontamalimab increased with increasing dose. Positive antidrug antibody (ADA) status did not appear to impact exposure to ontamalimab. The CDAI was the primary instrument to assess the efficacy of ontamalimab; no statistically signific ant differences were noted between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm. Therefore, the study did not meet its primary endpoint. However, post hoc analysis indicated increased remission rates in subjects in the 22.5 mg or 75 mg treatment arms who had higher serum con centrations of hsCRP or higher scores of SES-CD at baseline. Study A7281008 (TOSCA) was an open-label multi-cent er, Phase 1 sequential cohort study that evaluated the effects of a maximum induction dose of ontamalimab on CNS system immune surveillance.

The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline (pretreatment) in absolute lymphocyte count in ce rebrospinal fluid (CSF) in subj ects with IBD after receiving 3 doses of 225 mg ontamalimab. The mean per centage change from baseline in absolute lymphocytes in CSF was 61.76% with a median change of 35.2% (range: -70.2% to 267.8%). The post-treatment LP/pretreatment LP geomet ric mean ratio for CSF lymphocytes was 1.33 with the lower bound of the 80% confidence inte rval (CI)=1.13, which was greater than 0.5, supporting rejection of the null hypo thesis (ie, that the percent decrease in tota l lymphocytes counts after treatment would be ≥50% (equivalent to the geom etric mean ratio in total lymphocyte counts being ≤0.5). This result supports the hypothe sis that ontamalimab does not impair trafficking of lymphocytes into the CNS and thus should not impair CNS immune surveillance. Study A7281007 (OPERA II) was a Phase 2 open-label extension study to provide additional long-term safety data on subjects with mode rate to severe CD who completed Study A7281006 or Study A7281008 and wished to continue to re ceive ontamalimab. Ontamalimab 75 mg (with potential dose escalation to 225 mg) SC given Q4W for 72 weeks was generally well tolerated in subjects with CD over the treatment period eval uated in this study. In subjects with positive ADA or neutralizing antibody (NAb) status, exposur e to ontamalimab was not affected. Serum concentrations of ontamalimab in this study were consistent with what was predicted based on the Feeder Study A7281006. There were 2 deaths in th e study: 1 subject died of multiple organ dysfunction syndromes in the treatment period and 1 subject died of metast atic neoplasm in the follow-up period. Neither death was reported as related to treatm ent with the i nvestigational product by the investigators. The most frequently reported SAE was CD in either the treatment period or the follow-up period. The SOC with th e most subjects experiencing TEAEs was GI disorders. Although Study A7281007 was not placebo controlled, the explorat ory efficacy results (based on the modified Harvey Bradshaw Index) indicated that the effect of ontamalimab on disease activity was maintained over the duration of treatment. The ontamalimab dose selection (25 mg and 75 mg ) for this study is based on data from these 3 previous studies, which evaluated the activity of ontamalimab in adult pa tients with moderately to severely active CD based on CDAI scores between 220 and 450. The results of a post hoc analysis of remission rate by baseline elevated serum concentration of hsCRP suggested that the greatest treatment effect was at a dose of 22.5 mg. Similarly, post hoc analysis of remission rates by endoscopic severity assessed using the SES-CD suggested best efficacy at a dose of 75 mg. Therefore, both dosage regimens 25 mg and 75 mg Q4W have been selected for the Phase 3 testing. The Phase 1 study (A7281008, TOSCA) and Phase 2 studies (A7281006, OPERA; and A7281007, OPERA II [long-term safety study]) that i nvestigated the safet y, tolerance, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of ontamalimab support further clinical development of ontamalimab using SC administration in s ubjects with moderate to severe CD.

STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Study Design and Flow Chart This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ontamalimab in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic response in subjects with moderate to severe CD. A total of 1032 subjects (387 s ubjects in the 25 mg ontamalimab treatment group, 387 subjects in the 75 mg ontamalimab treatment group, and 258 subj ects in the placebo group) are planned for enrollment into the study ( Figure 1 ). Subjects must be at least 16 years of age and no more than 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form. The study consists of a screeni ng period up to 6 weeks and a 16-we ek treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments (25 mg ontamalimab, 75 mg ontamalimab, or pl acebo) in a 3:3:2 ratio. Randomization will be stratified based upon the subject’s status of prior anti-TNF treat ment (naïve or experienced), glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoids at baseline vers us not on glucocorticoids at baseline), and SES-CD at baseline (SES-CD ≥ 17 or SES-CD <17). S ubjects will receive SC injections of ontamalimab or placebo, usi ng a prefilled syringe (PFS), on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5) , and Week 12 (Visit 6). Subjects will undergo efficacy, , , safety, a nd health outcome assessments at these visits as detailed in Table 1 . At the end of the 16-week treatment period, subject s will be offered the opportunity to participate in either a double-blind maintenance study (S HP647-307; for subjects who fulfill the entry criteria) or a long-term safety extension (LTS) study (SHP647-304; for subjects who do not fulfill the entry criteria for Study SHP647-307) as shown in Figure 1 . Subjects who withdraw early from the 16-week treatment period or who do not wish to enter the maintenance study (SHP647-307) or LTS study (SHP647-304) will c ontinue into a 16-week safety follow-up period. Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigatio nal product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647-305 or SHP647-306) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance study or LTS study. A planned interim analysis for the coprimary endpoints will take place after approximately the first 50% of all randomized subjects in bot h the SHP647-305 and SHP647-306 studies have either completed the studies or have prematurel y withdrawn from the studies.

Rationale for Abdominal Pain Severity Abdominal pain is one of the most common symp toms of CD, with the cause likely to be multifactorial. In the CDAI, which was the most commonly used primary endpoint in CD studies in the past, the degree of abdominal pain was base d on a 4-point scale, with scores ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). However, the new standard is to use the 11-poin t numerical rating scale (NRS) instead for the degree of abdominal pain . The limitation is that the 4-point and the 11-point scales are not directly comparable. Numerous studies across a variety of conditions have examined cutoff scores for mild, moderate, and severe pain based on the 11-point pain NRS, with the findings across studies generally converging on a cutoff score of 4 (reflecting the maximum score indicating mild pain) and a scor e of 5 (reflecting the minimum score indicating moderate pain). To ensure that clinical remission criteria for abdominal pain are both clinically meaningful and fall definitively within the mild pain range on the NRS based on the literature, a remission subscore of ≤3 (a minimum improvement of at least 2 points is required for subjects who enter the study with moderate abdominal pain [subscore of ≥5]) will be used as part of the coprimary endpoints. This definition is furt her supported by a study c onducted in a similar Placebo 25 mg ontamalimab 75 mg ontamalimab Screening: Up to 6 weeks Randomization Maintenance study (SHP647-307) or LTS study (SHP647-304) or 16-week safety follow-up perioda W0 W4 Dosing: Treatment period: 16 weeks Week 16/End of Treatment W8 W12 For non-commercial use only"

Rationale for Very Soft St ool/Liquid Stool Frequency Diarrhea is the most common sign in the presen tation of CD, affecting approximately 85% of patients with a diagnosis of CD. In the CDAI, th e number of liquid or soft stools (each day for 7 days) is used with a multiplier of 2. The copr imary endpoints for clinical remission in studies SHP647-305 and SHP647-306 requires the use of a definition w ithout any such multiplying factor and will use the BSFS for defining the very soft or liquid stools according to types 6 and 7, respectively. A retrospective study of PROs in CD based on data from randomized controlled studies using rifaximin and MTX showed that a mean daily stool frequency score of ≤1.5 had an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of 0.79 (Khanna et al., 2015 ) and provided a potential cutoff for defining remissi on as measured by CDAI. In a recent study to select the attributes determini ng overall disease severity and to rank the importance of and to score these individual attributes for both CD and UC based on sp ecialist opinion, a sample of at least 10 loose stools per week was considered as an attribute contributing to overall disease severity in CD ( Siegel et al., 2016 ). Based on post hoc analyses of the Phase 2 data in the ontamalimab program (Study A7281006, OPERA) and by choosing the population of subjects satisfying the moderate to severe CD inclusion cr iteria, various cutoffs were explored and a stool frequency ≤2.0 was found to be optimal in terms of tr eatment separation while still allowing for a reasonable threshold for remi ssion. Based on these and other rece nt data that support this cutoff, an average daily stool frequency ≤2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) has been chosen as the stool frequency criterion for clinical remission. Endoscopic Response Endoscopic response is defined in 2 ways: • 25% reduction in SES-CD sc ore (“endoscopic response”) • 50% reduction in SES-CD score ( “enhanced endoscopic response”). “Endoscopic response” will be used as a coprimary endpoint and “enhanced endoscopic response” will be used as a key secondary endpoin t in this study as these magnitudes of changes are likely to be clinically relevant. In the recent trial with upadaci tinib, the magnitude of difference between the different doses of the ac tive drug and placebo at Week 16 was reported to be 9% to 36% for endoscopic response and 10% to 20% for enhanced endoscopic response (Sandborn et al., 2017 ). In the post hoc analysis of the Phase 2 OPERA study with ontamalimab the magnitude of difference between the active treatment arms and placebo showed a similar pattern (higher for the endos copic response than for enhanced endoscopic response) ( D'Haens et al., 2018 ). Mucosal healing or “endoscopic heal ing” is considered to be a pi votal long-term target in the treatment of CD; however, partia l healing or endoscopic response may also provide benefits. Endoscopic response can be an im portant indicato r that the mucosal infl ammation has decreased as an effect of the investigat ional product.

340,page_340,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 46 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 response, even though at a later stage a complete response may occur. Median duration of remission after 1 year treatment with infliximab was similar in subjects achieving complete absence of mucosal ulcer to subjects who achie ved significant but inco mplete mucosal healing (D'Haens et al., 2002 ). The benefit of endoscopic response was also shown in the SONIC study; the presence of endoscopic response (defined in that study as at least a 50% decrease in endoscopic score at Week 26 of treatment) identifie d subjects most likely to be in corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 50 ( Ferrante et al., 2013 ). The proportion of patients requiring major abdominal surgery in a single-cen ter cohort study with infliximab was similar with complete healing or with partial healing. ( Schnitzler et al., 2009 ; Panaccione et al., 2013 ). Subjects with such a treatment response should be identified by endoscopic assessment in order not to misclassify them as nonresponders and undere stimate the response to the treatment. 3.1.2 Rationale for Key Secondary Endpoints Clinical Remission Defined by CDAI Score Conventionally, a CDAI score of <150 has been used to define clinical remission. While there has been widespread use of the CDAI over a lo ng period of time, the items do not contribute equally to the score, and sympto m items reported by subjects are not specific for CD and are not sensitive for inflammation seen at colonoscopy. Th ere has been movement away from using the CDAI by regulatory authorities to the use of PROs and objective measures of disease such as endoscopy ( Williet et al., 2014 ). However, for benchmarking or for comparative effectiveness purposes, CDAI endpoints are expected to be used. Although this has been the established gold-standard for clinical remission to date, CDAI suffers from requiring complex calculations across 8 individual items includi ng subjective elements. Clinical Remission Defined by Average Daily Abdominal Pain ≤1 (Based on the 4-point Scale) and Average Daily Stool Frequency ≤3 of Type 6/7 The CDAI has been the traditionally used meas ure to assess clinical response and clinical remission in CD. In the CDAI, the degree of abdomi nal pain is one of 8 variables and is used with a multiplier of 5 in the overall score. Importan tly, it is based on a 4-point scale, with scores ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). With the shift to the new endpoint as evident from the coprimary endpoint of clinical remission in this study, it is still important to allow for a frame of reference to the existing standard for response, based on the CDAI components. A daily average abdominal pain threshold of ≤1 will help achieve this as 1 on the 4-point scale corresponds to mild abdominal pain. Although direct mapping between the scales has not been established, this will approximate to a score of 3 on the 11-point NR S scale, as this falls within the mild pain range on the NRS based on the literature. Based on post hoc analyses of the Phase 2 data in the ontamalimab program, regulatory requirements, and treatment separation assumptions, a threshold for th e average daily stool frequency ≤2 of type 6/7 (very soft st ools/liquid stools) was chosen for the coprimary endpoint of clinical remission. However, given the limited data available for this en dpoint, recent evidence For non-commercial use only"
341,page_341,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 from literature suggesting that thresholds ≤3 are likely to be quite stringent ( Sandborn et al., 2017), and the refractory nature of the disease in those with moderate to severe CD, it is also important to assess the effects of treatment using a more realistic measure. Hence, for this key secondary endpoint of clinical remi ssion, average daily stool frequency ≤3 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) has been chosen as the appropriate threshold. Clinical Response The goal of measuring clinical remission is to ha ve a sensitive clinical measure to assess the complete absence of symptoms or the stabiliza tion of noninflammatory symptoms. However, as response and remission are considered to be on a continuum of improvement or response to treatment, clinical remission is generally th e chosen measurement ove r clinical response. Therefore, clinical remission is used as coprimary endpoint and c linical response is used as a key secondary endpoint in this study. Clinical response is defined in Section 9.8.2.1. For both clinical response criteria, an additional requirement is that the symptom not being used to assess clinical response (ie, abdominal pain severity or very soft stool/liquid stool freque ncy) must remain unchanged/not worsen from the baseline score, or meet the criteria for clinical remission for that item of the 2-item PRO (either a 2-item PRO subscore of av erage daily stool frequency ≤2 of type 6/7 [very soft stools/liquid stools] as shown in the BSFS or av erage worst daily abdominal pain ≤3 [based on 11-point NRS] over the 7 most recent days). The rationale for needing to meet at a minimum clinical response definition for either abdominal pain severity or very soft stool/liquid stool fr equency (and not necessarily both) is based on the supposition that a lack of improvement in 1 of th ese symptoms is not nece ssarily an indicator of eventual lack of response (as assessed by the stricter clinical remi ssion criterion). Based on Phase 2 data, it has been observed that the magni tude of placebo response rate can be higher for abdominal pain than for stool frequency. Therefore, the additional criterion of at least a 2-point decrease in abdominal pain severi ty from baseline is re quired for assessing clinical response for abdominal pain. Overall, the defini tion of clinical response used for this study has been chosen to allow for the maximal pool of subjects to be assessed for the effect of treatment and, if appropriate, the continuation of thera py in the maintenance study (SHP647-307). Composite Score Endpoint of Both Clinical Remission by 2-item PRO and Endoscopic Response at Week 16 In theory, as the degree of infl ammation decreases due to the eff ect of treatment, both clinical signs and symptoms of CD as well as endosco pic appearance can improve. However, in any given subject, the rates of c linical improvement and endoscopic improvement may not be the same. There are reasons for this discrepanc y when evaluating clinical and endoscopic improvement in the same time period, including clinical symptoms not being well correlated to the mucosal inflammation. Due to the transmur al feature of the disease, symptoms can correspond to the inflammation in some of the other gut layers as well. Prev ious clinical studies and clinical observations indicate that the improvement of clinical signs and symptoms and the improvement in endoscopic appearance may not go hand in hand. Significant clinical improvement can precede significant endoscopic improvement. The healing process of the gut For non-commercial use only"

Therefore, when evaluating clin ical remission together with e ndoscopic endpoints, improvement in endoscopic scores could be more relevant than evaluating mucosal healing in the induction phase. For these reasons, the key secondary composite endpoint (whi ch takes into account both clinical and endoscopic response to treatment in the same subject) cons ists of the evaluation of the clinical remission together with the endoscopic response. Complete Endoscopic Healing Endoscopic healing will be defined in 2 ways: • Endoscopic healing defined by SES-CD ≤4 and at least a 2-point reduction versus baseline (Visit 2) and no subscore >1 in any individual variable • Complete endoscopic healing defined by SES-CD=0-2. There is no uniformly accepted definition for en doscopic healing in CD and several different terminologies are used to describe the sa me endoscopic appearance defined by a certain endoscopic score (eg, endoscopic remission a nd mucosal healing). Endoscopic healing or mucosal healing is predominantly defined by the absence of mucosal ulcerations in CD during endoscopic assessment of intestinal inflammation ( Atreya and Neurath, 2017). The International Organization for the study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease technical review on endoscopic indices for CD clinical studies defined co mplete endoscopic healing as SES-CD=0-2 ( Vuitton et al., 2016). Some studies introduced SES-CD ≤4 as “endoscopic remission”. The more stringent endpoint of “complete endoscopic healing” will be used as a key secondary endpoint in this study. Even in case of complete endoscopic he aling, there may still be ongoing histological activity in many cases and it may not always refl ect healing of all layers of the tissue, as endoscopy only addresses mucosal rather than transmural healing (Atreya and Neurath, 2017). The importance of inducing endoscopic healing is that it may be associated with long-term symptomatic remission; longer relapse-free inte rval; reduced frequency of hospitalizations, complications, and surgical resections; and the po tential for a significant improvement in quality of life ( Peyrin-Biroulet et al., 2011 ). 3.2 Duration and Study Completion Definition Each subject’s final visit in th is study may be at the end of the treatment period (Week 16), if continuing to Study SHP647-307 or SHP647-304, or at the end of the safety follow-up period (Week 32), if not continuing to either of these stud ies. In either case, the final visit will be in person at the site. A subject’s maximum dura tion of participation is expected to be approximately 38 weeks: a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a treatment period of 16 weeks, and a safety follow-up period of 16 weeks (if appli cable). It is expected that the study will be completed in approximately 3 years. For non-commercial use only"

Subjects who have no history of previously di agnosed active or latent TB are excluded if they have a positive Mantoux (PPD) tuberculin skin test (ie ≥5 mm induration) or a positive IGRA (the latter to be tested at the site’s local laboratory) during screening or within 12 weeks before screening. If the IGRA cannot be performed locally, a central laboratory may be used, with pr ior agreement from the sponsor. • An IGRA is strongly recommended fo r subjects with a prior Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination but may be us ed for any subject. Documentation of IGRA product used and the test result must be in the subject's source documentation if performed locally. Acceptable IGRA products include QuantiFERON ®-TB Gold Plus In-Tube Test. • If the results of the IGRA are indetermin ate, the test may be repeated, and if a negative result is obtained, en rollment may proceed. In subjects with no history of treated active or latent TB, a positive test on repeat will exclude the subject. Subjects with a history of active or latent TB infection must follow instructions for “Subjects with a prior di agnosis of active or late nt TB are excluded unless both of the following criteria ar e met” in this criterion. • Subjects with repeat indeterminate IGRA results, with no prior TB history, may be enrolled after consultation with a pulm onary or infectious disease specialist who determines low risk of infection (ie, subject would be acceptable for immunosuppressant [eg, anti-TNF] treatme nt without additional action).

Smoking is considered to be a risk factor for CD. Reports have shown that smoking is not only related to the onset, relapse, a nd exacerbation of CD, but also that smoking cessation lowers the postoperative recurrence rate ( Ueno et al., 2013 ). Subjects should inform the investigator of any changes to their smoking habits during the study (including starting or st opping smoking). Use of nicotine patches should be recorded as concomitant medication (see Section 5.2.1). 4.4 Reproductive Potential The potential effects of ontama limab on embryofetal or postnatal development have not been assessed in humans. Preliminary results from an enhanced pre- and postnatal development toxicity study of ontamalimab in nonhuman primat es indicated that, at the dose levels tested (30 and 60 mg/kg), infant losses were incr eased in ontamalimab-exposed animals when compared both to control animals in the study and to the historical control animal data from the testing facility. The relevance of this findi ng to humans is unknown but cannot be excluded. Based on the exposure in the Phase 2 clinical study A7281009 (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] from 0 to 672 hours [AUC 0-672h ] at 6140 µg·h/mL following repeated SC administration of 75 mg SHP647 Q4W), matern al exposure (AUC) in cynomolgus monkeys within a similar duration at 30 and 60 mg/kg on ce every 10 days is approximately 77 times and 172 times the clinical ex posure, respectively.

351,page_351,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 57 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 To minimize the risk of unintentional exposure of the embryo or fetus in the clinical study, all sexually active male and female subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are biologically capable of having children and with their partners are at risk of pregnancy, must agree to use an appropriate form of contracep tion (ie, highly effective methods for female and medically appropriate methods for male study subj ects), in accordance with the package instructions/leaflet, for the durat ion of the active treatment period and for at least 16 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. True abstinence is considered to be a highly effective contraception (ie, a method that results in a failure rate of <1% per year) when it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovul ation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to investigational product, and withdrawal are not appropriate methods of contraception. During screening, the investigator or designee in consultation w ith the subject will confirm the subject’s childbearing po tential status. For subjects of childbearing potential, it must be confirmed and documented that the subject ha s selected the most appropriate method of contraception (ie, highly effective methods for female and medically appropriate methods for male study subjects) from the permitted list of contraception methods. Subjects must affirm the consistent and correct use of at least 1 of th ese selected methods. Regular contraception check discussions will take place at the time points specified in Table 1 (ie, at each site visit) and will be documented. In addition, the subject must be instructed to call the site immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinue d or if pregnancy is known or suspected. 4.4.1 Contraceptive Methods for Female Study Subjects Sexually active females of childbearing potential must already be usi ng an established highly effective form of contraception and must be advi sed to use appropriate contraceptives throughout the study period and for 16 weeks following the last dose of investigational product. If hormonal contraceptives are used, they should be admi nistered according to the package insert. Contraception methods with low user dependency should preferably be used, in particular when contraception is introduced as a result of partic ipation in the clinical study. The following highly effective contraceptive methods are considered to be methods with low user dependency: • Intrauterine device • Intrauterine hormone-releasing system • Bilateral tubal occlusion • Male sterilization/vasectomized partner • Implantable progesterone-only hormonal contra ception associated with inhibition of ovulation.

Females of childbearing potential must agree to practice true abstinence (refrain from sexual activity that could result in pregnancy) or agree to use appropriate methods of highly effective contraception. Highly effective contraception (ie, methods that result in a failur e rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly) are: • Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraceptives associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) stabilized for at least 30 days before screening (Visit 1) • Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associ ated with inhibition of ovulation plus a barrier method • Intrauterine device • Intrauterine hormone-releasing system • Bilateral tubal occlusion • Male sterilization/vasectomized partner with documented absence of sperm in the postvasectomy ejaculate • True abstinence (see Section 4.4). 4.4.2 Contraceptive Methods for Male Study Subjects Contraception is required for all sexually active male subjects, who with their female sexual partners, must agree to use one of the followi ng appropriate methods of contracept ion throughout the study period and for 16 weeks following th e last dose of inve stigational product. Appropriate methods of contracep tion for male subjects are: • Male condom with spermicide; however, if spermicide is not available in the country, additional contraception (ie, one of those listed below) must be used in addition to a male condom • Male sterilization with documented absence of sperm in the postvasectomy ejaculate.

The investigator or sponsor may withdraw the subject at any time (eg, in the inte rest of subject safety). The investigator is encouraged to discuss withdraw al of a subject from investig ational product with the medical monitor when possible. If investigational product is discontinued, regardless of the reason, the evaluations listed for Week 16/early termination (ET; Visit 7) are to be performed. All subjects who discontinue treatment with investigational product should also undergo the protocol-specified 16-week safety follow-up period. In the event that subjects are unable to attend in person for the follow-up visits, all efforts should be made to collect info rmation on AEs and concomitant medications. Comments (spontaneous or elicited) or complain ts made by the subject must be recorded. The reason for termination and date of stopping investigational product must be recorded. Subjects who discontinue will not be replaced. 4.5.1 Subject Withdrawal Criteria Additional reasons a subject may be withdrawn from study treatment include but are not limited to: • Adverse events • Serious AEs • Pregnancy • Protocol deviations • Failure to return for visits.

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 6.1 Identity of Investigational Product The test product is ontamalimab, which will be provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution for SC administration in a glass PFS with a fixed needle. Each PFS contains 1 mL of ontamalimab solution for injection at an appropria te concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 or 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current ontamalimab IB. The reference product is placebo, which will be pr ovided in a PFS with a fixed needle containing 1 mL of placebo solution for SC administrati on. The placebo solution will contain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain ontamalimab. 6.1.1 Blinding the Treatment Assignment The placebo syringes and solution will match the ontamalimab syringes in appearance. The fill volume for all syringes will be the same. 6.2 Administration of Inve stigational Products 6.2.1 Interactive Response Technology for Investigational Product Management An interactive response technology (IRT) system will be used for screening and enrolling subjects, recording subject visits, randomizati on, investigational product supply dispensation and management, inventory management and supply ordering, investigational product expiration tracking and management, and emergency unblin ding. Please refer to the Study Manual for additional details regarding the IRT system. 6.2.2 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The actual treatment given to individual subjects is determined by a randomization schedule. Eligible subjects will be randomi zed in a ratio of 3:3:2 via a computer-generated randomization schedule to receive SC injections of 25 mg ontamalimab, 75 mg ontamalimab, or placebo, respectively. The randomization wi ll be performed centrally and stratified by status of prior anti-TNF therapy (2 strata: naïve versus experien ced), glucocorticoid use at baseline (2 strata: on glucocorticoids at baseline versus not on glucocorticoids at baseline), and SES-CD at baseline (2 strata: SES-CD ≥17 at baseline versus SES-CD <17 at baseline). To ensure that the allocation of subjects with prior anti-TNF therapy exposure is similar to that observed in previous studies, the percentage of subjects with prior exposu re to treatment with anti-TNF therapy exposure will be capped at 60% of the sample populati on. There will be no cap on the number of anti-TNF naïve subjects randomized. Subject numbers are assigned to all eligible subjec ts as they consent to take part in the study. Within each site (numbered uniquely within a pr otocol), the subject number will be assigned to subjects according to the sequence of presentation for study participation.

360,page_360,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 66 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 The randomization number represents a unique nu mber corresponding to i nvestigational product allocated to the subject, once elig ibility has been determined. Individual subject treatment will be automatically assigned by the IRT system. Investigational product packag ing identification numbers, separate from randomization numbers/unique identifiers, may also be assigned to subjects for specific treatment assignment as dictated by the study. In these cases, the same investigational product packing identification number may not be assigned to more than 1 subject. 6.2.3 Dosing Investigational product (ontamalimab or placeb o) will be administered subcutaneously by qualified site personnel Q4W (Week s 0, 4, 8, and 12). See Section 7.2 for the timing of dosing relative to other procedures. Investigational product shoul d be administered in the anterolate ral right or left thigh. If there are clinical reasons why the inve stigational product ca nnot be administered in the thigh, the investigational product ma y be administered in the deltoid area or abdomen with appropriate documentation. The location of the investigatio nal product administration will be recorded. After the first administration of investigati onal product, the subject must be observed by a member of the study staff for at least 30 minutes (the total duration should be determined at the discretion of the investigator). For subsequent administrations, obser vation of the subject is at the discretion of the investigator. In jection site and allergic reactio n monitoring should be completed by a member of the study staff. Investigator-directed delays in dosing due to abnormal laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the subject shou ld continue with the treatment. Only those subjects w ho complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647-305 or SHP647-306) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance study or LTS study. The investigator, or an appr oved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all investigational product is dispen sed by qualified staff members. 6.2.4 Unblinding the Treatment Assignment Whenever possible, the investigat or or subinvestigator should c ontact the Shire physician and/or assigned medical monitor before breaking the b lind. It is understood that in an emergency situation it may not be possible to communicate with the study team before breaking the blind. The safety of the subject should be of primary concern. When the blinding code is broken the reasons must be fully documented. In the event that the treatment assignment is broken, the date, the sign ature of the person who broke the code, and the reason for breaking the code are reco rded on the IRT and the source documents. Upon breaking the blind, the subject is withdrawn from the study, but should be followed up for safety purposes. The IRT will notify the relevant personnel in the event of any code break. Code-break information is held by the pharmacist/designated person at the site. For non-commercial use only"

STUDY PROCEDURES 7.1 Study Schedule The investigator may schedule visits (unschedul ed visits) in addition to those listed on the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 ), in order to conduct evaluati ons or assessments required to protect the well-being of the subject. 7.1.1 Screening Period 7.1.1.1 Screening Visit (Visit 1) Subjects will be screened within 6 weeks before the baseline visit (Visit 2) to determine eligibility to participate in the study and to perform the othe r assessments and procedures specified in Table 1 . Each subject or subject’ s parent or legally author ized representative must participate in the informed consent process and provide written informed consent/assent before any assessments or procedures specified in the protocol are performed. Screening assessments will take place over more than 1 day (at least 2 vi sits will be necessary to complete the screening procedures, including colonoscopy). A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent or assent, as applicable (and whose parents or legally authorized repr esentatives have given informed c onsent, as applicable), failed to meet the inclusion criteria a nd/or met at least 1 of the excl usion criteria, and has not been randomized or administered investigationa l product. A subject may be rescreened if their condition ha s changed and they may potentially be eligible. Subjects may be rescreened 1 time. Note: Screen ing laboratory tests, if considered by the investigator to be transient and inconsistent with the subject’s clinical condition, may be repeated once during the screening period for confirmation. Results of repeated tests must be reviewed for eligibility prior to the screening colonoscopy procedure. Hematology samples should be repeated if more than 3 weeks have elap sed before the day of colonoscopy to be able to use the hematocrit central laboratory resu lts for the CDAI score calculation at screening. Hematocrit must not be older than 3 weeks before the day of colonoscopy. Collection of the daily e-diary data must begin at least 10 days before colonoscopy preparation. Note that the subject must be confirmed as meeting the CDAI and PRO subscore requirements per inclusion criteria 4a and 4b before a colonoscopy is done. Colonoscopy preparation will be according to local routine. Colonoscopy during the screening pe riod must be performed preferably within 5 to 7 days, but no later than 10 days before base line (Visit 2), to allow for adequate e-diary data collection for the 2-item PRO and CDAI scores and to obtain the centrally read endoscopic subscore to verify the subject’s eligib ility (see Section 7.2.2.4). Colonoscopy preparation may be done on the same day as the colonoscopy procedure. If the calculated CDAI scores is <220 or >450, or the PRO scores are outside the eligibility thresholds, the subject will be considered a screen failure and For non-commercial use only"

All colonoscopies will be evaluated using the SES-CD (see Appendix 2). If a subject has had the following procedures perform ed as a part of standard medical care within 12 weeks before screening (Visit 1) , these procedures do not need to be repeated as a part of screening: • Chest x-ray • Documented negative PPD test or IGRA for TB. 7.1.1.2 Baseline Visit (Visit 2; Week 0) The baseline visit (Visit 2) will take place on Da y 1 (Week 0). The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1 will be performed. After eligibility has been reconfirmed and all baseline procedures and assessments have been completed, each subject will be randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment groups as described in Section 6.2.2 and the first dose of investigational product will be administered. Results of the baseline laboratory tests are not required for inve stigational product administration but must be reviewed as soon as possible thereafter. 7.1.2 Treatment Period 7.1.2.1 Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 are scheduled to take pl ace on Day 14 ±3 days (Week 2), Day 28 ±3 days (Week 4), Day 56 ±3 days (Week 8), and Day 84 ±3 days (Week 12), respectively. The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1 will be performed. 7.1.2.2 Final On-treatment Visit: Visit 7, Parts 1, 2, and 3 (Week 16/Early Termination) The Week 16/ET visit (Visit 7) consists of 3 parts. Part 1 of Visit 7 can either be done on the same day as Part 2 or be done up to 3 day(s) before Part 2. If Parts 1 and 2 are done on the same day, blood samples must be taken before starting the colonoscopy preparation. The Week 16/ET assess ments and procedures that will take place during Part 1 are specified in Table 1 . Part 2 of Visit 7 must be completed within 10 days (preferably within 5 to 7 days) before Part 3; this will allow sufficient time to obtain the data from the centrally read colonoscopy. The Week 16/ET assessments and procedures that wi ll take place during Part 2 are specified in Table 1 . Part 3 of Visit 7 will take place on Day 112 ±3 days.

Entry into the maintenance or LTS studies is depende nt upon whether the subject fulfills the efficacy entry criteria of the maintenance study (SHP 647-307), including achieving endoscopic and/or clinical response, and whether the subject agrees to participate. The Week 16 assessments and procedures will al so form the ET assessments for any subjects who are withdrawn early or discontinued from the study. 7.1.3 Follow-up Period Subjects who are withdrawn early from the study, or who do not enter either the maintenance or LTS studies, should enter the 16-week safety follow-up period for safety monitoring. During the safety follow-up period, the Week 24 visit (Visit 8) will take place on Day 168 ±7 days, or 8 weeks ±7 days after the su bject’s last visit in the treatment period for subjects who are withdr awn early from the study. This visit will routinely be conducted by telephone; however, as an exception, the visit can be performed as a study site visit if preferred. At the end of the safety follow-up period, there will be a visit at the site on Day 224 ±7 days, or 16 weeks ±7 days after the subject’s last visi t in the treatment period for subjects who are withdrawn early from the study; th is visit will form the Week 32 visit (Visit 9). The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1 will be performed, including querying for SAEs, AEs, and concomitant medications and procedures. All AEs a nd SAEs that are not resolved at the time of this visit will be followed to closure (see Section 8.1). Subjects who are proceeding to the maintenance or LTS studies will not enter the safety follow-up period. 7.1.4 Additional Care of Subj ects After the Study No aftercare is planned for this study. 7.2 Study Evaluations and Procedures Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol-required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is antici pated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside the control of the investig ator, that may make it un feasible to perform the tests and procedures.

Note: Blood and tissue samples may be stor ed for up to the duration allowed by local regulations, but for no lo nger than 25 years. 7.2.1 Demographic and Other Ba seline Characteristics Demographic characteristics will be recorded at screening (Visit 1). 7.2.2 Efficacy 7.2.2.1 Patient-reported Outcome – Crohn’s Disease Daily E-diary Patient-reported CD clinical signs and symptom data will be collected daily using a PRO-CD daily e-diary (electronic handhe ld device) starting during th e screening pe riod; however, collection of the daily e-diary data must begin at least 10 days before colonoscopy preparation. Subjects will enter data on CD signs and symp toms items using the e-diary, which will be provided to subjects at the st art of the study. Compliance will be assessed by site staff at each visit. The site staff will instruct the subject on the appropriate use of the e-diary when compliance is below 80% (eg, <23 out of 28 e-diary entries). If at leas t 70% compliance cannot be achieved after repeated inst ructions during the screening period, noncompliant subjects will be automatically noneligible as they will not fulfill inclusion criterion 1 (see Section 4.1). Subjects will be asked to record the following signs and symptom data, as experienced over the previous 24 hours, in the e-diary: • Abdominal pain severity ( numeric rating scale [NRS]) • Very soft stool/liquid stool fre quency (as shown by BSFS type 6/7) • Total stool frequency • Rectal bleeding frequency • Rectal urgency frequency • Nausea severity • Vomiting frequency • Incontinence frequency • Abdominal pain used in CDAI • General well-being.

The 2-item PRO will be calculated using the following criteria: • Screening: the 2-item PRO will be calculated based on the 7 most recent days during the 10 days of data collection before the colonoscopy preparati on. If 7 out of the 10 most recent days are not available, then the 2-item PRO cannot be calculated for the subject at screening. Note that the subject must be confirmed as meeting the PRO subscore requirements at screening before a colonoscopy is done. • Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6: the 2-item PRO will be calculated based on the 7 most recent days during the 10 days of data collection before th e visit. If fewer than 7 days are available, the 2-item PRO will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5 days are available, the 2-item PRO will be treated as missing. • Visit 7 (Part 3): the 2-item PRO will be calculated based on the 7 most recent days during the 10 days of data collection before the co lonoscopy preparation. If fewer than 7 days are available, the 2-item PRO will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5 days are available, th e 2-item PRO will be treated as missing. For all 2-item PRO calculations, th e 7 most recent days may or may not be contiguous during the 10 days of data collection depending on days to be excluded because of missing data. The PRO-CD daily e-diary is presented in Appendix 2. 7.2.2.2 Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease The SES-CD will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1 . The SES-CD score at baseline (Visit 2) and at Week 16/ET will be calc ulated using subscores of each of the segments investigated and centrally read from the colonoscopies performed at screening (Visit 1, Part 2) and Week 16 (Visit 7, Part 2), respectively. The SES-CD is a simple scoring system based on 4 endoscopic variables (presence and size of ulcers, proportion of surface covered by ulcers, proportion of affected surface, and presence and severity of stenosis [narrowing]) measured in the same 5 ileocolonic segments as the CD index of severity ( Daperno et al., 2004). Overall, values on the SES- CD range from 0 to 56, with higher values indicating more seve re disease. The 4 endoscopic vari ables are scored from 0 to 3 in each bowel segment (ileum, right/t ransverse/left colon, and rectum): • Presence and size of ulcers (none = sc ore 0; diameter 0.1–0.5 cm = score 1; 0.5–2 cm = score 2; diameter >2 cm = score 3) • Extent of ulcerated surface (none = 0; <10% =1; 10%–30% = 2; >30% = 3); extent of affected surface (none = 0; <50% = 1; 50%–75% = 2; >75% = 3) • Presence and type of narrowings (none = 0; single, can be passed = 1; multiple, can be passed = 2; cannot be passed = 3). A complete colonoscopy is requir ed (including visualization of th e terminal ileum except when it is not possible due to impassable stenosis or previous partial colectomy/ileocolectomy). The maximum stenosis score in a segment distal to another evaluable segment cannot exceed 2, so that the stenosis scores cannot exceed a total of 11 ( Reinisch et al., 2017 ).

Study videos will be scored separately by 2 centr al readers who are blinded to the treatment. If the central readers’ scores are not in agreement, there will be a third adjudication read to select the correct read from the first 2 scores. Results of the central reading of the videos will be communicated to sites within 5 business days. For the evaluation of efficacy, in cases where 1 or 2 segments cannot be fully evaluated by central endoscopic readers, ileocolonic segments that are evaluable during screening (Visit 1) and Week 16/ET (matching segments approach) will be utilized. The SES-CD is presented in Appendix 2. 7.2.2.3 Crohn’s Disease Activity Index The CDAI is a composite measure with 8 compone nts; 3 components (abdominal pain severity, very soft stool/liquid stool frequency, and general well-being) will be self-reported by the subject and will be recorded as part of the daily e-diary, as described in Section 7.2.2.1 and 5 components will be recorded at the time points specified in Table 1 .

Change in CDAI has been used as a primary endpoint in multiple pivotal studies in the CD indication. The algorithm for calculating the CD AI score was first published by William Best and colleagues ( Best et al., 1976 ). The CDAI is presented in Appendix 2. 7.2.2.4 Colonoscopy and Histology Colonoscopy will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1 . Bowel preparation regimens typically incorpor ate dietary modificati ons along with oral cathartics. Typically, the standard dose of a bow el preparation is split between the day before and the morning of the procedure; however, bowel preparation can be done entirely on the morning of the procedure. In this study, bowel preparation and colonos copy are to be conducted per local routine; however, sodium phosphate ba sed preparations must be avoided, as such regimens can produce mucosal changes that mimic IBD. In general, a complete colonoscopy should be performed; this includes visualization of the rectum, sigmoid colon, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, ile ocecal valve, and the terminal ileum (except after partial colectomy/ileocolectom y when the aim is to visualize the remaining colon and, if it exists, the terminal ileum). At screening, incomplete colonoscopy will be accepted only on a case by case basis (eg, presence of impassable narrowing without any clinical signs of bowel obstruction and when the same time the investigated segments provide the SES-CD score required for inclusion). Sim ilarly, a complete colonoscopy is the aim at Week 16/ET, with the exception of the presence of impassable stenosis or other CD-related complications as cause of failure to complete the colonoscopy procedure. The position of the endoscope will be based on the length of the instrument at various levels of insertion as well as the morphol ogical features of the intestin e as seen during colonoscopy. To achieve consistency in capturi ng and assessing endoscopic video recordings, each participating site will use an integrated hardware/software so lution and associated tools for the capture and transmission of endoscopy video recordings for central reading. Nonread able endoscopic images, as assessed by the investigator, should not be sent for central reading. The colonoscopy report and any photographs and/or video recordings taken during the pro cedure per local custom should be filed in the subj ect’s medical record. For non-commercial use only"

Co lonoscopy and biopsy procedures will be defined in a colonoscopy instructions manual and/or refere nce card(s), on which all sites will be trained. Colonoscopy results will be re viewed by a central reader. (see Appendix 2). Biopsies for conventional histologic asse ssment will be collected in formalin and shipped to the central laboratory. The central laboratory will register all biopsies and create paraffin blocks. Blocks will be batched and shipped on an agreed schedule to specialty laboratory, where tissue processi ng (sectioning, hematoxylin and eo sin staining, and affixation to glass slides), digitalization, and uploading of images will occur.

Adverse event incidence rates will not be calculated from these neurological evaluati on data but rather from the AE information recorded by the investigator. 7.2.3.4 Adverse Event Collection At each study visit, subjects will be questione d in a general way to ascertain if AEs have occurred since the previous visit (eg, “Have you had any health problems since your last visit?”). Adverse events are collected from the time inform ed consent and/or assent is signed until the end of the defined follow-up period stated in Section 7.1.3 (See Section 8, Adverse and Serious Adverse Events Assessment.) 7.2.3.5 Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured at the time points specified in Table 1 . Additional collection times or changes to collection times will be permitted, as necessary to ensure appropriate collection of safety data. Vital signs include blood pressure , pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature. Single measurements of sitting blood pressure will be recorded at each time point. Blood pressure should be determined by cuff with the subject’s arm supported at the level of the heart and recorded to the nearest mmHg using the same method, the same arm (preferably the dominant arm), and the same position throughout the study.

When timing of measurements coincide, ECGs should be perf ormed before laboratory blood collection and endoscopic procedure. A central ECG reader will be used in this study. The eligibility of the subject is based on the assessment of the ECG by the investigator. If abnormal results are observed following assessment by the central reader, th e investigator, in consultation with the appointed sponsor or contract research organization ( CRO) medical monitor, reconfirms subject eligibility to continue. 7.2.3.9 Chest X-ray A chest x-ray will be performed during screening (Visit 1). If a subject has had a chest x-ray performed as a part of standard medical care w ithin 12 weeks before screening (Visit 1), it does not need to be repeated as a part of screening.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire The IBDQ is a psychometrically validated PRO in strument for measuring the disease-specific HRQL in subjects with IBD, including CD. Th e IBDQ consists of 32 items, which are grouped into 4 domains: bowel function, systemic sympto ms, emotional status, and social function ( Irvine et al., 1994 ). The 4 domains are scored as follows: • Bowel symptoms: 10 to 70 • Systemic symptoms: 5 to 35 • Emotional function: 12 to 84 • Social function: 5 to 35. The total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224. For th e total score a nd each domain, a higher score indicates better HRQL. A score of at least 170 corresponds to clinical remission and an increase of at least 16 points is cons idered to indicate a clinic ally meaningful improvement. The IBDQ is presented in Appendix 2.

ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVER SE EVENTS ASSESSMENT 8.1 Definition of Adverse Events, Period of Observation, Recording of Adverse Events An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessa rily have a causal re lationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavor able and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempora lly associated with th e use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whethe r or not related to the medici nal (investigational) product (International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] Guidance E2A 1995). All AEs are collected from the tim e the informed consent and/or assent is signed until the end of the defined follow-up period stated in Section 7.1.3 . This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the study, regardless of whether or not investigational product is administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather th an a list of symptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each symptom should be listed individually. All AEs should be captured in the subject’s sour ce document. In addition to unto ward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured in the subject’s source document. All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achie ved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsen ing of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severity of AEs must be re corded during the course of the event including the start and stop dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event. Worsening of pretreatment events, after initia tion of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dyspepsia before dosing of investigational product, but the dyspepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administ ered, a new AE of severe dyspepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded in the subject’s source document). For non-commercial use only"
382,page_382,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 88 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 The medical assessment of severity is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The even t does not generally interfere with usual activ ities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therap eutic intervention. The event interferes with usual ac tivities of daily living, causing di scomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 8.1.2 Relationship Categorization A physician/investigator must make the assessmen t of relationship to investigational product for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have be en caused by the investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggest ing a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related.” Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undeterm ined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.” The causality assessment must be documented in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition Related The temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other ther apies, or accident. Not Related The event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event. 8.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest will be captu red and monitored during th is study. Investigators will report all AESIs to the sponsor, regardless of causality, using the same timelines as described for SAE reporting (see Section 8.2.2). The following describes the AESIs and the criteria for reporting AESIs. For non-commercial use only"
383,page_383,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 89 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 8.1.3.1 Hypersensitivity Potential hypersensitivity, serum sickness, vasculitis, and Arthus reactions to ontamalimab will be regarded as AESIs. These events must be reported on Shire “Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Nonserious AE as Required by the Protocol Form” and within the time frame mandated for SAEs (see Section 8.2.2 ). It is well known that the administration of foreign proteins can cause immune responses including hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis and serum sickness. Other immune responses to foreign proteins include the development of ADAs and NAbs. Monoclonal antibodies have been used in hum an therapeutics since the 1980s. The first monoclonal antibody approved for human use (O RTHOCLONE OKT3®) was a murine protein which caused rapid production of NAbs. Since th en, much effort has been expended to reduce the immunogenicity of these usef ul therapeutic proteins by reduc ing the extent of “foreignness” from chimeric antibodies such as infliximab, to humanized antibodies such as vedolizumab, and finally to fully human antibodies such as adalimumab and ontamalimab ( Isabwe et al., 2018 ) (see Figure 4 ). Figure 4 Potential Immunogenicity of Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies Ontamalimab is a fully human antibody of th e immunoglobulin G2 subclass. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of ontamalimab, in whic h over 700 subjects were treated for up to 3 years, there has been no case of anaphylaxis. There have been 2 reported case s of drug hype rsensitivity: serum sickness attributed to concomitant administration of penici llin; and a reaction characterized by dyspnea, facial erythema, and chest pain with onset 2 days after administration of the fifth dose of ontamalima b. The latter event mimicked a reaction that the subject had previously experienced after 4 doses of infliximab. In additio n, low-titer activity has been observed in ADA assays, includi ng pretreatment samples and placebo-treated subjects, and no subject has had a 2-fold or greater increase in A DA titer. Analysis of PK and clinical parameters has shown no difference between subjects whose ADA assay results are positive as compared with those whose are negative. Nonetheless, the possibility of a hypersensitiv ity reaction occurring af ter drug exposure cannot be fully ruled out. The reactions of concern are Type I (anaphylaxis) and Type III (immune complex) reactions. The clinical presentation of anaphylactic reacti ons is described in Table 5 .

384,page_384,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 90 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 Table 5 Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis (Type I Hypersensitivity) Anaphylaxis is highly likely when the first criterion below and at least one of the following criteria a and b are fulfilled: Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: a) Respiratory compromise (eg, dy spnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stri dor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) b) Reduced BPa or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence). BP=blood pressure; PEF=peak expiratory flow a Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 90 mmHg from 11 to 17 years. Source: Adapted from Sampson et al., 2006 . Type III hypersensitivity responses, including thos e mediated by immune complexes and T cells (delayed hypersensitivity responses in the older literature), are relatively rare with respect to therapeutic protein products and a high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary for the diagnosis (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research - Gu idance for industry: Im munogenicity assessment for therapeutic protein products, 2014). Type III hypersensitivity reactions involve the formation of biologic/ADA immune complexes in the circul ation which, when pr esent in the correct stoichiometric ratio, become deposited in tissues. Once immune complexes are deposited, they can elicit complement activation and inflammation, leading to tissue damage. When immune complexes are deposited in tissues, they tend to localize in small postcapillary venules where there is loss of laminar blood flow , in sites of ultrafiltration wh ere there is high pressure and fenestrated endothelium (eg, chor oid plexus, ciliary body, synovium , and glomeruli), in sites of turbulent blood flow (eg, coronary artery branches off aorta, ao rtic bifurcations, and cardiac valve leaflets), and in re nal glomerular endothelium. Signs and symptoms of immune complex deposit ion typically have onset 1 to 3 weeks after exposure ( Warrington et al., 2018 ) usually improving in 7 to 10 days , with full recovery in 2 to 4 weeks and may include fever, rash (including hi ves), arthralgia, myalgia, vasculitis, Arthus reaction, general ill feel ing, itching, and swollen lymph nodes. Some of these findings, such as fever, rash, arthralgia, and myalgia, are consis tent with findings associated with IBD and may therefore be very difficult to assign to a particular etiology. When such a reaction is suspected, samples for laboratory assessment will be obtained and stored. Tests will be performed if the diagnosis is confirmed and request ed by the adjudication committee.

Outcomes are as follows: • Fatal • Not recovered/Not resolved • Recovered/Resolved • Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae • Recovering/Resolving • Unknown. 8.1.5 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day-to-day fluctuation or expected progre ssion of the disease and ar e part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, si gnificant worsening of the symptoms should be recorded as an AE. 8.1.6 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations A change in the value of a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG assessment can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the investigational product, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of an already abnormal value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the re ference range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment w ith the investigational product, a nd the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference ra nge, must be taken into consideration. If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laborat ory, vital sign, or ECG values which were not present at the pretreatment value observe d closest to the start of study treatment, further investigations should be pe rformed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plau sible explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. The investigator should decide , based on the above criteria a nd the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical labora tory, vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinically significant and therefore represents an AE. 8.1.7 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined follow-up period stated in Section 7.1.3. Any report of pregnancy for any female study participant or the pa rtner of a male study participant must be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department using the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. A copy of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form (and any applicable follow-up For non-commercial use only"

The pregnant female study participant must be withdrawn from the study. Every effort should be made to gather info rmation regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the infant. It is the re sponsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 30 calendar days after th e initial notification and approximate ly 30 calendar days postpartum. If the pregnancy outcome is a live birth, the vital st atus and clinical conditi on of the infant should be obtained and documented at 1 year postpartum. Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and must be reported us ing the Shire “Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Nonserious AE as Required by the Prot ocol Form.” Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SAE. In addition to the above, if the investigator dete rmines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Sh ire “Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Nonserious AE as Required by the Protocol Fo rm” as well as the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Re port Form. The test date of the first positive serum/urine β-hCG test or ultrasound result will dete rmine the pregnancy onset date. 8.1.8 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they result in an AE/SAE as described in Section 8.2. Note: The 24-hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. The categories below are not mutually exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category. • Abuse – Persistent or sporadic intentional inta ke of investigational product when used for a nonmedical purpose (eg, to alte r one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that may be detrimental to the individual and/or society • Misuse – Intentional use of inves tigational product other than as directed or indicated at any dose (Note: this includes a situation wher e the investigational pr oduct is not used as directed at the dose pres cribed by the protocol) • Overdose – Intentional or uninten tional administration of i nvestigational product at a dose interval that is less than 2 weeks between doses • Medication Error – An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of an investigational product. For studies, me dication errors are repo rtable to the sponsor only as defined below. Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigat ional product are not cons idered reportable as medication errors. Medication errors should be collected/repor ted for all products under investigation. For non-commercial use only"

The administration and/or use of an expired i nvestigational product should be considered as a reportable medication error. There is no specific antidote fo r overdose with ontamalimab. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. 8.1.9 Unexpected Adverse Event An unexpected AE is an AE whose nature, severit y, specificity, or outcome is not consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the reference safety information (RSI). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are men tioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacol ogical properties of the product but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation. The expectedness of AEs will be determined by the sponsor using the IB as the RSI. This determination will include considerations such as the number of AEs previously observed, but not on the basis of what might be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of a product. 8.1.10 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is defined as any suspected adverse reaction to study treatment (ie, in cluding active comparators) that is both serious and unexpected. The event(s) must meet all of the following: • Suspected adverse reaction • Serious • Unexpected • Assessed as related to study treatment. 8.2 Serious Adverse Event Procedures 8.2.1 Reference Safety Information The reference for safety information for this st udy is Section 6.8 of th e ontamalimab IB, which the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators. 8.2.2 Reporting Procedures All initial and follow-up SAE reports must be re ported by the investigat or to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department and the CRO/Shire medical monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. Note: The 24-hour repo rting requirement for SA Es does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Section 8.1.8 ) unless they result in an SAE.

A copy of the Shir e “Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Nonserious AE as Required by the Protocol Fo rm” (and any applicable follow-up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monito r using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. 8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose: • Results in death. • Is life-threatening. Note: The te rm “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization. Note: Hospitalizations, which are the result of elective or previously scheduled surgery for pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be cl assified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or previously scheduled surgery that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s). • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. • Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect. • Is an important medical event. Note: Importa nt medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical even ts include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an ED or at home; blood dyscrasias or c onvulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization; or the de velopment of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs (regardless of relati onship to study) are collected fro m the time the subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow-up period stated in Section 7.1.3 and must be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department and the CRO/Shire medical monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigati onal product and discovered by the investigator at any interval af ter the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event.

The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the symptoms resolve, or the date the event is considered chronic. In the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge dates are considered the onse t and resolution dates, respectively. In addition, any signs or sympto ms experienced by the subject af ter signing the informed consent form, leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 8.2.6 Fatal Outcome Any SAE that results in the subject ’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolv ed, without a resolution date recorded. For any SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product shoul d be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The investigational product ac tion of “withdrawn” should not be selected solely as a result of the subject’s death. 8.2.7 Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, and Site Reporting The sponsor or the CRO is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities , US central institutional review boards (IRBs), and European Union (EU) central ethics committees (ECs) of related, unexpected SAEs (ie, SUSARs). In addition, the CRO is responsible for notifying active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs (ie, SUSARs) occurring during all interventional studies across the ontamalimab program. The investigator is responsibl e for notifying the local IRB, lo cal EC, or the relevant local regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required.

Abnormal values in ALT concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other ca uses of liver injury are considered potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) a nd should always be considered important medical events. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug-induced liver injury depends on the subject’s indivi dual baseline values and unde rlying conditions. Subjects who present with the following laboratory abnormalities per Table 6 should be evaluated further to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values. The measurement(s) should be reconfirmed with another blood draw pr eferably within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding of potential concern. Please refer to laboratory manual for further instructions. Guidance for Dosing Interruption: Investigator -directed delays in dosing due to abnormal laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the subject should continue with the treatment. Only those subject s who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647- 305 or SHP647-306) will be eligible to continue in th e maintenance study or LTS study.

DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS 9.1 Data Collection The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information required by the protocol in the eCRF. A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy. Discrepancies between source data and data entered in the e CRF will be addressed by qualified site personnel. When a data discrepancy warrants correction, th e correction will be made by authorized site personnel. Data collection procedures will be discu ssed with the site at th e site initiation visit and/or at the investigator’s meeting. It is exp ected that site personnel will complete the eCRF entry within approximately 3 busines s days of the subject’s visit. 9.2 Clinical Data Management Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management plan. Quality control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data are to be reviewed and checked for om issions, errors, and values requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queri es requiring clarification are to be communicated to the site for resolution. On ly authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner. 9.3 Data Handling Considerations Data that may potentially unbli nd the treatment assignment (ie, investigational product serum concentrations, antibodies to inve stigational product, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparation/accountability data) will be handled with special care during the data cleaning and review process. These data will be handled in such a way that, before unblinding, any data that may unblind study team personnel w ill be presented as blinded information or otherwise will not be made available. If appli cable, unblinded data may be made available to quality assurance representatives for the pur poses of conducting independent drug audits. 9.4 Statistical Analysis Process The study will be analyzed by the sponsor or its agent . The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safety data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study information such as su bject disposition, demogr aphics and baseline characteristics, investigationa l product exposure, and prior an d concomitant medications. The SAP will also include a descripti on of how missing, unused and spur ious data will be addressed. The SAP will be finalized before unblinding to pres erve the integrity of the statistical analysis and study conclusions. For non-commercial use only"
393,page_393,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 99 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® software Version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). Unless otherwise specified, summary tabulations will be presented by treatment group. All data listings will be sorted by treatment group, site, an d subject number, and will include the subject’s age, sex, and race. For categorical variables, the number and percenta ge of subjects within each category (with a category for missing data as needed) of the parameter will be presented. For continuous variables, the number of subjec ts, mean, median, standard de viation, minimum, and maximum values will be presented. 9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Desi gn, Data Monitoring Committee, and Hypersensitivity Adjudication Committee A planned interim analysis for the coprimary endpoints will take place after approximately the first 50% of all randomized subjects in bot h the SHP647-305 and SHP647-306 studies have either completed the studies or have prematurely withdrawn from the studies. Recruitment will not pause for this interim analys is. The purpose of the unblinded in terim analysis is to reassess the appropriateness of the premises used for the coprimary endpoints when the study was designed. There is no possibility to stop early for overwhelming efficacy as the studies must continue in order to enroll an appropriate number of subjects in the SHP647-307 study. The reassessment of sample size will be performed using conditional power methods. Results at the interim analysis may be futile for one or both of the ontamalimab doses and lead to the discontinuation of that dose for CD or the onta malimab CD program. Full details of the interim analysis, the guidelines for increasing the sample size, and futility rule s to stop a dose will be included in a prespecified interim analysis SA P. The interim analysis SAP will be finalized before the interim analysis is conducted. The planned interim analysis will be conducted by an external independent sta tistical group and given to the independent Interim Analysis Revi ew Committee; the individuals involved in the day-to-day conduct of the study will not be involv ed in the interim analysis nor have access to the results of the interim anal ysis. The sponsor will only be no tified by the Interim Analysis Review Committee of recommendations to modify the ontamalimab CD program according to the guidelines specified in the interim analysis SAP. An external DMC will be established to review the overall safety of the study subjects on an ongoing basis. The DMC will be responsible for the ongoing monito ring of safety of subjects enrolled in the study according to the DMC charter. Recommenda tions made by the DMC to alter the conduct of the study or to amend the protocol will be forwarded to Shire for review and for a final decision. Shire or its designee wi ll notify investigative sites and regulatory authorities as appropriate, of DMC recommendati ons (which may include summarie s of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints).

Analyses of the data for DMC review will be conducted according to the DM C charter and DMC SAP. Because no formal hypothesis testing for safety assessments is pl anned, multiplicity concerns regarding repeated analyses are not applicable. An external hypersensitivity adjudication committ ee will be established to review data from subjects who experience a suspected Type I or Type III hypersensitivity reaction in order to confirm the nature and etiol ogy of the reaction, to determin e whether testing should be performed on stored blood samples, and to finalize recommendations of permanent discontinuation or rechallenge with investigational product. Further details regarding the adjudication committee can be found in the adjudication charter. 9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations Graphical methods are used to control the global family-wise Type I error rate (FWER) at the .05 level (2-sided) for the comparisons of the 2 ontamalimab treatment groups with the placebo group. Alpha is initially split equall y at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the coprimary endpoints. Therefore, the power analysis and sample size estimation were calculated based on the chi-squa re test of proportions using nQuery Advisor® Version 7.0 (Statistical Solutions Ltd, Cork, Ireland) for an individual ontamalimab dose compared to placebo. Power calculations are made based on assuming a .025 (2-sided) significance level for each pairwise treatment comparison, 1720 subjects w ill be screened to randomize 1032 subjects in a 3:3:2 allocation ratio: 387 subj ects in the 25 mg ontamalimab treatment group, 387 subjects in the 75 mg ontamalimab treatment group, and 258 s ubjects in the place bo group. These numbers of subjects would yield an appr oximately 93% power to detect individual pairwise treatment difference in the first coprimary efficacy endpoint, clinical remission by 2-item PRO at Week 16, of 10% (17.5% ontamalimab versus 7.5% placebo) . Expected clinical re mission rates by 2-item PRO at Week 16 are based on observed rates from a post hoc analysis of the A7281006 study and placebo remission rates from literature (Sandborn et al., 2017 ). No adjustment for missing data is required in these sample size calculati ons as subjects with missing data for clinical remission by 2-item PRO at Week 16 are imputed as failures and the above rates account for these subjects. With the 1032 subjects in allocation noted a bove, this number of subjects would yield an approximately 94% power to detect individual pairwise treatment difference in the other coprimary efficacy endpoint, endoscopic respon se at Week 16, of 12.5% (27.5% ontamalimab versus 15% placebo). Expected endoscopic respon se rates at Week 16 are based on observed rates from a post hoc analysis of the A7281006 study and also endoscopic response rates from literature ( Sandborn et al., 2017 ). No adjustment for missing data is required in these sample size calculations as subjects with missing data for endoscopic response at Week 16 are imputed as failures and the above rates account for these subjects.

395,page_395,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 101 SHP647-305 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 22 Nov 2019 The overall power for the coprimary endpoints will be approximately 87% assuming no correlation between the tests on the endpoints and approximately 90% assuming a correlation of 0.4. With the sample size of 1032 subjects, Table 7 provides the power for detecting a treatment difference between a ontamalimab treatment group and the placebo group for the key secondary endpoints.

The 7 most recent days may or may not be contiguous during the 10 days of data collection before colonoscopy preparation, depending on days to be excluded because of missing data. If fewer than 7 days are available, the endpoi nt will be calculated on all available most recent 6 or 5 days. If fewer than 5 days are available, the endpoint will be treated as missing. • Endoscopic response at Week 16 as measured by a decrease in SES-CD of at least 25% from baseline. The coprimary efficacy endpoints, clinical re mission at the Week 16 visit and endoscopic response at the Week 16 visit, will each be co mpared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75 mg ontamalimab) to the placebo group using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test stratified by status of prior anti-TNF treatment, glucocorticoid use, and SES-CD at baseline for each of the stages of the study (stage 1 incl udes subjects whose primary efficacy data are used in the interim analysis and stage 2 includes all other subjects. Note: classification of stage 1 and stage 2 is based on the time of randomizatio n rather than the time of study completion or termination). Subjects with missing data at the W eek 16 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders. Weighted inverse normal p-value combination met hods are used to combine the p-values from stage 1 and stage 2 thro ugh the following formula: C(p 1, p2) = 1 – Φ [w1 Φ-1(1-p 1)+ w 2 Φ-1(1-p 2)] Where p 1, p2 are the p-values computed from the CMH chi-square test for each stage, wi2 = n i/(n1 + n 2), n 1 and n 2 are the preplanned stage-wise sample sizes that are fixed at the time of the interim analysis based on an original total sample size, and Φ denotes the cumulative distribution function of the st andard normal distribution ( Bretz et al., 2009a ). Given that there is no possibility of stopping early for efficacy, that a ny potential stopping for futility of either or both doses of ontamalimab is nonbinding, and that weights are prespecifie d, the test statistic C(p 1, p2) can be compared against the nominal alpha level to assess statistical significance (Chang and Chow, 2008 ).

The common treatment difference is a weighted average of the stratum-specific treatment differences. The estimate of the common treatment differe nce along with the corresponding stratified Newcombe 95% CI using the method of Yan and Su ( 2010) and the p-value computed from the p-value combination method will be presente d for each active treatment group to placebo comparison for each endpoint. Sensitivity/supplementary analyses to explore the impact of missing data on the coprimary efficacy endpoints and key secondary endpoints w ill be conducted. These analyses may compare imputations of the missing values which favor placebo (eg, worst case) and/or imputations which favor active treatment (eg, best case). In addition, imputation methods based on informative missingness and other missing data mechanisms may be performed. Additional sensitivity/supplementary analyses will also be conducted using the PP set and the completer set. Additional analyses may be developed in the SAP. All sensitivity/supplementary analyses will be described in the SAP. Prespecified subgroup analyses are planned for the coprimar y endpoints including, but not limited to gender, prior anti-TNF treatment, glucoc orticoid use at baseline, SES-CD at baseline, region, age group, randomization stratum, and other important subgroups. A full list of important subgroups will be described in the SAP. Within subgroups, efficacy endpoints will be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg ontamalimab and 75 mg ontamalimab) with the placebo group using a chi-square test. The estimate of the treatment difference, along with the corresponding Newcombe (hybr id-score) 95% CI and chi-square te st p-value, will be presented. Statistical Testing and Prot ection of the Type I Error The global FWER for the statisti cal tests of the coprimary and key secondary endpoints will be strongly controlled at .05 (2-sided). To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz et al. ( 2009b) will be utilized to propagate α from the coprimary endpoints to the key secondary endpoints and between the 2 ontamalimab treatment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the coprimary endpoints (P ) and alpha is propagat ed in a hierarchical manner to each of the 6 key secondary endpoi nts (K1–K6) within a pairwise treatment comparison. In order to pass alpha between the coprimary endpoints and the first key secondary endpoint, both coprimary endpoints must attain stat istical significance. A graphical visualization of the α propagation is presented in Figure 5 . For non-commercial use only"

A site that is not a covered entity as defined by HIPAA must pr ovide documentation of this fact to the sponsor or designee. The confidentiality of records that may be able to identify subjects will be protected in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines. After subjects have consented to take part in the study, the spons or and/or its representatives reviews their medical records a nd data collected during the study. These records and data may, in addition, be reviewed by others including the following: indepe ndent auditors who validate the data on behalf of the sponsor; third parties w ith whom the sponsor may develop, register, or market ontamalimab; national or local regulatory authorities; and the IRB(s)/EC(s) which gave approval for the study to proceed. The sponsor an d/or its representatives accessing the records and data will take all reasonable precautions in accord ance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines to maintain the confiden tiality of subjects’ identities. Subjects are assigned a unique identifying number; however, their initials and date of birth may also be collected and used to a ssist the sponsor to verify the acc uracy of the data (eg, to confirm that laboratory results have been assigned to the correct subject). The results of studies – cont aining subjects’ unique identifying number, relevant medical records, and possibly initials and dates of birth – will be recorded. They may be transferred to, and used in, other countries which may not afford the same level of protection that applies within the countries where this study is conducted. The purpose of any such transfer would include: to support regulatory submissions, to conduct new da ta analyses to publish or present the study results, or to answer questions aske d by regulatory or health authorities. 10.5 Study Results/Publication Policy Shire will endeavor to publish the results of all qualifying, applicab le, and covered studies according to external guidelines in a timely ma nner regardless of whether the outcomes are perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. Additionally, Shire adheres to external guidelines (eg, Good Publication Practices 2) when form ing a publication steering committee, which is done for large, multicenter Phase 2-4 and certain other studies as determined by Shire.

A male subject with a hematocrit of 40% has an absolute deviation of 7. Each percentage deviation has a value of 6 points. If hematocrit subtotal is <0, enter 0. Variable 8: This variable is based on Metropolitan Life Tables (these are programmed into the ePRO device). Percent deviation from standard we ight is (1 - weight/standard weight) × 100; therefor e, positive percent de viation represents weight loss, which adds points to the CDAI. Percentage deviatio n from standard weight = 1 point for each percent deviation. If body weight subtotal is less than -10, enter -10.

Local therapeutic standards and investigator judgment should be considered. AMINOSALICYLATES Mesalamine (5-ASA) Inadequate response or loss of response: Although the use of mesalamine in UC is well established (eg, induction treatment up to 4.8 g/day up to 8 weeks) and based upon evidence-based criteria, its use in CD is not well established. Oral mesalamine has not consistently been demonstrated to be effective compared with placebo for induction of remission and achieving mucosal healing in patients with active CD. Similarly, topical mesalamine is of limited benefit in CD ( Lichtenstein et al., 2018 ). For the purpose of this study, inadequate response or loss of response is defined as persis tent signs and symptoms of active disease despite treatment with mesalamine for at least 8 weeks at daily doses of 4.8 g/day. Intolerance: defined as documented treatment disconti nuation for AEs suspected to be related to mesalamine treatment. As guidance, the US package insert of mesala mine lists the following AEs.

Figure A1 Algorithm for C. difficile Diagnosis Using the Quick Check Card Test If the Alere Quik Chek card test is not availa ble, then a diagnosis may be established by following either of the algorithms shown in Figure A2 (using PCR for toxin), Figure A3 using toxigenic culture) or Figure A4 (using toxigenic culture, follow ed by PCR). The rationale for the method in Figure A3 is that the majority of PCR tests are expected to be negative for toxin, thus obviating the need for the test at the central laboratory. The expected turnaround time at the central laboratory for a GDH card test is expected to be shorter than that for stool culture for C. difficile at the local laboratory. The details of the se nsitivity and specificity of these tests were reported by Khanna ( Khanna et al., 2017). When medically reasonable, treatment decisions should be deferred until an etiology has been determined. When this is not feasible, management of symptoms should be dictated by the clinical situation. For non-commercial use only"

When this is not feasible, management of symptoms should be dictated by the clinical situation. If management requires a prohibit ed treatment (eg, intravenous glucocorticoids for induction or maintenance studies) the subject should be withdrawn from treatment. If treatment has been deferred, on ce an etiology is determined (eg, C. difficile , disease exacerbation, Campylobacter), appropriate treatment should be promptly implemented without waiting for a scheduled visit. If the etiology is determined to be C. difficile , treatment guidelines conforming to the current Infectious Diseas es Society of America recommendations for C. difficile infection ( McDonald et al., 2018) or the recent expert review on C. difficile infection in IBD ( Khanna et al., 2017) should be consulted. If C. difficile infection was identified, clinical improvement should be noted within about 5 days after the start of treatm ent. If improvement does not occur, the etiology is most likely an IBD flare secondary to C. difficile and treatment failure assessment should proceed per the protocol. Another possible explanati on is primary failure of C. difficile therapy which is unlikely. If an infectious etiology other than C. difficile is identified, it should be managed as appropriate, with reference to current clinical guidelines ( Shane et al., 2017 ). If any infectious etiology is determined, the s ite should contact the medical monitor to make him or her aware of the diagnosis and to disc uss treatment and ongoing study participation.
