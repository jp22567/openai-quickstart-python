The screening procedures can be done on different days within the time window 2. From Visit 8and onwards, on-site visits will be scheduled every 24 weeks until end of trial. Patients who prematurely discontinue trial medication will perform EOT visit and Follow Up visit, and then continue with scheduled visits until the trial is stopped. For patients not willin g to attend scheduled visits, telephone call smust be made regularly (ref. Section 3.3.4.1 ) to document any occurrence of outcome events and vital status. If the trial continues beyond 148 weeks, visit sare to be repeated with same intervals as from week 64 and onwards. 3. Timepoint for the EOT will be communicated via an I nvestigator letter when the Sponsor is confident that required number of events will be reached within a reasonable timeframe (ref. Section 3.1 and 6.2.3 ).All patients will have a follow up visit 30 days following regular or premature completion of the treatment period . 4. Visit dates are determined per the date of randomisation. If a visit is missed, the patient should be returned to the original visit schedule at the next visit. 5. NF = non fasting, F=fasting. Fasting means no food or liquid intake except for water the last 10 -16 hours 6. Informed consent may be obt ained prior to visit 1 in order to give time to collect medical records. Visit 1 should be performed within 30 days of signin g the informed consent form (ICF). 7. If accepted by local authorities or ethic committees, demographics to be collected in this trial are gender, year of birth, ethnicity and race. 8. The Investigator will be asked to record results from c linical routine examinations like ECG , echocardiography or similar procedures (MRI, CT -scan, etc.) , and if applicable information gathered from interrog ations of the ICD in the eCRF . 9. Vital signs measurements in this trial are blood pressure and pulse rate. 10. Protocol specified outcome events should be collected on the appropriate eCRF page only. The outcome events which are exempted from SAE reporting are listed in Section 5.3.6. 11. For patients with non -fatal stroke the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) should be scored by the investigator based on an interview at the next regular on-site visit after the onset of the str oke. In those cases where MRS assessment occurred within 90 days after the stroke, a repeat MRS -assessment should be performed at the next on-site visit. . 12. For the 12 -lead ECG done at the baseline and EOT visit, the interpretation of the tracing must be made locally by a qualified physician and documented on the ECG section of the eCRF. In case of any cardiac symptoms (indicating rhythm disorders or cardiac i schaemia), additional 12 -lead ECG(s) should be done to document a potential outcome event. 13. For female pat ients of child -bearing potential, local urine pregnancy test should be performed according to the Flow Chart . More frequent testing should be performe d if required by local regulations/authorities. 14. For the screening Visit 1, the safety laboratory is limited to liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine and urinalysis. Patients do not h ave to be fasting. 15. HbA1c to be analy sed in all patients, e.g. diabetics and non- diabetics. 16. For PK analysis ,one blood sample will be collected prior to the next scheduled dose of trial medication at Visit 4 and between 22 to 26 h after the most recent drug intake. 17. Collection of biobanking samples (pl asma, serum, urine, DNA) is optional. Participating patients are required to give informed consent specifically for biobankin g. Samples will be stored at a biobanking facility for future research . 18. DNA biobanking requires only one blood sample to be taken, preferably at Visit 2 (Randomisation). However, collection at later visits is per mitted as long as the informed consent for biobanking remains valid . 19. At all visits; the respective kit number has to be allocated to the patient via IRT. Trial medication should be taken after all trial related procedures are completed at an on - site visit."

HF is a prevalent disease affecting an estimated 26 million people worldwide. In the United States alone the prevalence is 5.7 million, and there are 670,000 new cases per y ear[R16-1527 ]. HF is associated with premature mortality and frequent hospitali sation. Approximately 50% of patients who develop HF die within 5 years after diagnosis [P16-03952 ]. Annually , more than 1 million patients are hospitalis ed with a primary diagnosis of HF . HF is the most common cause of hospitali sation among individuals above 65 years of age in the western countries [ P16- 03760]. Two ty pes of HF have been defined mainly based on the LV ejection fraction (EF) and also other structural changes in heart muscle. They consist of heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) <40% and heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) ≥40%. Relative prevalence of HFpEF among HF patients is approximately 50% [R16-1528 ]. Amongst patients with HF who require hospitali sation, the proportion of HFp EF is rising. A nalysis of a large HF registry showed that the proportion of patients hospitali sed with HF (HHF ) who had HFpEF increased from 33% in 2005 to 39% in 2010 [R16-1529 ]. The rate of rehospitalisation among patients with HFrEF is close to 29% within 60- 90 day s of hospitalisation discharge which is equal to HFpEF [ R16-1527 ]. Despite advances in therapy and management, HF remains a deadl y clinical sy ndrome. After HHF, the one y earmortality rate is high and not different between patients with preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) [R16-2217 ], underscoring a high unmet medical need in this population. About 25 to 45% of patients with HF have concomitant ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and nearl y 15-25% have borderline DM (pre-diabetes), indicating a potential link between the HF syndromes and glucometabolic disturbances [ R16-2382 , R16-2384 ]. Despite t he current standard of care for treatment of HFrEF such as medical therapy [angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), be ta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) , ivabradine and angiotensin receptor blocker -neprilysin inhibitor (ARN I)] or device therapy , the mortalit y and morbidity remains high. For HFpEF, however, control of congestive sy mptoms during acute episodes is the mainstay of management of these patients and no class of drugs have shown to increase survival or reduce HHF [P16-03760 , P16-05920 ]. Empagliflozin is an orally available inhibitor of the renal dependent glucose co -transporter 2 (SGL T-2) indicated for, reduction of blood glucose in patients with T2DM by promoting urinary glucose excretion. I t also reduces blood pressure, arterial stiffness and measures of the my ocardi al wor kload, likely through various mechanisms, as well as improving other CV risk factors (uric acid, visceral fat mass, albuminuria) [ P15-00589 , P15-09541 ]."

This trial completed in 2015 and showed empagliflozin, when given in addition to standard care treatment in high CV risk patients with T2DM, reduces the risk of 3 -point MACE by 14% mostly driven b y a 38% reduction in CV death. Furthermore this trial demonstrated reduction in the prespecified and adjudicated composite outcome of “CV de ath or HHF ”and HHF by 34%. Consistent with the main results of theEMPA -REG OUTCOME trial , in approximately 10% of the trial population who had investigator -reported heart failure at baseline, empagliflozin showed significant reduction in CV death, HHF , and composite of “ HHF or CV death” [P16- 01253 ]. 1.2 DRUG PROFILE Empagliflozin is an orally available, potent, and selective inhibitor of the renal SGLT -2. Its selective inhibition reduces renal reabsorption of sodium and glucose. This leads to both increased urinary sodium and glucose excretion. While the urinary sodiu m excretion returns to normal within few days of empagliflozin administration, the effect on urinary glucose continues. Empagliflozin has been developed for the treatment of T2DM, and has received marketing approval in various regions including the European Union ,Latin America, USA and Japan where it is marketed under the brand name Jardiance®. For a more detailed description of the drug profile please refer to the current I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) [ c01678844-06] and local prescribing information for empagliflozin. 1.2.1 Non-clinical assessment of safety For further information regarding pre -clinical evaluation, please refer to the current version of the IB for empagliflozin . 1.2.2 Clinical pharmacokinetics In humans, empaglifloz in predominantly showed linear pharmacokinetic (PK). Empagliflozin reaches peak levels at approximately 1.5 hours and showed a biphasic decline with the terminal elimination half-life of 12.4 hours ranging from 10 to 19 hours. Empagliflozin exposure increa ses with renal or hepatic impairment; however, no dose adjustment is recommended as the observed changes in exposure were not clinically meaningful. No clinically relevant PK interactions were observed with other oral antidiabetics, warfarin, verapamil, ra mipril, simvastatin, digoxin, hy drochlorothiazide, torasemide, emfibrozil, rifampicin, probenecid and oral contraceptives (Microgynon®). For further details refer to the current version of the IB for empagliflozin. 1.2.3 Clinical efficacy and safety Approximate ly 550 healthy volunteers were exposed to empagliflozin (up to 800 mg single dose and up to 50 mg multiple dosing). Approximately 8500 patients with T2DM have been treated with empagliflozin in research studies, of which approximately 4400 have been"

Also, empagliflozin was tested in over 4600 patients with T2DM and high CV risk for median treatment duration of 2.6 y ears. The EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial was a randomi sed, placebo -controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg in 7020 patients with T2DM and high CV risk. I t ended in 2015 after accruing the minimum prespecified 691 major adverse CV events. Empagliflozin was associated with significant risk reduction of all -cause mortality by 32% ( HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.57, 0.82 p<0.0001) and CV death b y 38% ( HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.49, 0.77, p value <0.0001). In addition, the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial showed reduction in the prespecified and adjudicated composite outcome of “CV death or HHF ” by 34% ( HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.55, 0.79, p value <0.0001). This result was consistent across various predefined sensitivity anal ysis and internal consistency was confirmed by showing overall homogeneit y over a wide range of subgroups, including patients with and without history of HF at baseline. There was no significant difference in improving CV outcomes between the 10 and 25 mg dose. The Phase III studies in T2DM showed that treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg once dail y for up to 24 weeks results in a reduction of HbA1c up to 1%, body weight reduction between 2 -3 kg,and a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 3 -5 mmHg compared with placebo. This was consistently observed with empagliflozin as monotherap y, add on to metformin, metformin and sulphony lurea, piogli tazone with or without metformin, and to basal insulin with metformin and/or sulphony lurea. Phase III studies up to 104 weeks in T2DM support the sustained effect of empagliflozin. In clinical studies, empagliflozin was well tolerated in both healthy volun teers and patients with T2DM including patients with high CV risk up to a median duration of 2.6 y ears. The frequency of overall Adverse Events (AEs), AEs leading to discontinuation and Serious AE (SAEs) were comparable to placebo. There was no significant increase in frequency of hypoglycaemia with empagliflozin compared to placebo except when used in combination with a sulphony lurea or basal insulin. I n general there was a small increase in frequency of urinary tract infection (UTI) compared to placebo. T here was an increase in frequency of genital infections with the use of empagliflozin. There was a small increase in total cholesterol, low -densit y lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high -densit y lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and no significant changes in t riglycerides. No changes in electroly tes were observed with empagliflozin. In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial renal function over time, as measured by the eGFR, is shown in Figure 1.2.3:1[P16-06807 ]. After the initial decrease ,eGFR remained stead y in the empagliflozin group and wasreversed after the cessation of the trial medication (Figure 1.2.3:2). At the follow -up visit, the adjusted mean difference from placebo in the change from baseline in the eGFR with each of the two doses of empagliflozin was 4.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (95% confidence interval, 4.0 to 5.5; P<0.001 f or both comparison s) (Figure 1.2.3:2).The data indicated that the initial drop in eGFR after administration of empagliflozin is reversible and most likely due to hemody namic carnages. This is very similar to what ha ve been observed with ACEi and ARBs . The EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial also generated the hypothesis that the expected deterioration in renal function in patients with T2DM slowed down after using empagliflozin, and this will be further tested in the HF trials using the eGFR slope anal ysis and composite renal endpoint s(see Section 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 )."

In patients with CKD4 renal impairment, while there was not change in the gl ycaemic response, the reduction in BP and renal hemod ynamic changes (similar to what was ob served in the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial) were preserved. In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trialasimilar reduction in CV risk was observed in the subgroup of patients with different degree of RI, including patients with eGFR between >45-60 and >30 -45 mL/min/1.73 m2. 2RATIONALE, OBJECTIVE S, AND BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT 2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL Heart failure is an important public health problem, and one of the leading causes of hospitali sation in the Western countries. With the increasingl y aging population and increasing incidence of obesity , the scope and cost to society associated with this condition will progressively rise. There is a nunmet medical need in treatment of patients with HFpEF. Despite advances in the management of HF, no new therapies have bee n found to improve outcomes by reducing mortality or morbidit y (i.e. CV death or HHF ) in these patients [P16- 03760 ]. HF also significantly decreases health -related quality of life (HRQOL) and pharmacological therapies have not shown consistent improvement in HRQOL . Empagliflozin improves survival in patients with high cardiovascular risk by mechanisms which go bey ond the blood glucose lowering effect. There was no heterogeneity by baseline HbA1c categories inHHF or “CV deat h and HHF” risk reduction in the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial. Empagliflozin exerts its glucose lowering effect b y preventing sodium and glucose reabsorption. The initial natriuresis will be compensated within days of drug administration through changes in tubul o-glomerular feedback. However, the glucosuria lasts as long as the medication is use d. This leads to consequent hemod ynamic changes associated with a modest osmotic diuresis, blood pressure lowering effect, improvement in arterial stiffness, reduction in oxidative stress, and decrease in heart rate ( HR) xPressure product, a measure of m yocardial oxy gen consumption, with no increase in HR and no effect on sympathetic nerve activity [P15-00589 , P15-09541 ]. Of note, the effect of empagliflozin on improving CV outcomes is evide nt even at low urinary glucose excretion demonstrated in those with low HbA1c as well as in those with reduced renal function (i.e. eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Subgroup anal ysis of the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial showed no difference in patients with baseline HbA1c <7%, 7% to 8%, 8% to 9%, or >9% for CV death or HHF risk reduction. In addition, patients who had no HbA1c change or only modest change up to 0.2% throughout the trial have shown to have a similar risk reduction of HHF as the patients with at least 0.3 % or higher reduction in HbA1c. Also as noted changes in BP reduction and hemod ynamic changes were preserved in patients with CKD4, despite loss of glycaemic efficacy . Lack of correlation between CV outcome improvement and blood glucose levels provides sup porting evidence that the benefit of empagliflozin in HHF or CV death risk reduction should also be expected in patients without DM [P16-01253 , c09670340 , c11764168 ].The beneficial CV effects of empagliflozin cannot be explained by the modest"
22,page_22,"Boehringer Ingelheim 09NOV 2016 BI Trial No.: 1245.110 c03946327 -01 Trial Protocol Page 23of 92 Proprietary confidential information © 2016 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies 001-MCS -40-106-RD-03(13.0)/Saved on:05Aug 2015glucose control achieved in the EMPA -REG OUTCOM E trial . Other outcome trials with the goal of tight gl ycaemic control (ADVANCE, ACCORD, and VADT) have failed to show significant CV benefit [R16-1560 ] and decrease in incident HF or mortality [R16-0736 ]. It should be noted that in a mechanistic stud y,non-DMsubjects showed metabolic changes such as, increase in endogenous glucose production, and substrate shift from glucose to lipid oxidation similar to those observed in patients with T2DM after one dose and up to 4 weeks of daily administration of empagliflozin [P16-01830 ]. Furthermore, in a trial of health y volunteers, empagliflozin 10 mg resulted in approximately 50 g glucosuria per day [P13- 04190 ]. This amount of glucose excretion is similar to what had been observed in pati ents with eGFR between 30 -60mL/min 1.73 m2(CKD3) which wasclose to 55 g glucosuria per day. In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial patients with CKD3 showed a trend for the CV death or HHF risk reduction very similar to the risk reduction in the main cohort and in patients with CKD2 and 1 . While the higher level of glucosuria is associated with a higher HbA1c reduction and better gl ycaemic control, this correlation is lacking for the CV benefits associated with empagliflozin, and in fact a lower glucose excretion similar to what has been observed in patients with CKD3 or in health y volunteer sseems to be sufficient to improve the CV outcomes. Therefore, the expected benefit of empagliflozin such as BP reduction, weight loss, improvement in arterial stiffness, and hemody namic changes, as well as CV benefits seen in patients with T2DM is also speculated to be seen in HF patients without DM and in patients with CKD3 and 4 . These findings further support the rationale of exploring the effect of empagliflozin bey ond DM.Although the ty pe of HF was not assessed entering the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, it is highly likely in this trial both patients with preserved and reduced ejection fraction were included, considering the high prevalence of both HFrEF and HFpEF in patients with DM [R16-1529 ]. The modes of action described above, and beneficial effect in patients with history of HF in the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, further supports the scientific rationale of performing this trial to explore the effect of empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF. 2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES The objective of this event -driven trial is to demonstrate superiorit yof empagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo in pati ents with sy mptomatic , chronic HF and preserved ejection fraction (LVEF > 40%) under stable treatment of HF s ymptoms . For further description of trial endpoints and statistical anal ysis, please refer to Section 5 and 7. This trial is part of an investigational clinical trial program of empagliflozin in patients with chronic HF. A trial to invest igate the efficacy and safet y in patients with reduced EF (LVEF ≤40%) is ongoing in parallel. 2.3 BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT The overall benefits and safe profile of empagliflozin have been outlined in previous sections. A pharmacologic rationale for the use of empagliflozin in HF can be found in Section 1.1 . The overall tolerability and safet y profile outlined in Section 1.2 , and the current IB, supports chronic administration of empag liflozin 10 mg in human studies."

Based on the putative mechanism of actions (reviewed in Section 2.1 ) and the result of the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, it is assumed that patients with HFpEF should benefit from empagliflozin treatment on top of guideline -directed therapies. The safet y profile of empagliflozin in these patients should follow a similar trend which was previously observed in over 10000 patients with T2DM treated with empagliflozin, including patients with high CV risk. Sa fety will be ensured by close monitoring of the subjects for AEs both clinically and by laboratory testing. Special attention will be paid to prevent metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA ). For further details refer to Section 4.2.1 . To continue the assessment of the long -term safety of empagliflozin, adjudication of cardiovascular events ,certain hepatic events ,and ketoacidosis will be performed in this trial. The progress of the trial will also be assessed at regular intervals by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). For further details please refer to Section 3.1.1 . One interim anal ysis is planned after approximately 500primary event shavebeen accrued. If the prespecified criteria for stopping for success at the interim anal ysis has been reached , the Executive Steering Committee (E xSC) and the Sponsor will b e informed. The final decision whether to stop the trialwill be made b y Sponsor. For further details refer to Section 7.4 . As with all drugs, the potential for h ypersensitivity and allergic reactions has to be taken into consideration when empagliflozin is administered. Other risks to the patients are the risks inherent to an y investigational medicinal product used in a clinical trial setting, such as unexpected adverse clinical or laboratory events. Empagliflozin ca uses intravascular volume contraction .In patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of empagliflozin is recommended . Although rare , apotential for drug induced liver injury (DILI) is under constant surveillance by the Sponsor and regulators. Therefore this trial requires timel y detection ,evaluation and follow -up of laboratory alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients´ safet y, see also Secti on 5.3.6.1 . Based on the findings in the nonclinical trials conducted to date and in accordance with international regulatory guidelines, the inclusion of women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) in this trial is justified. To minimi se the risk of unintenti onal exposure of an embry o or foetus to the investigational drug, WOCBP must agree to the requirements for pregnancy testing and contraceptive methods described in this protocol."

Figure 3.1 : 1 Trial design Patients are included in the trial once they have signed the informed consent form (ICF) . All patients suitable after screening and who still meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria when returning for Visit 2 approximately 1-3 weeks later will be randomi sed into one of the treatment groups in a 1:1 manner. Randomisation will be stratified with respect to geographical region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and “Other” ,history of DM (DM, pre-DM, no DM), LVEF (<50%, ≥50%) and eGFR (CKD -EPI)cr(<60 m L/min/ 1.73 m², ≥60mL/min/ 1.73 m²)at screening . The trial is event -driven and all randomised patients will remain in the trial until the defined number of adjudicated primary endpoint event shas been reached .Estimated trial duration is 38 months with a recruitment period of approximately 18 months. The estimated length of the double -blind treatment will vary from approximately 20 to 38 months for each patient .The trial duration may be prolonged in case the number of patients and/or primary endpoint events is not reached within the planned timelines. The total nu mber of randomi sed patients may be adapted based on assessment of the blinded event rate. For further details refer to Section 7.7 . The number of confirmed adjudicated primary endpoint events will be cont inuously monitored during the trial. As soon as the available data reliably suggests that the total number of patients with an adjudication confirmed primary endpoint event will be reached within a given timeframe, the trial team will initiate required act ions to stop the trial. From this time point on, all patients are expected to perform their last visit (EOT visit) with the proposed time schedule communicated via an investigator letter .

The operational aspects (trial management and monitoring) of the trial and Data Management will be outsourced globall y to aContract Research Organisation ( CRO ). A Coordinating Investigator is responsible to coordinate Investigators at different centres participating in this multicent reand multinational trial. Tasks and responsibilities are defined in a contract stored in the electronic Trial Master File (eTMF) at th e CRO . An ExSC and a Scientific Excellence Committee ( SEC)consisting of independent experts and Sponsor representatives will be established to support Sponsor in designing the trials and successful execution. The ExSC and SEC will have a scientific and advisory function in the trial. The ExSC will be involved with the detailed trialdesign discussions and decision making while the SEC has wide representation of different scientific disciplines and will be consulted on the topi cs requiring broader consensus . The composition of the ExSC and the SEC will be documented in the eTMF. The tasks and responsibilities will be agreed in contracts between the ExSC and the SEC and the Sponsor, and also summari sed in an ExSC - and SEC -charter filed in the eTMF. A data -monitoring committee (DMC), independent of the Sponsor and CRO will assess the progress of the trial, including an unblinded safety and efficacy assessment at specified intervals, and to recommend to the Sponsor whether to con tinue, modify , or stop the trial. Measures are in place to ensure blinding of the Sponsor , ExSC, SEC, CRO and all other trial participants. The tasks and responsibilities of the DMC will be specified in a charter. The DMC will maintain written records of all its meetings. Relevant documentation on the participating (Principal) Investigators and other important participants, including their curricula vitae, will be filed in the Investigator Site File ( ISF). BI has appointed a Trial Clinical Monitor, responsible for coordinating all required activities, in order to manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and applicable B Iand CRO Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ), direct the clinical trial team in the preparation, conduct, and reporting of the trial, ensure appropriate oversight of vendors. Statistical Evaluation will be done b y BI according to BI SOPs, and Data Management will be done b y the CRO in accordance with CRO SOPs. Tasks and functions assigned in order to organise, manage, and evaluate the trial will be defined according to BI and CRO SOPs, and the applicable SOPs will be listed in the contract with the CRO. A list of responsible persons and relevant local information can be found in the ISF. A central laboratory service and an Interactive Voice/Web -based Response Sy stem (IRT)- vendor will be used in this trial. Details will be provided in the IRT Manual and Central Laboratory Manual, available in I SF."

For an y events that qualify for adjudication, trial sites will be required to provide in a timely manner clinical documentation such as (but not limited to) electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory values, angiography reports , echocardiograph y reports, CT and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI )reports , discharge summaries, and autops y reports to support the external event adjudication. Ifthe CEC requests more data, all efforts must be made b y the site to collect all available data to support adjudication. For reporting of events and exemption from expedited reporting refer to Section 5.3. 7.2. The tasks and responsibilities of the CEC , and the pre -specified c riteria for adjudication will be specified in a charter. The CEC will maintain the adjudication results in writing. Hepatic external adjudicatio n 3.1.1.2 Certain hepatic events will be adjudicated b y external independent experts for severit y and causal relationship with the trial medication; both in a blinded fashion. Events tobe reviewed will be defined in a hepatic charter. Events may either be defined by abnormal laboratory values and/or relevant adverse events or both. For qualify ing events, relevant source documents generated from any medical evaluations of these events will be requested including laboratory values, histological analy sis, re ports from ultrasound, CT, MRI , scintigraph y, hospital discharge letters, and medical reports from other physicians. All evaluations will be performed in a blinded fashion. The assessments will be analysed based on empagliflozin data combined from multiple trials (i.e. on project level). Adjudication of ketoacidosis 3.1.1.3 Events suspected to be metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and DKA will be adjudicated b y independent external experts in a blinded fashion. 3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF CONTROL GROUP(S) A variet y of medications have been tested in patients with HFpEF without showing benefit in morbidity and mortality . The aim of this trial is to recruit patients with HFpEF on various HF background therapies to evaluate the long term effect of emp agliflozin on CV death and HHF in a real life clinical setting. Due to its mode of action empagliflozin should be efficacious in treating patients with HF and could provide additional efficacy in combination with any given background therapy ."
27,page_27,"Boehringer Ingelheim 09NOV 2016 BI Trial No.: 1245.110 c03946327 -01 Trial Protocol Page 28of 92 Proprietary confidential information © 2016 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies 001-MCS -40-106-RD-03(13.0)/Saved on:05Aug 2015The placebo -controlled design is considered ethically acceptable on the basis of appropriate criteria for patient discontinuation, ability to change background therapy to maintain, or obtain, sufficient level of hemody namic control as defined in relevant local and reg ional guidelines for optimi sed standard of care. The double -blind treatment period is planned until the necessary number of events is observed to evaluate efficacy of empagliflozin compared to standard of care. The 30 day s follow -up period is considered to be sufficient for assessment of adverse events and efficacy outcomes after stopping trial medication . Patients should be receiving appropriate care as defined b y their ph ysician or practitioner for all cardiovascular conditions according to the prevailin g guidelines .This should be conducted in the context of local or regional guidance for primary or secondary CV prevention. The rationale for dose and dose -interval selection is described in Section 4. 1.2. 3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL P OPULATION An appropriate number of patients will be screened for the trial in approximate ly 22 countries. Approximately 500trial centres will participat eto ensure that the estimated 4126 patients are randomi sedto trial medication and complete the trial. Investigators who fail to randomi se at least one patient in the first 12 weeks from centre initiation may be excluded from further participation. If enrolment is delay ed, additional centres may be initiated. The total number of randomi sed patients may be adapted based on assessment of the blinded event rate. For further details refer to Section 7.7 . Clinical trials contribute toward reducing health dispariti es through improved knowledge about treatment among diverse populations. Greater diversit y in clinical trial samples allows for broader generali sation of trialresults, increased minority access to trials, improved standards of care, decreased disparities in disease treatment and outcomes, and improved external validity supported by a more representative sample. Greater number of African - Americans as an example ,suffer from HF and all efforts must be made to have adequate representation of this minority population from the USA [ P15-10667 ].Each Investigator should develop a recruitment strategy that ensures the recruitment of a representative patient population and takes into consideration gender, race and ethnicity . According to previous heart failure trials and registries the prevalence of DM amongst patients with HF varies from 2 5%to 40%. Prevalence of pre -DM is not clearly understood but it is estimated to vary from 15% to 50% [ R16-2382 , R16-2384 ]. In a recent large HF outcome trial, 35% of the patients reported to have DM, another 15% found to have undiagnosed DM and around 27% had pre -DM [ R16-2383 ]. Since there is a chance that empagliflozin, as a diabetes drug, when used in CV outcome trials recruits more patients with T2DM, capping on trial level will be used to aim for a similar distribution of patients with DM, pre -DM or no DM as it is expected in the population of patients w ith the chronic heart failure in real life."

Additionally recruitment to the three categories of DM, pre -DM or no DM will be monitored on regional level. Capping on regional level may be applied to achieve a contribution of each region to each category of diabetes status. DM in this context is defined as active treatment with antidiabetic medication (for indication of DM) or screening HbA1c ≥6.5% or history of DM. Pre-DM is defined as screening HbA1c ≥5.7% and <6.5% without the intake of antidiabetic medication (unless taken for a non -DM indication) and no history of DM, and patients with no DM is defined as screening HbA1c < 5.7 % without an y intake of antidiabetic medication (unless taken for a non -DM indication) and no history of DM [R16- 2261 ]. IRT will be used to aim for a trial population consisting of approximately 35% to 50% with an LVEF >50%. To ensure adequate enrolment of patients the f inal decision on capping will be based on the recommendation from the ExSC during the recruitment period . Screening of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening for the trial will stop at all centr es when a sufficient number of patients have been randomi sed to trial treatment. Investigators will be notified when scr eening is complete and will not be allowed to recruit additional patients thereafter. Patients who have completed visit 1 procedures prior to notification of the termination of recruitment will be allowed to be randomised in the trial, if they meet all eli gibility criteria. Patient eligibility will be based upon a complete medical history including a ph ysical examination and clinical laboratory tests. Judgment of the clinical relevance of a concomitant disease is at the discretion of the Investigator. Re-screening and/or re -testing (of assessments) is permitted if approved b y Local Clinical Monitor ( CML )/Clinical Lead ( CL)or delegate. Whilst the information provided below is not an exhaustive list, it provides some guidance as to when such re -screening and/ or re-testing would be considered appropriate. Re-testing: Re-testing for eligibility criteria is onl y to be performed once for a laboratory result which is obviously received bey ond stability at the central laboratory or thought to be a spurious result based on previousl y available laboratory results. The re test should be carried out as soon as possible so the laboratory test results will be received within the next planned visit windows in order to avoid protocol window violations. Re-screening: -Re-screening of the same patient is only allowed once. -The patient should be declared a screening failure in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF )and IRT with their original patient number. -Upon re -screening, the IRT sy stem will allocate a new screening number for the patient ."

If a patient is wit hdrawn from the trial the ExSC and the Sponsor should be informed immediately about each individual case. Prematurely discontinuation of tri al medication For patients who prematurely discontinue trial medication all efforts should be made to observe these patients and ask them to continue to attend the scheduled visits until the end of trial. I t is expected that all efforts are made to follow up on the coll ection of all adverse events, outcome events and concomitant therap y, and to have a complete dataset without missing data. If a patient wh o prematurely discontinued trial medication is not willing to return to the predefined trial visits, at minimum a tel ephone call every 24weeks (preferably every 12 weeks) and a telephone call at trial end will be required, to document the occurrence of outcome events and vital status. I f possible, other AE’s and concomitant therapy changes since last visit must be recor ded. Every attempt must be made b y the Investigator to ensure patients continue partici pating in the trial during trial medication interruptions an d after discontinuation of trial medication. Patients who prematurel y discontinue trial medication are allow ed to restart treatment, at an y time if appropriate in the opinion of the I nvestigator . At every visit following trial medication discontinuation Investigators must consider if trial medication can be re-started. Patients that are not actively taking tria l medication may be less motivated to adhere to the scheduled trial visits. I nvestigators and site staff should work to detect early signs of losing interest and readily present such patients (not actively taking trial medication) with the following option s to encourage continued participation: Option 1 Continue to attend regularly scheduled trial visits at the centre until the trial ends Option 2 Conduct all remaining trial visits over the phone Option 3 Discontinue participation in remaining trial activ ities but permit collection of vital status and CV outcome events at the end of the trial through the patient or alternative person designated b y the patient (e.g., family, spouse, partner, legal representative, or ph ysician) even if only by telephone Option 4 Discontinue participation in remaining trial activities but permit collection of vital status at the end of the trial through the patient, alternative person designated b y the patient, or through review of patient’s medical information from alternati ve sources (e.g., doctor’s notes, hospital records, etc.) Patients will be asked to choose the most rigorous form of follow -up that they are willing to comply with."

Withdrawal of informed consent A patient has the right to withdraw informed consent for participation at an y time for an y reason. However, withdrawal of consent from trial participation should be very rare and unusual. Because of this, the I nvestigator must be involved in the discussion s with the patient regarding a withdrawal of consent. Additionally , the Investigator must discuss the withdrawal of consent with the Sponsor’s/CRO’s representative prior to stopping trial participation. Early discontinuation of trial medication is not a c riterion for withdrawal of consent for participati onin the trial. The right to withdraw informed consent at an y time for an y reason also applies to the optional informed consent to biobanking (including DNA sampling), which is separate from the consent fo r trial participation. If the patient withdraws informed consent for participation in the trial, the trial will end for that patient. The patient should stop taking trial medication and should be asked to complete the end of treatment (EOT) visit and follo w-up procedures as described in the Flow Chart. Completing these procedures is strongl y recommended for the patient’s safety. Patients that withdraw informed consent will not be replaced. Vital status must be collected at the end of trial for patients that withdraw consent from trial participation, if allowed by local regulations. Patients lost to follow -up If a patient is lost, every effort will be made by the Investigator and site staff to contact and locate the patient before the patient is declared lost to follow -up. Investigators and site staff must use every possible allowable means, according to local regulations, to locate patients who have missed visits. Efforts to contact the patient may include but are not limited to: •Calling all numbers for patient and listed contacts (including in the evening and on weekends). •Calling primary care physician, referring specialist and/or other listed phy sicians for more recent information, date of last office visit or to determine vital status. •Sending an email and follow up with mailing certified letters (return receipt requested) to all known patient addresses and all listed contacts (e.g., relatives, friends, neighbours) that were provided by the patient. •Reviewing patient’s records and medical notes for any details of a hospitalisation, doctor’s visit or other procedure that may indicate location or status of subject. •Use Internet to search for possible contact information for the patient. •Try reverse directory for phone numbers to get possible addresses and/or new contact details. •Utilise social networking sites."

Pregnancy If a patient becomes pregnant during the trial, the trial medication will be stopped, the patient will be fol lowed up during the trial and until birth or termination of the pregnancy (see further details in Section 5.3.4.2 ). An excessive withdrawal rate can have a severe negative impact on the scientific value of the trial. T he Intention To Treat anal ysis requires that all randomised patients be followed until trial end even if the trial medication was temporarily interrupted, discontinued or never started. Every effort should be made to keep the patients in the trial as sched uled. This includes careful patient selection and appropriate explanation of the trial requirements and procedures prior to enrolment as well as an explanation of the consequences of premature withdrawal.

Empagl iflozin exerts its effect by promoting glucosuria and consequent hemody namic changes associated with diuresis, improvement in arterial stiffness, blood pressure lowering effect with no increase in HR and reduction in HR xPressure product, an index of my ocardial oxygen consumption. These modes of actions support the scientific rationale of using empagliflozin in patients with HF. In the EMPA -REG -OUTCOME trial both doses were administered to patients with T2DM and showed to be equally effective in reducing CV death, HHF , and composite of HHF or CV death i n patients with HF at baseline. In subgroup anal ysis empagliflozin improved the main outcome of CV death and HHF with thesimilar magnitude in patients with low orhigh levels of HbA1c at baseline. This indicates the risk reduction for HF outcome is indep endent of the degree of gl ycaemic control at baseline, suggesting that the sebenefits can be achieved with the 10 mg dose similar to the 25"

The mechanism of action is supported by studies in healthy volunteers where both doses were associated with about 50g glucosuria. Given the lower exposure with 10 mg empagliflozin similar general safet y, and CV eff ects similar for both doses, empagliflozin 10 mg once daily has been selected in this trial. For further details see current version of the IB. 4.1.3 Method of assigni ng patients to treatment groups During Visit 2 eligible patients will be randomi sed to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, or matching placebo, in a 1:1 ratio according to therandomi sation plan. The assignment will occur in a blinded fashion via Interactive Response Technology (IRT). To facilitate the use of the IRT, the Investigator will receive a manual including all necessary instructions for using the sy stem. A cop y of the manual will be available in the I SF. Patient assignment to the treatment group will be determined b y a c omputer generated random sequenc e. Access to the randomi sation code will be co ntrolled and documented -for further details please refer to Section 4.1.5 .1. and 4.1.5.2. Using this procedure, relevant parties will be blinded to the treatment group assignment. For information on stratificati on and capping please refer to Section 3.3. 4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient Patients who qualify will be randomised to one of the dosage sdescribed in Section 4.1.1. Trial medication will be dispensed in a double -blind and single -dummy manner. Dispensing of kits for the double -blind treatment period will begin at Visit 2 and continue at every visit until end of trial . For further details regarding packaging (e.g. number of tablets per container) please refer to Section 4.1.6. From the start of the treatment period patients will be instructed to take the trialmedication once dail y with a glass of water. Empagliflozin can be taken with or without food. To ensure a dose interval of about 24 hours, the medication should be taken in the morning at approximately the same time every day. If a dose is missed by more than 12 h ours, that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. On days before the next visit, the dose should be taken 22 -26 hours before the planned dose at the visit. No double doses should be taken. Patients should be instru cted not to take their medication on the morning of trialvisits as they will be dosed whilst in the clinic. Visits should be routinely scheduled at approximately the same time of day for each visit. The actual date and time of administration of the trial medication at the trial visit will be recorded in the eCRF."

The DMC will be provided with unblinded data in order to allow them to review efficacy and safet y and to fulfil their tasks as outlined in the data monitoring committee charte r. An independent team, not otherwise involved in the conduct of the trial, will provide the unblinded results to the DMC. The randomi sation code will be kept secret by Clinical Trial Support up to database lock. Unblinding and breaking the code 4.1.5.2 Emergency unblinding will be available to the Investigator via the IRT. It must only be used in an emergency situation when the identity of the trial medication must be known to the Investigator in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure s afety of trial participants. Whenever possible and if time allows, the need for unblinding will be discussed with the medical representative from the Sponsor or delegate before the unblinding of trial medication takes place. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or appropriate eCRF page along with the date and the initials of the person who broke the code. The patient could continue with trial medication after unblinding. Due to the requirements to report Suspected U nexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs), it may be necessary for a representative from B I’s Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomi sation code for individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only be given to authorised Pharmacovigilance representatives and not to be shared further . For Japan only : In this blinded trial, an emergency code break will be available to the Investigator / the sub -Investigators via the IRT. This code break may only be accessed in emergency situations when the identity of the trial medication must be known to the Investigator /the sub -Investigators in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or if required to assure the safety of trial participants. Each site receives a manual from the IRT provider that contains instructions on how to unblind the treatment of a patient via the IRT (via 24 -hour Emergency helpline). If the code break for a patient is accessed, the Sponsor or delegate must be informed immediately . The reason for accessing the c ode break, together with the date, must be documented on the appropriate eCRF page. In case third part y needs to break the code, however, when the Investigator cannot be reached, the code can be opened b y calling emergency code manager. 4.1.6 Packaging, labellin g and re -supply The investigational products will be provided by BI or a designated CRO.

Concomitant antidiabetic medications should be adjusted individually as clinically indicated by the patient’s usual diabetes care provider. Restrictions of antidiabetic background therapy are described in Section 4.2.2 . Patients without a diagnosis of DM experiencing repeated or severe s ymptoms such as nervousness, sweating, intense hunge r, trembling, weakness and palpitations should contact the Investigator or other healthcare professional, as these sy mptoms might be suggestive of hypoglycaemia. In the case of h ypoglycaemia ,in patients with or without DM, that may put the patient at risk (e.g. repeated s ymptomatic hy poglycaemia or severe h ypogl ycaemia), appropriate care should be provided at the discretion of the Investigator. Special attention must be paid to the prevention of ketoacidosis . All patients must be made aware of this risk an d need to be instructed to contact the Investigator or other healthcare professional in case of s ymptoms of metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and DKA. Cases of DKA have been reported in patients treated with empagliflozin, including fatal cases. In a number of reported cases, the presentation of the condition was aty pical with only moderatel y increased blood glucose values; below 14 mmol/l (250 mg/dl). The risk of DKA must be considered in the event of non -specific s ymptoms such as nausea, vomiting, anorexi a, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual fatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed and treated for ketoacidosis immediately according to local guidelines if these s ymptoms occur, regardless of blood glucose level. If ketoacidosis is suspected, the trial medication should be discontinued, the patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be initiated . Patients who may be at higher risk of ketoacid osiswhile taking empagliflozin include patients on a very low carbohy drate diet (as the combination may further increase ketone body production), patients with an acute illness, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g. Type 1 diabetes mell itus(T1DM ), history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery ), insulin dose reduction (including insulin pump failure), alcohol abuse, severe dehy dration, and patients with a history of ketoacidosis. Empagliflozin should be used with caution in these patient s.In patients requiring insulin, caution should be taken when the dose of insulin is reduced. In clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g. prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery ), the Investigator should consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporaril y discontinue the trial medication . There are no trial specific emergency procedures to be followed."

For documentation of symptomatic acute UTI during trial conduct, a urine culture sample has to be taken and sent to central lab for confirmation of the diagnosis. 5.3.5 Electrocardiogram ECGs will be performed at Visit 2, and at the EOT Visit as indicated in the Flow Chart. Printed paper traces from 12 -lead ECGs (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 -V6) will be c ollected . They should be evaluated, signed, dated and commented upon by the treating physician/Investigator and stored locall y. The diagnosis and results from the ECG report s should be collected in the eCRF. In the event of an y cardiac symptoms (i.e. sus picion of heart rh ythm disorders or cardiac ischaemia) during the course of the trial ,ifan additional ECG is recorded at time of event, or later at the next regular visit, they will be evaluated, signed, dated and commented upon by the treating ph ysician /Investigator and stored locally . Any clinically relevant new changes in the ECG (regardless of patient s’symptoms) should be reported as AEs and followed up and/or treated locall y until normal or stable condition. ECG associated with cardiovascular endpoints must be submitted to the adjudication committee together with the baseline ECG . Each ECG tracing stored locally shoul d be labelled with trial and patient number, patient initials and date. 5.3.6 Other safety assessments Outcome of non -fatal stroke 5.3.6.1 For patients experiencing a non -fatal stroke theModified Rankin Scale (MRS) should be used to assess stroke outcome ( Appendix 10. 4). The scale is widel y used in clinical practice and consists of grades, from 0 to 6, with 0 corresponding to no s ymptoms and 6 corresponding to dead . Investigators will measure and score the MRS based o n an interview with the patient at the next regular on -site visit after the onset of the stroke. I n those cases where MRS assessment occurred within 90 day s after the stroke, a repeat MRS -assessment should be performed at the next on -site visit. Detailed i nformation on the stroke (date and time of onset, ty pe, symptoms, method of detection, outcome) will be collected in the eCRF. Hepatic events 5.3.6.2 For assessment of hepatic events please refer to Section 3.1.1. 2. 5.3.7 Assessment of adverse events Definitions of AEs 5.3.7.1 Adverse event An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment."

Adverse reaction An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event i s at least a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may arise from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorisation include off - label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors. Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which: results in death, is life -threatening, this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event ; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically might have caused death if more severe. requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity , is a congenital anoma ly/birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical judgment which may jeopardi se the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse . Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is considered a serious adverse reaction. For Japan only : The following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any other reason” :AEswhich possibly lead to disability will be reported as SAE s. AEs considered “Always Serious” In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medi cal Events, BIhas set up a list of AEs, which by their nature, can alway s be consider ed to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as given above. The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the ISF. These events should alway s be reported as SAEs as described above. Note: Cancers of new histo logy and exacerbations of existing cancer must be reported as a serious event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the cancer."

AESIs need to be reported to the Sponsor’s /CRO’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE, see below . The following are considered as AESIs: Hepatic injury A hepatic injury is defined by the following alterations of hepatic laboratory parameters: an elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or Marked peak ami notransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥5fold ULN These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the ISF. In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed,if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed . Decreased renal function Decreased renal function is defined by a creatinine value showing a ≥2fold increase from baseline and is above the ULN. For the AESI “decreased renal function” the patient needs to be follow ed-up appropriatel y based on local clinical guidance. The Investigator should refer to follow -up schedule for renal endpo int events described in Section 5.3.4.1 . Ketoacidosis Ifmetabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and DKA is suspected ,further investigations should be done according to the medical judgment and the clinical course until a diagn osis is made and/or the patient is recovered. Due to its mechanism of action, empagliflozin may potentiall y modify the clinical presentation of ketoacidosis which may occur at lower plasma glucose levels in patients with DM and potentially also in non -diabetic patient population. The diagnosis of ketoacidosis in these patients can be based on arterial pH ≤7.30, serum bicarbonate levels <15 and measurement of serum beta -hydroxybutrate levels. Other diagnostic criteria which can support the diagnosis of ketoac idosis are urine ketones and anion gap >10."

Events leading to l ower limb amputation Any event leading to a lower limb procedure of amputation, auto -amputation or disarticulation as defined below isconsidered as an AESI . “Amputation is a resection of a limb through a bone. Disarticulation is a resection of a limb through a joint. Auto -amputation is a spontaneous separation of non -viable portion of the lower limb. Not included in this definition are debridement (removal of callus or dead tissue), procedures on a stump (like stump revision, drainage of an abscess, wound revisi on etc.) and other procedures (e.g., nail resection or removal) without a concomitant resection of a limb (amputation or disarticulation).” (International Working Group of Diabetic Foot, 2015). Each lower limb amputation, disarticulation, or auto -amputatio n should be reported separately . The SAE report should include the date of the procedure, the level of amputation or disarticulation, the medical condition(s) leading to the procedure and if the patient had some of the known risk factor(s) for lower limb a mputation. Intensity of A Es The intensity of the AE should be judged based on the following: Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity Severe: Incapacita ting or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities Causal relationship of AEs The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse event. An adverse reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised b y the fact that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected. Medical judgment should b e used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history . Argu ments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship could be: •The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug •The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class. •A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure. •Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re -introduced"

Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship could be: •No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident (e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic d isease within days / weeks of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug concerned) . •Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives). •Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despite removing the original trigger. •Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned). •Disappearance of the event even though the trial medication continues or remains unchanged. For Japan only : The reason for the decision on causal relationship for unlisted AEs needs to be provided in the eCRF. Adverse event collection and reporting 5.3.7.2 AE Collection The Investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in their patient files. The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF(s) by the I nvestigator: From signing the ICFonwards through the Residual Effect Period (REP), until individual patient's end of trialparticipation : oallAEs (serious and non -serious) , Outcome events and all AESIs. After the individual patient’s end of trial: The Investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for AEs, but must report relevant SAEs and relevant AESIs of which the I nvestigator ma y become aware of. The REP (timeframe after last dose of trialmedication when measurable drug levels or pharmacod ynamic effects are still likely to be present) is defined as 7 day s after the last trial medication application.

If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy an SAE form must be completed in addition . Exemptions to SAE reporting A list of serious adverse events that commonly occur in the trialpopulation or which are components of trial endpoints are exempted from expedited reporting. These events are known consequences of the underl ying disease and it is not possible, based on a single case, to conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational drug caused these events. Pulmonary complications of heart failure are added to the exemption list, since patients with HF commonly experience such complications. Thus these events could be reported as pulmonary events, although the underly ing aetiology was attributed to HF. Regardless of relationship to trial medication, these events will not be reported by the Sponsor to regulatory agencies or ethics committees in an expedited manner. These events include: Cardiovascular (CV) related death. The CV related death also inclu des death due to undetermined cause, and death due to pulmonary events that may be secondary to complications of heart failure such as pulmonary oedema , pulmonary vascular disease secondary to heart disease. HF hospitalisation Non-fatal MI Non-fatal stroke and Transient ischemic attack (TIA) CV hospitalisation events Pneumonia (fatal and non -fatal) New or exacerbated COPD (fatal and non -fatal) Based on the same conclusion that it is not possible to perform a causality assessment on these events based on a single case, the trial investigators are exempted from performing a causality assessment and reporting these serious adverse events on the SAE form to the Sponsor. All such events will be collected sy stematicall y on the eCRF (within 24 hours) from the time of randomisation throughout follow up.

The patient should be fasting (no food or liquid except water the last 10 –16 hours) at Visit2 (Randomisation), EOT Visit and Follow Up Visit . If a patient mistakenl y takes trial medication on the morning of Visit 4 before attending the clinic the visit should be rescheduled for another day as soon as possible ,reminding the patients about expected time of dosing. The rescheduled visit must take place in a short enough time -frame so that the patient has sufficient trial medication available. All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart. I f any visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the origi nal visit date schedule. The trial medication packs contain sufficient medication to allow for these time windows. 6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PRO CEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS The Flow Chart summari ses the investigational procedures to be done at each visit, and trial procedures should be performed before intake of any trial medication . The procedures are further described below. 6.2.1 Screening No trial procedures should be done unless the patient has consented to taking part in the trial. Preferably the patient should also b e informed about biobanking (including DNA) sampling alread y at this visit. Once the patient has consented to the trial participation , she/he is considered to be enrolled in the trial and have started screening. The patient should be re gistered in the enrolment log and be registered in the IRT as a screened patient. Patients will continue to take background medication for heart failure and treatment for their concomitant disorders if applicable . If the patient meets the entry criteria, Visit 2 should occur as soon as possible once it has been confirmed that the patient is eligible to continue. If the patient does not meet the entry criteria, the site may make a phone contact to inform the patient that he/she is no longer required to return to th e clinic for Visit 2 . Patients who fail screening (fail to meet one or more of the inclusion criteria, and/or meet one or more of the exclusion criteria) following Visit 1 procedures should be registered as a screen failure in IRT . 6.2.2 Treatment period Randomi sation will occur at Visit 2 using IRT. The patients will return to the clinic for regularl y scheduled visits 4, 12, 32 and 52 weeks after randomisation during the first year of trial participation, and every 24 weeks thereafter for the duration of the tri al, as specified in the Flow chart. These on-site visits will assess the occurrence of safet y and efficacy endpoints, trial medication compliance, concomitant therap y or intervention."

The telephone contact s will focus on safety (e.g. hospitalisation sor occurrence of AEs), changes in concomitant therap y and trial medication compliance. The patients should be fasting at the Randomisation Visit . Theoptional blood sample for DNA will preferably be collected at the Randomisation Visit for all patients eligible for randomisation, but could also be taken at an y later vi sitafter the separate consent is signed . At any time during the treatment period the Investigator is allowed to adjust and optimi se HF background therap y according to local and international guidelines. If any additional therap y is considered necessary for the patient’s welfare during the treatment period it may be given at the discretion of the Investigator (see also restrictions in Section 4.2.2 ). For sites selected to participate in collection of sa mples for PK anal ysis, please refer to Section 5.4 and the Lab Manual for details. Patients will be dispensed medication at each on-site visit and allocation of new kit number (s) will be managed through the IRT. Trial medication administration should be done after physical and laboratory assessments. This is an event driven trial. Patients will remain in the treatment period until the necessary number of events is reached. Permane nt trial medication discontinuation is only justified when clear persistent contraindications arise, or when the patient requests to stop trial medication . See Section 6.2.4 for details on how to handle trial me dication discontinuations, and Section 3.3.4 for when discontinuation from trial is justified. 6.2.3 End of Treatment, Follow Up Period and Trial Completion Patients on treatment at the time when required number of outcome events are reached (ref. Section 7.7 ), will be asked to return to the clinic for the EOT visit, with the proposed time schedule communicated via an investigator letter, followed b y the Follow Up Visit 30 days later. During the EOT visit all trial medication will be collected and compliance calculated, occurrence of safet y and efficacy endpoints will be assessed and complete physical examination ,laboratory assessments and ECG will be performed (ref.

To ensure the trial population consist of a reasonable combination of non -, pre-and DM patients ,and to aim for approximately 35% to 50% of the population or more with an LVEF >50% capping will be used on triallevel (see also Section 3.3 ). Capping on regional level may be applied to achieve a contribution of each region to each category of diabetes status. The composite primary endpoint is the time to first event of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated HHF . The statistical model for the primary anal ysis is the Cox proportional hazards model. The hazard ratio and its confidence limits will be determined for evaluating the superiority of empagliflozin to placebo for the primary endpoint. The key secondary endpoints, which are part of the testing strategy , are occurrence of adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent) , and eGFR (CKD -EPI)crslope of change from baseline 7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHES ES A hierarchical testing procedure will be followed for the assessment of the primary and the key secondary endpoint s. For all endpoints, superiority of empagliflozin vs. placebo will be evaluated with a two -sided test inthe following structure: Null hypothesis: There is no difference between t he effect of placebo and the effect of empagliflozin in terms of the endpoint in question. Alternative h ypothesis: There is a difference between the effect of placebo and the effect of empagliflozin in terms of the endpoint in question. The tests will be performed in the following hierarchical order: 1.Time to first event of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated HHF 2.Occurrence of adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent) 3.eGFR (CKD -EPI)crslope of change from baseline Starting from step 1, if the null hy pothesis is rejected, and the result is more favourable for empagliflozin, superiority is concluded in the tested endpoint, and the overall ty pe I error is preserved for the test in the next step. If at an y step the nul l hypothesis is not rejected, subsequent tests are conducted in an exploratory fashion. The overall ty pe one error rate will be preserved at a level of 0.05 (2 -sided). The ty pe one error rate used at the final analy sis will be influence dby the pre -planned interim anal ysis – see Section 7.4 ."

The safet y analysis will be based on the treated set (TS ), which consists of all patients treated with at least one dose of the trial medication. For both efficacy and safety anal yses, treatment will be evaluated as randomi sed. For serum creatinine and values based on upon this measurement such as eGFR, baseline will be defined as the mean of all available measurements from the screening visit until start of randomised trial medication. Baseline status of DM is defined as: DM: any pre-treatment HbA1c above 6.5 or history of DM as entered in the eCRF on the medical history page Pre-DM: no history of DM and no HbA1c >=6.5 before treatment and a pre -treatment HbA1c value of >= 5.7 and <6.5 Non-DM: not meeting criteria of DM or pre -DM above For all other endpoints, baseline will be defined as the last available measurement before start of randomised trial medication. 7.3.1 Primary endpoint analys es The primary endpoint will be evaluated on the randomi sed set using a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment ,age (continuous), gender, geographical region ,baseline status of DM (DM, pre-DM, no DM), LVEF (continuous) and eGFR (CKD -EPI) crat baseline (continuous )as covariates . The time to the event of interest will be computed as (event date −randomi sation date) +1. All events observed after randomi sation until trial termination will be included in the analysis. Patients who do not have anevent during the trial period will be censored at the individual day of trial completion or the last day that the patient was known to be free of the event ,whiche ver is earlier. The time to censoring will be computed as (individual day of trial completion or the last day known to be free of the event –randomi sation date) + 1. For patients who have more than one primary endpoint event during the trial, the time to the first occurrence of the primary endpoint event will be considered for the primary analy sis. Only theadjudicated and confirmed events will be used for the primary anal ysis. To detect an y heterogeneity in the treatment effect among diabetic patients, p re-diabetic patients and non -diabetic patients, a subgroup analy sis will be performed by including the diabetic status by treatment interaction term into the Cox model."

A sensitivity anal ysis will be provided based on the treated setonly including an y events up to 30 day s after treatment discontinuation. 7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses The key secondary endpoints occurrence of adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent) will be modelled using a join tfrailty model together with adjudicated CVdeath in order to take into account the dependence between the endpoints . The joint frailty model will be adjusted for the same covariates as the primary anal ysis. The joint frailty model therefore models the hazards in the following way : ri(t|ωi, Zi) = ω i exp {β ’1Zi}r0(t) λi (t|ωi,Zi) = ω iαexp {β ’2 Zi}λ0(t) where r i(t) is the hazard of the recurrent HHF for the ith patient, proportional to the baseline intensity function r 0. The hazard function of CV death for the ith patient is λ iproportional to the baseline hazard λ0. β1and β 2are vectors of the regression co efficients of the covariate vectors Ziincluding treatment, age (continuous), gender, history of DM,geographical region , LVEF ( continuous )and eGFR (CKD -EPI) crat baseline (continuous ). Patient specific independent random effects are denoted by ωi, with α giving the relation between HHF and CV death. Patient specific independent random effects denoted by  i and are assumed to follow a gamma distribution with mean 1. The resulting likelihood function can be solved assuming piecewise constant hazards . Slope in change from baseline of eGFR (CKD -EPI) crwill be anal ysed by a random coefficient model allowing for random intercept and random slope per patient. The model will include the factors treatment, gender, geographical region, and status of DM as fixed effects and eGFR (CKD -EPI)crat baseline (conti nuous) , LVEF (continuous), age (continuous), time and interaction of treatment b y time as linear covariates and allow for randomly vary ing slope and intercept between patients. The model will include all on - treatment change from baseline data. Since the s lope is run on the change from baseline data, the intercept will model the acute drop, whereas the long -term effect is modelled by the slope. Change from baseline in clinical summary score for HF s ymptoms and physical limitations domains of the KCCQ at we ek 52 will be evaluated by a mixed model repeated measures model including baseline score , LVEF (continuous), age (continuous) and eGFR (CKD - EPI)crat baseline (continuous) as linear covariate sand treatment, visit, baseline score by"

The other time -to-event type of secondary endpoints will be analy sed using the same Cox proportional hazards model as the primary anal ysis. This also applies for time to adjudic ated CV death and all -cause mortality , rather than using the joint frailty model described above. 7.3.3 Further endpoint analyses Further time-to-event endpoints will be analy sedin the same Cox proportional hazards model asthe primary anal ysis.

An unmatched win ratio considering adjudicated CV death and adjudicated HHF will be analysed based on unmatched pairs. All patients randomised to empagliflozin will be compared to all patients randomised to placebo. Only common follow -up time will be considered for the comparison. Patients on empagliflozin are considered to have “won” the comparison if either the other patient has died while the patient on empa gliflozin was still alive, or if both patients did not die, then if the other patient had more occurrences of HHF. The number of comparisons won is noted as N W. Patients on empagliflozin are considered to have “lost” the comparison if the empagliflozin patient died while the patient on placebo was still alive, or if both patients did not die, then if the patient on empagliflozin had more occurrences of HHF. The number of comparisons lost is noted as N L. The win ratio is NW/ NL.

Details of the imputation rule will be given in the statistical analy sis plan. An eGFR (CDK -EPI)crreduction is considered sustained, if it is determined by two or more consecutive post-baseline central laboratory measurements separated by at least 30 day s(first to last of the consecutive eGFR values) . If there is no additional measurement after the eGFR reduction is observed and the patient dies within 60 day s of this measurement without second measurement >= 30 day s after the first, then the eGFR reduction is also considered sustained."

Approximately equal numbers of patients will be randomised to each treatment group. BI will arrange for the randomi sation and the packaging and labelling of trial medication. The randomi sation list will be generate d using a validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo - random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non - predictable. The block size will be documented in the Clinical Trial Report (CTR ). Access to the codes will be con trolled and documented. 7.7 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE For the sample size calculation, a y early event rate in the placebo group of 10% is assumed. The assumption is based on the CHARM -Preserved study and part of the TOPCAT study from the Americas [R07-4374 , R16-1458 ].The annual event rates in CHARM -Preserved were 8.1 % in the c andesartan group and 9.1% in the placebo group. The annual rates from the America s inthe TOPCAT study were 10.4 in the spironolactone group and 12.6 in the placebo group. The trial is designed to achieve a power of 90% for a two sided test at level α = 0.05. The following table presents the number of required events together with the number of to be randomi sed and treated patients assuming an accrual period of 18 months and a follow -up period of 20 months for different assumed true hazard ratios. However, the follow -up period is not fixed but the trial will continue until the necessary number of events ha sbeen observed, which are confirmed b y the adjudication committee."

Including interim anal ysis with Hwang -Shih-deCani alphaspending with gamma= -8 at 60% of information will diminish the power onl y slightly to 89.98%. The event rate will be assessed in a blinded manner during recruitment before an yinterim unblinding . If the accumulated blinded data sug gests a lower event rate based on an assumed hazard ratio of 0.8 between the groups, then the number of randomised patients may be increased to a maximum of 6000 patients. The number of confirmed primary outcome events will not be affected b y this consider ation and will remain 841 events. Calculations were performed using ADDPL AN6. 1.1by ADDPLAN Inc. Based on the abovementioned assumptions, and considering that HHF (first and recurrent) will only be tested if the primary endpoint is successful, the chance of showing significance for HHF (first and recurrent) in a positive trial is at least 70%. For the integration of a Japanese population in this global phase III trial, and in order to comply with the regulatory requirements for bridging the trial r esults to this population, the Japanese patients to be randomised will be followed and controlled if necessary .

If a trial collaborator has given a supplementary explanation, the trial collaborator also signs (or places a seal on) and dates the ICF. Re-consenting may become necessary when new relevant information becomes ava ilable and should be conducted according to the Sponsor's or delegate’s instructions. The respective procedure for illiterate patients is described in the Appendix 10.1. The consent and re -consenting process shou ld be properl y documented in the source documentation. The patient must be informed that his/her personal trial -related data will be used by Boehringer Ingelheim in accordance with the local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explain ed to the patient. The patient must be informed that his / her medical records may be examined by authorised monitors (CML /CL/Clinical Research Associate ( CRA )) or Clinical Quality Assurance auditors appointed b y BI, by appropriate IRB / IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. 8.2 DATA QUALITY ASSURAN CE In order to achieve a high level of standardised processes, data collection of efficacy and safet y endpoints is coordinated centrally: central lab anal ysis of efficacy endpoints, biomarkers and safet y lab central ECG collection (for clinically relevant ECG changes documented as an AE or suspected clinicall y relevant ECG changes) central IRT for stratification, randomisation and kit allocation at each visit central adjudication of HHF and card iovascular events, and hepatic adjudication. The data management procedures to ensure the quality of the data are described in detail in the trial data management and anal ysis plan available in eTMF. A quality assurance audit/inspection of this trial may be conducted b y the Sponsor, Sponsor’s designees, or b y IRB / IEC or by regulatory authorities. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the Investigator’s trial -related files and correspondence, and the informed consent docume ntation of this clinical trial. 8.3 RECORDS ECRF for individual patients will be provided b y the Sponsor or delegate . See Section 4.1.5.2 for rules about emergency code breaks. For drug accountability , refer to Section 4.1.8 . 8.3.1 Source documents In accordance with regulatory requirements the Investigator should prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that include all observations and"

Source data as well as reported data should follow good documentation practices and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit t rail). Data reported on the eCRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must be explained. The current medical history of the subject may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility for the trial and the Investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of an y diagnostic tests. In this case the Investigator must make three documented attempts to retrieve previous medical records. If this fails, a verbal history from the patient, documented in their medical records , would be acceptable . Before providing an y copy of patients’ source documents to the Sponsor or delegate the investigator must ensure that all patient identifiers (e.g. patient’s name, initials, address, phone number, social security number) have properly been removed or redacted to ensure patient confidentiality . If the patient is not compliant with the protocol, any corrective action e.g. re -training must be documented in the patient file. For the eCRF, data must be derived from source documents, for exam ple: Patient identification: gender, date or year of birth (in accordance with local laws and regulations) Patient participation in the trial (substance, trial number, patient number, date patient was informed) Dates of Patient’s visits, including dispensing of trial medication Medical history (including trial indication and concomitant diseases, if applicable) Medication history Adverse events and outcome events (onset date (mandatory ), and end date (if available)) Serious adverse events (onset date (mandatory ), and end date (if available)) Concomitant therap y (start date, changes) Originals or copies of laboratory results and other imaging or testing results, with proper documented medical evaluation (in validated electronic format, if available ) Completion of Patient’s Participation in the trial” (end date; in case of premature discontinuation document the reason for it). Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be documented evidence in the source data ( e.g. medical records) that the trial participant meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet an y exclusion criteria. The absence of records (either medical records, verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria does not make the patient eligible for the clinical trial."

The frequency of on -site monitoring will be determined b y assessing all characteristics of the trial, including its nature, objective, methodology and the degree of any deviations of the intervention from normal clinical practice. The I nvestigator / institution will permit trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review and regulatory inspections. Direct access must be provided to the eCRF and all source documents/data, including progress notes, copies of laboratory and medical test r esults, which must be available at all times for review b y the CRA, auditor and regulatory inspector (e.g. FDA). The CRA and auditor may review all eCRFs and ICFs. The accuracy of the data will be verified b y direct comparison with the source documents des cribed in Section 8.3.1. The Sponsor or delegate will also monitor compliance with the protocol and ICH GCP. An adaptive approach to clinical trial monitoring will be utilised. This is initiated by an assessment of the risk associated with the trial combined with an assessment of critical data and processes. A Risk Assessment Mitigation Plan and Integrated Project Management Plan collectively document the strategies involved with the implementation of onsite, remote and central monitoring activities in order to direct focus to the areas of greatest risk which have the most potential impact to safet y patient and data quality. Trial oversight is achieved b y regular review of a report of risk which then influences an y requir ed changes to the monitoring strategy . The Investigator /institution will allow on -site trial -related monitoring, audits, I RB/IEC review and regulatory inspections. Direct access should be granted to all source documents (paper and e -records) including progress notes, copies of laboratory and medical test results The CRA and auditor may review all CRFs and ICFs. The accuracy of the data will be verified b y direct comparison with the source documents described in Section 8.3.1. The Sponsor/CRO will also monitor compliance with the protocol and I CH GCP. 8.3.3 Storage period of records Trial site(s): The trial site(s) must retain the source documents and essential documents (including ISF) according to the national or local requirements (whatever is longer) valid at the time of the end of the trial.

If a standard mercury sphy gmomanometer is not available, alternative devices recommended b y website ww w.dableducational.org may be used or devices approved for use b y the appropriate national agency /ies. At visit 1, blood pressure should be taken 3 times in both arms. If the pressures differ b y more than 10 mmHg (as in the presence of a subclavian steal sy ndrome), the arm with the higher pressure (s ystolic or diastolic) should be used for subsequent measurements. After the patient ha srested quietly , in the seated position for five minutes, three blood pressure measurements will be taken approximately two m inutes apart and all three results must be entered in the eCRF. The seated HRwill be taken during one of the two -minute interval s. Blood pressure measurements should be recorded to the nearest 2 mmHg only when measured with a manual sphy gmomanometer; when digital devices are used the value from the device should be rounded to the nearest 1 mmHg. For calculation of mean values, decimal places should be rounded to integers (e.g. a DBP of 94.5 would be rounded to 95 mmHg and a DBP of 109.4 would be rounded to 109 mmHg)."

The screening procedures can be done on different days within the time window . 2. From Visit 8and onwards, on-site visits will be scheduled every 24 weeks until end of trial. Patients who prematurely discontinue trial medication will perform EOT visit and Follow Up visit, and then continue with sched uled visits until the trial is stopped. For patients not willin g to attend scheduled visits, telephone call smust be made regularly (ref. Section 3.3.4.1 ) to document any occurrence of outcome events and vital status. If the trial continues beyond 148 weeks , visit sare to be repeated with same intervals as from week 64 and onwards. 3. Timepoint for the EOT will be communicated via an I nvestigator letter when the Sponsor is confident that required number of events will be reached within a reasonable timeframe (ref. Section 3.1 and 6.2.3 ).All patients will have a follow up visit 30 days following regular or premature completion of the treatment period . 4. Visit dates are determined per the date of randomisation. If a visit is missed, the patient should be returned to the original visit schedule at the next visit. 5. NF = non fasting, F=fasting. Fasting means no food or liquid intake except for water the last 10 -16 hours 6. All v isit 1 procedures shou ld be performed within 28 days of signing the informed consent form (ICF). 7. If accepted by local authorities or ethic committees, demographics to be collected in this trial are gender, year of birth , ethnicity and race. 8. The Investigator will be asked to record r esults from c linical routine examinations like ECG , echocardiography or similar procedures (MRI, CT -scan, etc.) , and if applicable information gathered from interrogations of the ICD in the eCRF . 9. Vital signs measurements in this trial are blood pre ssure and pulse rate. 10. Protocol specified outcome events should be collected on the appropriate eCRF page. Exemp tions from reporting on the SAE form are specified inSection 5.3.7 . 11. For patients with non -fatal stroke the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) should be scored by the investigator based on an interview at the next regular on-site visit after the onset of the stroke. In those cases where MRS assessment occurred within 90 days after the stroke, a repeat MRS -assessment should be performed at the next on -site visit. For patients who experience a non -fatal stroke less than 90 days prior to the study closure date, the final MRS assessment will occur at the final study visit for that patient. 12. For the 12 -lead ECG done at screening and EOT visit, the interpretation of the tracing must be made locally by a qualified physician or appropriately qualified designee and documented on the ECG section of the eCRF. In case of any cardiac symptoms (i ndicating rhythm disorders or cardiac isch aemia), additional 12 -lead ECG(s) should be done to document a potential outcome event. 13. For female pat ients of child -bearing potential, local urine pregnancy test should be performed according to the Flow Chart . More frequent testing should be performed if required by local regulations/authorities. 14. For the screening Visit 1, the safety laboratory is limited to liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine and haematology panel . Patients do not have to be fasting. 15. HbA1c to be analy sed in all patients, e.g. diabetics and non -diabetics. 16. For PK analysis ,one blood sample will be collected prior to the next scheduled dose of trial medication at Visit 4and between 22 to 26 h after the most recent drug intake. 17. Collection of biobanking samples (plasma, serum, urine, DNA) is optional. Participating patients are required to give informe d consent specifically for biobanking . Samples will be stored at a biob anking facility for future research . 18. DNA biobanking requires only one blood sample to be taken, preferably at Visit 2 (Randomisation). However, collection at late r visits is permitted as long as the informed consent for biobanking remains valid . 19. At all visits; the respective kit number has to be allocated to the patient via IRT. Trial medication should be taken after all trial related procedures are completed at an on - site visit."

HF is a prevalent disease affecting an estimated 26 million people worldwide. In the United States alone the prevalence is 5.7 million, and there are 670,000 new cases per year[R16-1527 ]. HF is associated with premature mortality and frequent hospitali sation. Approximately 50% of patients who develop HF die within 5 y ears after diagnosis [P16-03952 ]. Annually , more than 1 million patients are hospitali sed with a primary diagnosis of HF . HF is the most common cause of hospitali sation among individuals above 65 y ears of age in the western countries [P16-03760]. Two ty pes of HF have been defined mainly based on the LV ejection fraction (EF) and also other structural changes in heart muscle. The yconsist of heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) <40% and heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) ≥40%. Relative prevalence of HFpEF among HF patients is approx imately 50% [R16-1528 ]. Amongst patients with HF who require hospitali sation, the proportion of HFpEF is rising. A nalysis of a large HF registry showed that the proportion of patients hospitali sed with HF (HHF ) who had HFpEF increased from 33% in 2005 to 39% in 2010 [R16-1529 ]. The rate of rehospitalisation among patients with HFrEF is close to 29% within 60 -90 day s of hospitalisation discharge which is equal to HFpEF [R16-1527 ]. Despite advances in therapy and management, HF remains a deadl y clinical sy ndrome. After HHF, the one y earmortality rate is high and not different between patients with preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF)[R16-2217 ], underscoring a high unmet medical need in this population. About 25 to 45% of patients with HF have concomitant ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and nearl y 15-25% have borderline DM (pre-diabetes), indicating a potential link between the HF syndromes and glucometabolic disturbances [R16-2382 , R16-2384 ]. Despite t he current standard of care for treatment of HFrEF such as medical therapy [angiotensin -converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) , ivabradine and angiotensin receptor blocker -neprilysin inhibitor (ARN I)] or device therapy ,the mortalit y and morbidity remains high. For HFpEF, however, control of congestive sy mptoms during acute episodes is the mainstay of management of these patients and no class of drugs have shown to increase survival or reduce HHF [P16-0376 0, P16-05920 ]. Empagliflozin is an orally available inhibitor of the renal dependent glucose co -transporter 2 (SGL T-2) indicated for, reduction of blood glucose in patients with T2DM by promoting urinary glucose excretion. I t also reduces blood pressure, arterial stiffness and measures of the my ocardi al work load, likely through various mechanisms, as well as improving other CV risk factors (uric acid, visceral fat mass, albuminuria) [P15-00589 , P15-09541 ]."

This trial completed in 2015 and showed empagliflozin, when given in addition to standard care treatment in high CV risk patients with T2DM, reduces the risk of 3 -point Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE )by 14% mostly driven by a 38% reduction in CV death. Furthermore this trial demonstrated reduction in the prespecified and adjudicated composite outcome of “CV death or HHF ”and HHF by 34% . Consistent with the main results of theEMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, in approximately 10% of the trial population who had investigator -reported heart failure at baseline, empagliflozin showed significant reduction in CV death, HHF , and composite of “ HHF or CV death” [P16- 01253 ]. 1.2 DRUG PROFILE Empagliflozin is an orally available, potent, and selective inhibitor of the renal SGLT -2. Its selective inhibition reduces renal reabsorption of sodium and glucose. This leads to both increased urinary sodium and glucose excretion. While the urinary sodiu m excretion returns to normal within few days of empagliflozin administration, the effect on urinary glucose continues. Empagliflozin has been developed for the treatment of T2DM, and has received marketing approval in various regions including , for exampl e,the European Union ,Latin America n countries , USA and Japan where it is marketed under the brand name Jardiance®. For a more detailed description of the drug profile please refer to the current I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) [c01678844 -06] and local prescribing information for empagliflozin. 1.2.1 Non-clinical assessment of safety For further information regarding pre -clinical evaluation, please refer to the current version of the IB for empagliflozin . 1.2.2 Clinical pharmacokinetics In humans, empagliflozin predominantly showed linear pharmacokinetic (PK). Empagliflozin reaches peak levels at approximately 1.5 hours and showed a biphasic decline with the terminal elimination half -life of 12.4 hours ranging from 10 to 19 hours. Empagliflozin exposure increases with renal or hepatic impairment; however, no dose adjustment is recommended as the observed changes in exposure were not clinically meaningful. No clinically relevant PK interactions were observed with other oral antidiabetics, warfarin, verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, digoxin, hy drochlorothiazide, torasemide, emfibrozil, rifampicin, probenecid and oral contraceptives (Microgynon®). For further details refer to the current version of the IB for empagliflozin. 1.2.3 Clinical efficacy and safety Approximately 550 healthy volunteers were exposed to empagliflozin (up to 800 mg single dose and up to 50 mg multiple dosing). Approximately 8500 patients with T2DM have been treated with empagliflozin in research studies, of wh ich approximately 4400 have been"

Also, empagliflozin was tested in over 4600 patients with T2DM and high CV risk for median treatment duration of 2.6 y ears. The EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial was a randomi sed, placebo -controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg in 7020 patients with T2DM and high CV risk. I t ended in 2015 after accruing the minimum prespecified 691 major adverse CV events. Empagliflozin was associated with significant risk reduction of all -cause mortality by 32% ( HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.57, 0.82 p<0.0001) and CV death b y 38% ( HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.49, 0.77, p value <0.0001). In addition, the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial showed reduction in the prespecified and adjudicated composite outcome of “CV death or HHF ” by 34% ( HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.55, 0.79, p value <0.0001). This result was consistent across various predefined sensitivity anal ysis and internal consistency was confirmed by showing overall homogeneit y over a wide range of subgroups, including patients with and without history ofHF at baseline. There was no significant difference in improving CV outcomes between the 10 and 25 mg dose. The Phase III studies in T2DM showed that treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg once dail y for up to 24 weeks results in a reduction of Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c )up to 1%, body weight reduction between 2 -3 kg,and a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 3 -5 mmHg compared with placebo. This was consistently observed with empagliflozin as monotherap y, add on to metformin, metformin and sulphony lurea, pioglitazone with or without metformin, and to basal insulin with metformin and/or sulphony lurea. Phase III studies up to 104 weeks in T2DM support the sustained effect of empagliflozin. In clinical studies, empagliflozin was well toler ated in both healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM including patients with high CV risk up to a median duration of 2.6 y ears. The frequency of overall Adverse Events (AEs), AEs leading to discontinuation and Serious AE (SAEs) were comparable to placebo . There was no significant increase in frequency of hypoglycaemia with empagliflozin compared to placebo except when used in combination with a sulphony lurea or basal insulin. I n general there was a small increase in frequency of urinary tract infection (U TI) compared to placebo. There was an increase in frequency of genital infections with the use of empagliflozin. There was a small increase in total cholesterol, low -densit y lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high -densit y lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and n o significant changes in trigl ycerides. No changes in electroly tes were observed with empagliflozin. In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial renal function over time, as measured by theeGFR, is shown in Figure 1.2.3:1[P16-06807 ]. After the initial decrease ,eGFR remained stead y in the empagliflozin group and wasreversed after the cessation of the trial medication (Figure 1.2.3:2). At the follow -up visit, the adjusted mean difference from placebo in the change from baseline in the eGFR with each of the two doses of empagliflozin was 4.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (95% confidence interval , 4.0 to 5.5; P<0.001 for both comparison s) (Figure 1.2.3:2).The data indicated that the initial drop in eGFR after administration of empagliflozin is reversible and most likely due to hemody namic carnages. This is very similar to what ha ve been observed with ACEi and ARBs . The EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial also generated the hypothesis that the expected deterioration in renal function in patients with T2DM slowed"

In patients with CKD4 renal impairment (RI), while there was not change in the gl ycaemic response, the reduction in BP and renal hemody namic changes (similar to what was observed in the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial) were preserved. In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME triala similar reducti on in CV risk was observed in the subgroup of patients with different degree of RI, including patients with eGFR between >45-60 and >30 -45 mL/min/1.73 m2. 2RATIONALE, OBJECTIVE S, AND BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT 2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL Heart failure is an important public health problem, and one of the leading causes of hospitali sation in the Western countries. With the increasingl y aging population and increasing incidence of obesity , the scope and cost to society associated with this condition will progressively rise. There is a nunmet medical need in treatment of patients with HFpEF. Despite advances in the management of HF, no new therapies have been found to improve outcomes by reducing mortality or morbidit y (i.e. CV death or HHF ) in these patie nts [P16- 03760 ]. HF also significantly decreases health -related quality of life (HRQOL) and pharmacological therapies have not shown consistent improvement in HRQOL . Empagliflozin improves survival in patients with high car diovascular risk by mechanisms which go bey ond the blood glucose lowering effect. There was no heterogeneity by baseline HbA1c categories inHHF or “CV death and HHF” risk reduction in the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial. Empagliflozin exerts its glucose lowering effect b y preventing sodium and glucose reabsorption. The initial natriuresis will be compensated within days of drug administration through changes in tubulo -glomerular feedback. However, the glucosuria lasts as long as the medication is use d. This leads to consequent hemod ynamic changes associated with a modest osmotic diuresis, blood pressure lowering effect, improvement in arterial stiffness, reduction in oxidative stress, and decrease in heart rate ( HR) xPressure product, a measure of m yocardial oxy gen consumption, with no increase in HR and no effect on sympathetic nerve activity [P15-00589 , P15-09541 ]. Of note, the effect of empagliflozin on improving CV outcomes is evident even at low urinary glucose excretion demonstrated in those with low HbA1c as well as in those with reduced renal function (i.e. eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ). Subgroup anal ysis of the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial showed no difference in patients with baseline HbA1c <7%, 7% to 8%, 8% to 9%, or >9% for CV death or HHF risk reduction. In addition, patients who had no HbA1c change or only modest change up to 0.2% throughout the trial have shown to have a similar risk reduction of HHF as the patients with at least 0.3% or higher reduction in HbA1c. Also as noted changes in BP reduction and hemod ynamic changes were preserved in patients with CKD4, despite loss of glycaemic efficacy . Lack of correlation between CV outcome improvement and blood glucose levels pro vides supporting evidence that the benefit of empagliflozin in HHF or CV death risk reduction should also be expected in patients without DM [P16-01253 , c09670340 , c11764168 ].The beneficial CV effects of empagliflozin cannot be explained by the modest"

Other outcome trials with the goal of tight gl ycaemic control (ADVANCE, ACCORD, and VADT) have failed to show significant CV benefit [R16-1560 ] and decrease in incident HF or mortality [R16-0736 ]. It should be noted that in a mechanistic stud y,non-DMsubjects showed metabol ic changes such as, increase in endogenous glucose production, and substrate shift from glucose to lipid oxidation similar to those observed in patients with T2DM after one dose and up to 4 weeks of daily administration of empagliflozin [ P16-01830 ]. Furthermore, in a trial of health y volunteers, empagliflozin 10 mg resulted in approximately 50 g glucosuria per day [P13- 04190 ]. This amount of glucose excretion is similar to wha t had been observed in patients with eGFR between 30 -60mL/min 1.73 m2 (CKD3) which wasclose to 55 g glucosuria per day. In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial patients with CKD3 showed a trend for the CV death or HHF risk reduction very similar to the risk reduct ion in the main cohort and in patients with CKD2 and 1. While the higher level of glucosuria is associated with a higher HbA1c reduction and better gl ycaemic control, this correlation is lacking for the CV benefits associated with empagliflozin, and in fac t a lower glucose excretion similar to what has been observed in patients with CKD3 or in health y volunteer sseems to be sufficient to improve the CV outcomes. Therefore, the expected benefit of empagliflozin such as BP reduction, weight loss, improvement in arterial stiffness, and hemody namic changes, as well as CV benefits seen in patients with T2DM is also speculated to be seen in HF patients without DM and in patients with CKD3 and 4 . These findings further support the rationale of exploring the effect of empagliflozin bey ond DM.Although the ty pe of HF was not assessed entering the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, it is highly likely in this trial both patients with preserved and reduced ejection fraction were included, considering the high prevalence of both HF rEF and HFpEF in patients with DM [R16-1529 ]. The modes of action described above, and beneficial effect in patients with history of HF in the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, further supports the scientific rationale of performing this trial to explore the effect of empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF. 2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES The objective of this event -driven trial is to demonstrate superiorit yof empagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo in patients with sy mptomatic , chronic HF and preserved eject ion fraction (LVEF > 40%) under stable treatment of HF s ymptoms . For further description of trial endpoints and statistical anal ysis, please refer to Section 5 and 7. This trial is part of an investigational clinical trial program of empagliflozin in patients with chronic HF. A trial to investigate the efficacy and safet y in patients with reduced EF (LVEF ≤40%) is ongoing in parallel. 2.3 BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT The overall benefits and safe profile of empagliflozin have been outlined in previous sections. A pharmacologic rationale for the use of empagliflozin in HF can be found in Section 1.1 . The overall tolerability and safet y profile outlined in Section 1.2 , and the current IB, supports chronic administration of empagliflozin 10 mg in human studies."

DM is known to be a frequent and clinicall y important co -morbidity in HF patients. To evaluate this important co-morbidity , HF patients across the DM spectrum (i.e., T1DM, T2DM, pre -diabetes) as well as HF patients who do not have DM, wil l be included in this trial. Special safet y considerations are required for patients with T1DM, and several safet y monitoring strategies will be employ ed, including training of investigators and education of patients on the risk and prevention strategi es for ketoacidosis (KA) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) . Since a nSGLT -2 inhibitor may alter the ty pical presentation of this condition, patients will receive a home monitoring device to measure blood ketones and a diary for patients torecord their blood glucose , ketone values ,and insulin intake. Patients with T1DM will also be required to carry a trial information card which includes information about the possible altered presentation of KAto be presented to health care professiona lsshould the patient be seen in an urgent care setting. For further details refer to Section 4.2.1. As outlined above, inclusion of patients who do not have diabetes is also allowed in this tri al. It has been shown that in healthy volunteers dosing with empagliflozin results in gly cosuria summing up to about 2/3 the average glucosuria in patients with T2DM. This is similar to the amount of glucose lost in T2DM subjects with moderate RI. Because in the EMPA REG Outcome study no difference in CV benefit was detected for patients with RIvs the overall population, it is it is hy pothesized that this amount of glucosuria is not the main factor to obtain CV effects with empagliflozin. There are no lon g-term safet y data for empagliflozin in patients without diabetes. Data in non-diabetic subjects is limited to healthy volunteers, without significant co -morbidities or concomitant medications. Exposure in healthy volunteers is from single dose and multi ple dose studies with exposure up to 28 day s. However, while limited, such data does include over 500 health y volunteers exposed to empagliflozin during the clinical development for treatment of T2DM. No specific safet y concern was identified and no occur rences of symptomatic hy pogly cemia were detected [U12-2707 -01]. It is noted that in patients with T2DM the risk of h ypoglycemia was onl y increased with empagliflozin compared to the placebo group in patients who were concomit antly treated with insulin or a sulfony lurea. Further, in a mechanistic study [c11963611 -01], subjects without DM were shown to increase endogenous glucose production in response to glucosuria after administration of empagliflozin. As a result, blood glucose levels remained in the normal range for these individuals [P16-01830 ]. Therefore, it isscientifically reasonable to hy pothesize that in non - diabetic patients, with no medical indi cation for insulin or sulfony lurea treatment that the risk of hy poglycemia associated with empagliflozin treatment would be lower than in patients with T2DM . Because the mode of action, blockade of the SGLT2 with consequent glucosuria, is the same in pat ients with and without diabetes, although to different degrees , it is considered likel y that the tolerability of empagliflozin may be no less favourable in patients without DM compared to patients with T2DM. There is also currentl y limited therapeutic exp erience with empagliflozin in patients aged 85 years and older. The prevalence of HFincreases with age and the therapeutic options in the"

The inclusion of this population in the clinical trial setting will help suppor t the assessment of benefit -risk of empagliflozin for patients over 85. Special caution should be used in these patients, who may be at increased risk of adverse consequences attributable to empagliflozin -related volume depletion. Many patients with chron ic HF have RI, and to ensure that the trial results reflect this population, patients with eGFR ≥20 ml/min/1.73m2can be included. In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, the cardiovascular benefits ofempagliflozin were not driven by its pharmacological effect o f lowering blood glucose and were consistently noted in patients with different degrees of RI, including patients with eGFR between > 30 and < 45 ml/min/1.37m2. In previous trials in patients with T2DM the safet y profile in moderate and severe RIwere comparable to the overall trial population [P17-10453 ]. Renal safet y will be closely monitored throughout the trial. Refer to section 5.3.4.1 .and 5.3.7.1 . Investigators will be encouraged to treat participants to best standard of care in compliance with the local guidelines and recommendations for HF, and DMif present . Based on the putative mechanism of actions (reviewed in Section 2.1 ) and the result of the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, it is assumed that patients with HFpEF should benefit from empagliflozin treatment on top of guideline -directed therapies. The safet y profile of empagliflozin in these patients should follow a similar trend which was previously observed in over 10000 patients with T2DM treated with empagliflozin, including patients with high CV risk. Safety will be ensured by close monitoring of the subjects f or AEs both clinically and by laboratory testing. To continue the assessment of the long -term safety of empagliflozin, adjudication of cardiovascular events ,certain hepatic events ,and KAwill be performed in this trial. The progress of the trial will al so be assessed at regular intervals b y an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). For further details please refer to Section 3.1.1 . One interim anal ysis is planned after approximately 500primary event shavebeen accrued. If the prespecified criteria for stopping for success at the interim anal ysis has been reached , the Executive Steering Committee (E xSC) and the Sponsor will be informed. The final decision whether to stop the trialwill be m ade b y Sponsor. For further details refer to Section 7.4 . As with all drugs, the potential for h ypersensitivity and allergic reactions has to be taken into consideration when empagliflozin is administered. Other risks to the patients are the risks inherent to an y investigational medicinal product used in a clinical trial setting, such as unexpected adverse clinical or laboratory events. Empagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction .In patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of empagliflozin is recommended . Although rare , apotential for drug induced liver injury (DILI) is under constant surveillance by the S ponsor and regulators. Therefore this trial requires timel y detection ,evaluation and follow -up of laboratory alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients´ safet y, see also Section 5.3.6.1 ."

The aim of this trial is to recruit patients with HFpEF on various HF background therapies to evaluate the long term effect of empagliflozin on CV death and HHF in a real life clinical setting. Due to its mode of action empagliflozin should be efficacious in treating patients with HF and could provide additional efficacy in combination with any given background therap y. The placebo -controlled design is considered ethically acceptable on the basis of appropriate criteria for patient discontinuation, ability to change background therapy to maintain, or obtain, sufficient level of hemody namic control as defined in relevant local and regional guidelines for optimi sed standard of care. The double -blind treatment period is planned until the necessary number of events is observed to evaluate efficacy of empagliflozin compared to sta ndard of care. The 30 day s follow -up period is considered to be sufficient for assessment of adverse events and efficacy outcomes after stopping trial medication . Patients should be receiving appropriate care as defined b y their ph ysician or practitioner for all cardiovascular conditions according to the prevailing guidelines .This should be conducted in the context of local or regional guidance for primary or secondary CV prevention. The rationale for do se and dose -interval selection is described in Section 4.1. 2. 3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL P OPULATION An appropriate number of patients will be screened for the trial in approximate ly 22 countries. Approximately 560trial centres will participat eto ensure that the estimated 4126 patients are randomi sedto trial medication and complete the trial. Investigators who fail to randomi se at least one patient in the first 12 weeks from centre initiation may be excluded from further participation. If enrolment is delay ed, additional centres may be initiated. The total number of randomi sed patients may be adapted based on assessment of the blinded event rate. If the accumulated blinded data sugg ests a slower accrual of primary outcome events over calendar time than originally projected, then the number of patients randomised may be increased up to 6000. Operationall y, the recruitment period would be extended and could continue up to 6 months befo re the target number of events is expected to be achieved. The number of primary outcome events required is not affected by this consideration. For further details refer to Section 7.7 . Clinical trials c ontribute toward reducing health disparities through improved knowledge about treatment among diverse populations. Greater diversit y in clinical trial samples allows for broader generali sation of trialresults, increased minority access to trials, improved standards of care, decreased disparities in disease treatment and outcomes, and improved external validity supported by a more representative sample.

According to previous heart failure trials and registries the prevalence of DM amongst patien ts with HF varies from 2 5%to 40%. Prevalence of pre -DM is not clearly understood but it is estimated to vary from 15% to 50% [ R16-2382 , R16-2384 ]. In a recent large HF outcome trial, 35% of t he patients reported to have DM, another 15% found to have undiagnosed DM and around 27% had pre -DM [ R16-2383 ]. Since there is a chance that empagliflozin, as a diabetes drug, when used in CV outcome trials recruits more p atients with T2DM, capping on trial level will be used to aim for a similar distribution of patients with DM, pre -DM or no DM as it is expected in the population of patients with the HFin real life. Via IRTit will be ensured that approximately a minimum of 35 % of the trial population will be patients with DM , a minimum of 15 % will be patients with pre -DM and a minimum of 20 % will be non -diabetic patients. Additionally recruitment to the three categories of DM, pre -DM or no DM will be monito red on regional level. Capping on regional level may be applied to achieve a contribution of each region to each category of diabetes status. DM in this context is defined as active treatment with antidiabetic medication (for indication of DM) or screening HbA1c ≥6.5% or history of DM. Pre-DM is defined as screening HbA1c ≥5.7% and <6.5% without the intake of antidiabetic medication (unless taken for a non -DM indication) and no history of DM, and patients with no DM is defined as screening HbA1c < 5.7 % wit hout an y intake of antidiabetic medication (unless taken for a non -DM indication) and no history of DM [R16- 2261 ]. IRT will be used to aim for a trial population consisting of approximately 35% to 50% with an LVEF >50%. To ensure adequate enrolment of patients the f inal decision on capping will be based on the recommendation from the ExSC during the recruitment period . Screening of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening for the trial will stop at all centr es when a sufficient number of patients have been randomi sed to trial treatment. Investigators will be notified when screening is complete and will not be allowed to recruit additional patients thereafter. Patients who have completed visit 1 procedures prior to notification of the termination of recruitment will be allowed to be randomised in the trial, if they meet all eligibility criteria. Patient eligibility will be based upon a complete medical history including a ph ysical examination and clinical laborato ry tests. Judgment of the clinical relevance of a concomitant disease is at the discretion of the Investigator.

If a patient is withdrawn f rom the trial the ExSC and the Sponsor should be informed immediately about each individual case. Prematurely discontinuation of tri al medication For patients who prematurely discontinue trial medication all efforts should be made to observe these patients and ask them to continue to attend the scheduled visits until the end of trial. I t is expected that all efforts are made to follow up on the collection of all adverse events, outcome events and concomitant therap y, and to have a complete dataset without missing data. If a patient wh o prematurely discontinued trial medication is not willing to return to the predefined trial visits, at minimum a telephone call every 24weeks (preferably every 12 weeks) and a telephone call at trial end will be required, to document the occurrence of outcome events and vital status. I f possible, other AE’s and concomitant therapy changes since last visit must be recorded. Every attempt must be made b y the Investigator to ensure patients continue partici pating in the trial during trial medication interruptions an d after discontinuation of trial medication. Patients who prematurel y discontinue trial medication are allowed to restart treatment, at an y time if appropriate in the opinion of the I nvestigator . At every visit follo wing trial medication discontinuation Investigators must consider if trial medication can be re-started. Patients that are not actively taking trial medication may be less motivated to adhere to the scheduled trial visits. I nvestigators and site staff sho uld work to detect early signs of losing interest and readily present such patients (not actively taking trial medication) with the following options to encourage continued participation: Option 1 Continue to attend regularly scheduled trial visits at the centre until the trial ends Option 2 Conduct all remaining trial visits over the phone Option 3 Discontinue participation in remaining trial activities but permit collection of vital status and CV outcome events at the end of the trial through the patien t or alternative person designated b y the patient (e.g., family, spouse, partner, legal representative, or ph ysician) even if only by telephone . If possible, other AE’s and concomitant therap y changes tobe recorded. Sites should encourage the patient to r eturn to the clinic for the final stud y visit. Option 4 Discontinue participation in remaining trial activities but permit collection of vital status at the end of the trial through the patient, alternative person designated b y the patient, or through rev iew of patient’s medical information from alternative sources (e.g., doctor’s notes, hospital records, etc.)"

A patient could be instructed to permane ntly stop the trial medication only after discussion with I nvestigator, if eligibility criteria are being violated, or if the patient fails to comply with the protocol (e.g. non -attendance at trial assessments). Withdrawal of informed consent A patient has the right to withdraw informed consent for participation at an y time for an y reason. However, withdrawal of consent from trial participation should be very rare and unusual. Because of this, the I nvestigator must be involved in the discussion s with the patient regarding a withdrawal of consent. Additionally , the Investigator must discuss the withdrawal of consent with the Sponsor’s/CRO’s representative prior to stopping trial participation. Early discontinuation of trial medication is not a c riterion for withdrawal of consent for participati onin the trial. The right to withdraw informed consent at an y time for an y reason also applies to the optional informed consent to biobanking (including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA )sampling), which is separate from the consent for trial participation. If the patient withdraws informed consent for participation in the trial, the trial will end for that patient. The patient should stop taking trial medication and should be asked to complete the end of treatme nt (EOT) visit and follow -up procedures as described in the Flow Chart . Completing these procedures is strongl y recommended for the patient’s safety. Patients that withdraw informed consent will not be replaced. Vital status m ust be collected at the end of trial for patients that withdraw consent from trial participation, if allowed by local regulations. Patients lost to follow -up If a patient is lost, every effort will be made by the Investigator and site staff to contact and locate the patient before the patient is declared lost to follow -up. Investigators and site staff must use every possible allowable means, according to local regulations, to locate patients who have missed visits. Efforts to contact the patient may include but are not limited to: •Calling all numbers for patient and listed contacts (including in the evening and on weekends). •Calling primary care physician, refer ring specialist and/or other listed phy sicians for more recent information, date of last office visit or to determine vital status. •Sending an email and follow up with mailing certified letters (return receipt requested) to all known patient addresses and all listed contacts (e.g., relatives, friends, neighbours) that were provided by the patient. •Reviewing patient’s records and medical notes for any details of a hospitalisation, doctor’s visit or other procedure that may indicate location or status of subj ect. •Use Internet to search for possible contact information for the patient. •Try reverse directory for phone numbers to get possible addresses and/or new contact"

Pregnancy If a patient becomes pregnant during the trial, the trial medication will be stopped, the patient will be followed up during the trial and until birth or termination of the pregnancy (see further details in Section 5.3.4.2 ). An excessive withdrawal rate can have a severe negative impact on the scientific value of the trial. The In tention To Treat anal ysis requires that all randomised patients be followed until trial end even if the trial medication was temporarily interrupted, discontinued or never started. Every effort should be made to keep the patients in the trial as scheduled. This includes careful patient selection and appropriate explanation of the trial requirements and procedures prior to enrolment as well as an explanation of the consequences of premature withdrawal. Discontinuation of the trialby the Sponsor 3.3.4.2 BIreserves the right to discontinue the trial overall or at a particular trialcentre at an y time for the following reasons: 1.Failure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular trial centre 2.Emergence of an y efficacy /safet y information invali dating the earlier positive benefit - risk-assessment that could significantl y affect the continuation of the trial(see also Section 3.1.1 ). 3.Violation of GCP, the Clinical Trial Protocol (CTP), or the contract disturbing the appropriate conduct of the trial The Investigator / the trialcentre will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of trialtermination (except in case of the third reason)."

Empagl iflozin exerts its effect by promoting glucosuria and consequent hemody namic changes associated with diuresis, improvement in arterial stiffness, blood pressure lowering effect with no increase in HR and reduction in HR xPressure product, an index of my ocardial oxygen consumption. These modes of actions support the scientific rationale of using empagliflozin in patients with HF. In the EMPA -REG -OUTCOME trial both doses were administered to patients with T2DM and showed to be equally effective in reducing CV death, HHF , and composite of HHF or CV death in patients with HF at baseline. In subgroup anal ysis empagliflozin improv ed the main outcome of CV death and HHF with thesimilar magnitude in patients with low orhigh levels of HbA1c at baseline. This indicates the risk reduction for HF outcome is independent of the degree of gl ycaemic control at baseline, suggesting that the sebenefits can be achieved with the 10 mg dose similar to the 25"

Dispensing of kits for the double -blind treatment period will begin at Visit 2 and continue at every visit until end of trial . For further details regarding packaging (e.g. number of tablets per container) please refer to Section 4.1.6. From the start of the treatment period patients will be instructed to take the trialmedication once dail y with a glass of water. Empagliflozin can be taken with or without food. To ensure a dose interval of about 24 hours, the medication should be taken in the morning at approximately the same time every day. If a dose is missed by more than 12 h ours, that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. On days before the next visit, the dose should be taken 22 -26 hours before the planned dose at the visit. No double doses should be taken. Patients should be instructed not to take their medication on the morning of trialvisits as they will be dosed whilst i n the clinic. Visits should be routinely scheduled at approximately the same time of day for each visit.

The randomi sation code will be kept secret by Clinical Trial Support up to database lock. Unblinding and breaking the code 4.1.5.2 Emergency unblinding will be available to the Investigator via the IRT. It must only be used in an emergency situation when the identity of the trial medication must be known to the Investigator in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safet y of trial participants. Whenever possible and if time a llows, the need for unblinding will be discussed with the medical representative from the Sponsor or delegate before the unblinding of trial medication takes place. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or appropriate eCRF page along with the date and the initials of the person who broke the code. The patient could continue with trial medication after unblinding. Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs), it may be necessary for a representative from B I’s Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomi sation code for individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only be given to authorised Pharmacovigilance representatives and not to be shared further . For Japan only : In this blinded trial, an emergency code break will be available to the Investigator / the sub -Investigators via the IRT. This code break may only be accessed in emergency situations when the identity of the trial medication must be known to the Investigator /the sub -Investigators in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or if required to assure the safety of trial participants. Each site receives a manual from the IRT provider that contains instructions on how to unblind the treatmen t of a patient via the IRT (via 24 -hour Emergency helpline). If the code break for a patient is accessed, the Sponsor or delegate must be informed immediately . The reason for accessing the code break, together with the date, must be documented on the appro priate eCRF page. In case third part y needs to break the code, however, when the Investigator cannot be reached, the code can be opened b y calling emergency code manager. 4.1.6 Packaging, labelling and re -supply The investigational products will be provided by BI or a designated CRO.

Restrictions of antidiabetic background therapy are described in Section 4.2.2 . Patients without a diagnosis of DM experiencing repeated or severe s ymptoms such as nervousness, sweating, intense hunger, trembling, weakness and palpitations should contact the Investigator or other healthcare pr ofessional, as these sy mptoms might be suggestive of hypoglycaemia. In the case of h ypoglycaemia ,in patients with or without DM, that may put the patient at risk (e.g. repeated s ymptomatic hy poglycaemia or severe h ypogl ycaemia), appropriate care should be provided at the discretion of the Investigator. Special attention must be paid to the prevention of KA. All patients must be made aware of this risk and need to be instructed to contact the Investigator or other healthcare professional in case of s ymptoms of metabolic acidosis, KAand DKA. Cases of DKA have been reported in patients treated with empagliflozin, including fatal cases. In a number of reported cases, the presentation of the condition was aty pical with only moderatel y increased blood glucose values; below 14 mmol/l (250 mg/dl). The risk of DKA must be considered in the event of non -specific s ymptoms such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual fatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed and treated for KAimmediately according to local guidelines if these sy mptoms occur, regardless of blood glucose level. If KAis suspected, the trial medication should be discontinued, the patient should be evaluated, and promp t treatment should be initiated . Patients who may be at higher risk of KAwhile taking empagliflozin include patients on a very low carbohy drate diet (as the combination may further increase ketone body production), patients with an acute illness, pancreat ic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM ), history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery ), insulin dose reduction (including insulin pump failure), alcohol abuse, severe deh ydration, and patients with a history of KA. Empagliflozin should be used with caution in these patients. In patients requiring insulin, caution should be taken when the dose of insulin is reduced. In clinical situations known to predispose to KA(e.g. prolonged fasting due to acute illness or su rgery ), the Investigator should consider monitoring for KAand temporaril y discontinue the trial medication . There are no trial specific emergency procedures to be followed. 4.2.2 Restrictions The use of anySGLT -2 inhibitors orcombined SGLT-1and 2 inhibitor sexcept the blinded trial medication is prohibited during the course of the trial.This does not include the 30 day s"

WOCBP must use the contraception methods as described in the patient information. 4.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE Patients are requested to bring all remaining trial medication including empty package material with them when attending visits. The Investigator or his/her designate will count the number of the returned tablets and calculate the compliance based on the number of tablets taken , divided by the number of tablets that should have been taken since last visit , multiplied by 100.See formula below. Compliance (%) = Compliance should be between 80% and 120%. Compliance should be emphasised with a goal of at least 80% compliance rate. However, randomi sed patients will not be discontinued for poor compliance without prior discussion with the monitor or designee. Patients who are not compliant with their medication should again be carefully interviewed and again re -informed about the purpose and the conduct of the trial.Number of tablets actually taken since last tablet count x 100 Number of tablets which should have been taken in the same period"

If the required language is not available then the patient is not required to complete the questionnai re. The questionnaire takes about 5 -8 minutes to complete and will be distributed according to the Flow Chart . The Investigator (or designated site -personnel) should ensure that the patient has access to a quiet area at the site where he/she can be left alone to record her/his response in the questionnaire. In instances where a patient cannot give or decide upon a response, no response should be recorded. The Investigator (or designated site -personnel) should check that all items have been completed by the patient, but the response to each item should not be scrutinised. Instructions to patients are included in the questionnaire. The respective procedure for illiterate patients (if included) is described in the Appendix 10.1 . To assess the further endpoint of change from baseline in KCCQ based on patient -preferred outcome a t week 52 , the investigator or designee will be required to ask the patient one additional question about which domain is the most difficult for the patient to cope with. The response to this question will be recorded in the eCRF. 5.2.2 New York Heart Associati on classification The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification will be used to classify the severit y of the patients’ heart failure (ref.

Ketone monitoring in patients with ty pe 1 diabetes (T1DM) only 5.3.4.5 Patients with T1DM will be provided an electronic device to determine their ketone concentration (i.e. a blood glucose monitoring device/meter that is also capable of measuring blood ketones). Patients should be advised to measure their ketones at least one dail y, ideally after fasting for at least 6 hours, throughout the treatment period andfor 5 day s after empagliflozin / placebo treatment has been stopped. Patients should be r eminded to test their ketones in case of an y symptoms of KA, e.g. nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Patients must be reminded about the signs and s ymptoms of KA, on the interpretation of ketone values measured via the meter, and on appropriate action to take in the event of increased ketone levels (see below) . In the same way as during routine clinical care, patients should also be reminded to test for ketones in case of repeatedly elevated blood glucose levels (e.g. >11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL)) which cannot be explained. Patients will be instructed that in the event of increased ketones, they are to either follow the rules given b y their treating ph ysician (e.g. increased fluid intake and/or insulin bolus) or contact their trial site. Blood glucose and ketone levels should be checked every 1-2 hours until they are back in a range considered to be normal. Patients are to be instructed to immediately refer themselves to hospital and/or the Investigator, or to contact an emergency physician in case of a blood ketone concentration > 1.5 mmol/L (as indicated in the meter manual). In case of a suspected KA a blood gas test (pH, bicarbonate) should be performed locally at the earliest opportunity and the patient treated according to local medical judgement .

The scale is widel y used in clinical practice and consists of g rades, from 0 to 6, with 0 corresponding to no s ymptoms and 6 corresponding to dead . Investigators will measure and score the MRS based on an interview with the patient at the next regular on -site visit after the onset of the stroke. I n those cases where MRS assessment occurred within 90 day s after the stroke, a repeat MRS -assessment should be performed at the next on -site visit. For patients who experience a non -fatal stroke less than 90 day s prior to the study closure date, the final MRS assessment will occur at the final study visit for that patient. Detailed information on the stroke (date and time of onset, type, symptoms, method of detection, outcome) will be collected in the eCRF. Hepatic events 5.3.6.2 For assessment of hepatic events please refer to Section 3.1.1. 2. 5.3.7 Assessment of adverse events Definitions of AEs 5.3.7.1 Adverse event An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Adverse reaction An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may arise from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorisation include off - label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors. Serious adverse event"

Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that d o not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse. For Japan only : The following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any other reason” :AEswhich possibly lead to disability will be reported as SAE s. AEs considered “Always Se rious” In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medi cal Events, BIhas set up a list of AEs, which by their nature, can alway s be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as given a bove. The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the ISF. These events should alway s be reported as SAEs as described above. Note: Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be reported as a serious event regardle ss of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the cancer. Adverse events of Special Interest (AESIs) The term AESI relates to any specific AE that has been identified at the substance level as being of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the Sponsor’s /CRO’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE, see Section 5. 3.7.2. The following are considered as AESIs: Hepatic injury A hepatic injury is defined by the following alterations of hepatic la boratory parameters:"

In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results me et the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed . Decreased renal function Decreased renal function is defined by a creatinine value showing a ≥2fold increase from baseline and is above the ULN. For the AESI “decreased renal function” the patient needs to be follow ed-up appropriatel y based on local clinical guidance. The Investigator should refer to follow -up schedule for renal endpoint events described in Sectio n 5.3.4.1 . Ketoacidosis Ifmetabolic acidosis, KAand DKA is suspected ,further investigations should be done according to the medical judgment and the clinical course until a diagnosis is made and/or the patient is recovered. Due to its mechanism of action, empagliflozin may potentiall y modify the clinical presentation of KAwhich may occur at lower plasma glucose levels in patients with DM and potentially also in non -diabetic patient population. The diagnosis of KAin these pa tients can be based on arterial pH ≤7.30, serum bicarbonate levels <15 and measurement of serum beta - hydroxybutrate levels. Other diagnostic criteria which can support the diagnosis of KAare urine ketones and anion gap >10. Investigators should note that not all criteria mentioned above need to appl y for the diagnosis of KA, and clinical judgment should also be taken into consideration. Events leading to l ower limb amputation Any event leading to a lower limb procedure of amputation, auto -amputation or disarticulation as defined below isconsidered as an AESI . “Amputation is a resection of a limb through a bone. Disarticulation is a resection of a limb through a joint. Auto -amputation is a spontaneous separation of non -viable portion of the lower limb."

Each lower limb amputation, disarticulation, or auto -amputation should be reported separately . The SAE report should include the date of the procedure, th e level of amputation or disarticulation, the medical condition(s) leading to the procedure and if the patient had some of the known risk factor(s) for lower limb amputation. Intensity of A Es The intensity of the AE should be judged based on the following: Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities Causal relationship of AEs The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse event. An adverse reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised b y the fact that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected. Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -chall enge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history . Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship could be: •The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug •The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class. •A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure. •Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re -introduced •No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre - existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications). •The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome). •An indic ation of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller effect size if dose is diminished).

The p re-dose blood samples will be collected at visit 4to determine plasma empagliflozin trough concentrations . These samples will serve to determine stead y state trough concentrations of empagliflozin. The date and exact clock time of trialmedication intake the day before this visit will be recorded together with the date and exact clock time of drawing the trough PK sample. 5.4.2 Methods of sample collection The time interval for blood sample collection relative to the most recent intake of trial medication should be between 22 and 26 h. For quantification of empagliflozin trough plasma concentrations, 3 mL of blood will be drawn from a forearm vein in an EDTA -anticoagulant blood drawing tube at each time -point. Details of sample handling and samp le logistics can be found in the ISF (Central lab manual). 5.4.3 Analytical determinations Empagliflozin concentrations in plasma samples will be determined b y a validated HPL C MS/MS assay (high performance liquid chromatography , tandem mass spectrometry ).In order to identify samples from patients taking placebo, the bioanal yst will be un -blinded so that samples from patients receiving placebo will not be anal ysed for empagliflozin. 5.5 ASSESSMENT OF BIOMAR KERS Samples for NT -proBNP will be collected at Visit 1 (Screening) to determine whether the patient is eligible for the trial. Further samples for NT -proBNP will be collected at later time points in the trial(see Flow Chart) to investigate a potential effect of the trial medication. Samples for NT -proBNP will be anal ysed at the Central Laboratory .

EQ-5D is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. Itis designed for self -completion by patients. The EQ -5D self -report questionnaire (EQ -5D) essentially consists of 2 pages comprising: the descriptive s ystem (five dimensions of health; namely mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiet y/depression). Each dimension comprises fivelevels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems , severe problems, extreme problems /unable to perform activity ). the EQ -VAS (visual analogue scale) which records the patient’s self -rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 –100) VAS. For further description o n completi ng the questionnaire refer to the last part of Section 5.2. 1. 5.6.2 Health Care Resource Utili sation (HCRU) HCRU data will be used for health economic analysis (i.e. cost -effectiveness analy sis) required for reimbursement decisions. Resource use will be captured via interview with the patient and entered in the eCRF at all on-site visits during the complete trial period ,and will allow calculation of direct and indirect costs. Main components to be collected are unscheduled outpatient visits and hospitali sations. 5.7 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS All measurements performed during this trial are standard measurements and will be performed in order to monitor safet y aspects, and to determine empagliflozin efficacy and safet y in an appropriate way. The scheduled measurements are appropriate to see drug induced changes in vital signs, standard laboratory values, biomarkers specific to efficacy of treatment of HF, and ECG. The primary and secondary endpoints are accepted for evaluation of efficacy , safet y and tolerability on an oral HF drug and they are widel y used in respective p ivotal phase III studies. Health related quality of life questionnaires are a necessary part for this phase III trial in order to collect data for a health economic evaluation. Therefore, the appropriateness of all measurements applied in this trial is gi ven."

The patient should be fasting (no food or liquid except water the last 10 –16 hours) at Visit2 (Randomis ation), EOT Visit and Follow Up Visit . If a patient mistakenl y takes trial medication on the morning of Visit 4 before attending the clinic or comes in non -fasted where a fasting condition is required (refer to the Flow Chart ), the visit should be rescheduled for another day as soon as possible ,reminding the patients about expected time of dosing. The rescheduled visit must take place in a short enough time - frame so that the patient has sufficient trial medication available. All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart . If any visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date schedule. The trial medication packs contain sufficie nt medication to allow for these time windows. 6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PRO CEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS The Flow Chart summari ses the investigational procedures to be done at each visit, and trial procedures should be performed before i ntake of any trial medication . The procedures are further described below. 6.2.1 Screening No trial procedures should be done unless the patient has consented to taking part in the trial. Preferably the patient should also be informed about biobanking (including DNA) sampling alread y at this visit. Patients who have been diagnosed with T1DM are to be provided with the consent form that contains information relevant for patients with T1DM. Once the patient has consented to the trial participation , she/he is considered to be enrolled in the trial and have started screening. The patient should be re gistered in the enrolment log and be registered in the IRT as a screened patient. Patients will continue to take background medication for heart failure and trea tment for their concomitant disorders if applicable . The screening visit may be conducted over multiple day s, at the discretion of the investigator, as long as all screening procedures are performed and resulted within the allowable visit window in the flow chart . For example, a site may obtain written informed consent followed by collection of samples for the safet y lab analysis and ECG . Remaining procedures may be performed on a separate day , once it is confirmed that the pa tient’s laboratory values, including NTproBNP value, arenot exclusionary . If the patient meets the entry criteria, Visit 2 should occur as soon as possible once it has been confirmed that the patient is eligible to continue. If the patient does not meet t he entry criteria, the site may make a phone contact to inform the patient that he/she is no longer required to return to the clinic for Visit 2 ."

The patients will return to the clinic for regularl y scheduled visits 4, 12, 32 and 52 weeks after randomisation during the first y ear of trial participation, and every 24 weeks thereafter for the duration of the trial, as specified in the Flow chart . These on-site visits will assess the occurrence of safet y and efficacy endpoints, trial medication compliance, concomitant therap y or intervention. Telephone follow -up calls will be scheduled 10-12 weeks after every on-site visit starting after Visit 4 and continuing throughout the trial (see Flow chart ). The telephone contact s will focus on safety (e.g. hospitalisation sor occurrence of AEs), changes in concomitant therap y and trial medication compliance. The patients shou ld be fasting at the Randomisation Visit . Consenting patients with T1DM are to be provided with the ketone monitoring device, the patient diary and Trial information card. The site staff are to provide instruction to the patient on how to properly use the ketone monitoring device and the importance of recording their glucose, ketone and insulin intake throughout the trial. At all subsequent visits, site staff are required to review the patient’s diary with the patient to ensure that the diary is properl y completed. Patients with T1DM should be provided with ketone monitoring supplies as necessary . Theoptional blood sample for DNA will preferably be collected at the Randomisation Visit for all patients eligible for randomisation, but could also be taken at an y later visit after the separate consent is signed . At any time during the treatment period the Investigator is allowed to adjust and optimi se HF background therap y according to loc al and international guidelines. If any additional therap y is considered necessary for the patient’s welfare during the treatment period it may be given at the discretion of the Investigator (see also restrictions in Section 4.2.2 ). For sites selected to participate in collection of samples for PK anal ysis, please refer to Section 5.4 and the Lab Manual for details. Patients will be dispensed medicatio n at each on-site visit and allocation of new kit number (s) will be managed through the IRT. Trial medication administration should be done after physical and laboratory assessments. This is an event driven trial. Patients will remain in the treatment peri od until the necessary number of events is reached."

To ensure the trial population consist of a reasonable combination of non -, pre-and DM patients ,and to aim for approximately 35% to 50% of the population or more with an LVEF >50% capping will be used on triallevel (see also Section 3.3 ). Capping on regional level may be applied to achieve a contribution of each region to each category of diabetes status. The composite primary endpoint is the time to first event of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated HHF . The statistical model for the primary anal ysis is the Cox proportional hazards model. The hazard ratio and its confidence limits will be determined for evaluating the superiority of empagliflozin to placebo for the primary endpoint. The key secondary endpoints, which are part of the testing strategy , are occurrence of adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent) , and eGFR (CKD -EPI)crslope o f change from baseline 7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHES ES A hierarchical testing procedure will be followed for the assessment of the primary and the key secondary endpoint s. For all endpoints, superiority of empagliflozin vs. placebo will be evaluated with a two-sided test inthe following structure: Null hypothesis: There is no difference between the effect of placebo and the effect of empagliflozin in terms of the endpoint in question. Alternative h ypothesis: There is a difference between the effect of placebo and the effect of empagliflozin in terms of the endpoint in question.

The safet y analysis will be based on the treated set (TS ), which consists of all patients treated with at least one dose of the trial medication. For both efficacy and safety anal yses, treatment will be evaluated as randomi sed. For serum creatinine and values based on upon this measurement such as eGFR, baseline will be defined as the mean of all available measurements from the screening visit until start of randomised trial medication. Baseline status of DM is defined as: DM: any pre-treatment HbA1c above 6.5 or history of DM as entered in the eCRF on the medical history page Pre-DM: no history of DM and no HbA1c >=6.5 before treatment and a pre -treatment HbA1c value of >= 5.7 and <6.5 Non-DM: not meeting criteria of DM or pre -DM above For all other endpoints, baseline will be defined as the last avai lable measurement before start of randomised trial medication. 7.3.1 Primary endpoint analys es The primary endpoint will be evaluated on the randomi sed set using a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment ,age (continuous), gender, geographical region ,baseline status of DM (DM, pre-DM, no DM), LVEF (continuous) and eGFR (CKD -EPI) crat baseline (continuous )as covariates . The time to the event of interest will be computed as (event date −randomi sation date) +1. All events observed after randomi sation until completion of the planned treatment phase will be included in the analy sis. Patients who do not have anevent will be censored at the individual end of the planned treatment phase or the last day that the patient was known to be free of the event ,whichev er is earlier. The time to censoring will be computed as (individual endof the planned treatment phase or the last day known to be free of the event – randomi sation date) + 1. For patients who have more than one primary endpoint event during the trial, th e time to the first occurrence of the primary endpoint event will be considered for the primary analy sis. Only theadjudicated and confirmed events will be used for the primary analysis."

Standard subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint include geographical region , sex, BMI, LVEF, renal function, prognostic factors, age, ethnicity , race and different background therapies etc. More details will be specified in the TSAP. A sensitivity anal ysis will be provided based on the TSonly including an y events up to 30 days after treatment discontinuation. 7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses The key secondary endpoints occurrence of adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent) will be modelled using a join tfrailty model together with adjudicated CV death in order to take into accoun t the dependence between the endpoints . The joint frailty model will be adjusted for the same covariates as the primary anal ysis. The joint frailty model therefore models the hazards in the following way : ri(t|ωi, Zi) = ω i exp {β ’1Zi}r0(t) λi (t|ωi,Zi) = ω iαexp {β ’2 Zi}λ0(t) where r i(t) is the hazard of the recurrent HHF for the ith patient, proportional to the baseline intensity function r 0. The hazard function of CV death for the ith patient is λ iproportional to the baseline hazard λ0. β1and β 2are vectors of the regression co efficients of the covariate vectors Ziincluding treatment, age (continuous), gender, history of DM,geographical region , LVEF ( continuous )and eGFR (CKD -EPI) crat baseline ( continuous ). Patient specific independent random effects are denoted b y ω i, with α giving the relation between HHF and CV death. Patient specific independent random effects denoted by  i and are assumed to follow a gamma distribution with mean 1. The resulting likelihood function can be solved assuming piecewise constant hazards . Slope in change from baseline of eGFR (CKD -EPI) crwill be anal ysed by a random coefficient model allowing for random intercept and random slope per patient. The model will include the factors treatment, gender, geographical r egion, and status of DM as fixed effects and eGFR (CKD -EPI)crat baseline (continuous) , LVEF (continuous), age (continuous), time,interaction of treatment b y time and interaction of eGFR (CKD -EPI) cr at baseline (continuous) b y time as linear covariates a nd allow for randomly vary ing slope and intercept between patients.

All on-treatment data up to week 52 will be included. Occurrence of all -cause hospitalisation (first and recurrent) will be evaluated by a similar joint frailty as adjudicated HHF and will be evaluated with a joint model together wi thall- cause mortalit y. The other time -to-event type of secondary endpoints will be analy sed using the same Cox proportional hazards model as the primary anal ysis. This also applies for time to adjudic ated CV death and all -cause mortality , rather than using the joint frailty model described above. 7.3.3 Further endpoint analyses Further time-to-event endpoints will be analy sedin the same Cox proportional hazards model asthe primary anal ysis.

An unmatched win ratio considering adjudicated CV death and adjudicated HHF will be analysed based on unmatched pairs. All patients randomised to empagliflozin will be compared to all patients randomised to placebo. Only common follow -up time will be considered for the comparison. Patients on empagliflozin are considered to have “won” the comparison if either the other patient has died while the patient on empa gliflozin was still alive, or if both patients did not die, the n if the other patient had more occurrences of HHF , or if the number of occurrences of HHF is the same but the time to the first occurrence of HHF is longer . The number of comparisons won is noted as N W. Patients on empagliflozin are considered to have “lo st” the comparison if the empagliflozin patient died while the patient on placebo was still alive, or if both patients did not die, then if the patient on empagliflozin had more occurrences of HHF , or if the number of occurrences of HHF is the same but the time to the first occurrence of HHF is shorter . The number of comparisons lost is noted as N L. The win ratio is NW/NL. The rules for winning and losing follow a modified Rogers 2014 [ R16-4909] approach also considering the ti me to the first HHF event in case of a tie on the number of HHF events. T he analysis of the unmatched win ratio will be conducted as described in Pocock 2012 [R16- 4813 ].

Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. No h ypoth esis testing is planned. Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP of 7 day swill be c onsidered ‘treat ment -emergent’. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment - emergent’. Frequency , severity , and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by system organ class and p referred term after coding according to th e current version of the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). Laboratory data will be analy sed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be highlighted in the listings. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinicall y relevant abnormal values. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate ), phy sical examinations or other safety -relevant data observed at screening, baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end -of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to possible changes compared to findings before s tart of treatment. Reasons for discontinuation and use of post -baseline concomitant medications will be tabulated. The details of the anal ysis will be specified in the TSAP . 7.3.5 Pharmacokinetic analyses Individual concentration -time data with descriptive statistics for empagliflozin trough concentrations will be presented in the Clinical Trial Report (CTR) . 7.3.6 Prespecified meta -analysis On project level, meta -analy ses arepre-specified. Data from this trial and a parallel trial in HFrEF patients, 1245.121 ,will be pooled. The statistical model will include trial as a covariate.

At time of interim analysis, the ExSC, the SEC, Sponsor , CRO , and all trial personnel will stay blinded to the interim results .For blinding please also refer to Section 4.1.5.1 . After approximately 500 primary adjudicated outcome events have been accrued (approxim ately 60% of information isavailable) an interim anal ysis will be performed. The following Hwang, Shih and De Cani α -spending function for the analysis at information fraction t k(planned to be approximately 60%) with parameter γ =-8 will be used:  ∗( ,  )=min   ,  1−      1−    =min  0.025 , 0.0251−     1−    For an interim anal ysis at the timepoint of approximately 60% of information ,the chose n alpha -spending function gives an alpha -level of 0.001 at time of interim. If the p -value for the primary endpoint and the p -value for CV -death ( from the primary Cox proportional hazards model) are lower than the cutoff to be evaluated from the alpha - spending function (planned at 0.001 one-sided ), then the trial will be stopped for overwhelming efficac y. In this case, the hierarch y will be tested as specified in Section 7.2. Otherwise the trial will be continued. The final alpha -level is therefore planned at a one -sided alpha -level of 0. 0248 which translates in a two -sided alpha of 0.0496 . The event rate will be assessed b y the trial team in a blinded manner onl y during trial recruitment and before the unblinded interim analy sis(see Section 7.7 ). 7.5 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA There will be no imputation of data for safet y data or for time -to event endpoints . For patients who discontinue the trial treatment prematurel y, all efforts will be made to follow patients for survival and for any other endpoints including the primary and key secondary endpoints until the end of the trial. For the slope anal ysis of eGFR (CKD -EPI)cr, all available on-treatment change from baseline data will be used .Patients without on-treatment data after randomi sation will not b e included in this analy sis. For the anal ysis of change from baseline to 30 days after treatment stop, only available data will be used. Only patients with post -treatment data will be used in this analysis. For other longitudinal endpoints such as KCCQ scores , MMRM methodology will be used. Models will be run on both all observed data and all observed on-treatment data. Details of the imputation rule will be given in the statistical analy sis plan."

Subjects will be randomised to the trial treatments in a 1:1 ratio. The randomisation will be stratified by the following factors: Geographic alregion (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia , Other ) Status of DM at screening : ono DM (HbA 1c < 5.7 %without the intake of antidiabetic medication , unless taken for a non -DM indication , and no history of DM ), or opre-DM (HbA1c >=5.7 %and <6.5 %without the intake of antidiabetic medication unless taken for a non -DM indication ,and no history of DM), or oDM (HbA1c >= 6.5 %or intake of antidiabetic medication for a DM indication , or a history of DM ) eGFR (CKD -EPI)crat screening o<60 m L/min/ 1.73 m² o≥60 m L/min/ 1.73 m² LVEF oLVEF < 50% oLVEF ≥50% Patients will be randomised in blocks to double -blind treatment via an IRT system. Approximately equal numbers of patients will be randomised to each treatment group. BI will arrange for the randomi sation and the packaging and labelling of trial medication. The randomi sation list will be generated using a val idated sy stem, which involves a pseudo - random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non - predictable. The block size will be documented in the CTR. Access to the codes will be controlled and documented. 7.7 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE For the sample size calculation, a y early event rate in the placebo group of 10% is assumed. The assumption is based on the CHARM -Preserved study and part of the TOPCAT study from the Americas [R07-4374 , R16-1458 ].The annual event rates in CHARM -Preserved were 8.1 % in the c andesartan group and 9.1% in the placebo group. The annual rates from the America s inthe TOPCAT study were 10.4 in the spironolactone group and 12.6 in th e placebo group. The trial is designed to achieve a power of 90% for a two sided test at level α = 0.05."

However, the follow -up period is not fixed but the trial will continue until the necessary number of events ha sbeen observed, which are confirmed b y the adjudica tion committee. The drop -out rate from the trial is assumed to be low (< 1% per y ear) and is therefore not further considered for the determination of sample size.

Including interim anal ysis with Hwang -Shih-deCani alphaspending with gamma= -8 at 60% of information will diminish the power onl y slightly to 89.98%. The event rate and recruitment progress will be assessed in a blinded manner during recruitment before an yinterim unblinding . If the accumulated blinded data suggests a slower accrual of primary outcome event sover calendar time than originall y projected, then the number of randomised patients may be increased to a maximum of 6000 patients. Operationall y, the recruitment period would be extended and could continue up to 6 months before the target number of events is expected to be achieved.

Section to be changed 2.3 Benefit Risk Assessment Description of change The following information was added: In this trial, the effect of empagliflozin will be evaluated in HF patients. DM is known to be a frequent and clinicall y important co -morbidity in HF patients. To evaluate this important co - morbidity , HF patients across the DM spectrum (i.e., T1DM, T2DM, pre-diabetes) as well as HF patients who do not have DM, will be included in this trial. Special safet y considerations are required for patients with T1DM, and several safet y monitoring strategies will be emplo yed, including training of investigators and education of patients on the risk and prevention strategies for ketoacidosis (KA) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Since an SGLT - 2 inhibitor may alter the ty pical presentation of this condition, patients will receive a home monitoring device to measu re blood ketones and a diary for patients to record their blood glucose, ketone values, and insulin intake. Patients with T1DM will also be required to carry a trial information card which includes information about the possible altered presentation of K A to be presented to health care professionals should the patient be seen in an urgent care setting. For further details refer to Section 4.2.1 . As outlined above, inclusion of patients who do n ot have diabetes is also allowed in this trial. I t has been shown that in healthy volunteers dosing with empagliflozin results in gly cosuria summing up to about 2/3 the average glucosuria in patients with T2DM. This is similar to the amount of glucose lost in T2DM subjects with moderate RI. Because in the EMPA REG Outcome study no difference in CV benefit was detected for patients with RI vs the overall population, it is it is hy pothesized that this amount of glucosuria is not the main factor to obtain CV effects with empagliflozin. There are no long -term safet y data for"

Data in non-diabetic subjects is limited to healthy volunteers, without significant co -morbidities or concomitant medications. Exposure in heal thy volunteers is from single dose and multiple dose studies with exposure up to 28 day s. However, while limited, such data does include over 500 healthy volunteers exposed to empagliflozin during the clinical development for treatment of T2DM. No specifi c safet y concern was identified and no occurrences of s ymptomatic hy poglycemia were detected [U12-2707 -01]. It is noted that in patients with T2DM the risk of hy pogly cemia was onl y increased with empagliflozin compared to the placebo group in patients who were concomitantl y treated with insulin or a sulfony lurea. Further, in a mechanistic study [c11963611 -01], subjects without DM were shown to increase endogenous glucose production in response to glucosuria after administration of empagliflozin. As a result, blood glucose levels remained in the normal range for these individuals [P16-01830 ]Therefore, it is scientifically reasonable to hy pothesize that in non - diabetic patients, with no medical indication for insulin or sulfony lurea treatment that the risk of hypoglycemia associated with empagliflozin treatment would be lower than in patients with T2DM. Because the mode of action, blockade of the SGLT2 with cons equent glucosuria, is the same in patients with and without diabetes, although to different degrees, it is considered likel y that the tolerability of empagliflozin may be no less favourable in patients without DM compared to patients with T2DM. There is a lso currentl y limited therapeutic experience with empagliflozin in patients aged 85 years and older. The prevalence of HF increases with age and the therapeutic options in the elderly above 85 years are limited. The inclusion of this population in the cl inical trial setting will help support the assessment of benefit -risk of empagliflozin for patients over 85. Special caution should be used in these patients, who may be at increased risk of adverse consequences attributable to empagliflozin -related volum e depletion."

If a standard mercury sphygmomanomete r is not available, alternative devices recommended b y website www.dableducational.org may be used or devices approved for use b y the appropriate national agency /ies. At visit 1, blood pressure should be taken 3 times in both arms. If the pressures differ by more than 10 mmHg (as in the presence of a subclavian steal syndrome), the arm with the higher pressure (systolic or diastolic) should be used for subsequent measurements. After the patient has rested quietly , in the seated position for five minutes, th ree blood pressure measurements will be taken approximately two minutes apart and all three results must be entered in the eCRF.

Was changed to: Investigators will measure and score the MRS based on an interview with the patient at the next regular on -site visit after the onset of the stroke. In those cases where MRS assessment occurred within 90 day s after the stroke, a repeat MRS - assessment should be performed at the next on -site visit. For patients who experience a non -fatal stroke less than 90 days prio r to the study closure date, the final MRS assessment will occur at the final study visit for that patient.

As severit y of non -fatal stroke is not part of the primary , secondary , or other endpoints of this study the last MRS assessment in these patients will be less than 90 day s after their stroke in order not to delay the end of the trial. 11.3 GLOBAL AMENDMENT 3 Date of amendment 20 Nov 2019 EudraCT number EU number2016 -002278 -11 BI Trial number 1245.110 BI Investigational Product(s) Empagliflozin Title of protocol A phase III randomised, double -blind trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of once daily empagliflozin 10 mg compared to placebo, in patients with chronic Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction ( HFpEF). Global Amendment due to urgent safety reasons Global Amendment Section to be changed 4.2.2 Restrictions Description of change The use of an y SGLT -2 inhibitors or combined SGLT-1 and 2 inhibitors except the blinded trial medication is prohibited during the course of the trial. This also includes the 30 day s period between the EOT and the Follow Up Visit.

Section to be changed 7.3.1 Primary endpoint analy ses Description of change All events observed after randomisation until trial termination will be included in the anal ysis. Patients who do not have an event during the trial period will be censored at the individual day of trial completion or the last day that the patient was known to be free of the event, whichever is earlier. The time to censoring will be computed as (individual day of trial completion or the last day known to be free of the event – randomisation date) + 1. Was changed to: All events observed after randomisation until completion of the planned treatment phase will be included in the analy sis. Patients who do not have an event will be censored at the individual end of the planned treatment phase or the last daythat the pati ent was known to be free of the event, whichever is earlier. The time to censoring will be computed as (individual end of the planned treatment phase or the last day known to be free of the event –randomisation date) + 1. Rationale for change The intention -to-treat analy sis approach was chosen to as closel y as possible reflect real-life conditions, disregarding any occurrences of treatment stop or restart of treatment, that may happen in clinical practice. The study defined treatment discontinuati on in the close -out period is administrative and does not resemble clinical practice . Therefore, its inclusion does not reflect the objective of the primary analysis. Consequently , only events up to the completion of the planned treatment phase will be inc luded in the"
