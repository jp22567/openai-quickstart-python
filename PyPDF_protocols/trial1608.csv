The IMP will consist of tablets and capsules in weekl y child -resistant blister cards, each containi ng sufficient tablets and capsules for 7 (+ 2) day s. When accessed by the site, the interactive voice response s ystem ( IVRS )or interactive web response sy stem ( IWRS )will assign specific blister cards to be dispensed to a subject. During the Titration P eriod (Day s 1 - 4), subjects randomized to the OPC -64005 arm will receive 20 mg OPC -64005 (ie, two10 mg OPC -64005 tablets) and atomoxetine placebo daily, subjects randomized to the a tomoxetine arm will receive 40mg of atomoxetine and OPC -64005 placebo daily , and subjects randomized to the placebo arm will receive both OPC -64005 placebo and atomoxetine placebo daily . During the Treatment Period (Day s 5 - 56), subjects randomized to the OPC -64005 arm will receive 30 mg OPC -64005 and atomoxetine placebo daily,subjects randomized to the a tomoxetine arm will receive 80 mg of atomoxetine and OPC -64005 placebo daily, and subjects randomized to the placebo arm will receive both OPC -64005 placebo and atomoxetine placebo daily. If a subject is not able totolerate the 30 -mg dose of OPC -64005, the dose may be reduced to 20 mg for the duration of the Treatment Period. If a subject is not able to tolerate the 80 -mg dose of a tomoxetine , the dose may be reduced to 40 mg of a tomoxetine for the duration of the Treatme nt Period. Subjects are permitted to have one dose reduction and one titration back up to their previous dose (ie, 30 mg for OPC -64005 and 80 mg for atomoxetine) during the trial . When a subject is titrated down to a lower dose, they should be maintained on that low dose for a minimum of 4 day s before being titrated back up to the higher dose. On scheduled visit day s (Day s7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56), dosing should be held until the subject is in the clinic ; subjects will be dosed from a newl y dispensed b lister card.

Descriptive statistics will be provided for all efficacy and safet y variables in general. Continuous variables will be summarized by tabulations of mean, median, range, and standard deviation (SD). Tabulations of frequency distributions will be provided for categorical variables. Primary: The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to the Day 56Visit onthe investigator -administered CAARS -O:SV 18- item ADHD s ymptoms total score in the OPC -64005 group relative to the a tomoxetine group. Bayesian posterior probability of true ba seline corrected difference at Day 56(± 1 day ) between treatment arms (OPC -64005 and atomoxetine ) being larger than 4 points on the 18- item, investigator -administered CAARS -O:SV given estimates of means and SD in the treatment arms will be calculated. Uninformative prior will be used in calculations. Estimates for means and SD will be derived from mixed- effect model as described below. The change from baseline in the 18- item, investigator -administered CAARS -O:SV will be analy zed using a mixed- effect mo del repeated measures (MMRM) methodology with the unstructured variance covariance matrix. The model will include fixed class- effect terms for treatment, trial site, visit week, an interaction term of treatment by visit week, and baseline 18-item, investi gator -administered CAARS -O:SV as covariate . The need of additional fixed effects and its interactions in the model will be explored. Other continuous efficacy endpoints will also be analy zed using MMRM methodology . Complete model details will be specified in the SAP. Trial Duration: The duration of this trial from first subject enrolled to last subject completed is estimated to be approximately 9months.

20,page_20,"Protocol 277 -201-00001 Confidential -Proprietary Information 20 Version 4.0, 28 Aug 20171 Introduction OPC -64005 is a novel monoamine sy stem modulator that is sy nthesized by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., L td andis being developed for the treatment of attention -deficit/ hyperactivit y disorder (ADHD). 1.1 Nonclinical Data OPC -64005 doses (mg/kg) are indicated as the free base form for all in vivo nonclinical studies. 1.1.1 Efficacy Pharmacology OPC -64005 exhibits inhibitory activities on serotonin (5 -HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) reuptake into rat brain sy naptosomes.1OPC -64005 shows selective affinities for human 5 -HT, NE, and DA transporters (inhibition constant values = 1.62, 6.57, and 123.06 nmol/L , respectivel y).2,3 In addition, OPC -64005 has demonstrated the potential to modulate monoamine sy stems. In vivo microdialy sis demonstrated that extracellular 5 -HT, NE, and DA levels in the rat medial prefrontal cortex were dose dependent and simultaneously increased b y OPC -64005 with greater potency relative to paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, and bupropion.4,5 In addition, OPC -64005, oral ly administered at doses of 0.2 mg/kg and greater, produced statistically significant increases in extracellular 5- HT, NE, and DA (area under the curve as an integrated measurement of percent of basal values during 0 to 360 minutes after administration) to 206.7%, 176.5%, and 164.8%, respectively , compared to the vehicle group. I n the medial prefrontal cortex, where there is a low density of dopamine transporter (DAT), extracellular DA levels are thought to be regulated by norepinephrine transporter (NET).6 The effects of DAT inhibition on the extracellular DA level were therefore evaluated in the striatum, where there is a high densit y of DAT. OPC -64005 significantly increased extracellular DA levels in the rat striatum at 2.5 mg/kg and higher doses .7 OPC -64005 also showed significant antidepressant -like effects in the rat forced swimming test following oral administration once daily for 2 days at 5 and 10 mg/k g8,9 and for 14 day s at 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg.10,11 Furthermore, OPC -64005 demonstrated significant anxioly tic-like effects in the rat elevated plus maze test following single oral administration at 2.5, 5, and 7.5 mg/kg.12 From the results of these nonclinical pharmacology studies, OPC -64005 may have the potential to improve depress ivesymptoms related to monoamine imbalance .

At 30 mg/kg, vocalization and increased bod y ton e were noted only during handling.13 OPC -64005 at a single oral dose of 3 mg/kg showed no effect on the respiratory system in male rats.14 OPC -64005 increased respiratory rate and minute volume at 10 mg/kg and higher and decreased tidal volume at 30 mg/kg. OPC -64005 showed no effect on the cardiovascular s ystem in conscious male monkey s at a single oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg.15 OPC -64005 increased mean blood pressure at 1 mg/kg and higher, increased heart rate , and shortened QT interval at 3 mg/kg and higher. OPC -64005 at 1 µmol/L and higher inhibited human ether-a- go-go related gene current (hERG) wit h a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 3.34 µmol/L .16 In isolated guinea pig right ventricular papillary muscles, OPC -64005 at 1 µmol/L showed no effect on any action potential parameters.17 However, OPC -64005 at 10 µmol/L and 100µmol/L shortened action potential duration at 30% and 60% of repolarization. At 100µmol/L , OPC -64005 shortened the action potential amplitude and action potential duration at 90% repola rization and decreased the maximum upstroke velocity of action potential. I n isolated guinea pig right atrial preparations, OPC -64005 at up to 30 µmol/L showed no effects on heart rate and contraction force.18 However, OPC -64005 at 100µmol/L showed negative chronotropic and inotropic effects and induced sinus arrest in 3of 5preparations within 30 minutes after application. 1.1.3 Nonclinical A bsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion 1.1.3.1 Absorption Following si ngle oral administration of OPC -64005 at 1 mg/kg as the free base form to fed male rats19and at 1 mg/kg to fed male monkey s20maximum (peak) plasma concentration (C max), area under the concentration- time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞), and terminal -phase elimination half -life were respectively 38.26 and 39.23 ng/mL, 283.2 and 972.9 ng·h/mL, and 2.915 and 8.435 hours. Although dose-dependent increases in pl asma C maxand AUC 0-∞were observed in both rats and monkey s at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3mg/kg, the increases in s ystemic exposure were not dose proportional. Orally administered [pheny l-14C (U)] -OPC -277 (14C-OPC -64005) was highl y absorbed in both rats (>91%) and monkey s (>77%) .21,22 The absolute bioavailability of OPC -64005 (free base form) was 49.9% in rats and 57.1% in monkey s.

The concentrations of radioactivity in most tissues peaked at 2 or 4hours postdose and then decreased slowly , which was similar to the plasma concentration. The pattern of distribution was similar between males and females. The tissue -to-plasma partition ratios in males were lower than those in females in man y tissues. In vitro protein binding of 14C-OPC -64005 was 95.59% to 96.79% in human serum, indicating high protein binding of OPC -64005 in human serum.23 In mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and monkey serum, protein binding was 85.35% to 96.92%. 1.1.3.3 Metabolism Following oral administration of OPC- 64005 in rats and monkey s, the metabolites OPC -124789, OPC -124975, OPC -124990, OPC -124996, OPC -144013 (OPC -64005 glucuronide), DM -6401, DM- 6402, and a sulfate of MOP -184703 were identified in the plasma in both species.24 In an investigation of the in vitro metabolism of OPC-64005, OPC -144013, OPC -124975, and DM -6401 were the main metabolites produced using human liver S9 and human hepatocy tes, and OPC -124789, OPC -124990, and OPC -124996 were also observed; no unique human metabolites were obse rved.25 In an in vitro metabolism study of 14C-OPC -64005 using recombinant human cy tochrome P450 (CYP) enzy mes, 14C-OPC -64005 was slightly metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.26 1.1.3.4 Excretion Following single oral administration of 14C-OPC -64005 to rats, the urinary and fecal excretions of radioactivity within 168 hours postdose respectively accounted for 62.11% to 64.98% and 31.23% to 33.62% of the administered dose, and the biliary and urinary excretions of radioactivity within 48 hours postdose respectively accounted for 63.52% to 72.18% and 19.64% to 29.37% of the administered dose.21,27 A high rate of enterohepatic circulation was seen in male rats.

OPC -64005 doses (mg/kg) are indicated as the free base form in all in vivo toxicity studies. 1.1.4.1 Single -dose Toxicity In single -dose oral toxicity studies, the approximate lethal dose was betw een 30 and 100mg/kg in male rats, between 100 and 300 mg/kg in female rats, and between 30 and 100mg/kg in male and female monkey s. In a single- dose oral toxicity study in monkey s, clonic convulsion was observed in 1 female at 100 mg/kg (lethal dose).28,29 1.1.4.2 Repeated -dose Toxicity In a 4 -week repeated- dose oral toxicity study in rats, deaths occurred in females at 30mg/kg/day , and clonic convulsion was observed in fem ales at this dose.30 Tremor, accelerated touch response, increased spontaneous motor activity , decreased body weight or suppressed bod y weight gain, and decreased food consumption were observed in males at 30 mg/kg/day and in females at 10 mg/kg/day and higher. In blood biochemistry , decreased glucose in males and decreased cholesterol and increased phosphorus and γ-and β -globulin in females were observed at 30 mg/kg/day . Creatine phosphokinase and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST )were increased in males and females at 30mg/kg/day . Increased γ -globulin was also observed in females at 10 mg/kg/day . Almost all changes observed during the treatment period showed reversibility . The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was therefore estimated to be 10 mg/kg/day for males and 3 mg/kg/day for females. For OPC -64005 on Day 28, the C maxwas 954 and 415ng/mL and the AUC from time zero to 24 hours (AUC 0-24h) was 16160 and 5120 ng·h/mL in males and females, respe ctivel y. In a 4 -week repeated- dose oral toxicity study in monkey s, since death occurred in 1 male and 2 females on Day s1 to3 at the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day , administration at that dose was discontinued.31 After a withdrawal period (5 days for males and 6 days for females), the highest dose was reduced to 20 mg/kg/day for administration to the surviving 4 males and 3 females for 4 weeks.

L imb t remor (males and females), decreased body weight ,or suppressed body weight gain in females were observed at 10 mg/kg/day . The NOAEL was therefore estimated to be 3 mg/kg/day for both males and females.

In the females, increased reticulocy tes, total cholesterol, phospholipids, total protein, calcium, phosphorus, β- globulin, and γ -globulin, decreased water consumption and urin e volume, and increased urine osmolarity were observed at 10mg/kg/day . In histopathology , hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocy tes with increased smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the liver and apoptosis of acinar cells in the pancreas were observed in mal es at 10 mg/kg/day and higher. In addition, fatty change of the hepatocy tes with increased lipid droplets in the mid zone of the lobules in the liver and ventral -lobe-specific atrophy of the prostate at 10 mg/kg/day and higher and focal accumulation of fo amy cells in the lung and bronchus at 30 mg/kg/day were observed in males, and none of these changes were observed in the 4- week repeated -dose oral toxicity study . All changes observed during the treatment period showed reversibility after withdrawal of a dministration.

This subject was suspected to have underly ing sinus node dy sfunction. The MTD was not det ermined in this trial for the following reasons: this cohort did not meet the definition of MTD as defined in the protocol; supraventricular tach ycardia observed in this subject was difficult to assess; and the investigator and subinvestigator did not change the assessment of ‘nonserious’ for supraventricular tachy cardia even after the Sponsor had assessed the event as ‘serious’ .

Subjects were administered daily 10, 20, or 30- mg doses of OPC -64005 (n= 6 per dose cohort) or placebo (n = 2 per dose cohort) for 14 day s in Part 1 of the trial. In Part 2, subjects were administered a dail y 30-mg dose of OPC -64005 (n = 10), placebo (n = 4) or bupropion (n = 8) for 14 day s. In Part 1, 33 TEAEs were reported for 16 of 24 subjects (66.7%) and the most frequentl y reported TEAE was constipation. I n Part 2, 77 TEAEs were reported for 21 of 22subjects (95.5%) and the most frequentl y reported TEAE was headache.

Stead y state for OPC -64005 was reached after 10 to 12 day s of dosing. Assay s to detect the presence of neurotransmitter metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggested that the 30 mg dose of OPC -64005 had a significant impact on reuptake inhibition for NE and 5- HT. However, there was no clear evidence of DA related metabolites in CSF in either OPC -64005 samples or in those collected from subjects who received bupropion (positive control). 1.2.4 Phase 1, Multiple A scending Dose Trial in Healthy Adult Male Subjects (Japan, Trial 277 -12-001) This phase 1 trial was a single -center, placebo -controlled, randomized, double -blind, multiple ascending oral dose tr ial of OPC -64005 in healthy Japanese adult male subjects (Trial 277-12- 001). The trial was planned for 3 dose-cohorts (20 mg for Cohort 1, 40 mg for Cohort 2, and 60 mg for Cohort 3). Each cohort consisted of 8 subjects, 6 subjects randomized to receive OPC -64005 and 2 subjects to receive placebo. Subjects were administered OPC -64005 for 14 day s. Subsequently the 40 mg dose in Cohort 2 was decreased to 30 mg due to the mean C max on Day 14 following the repeated- dose administration of 20 mg OPC -64005 in Cohort 1 being higher than expected (178 ng/mL).

After the completion of Cohort 2 (30 mg), the decision was made not to proceed with Cohort 3 (60 mg) because sufficient data for PK and safet y were obtained from Cohorts 1 and 2. The mean C maxfor the 30 mg group following 14 days of multiple administrations was 292 ng/mL. Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 1 subject (1/6) in the 20 mg OPC -64005 group and 3 subjects (3/6) in the 30 mg OPC -64005 group. All of the TEAEs reported in the OPC -64005 groups were considered potentiall y drug -related. NoTEAEs were reported in the placebo group. The TEAEs observed during the trial were nausea, somnolence, and pruritic rash and all were reported in the OPC -64005 group: pruritic rash, 1 subject (1/6) in the 20 mg OPC -64005 group: nausea, 2 subjects (2/6) in the 30 mg OPC -64005 group: somnolence, 1 subject (1/6) in the 30 mg OPC -64005 group. Of the 4 TEAEs reported in this trial, 1 was moderate and 3 were mild in severity . The onl y TEAE leading to discontinuation of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) occurred while on a dose of 20 mg and was the rash pruritic which was moderate in severit y and potentially drug-related. Based on the resul ts of this trial, multiple administration of 20 mg and 30 mg of OPC -64005 once dail y for 14 days was well tolerated and no significant safety concerns were observed in healthy Japanese adult male subjects. 1.2.5 Phase 1 Trial to Evaluate Serotonin, Norepinephrin e, and Dopamine Transporter Occupancy in Healthy Adult Male Subjects (United States, 277 -10-205) This phase 1 open -label trial was designed to evaluate serotonin transporter (SERT), NET, and DAT occupancy in human brain after oral administration of OPC -64005 in healthy male subjects. Eighteen subjects were enrolled into the trial, 17 subjects were administered I MP, and 15 subjects completed the trial. OPC -64005 was administered to each subject once or twice at a dose of 8, 20, or 60 mg. Each subject was to undergo 1 baseline PET scan prior to dosing and 2 PET scans after each subsequent dose of OPC- 64005.

Receptor occupancy increased with increasing OPC -64005 plasma concentration for SERT and NET, while no clear trend was visible for DAT. The estimate d overall E max for SERT occupancy ranged from 73.3% to 84.8% and the overall EC 50ranged from 5.5to 8.84 ng/mL . The estimated overall E maxfor NET occupancy was 117% and the EC50was 18.8 ng/mL . At 24 hours postdose, % receptor occupancy for SERT and NE T receptors were greater than 74% and 71%, respectively . At the 60 mg OPC -64005 dose, DAT receptor occupancy ranged from 1% to 16% at plasma concentrations of 18.1 to 205ng/mL. Twelve of 17 subjects (70.6%) had 43 TEAEs across all doses of OPC -64005, with most TEAEs reported after dosing with 60- mg of OPC -64005. The most frequently occurring TEAEs (reported b y more than 2 subjects overall) were nausea (8 subjects), dizziness (4subjects), and headache (3 subjects). All of these TEAEs were considered by the investigator to be potentially related to the IMP except for one incidence of headache. 1.2.6 Phase 1 Trial to Evaluate Dopamine Transporter Occupancy in Healthy Adult Male Subjects (Japan, Trial 277 -13-001) This phase 1 open -label, single -dose,positron emission tomograph y (PET) trial was designed to evaluate DAT occupancy in the human brain following oral administration of OPC -64005 in 6 healthy adult male subjects. An established DAT ligand, 18F-FE-PE2I, was used in this trial. Six subjects were div ided into 2groups of 3 subjects each, receiving either a single oral dose of 30 mg or 60 mg of OPC -64005. The PET scans were performed 3 times (predose, 2 hours postdose, and 24 hours postdose) for each subject. During the trial, 5 of the 6 subjects had 1 4 TEAEs reported. In the 30 mg group, all 3 subjects had 6 TEAEs while in the 60 mg group 2 subjects had 8 TEAEs.

Eight subjects were enrolled and were administered the I MP. Five of these subjects completed the trial. A 30 -mg dose of OPC -64005 was administered once dail y for 14 days. Sixty -minute PET scans were performed 3 ti mes for each of the 5 subjects (predose, at 2 hours postdose on Day 14, and at 24 hours postdose after the last OPC- 64005 administration on Day 14). The DAT ligand, 18F-FE-PE2I, was administered intravenousl y before each PET scan. Two of the 8 enrolled subjects experienced the TEAE of mild rash, which was considered related to the IMP. These subjects were discontinued due to the TEAE. No other TEAEs were reported, and there were no safety concerns in this trial. The mean DAT occupancy was 27.8% at 2 hours postdose and 24.4% at 24 hours postdose (OPC -64005 plasma concentration range was 138 - 257 ng/mL and 60.8 - 127 ng/mL, respectively ).

Known risks associated with the administration of atomoxetine are as described in the prescribing information (http://www.strattera.com). The dose of atomoxetine to be administered in this trial (40 mg up -titrated to 80 mg) is in accordance with this prescribing information. 2 Trial Rationale and Object ives 2.1 Trial Rationale Dopamine h ypoactivit y has been implicated in attention -deficit/hy peractivity disorder (ADHD), as evidenced by stimulant -mediated improvement of inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behavior in the majority of presenting and treated ch ildren, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with ADHD.42,43,44,45,46 In addition to DAT inhibition, norepinephrine transport inhibition is also a pharmaceutical target for effective treatment of ADHD s ymptomatology . Since NET inhibitors can also inhibit DA transport in the prefront al cortex, NET inhibition leads to enhanced dopaminergic signaling thatmay, in part, underlie the clinical utility of NET inhibitors in ADHD. Data from single -and multiple -dose positron emission tomograph y studies confirm the in vitro neuropharmacology and microdial ysis-based characterization of OPC -64005 as a triple -reuptake -inhibitor with a unique balance of monaminergic transporter inhibition for 5-HT, NE, and DA (data on file). Based on this pharmacology , including potent NET inhibition and modest DAT inhibition at the proposed clinical doses, it is a reasonable hypothesis that OPC -64005 will be effective for the treatment of the core s ymptoms (inattention, impulsivity , and hy peractivity )of ADHD. In addition, OPC -64005 inhibition of SERT is compar able to that of marketed antidepressants, at clinical doses. Since there is high comorbidity of mood sy mptoms in the general ADHD population, SERT inhibition may yield clinical benefit in non -core s ymptoms of ADHD as well. 2.2 Dosing Rationale Dose selection for this trial is based on safety , tolerability , and PK data from single and multiple -dose PK studies. I n addition, pharmacodynamic outcomes from 3 separate PET studies were used as guidance to support dose selection. I n particular, we targeted a high dose with approximately 90% NET occupancy to address s ymptoms of inattention; and we targeted approximately 25 to 30% DAT occupancy in efforts to provide greater Until the information herein is released by Otsuka to the publ ic domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 277-201-00001 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments 32"

OPC -64005 has been administered to healthy subjects at daily oral doses ranging from 1to 60 mg and at treatment durations ranging from single dose to 14 dail y doses. In Trial 277-10- 206 (conducted in t he United States [US]), mean peak concentration (Cmax) values on Day 14 after multiple daily doses of 20 or 30 mg of OPC -64005 were 195 ng/mL and 274 ng/mL, respectivel y. Stead y state of OPC -64005 was reached after 10 to 12 day s of dosing in this trial. In Trial 277 -12-001 (conducted in Japan), C max values after once daily dosing for 14 day s were 178 ng/mL and 292 ng/mL at OPC -64005 doses of 20 and 30 mg, respectivel y. Stead y state was reached b y Day 7 in both the 20-mg and 30 -mg groups in this trial. In Trial 277 -10-205 the overall concentration of plasma to obtain 50% of the maximum effect in vivo (EC 50) for SERT occupancy ranged from 5.5 to 8.84 ng/mL, and the EC 50 for NET occupancy was 18.8 ng/mL. Dopamine transporter occupancy was rel ativel y low (< 2 0%) in 2 single -dose-trials (277-10- 205 and 277-13-001) at plasma concentration ranges of 18.1 to 205 ng/mL and 4.68 to 154 ng/mL, respectivel y. In a multiple -dose trial (277-14-001), mean DAT occupancy was 27.8 % at 2 hours postdose (plasma concentration range 138 - 257 ng/mL) and 24.4% at 24 hours postdose (plasma concentration range 60.8 - 127 ng/mL) after repeated ad ministration of OPC -64005 at 30mg once dail y for 14 days. DosesofOPC -64005 up to 30 mg were used in Trial 277 -10-206. In Trial 277-12-001, administration of 20 and 30 mg of OPC -64005 once dail y for 14 days was well tolerated, and no significant safety concerns were observed in healthy Japanese adult male subjects. Considering the pharmacody namics ,pharmacokinetics ,and safety resu lts obtained from completed multiple -dose trials, a daily dose of 30 mg was selected as the target dose for administration in the current trial. The dosage of a tomoxetine (40 mg daily starting dose to a target dose of 80 mg dail y) is the dose and regimen r ecommended in the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved prescribing information. Extrapolation from the available animal PET data47 suggests that a dose of atomoxetine in the clinically relevant range corresponding to 1.0to 1.8 mg/kg would result in > 90% NET occupancy , which is comparable with the observed NET receptor occupancy observed with OPC -64005 at 30 mg at steady state (study on file) .

As is frequently done in adult ADHD trials, items will be modified using the Adler adult prompts and only the 18 DSM -5 criteria relevant items (9 Inattentive and 9 Hyperactive/Impulsive) will be administered. The primary efficacy assessment of ADHD symptoms is the ADHD Sy mptom s Total Score, which consists of the combined score for the Inattentive Sy mptoms and Hyperactive/Impulsive Sy mptoms subscales. The 18-item scale can be administered by an appropriatel y trained and qualified clinician in approximately 20 to 30 minutes. 3.7.2.2 Conners’ A dult ADHD Rating Scale -Self-Report: Screening Version ( CAARS -S:SV) The CAARS -S:SV (Appendix 5) includes the same 30 items as the investigator -administered CAARS -O:SV, worded in the first person for the subject’s impressions of their own ADHD behaviors (eg, “I talk too much,” “I am alway s on the go...”).53 As with the investigator -administered CAARS -O:SV, administration of the CAARS -S:SV in the current trial will be limited to the 18 DSM -5 criteria relevant items (9 Inattentive S ymptoms and 9 Hy peractive/Impulsive Sy mptoms subscales). The evaluation of ADHD symptoms will be based on the 18 -item ADHD S ymptoms Total Score , which consists of the combined score for the Inattentive S ymptoms and Hyperactive/Impulsive Sy mptoms subscales . The CAARS -S:SV can be completed in approximately 10 minutes. 3.7.2.3 Adult ADHD Investigator Sy mptom Rating Scale ( AISRS With Adult Prompts ) The AISRS ( Appendix 6) was published in 2010 by Drs. Lenard Adler, Thomas Spencer, and Joseph Biederman of New York Universit y and Massachusetts General Hospital.54 The AISRS consists of the 18 DSM ADHD s ymptoms with adult -relevant wording.

Suggested anchor guidance is provided in Appendix 7.56 3.7.2.5 Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale (CGI-I) The CGI -I is an observer -rated scale that will be used to measure the efficacy of the IMP.55 The rater or investigator will rate whether the subject’s total improvement relative to baseline is due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices include: 1 =very much improved, 2 =much improved, 3 =minimally improved, 4 =no change, 5 =minimally worse, 6 =much worse, and 7 =very much worse.

Scores for individual items range from 1 (“never/not at all”) to 5 (“extremely /very often”). Before total and subscale scores can be calculated, scores for individual questions that are worded negatively are reversed so that a higher score indicates a greater quality of life. Scores for each item are then converted to a 100 -point scale and averages are calculated to obtain total score and subscale scores. 3.7.2.7 Profile of Mood States- Brief Form (POMS ) The POMS ( Appendix 10) is a 30- item self -report scale that generates the following subscales: Tension or Anxiety , Anger - Hostility , Vigor -Activity , Fatigue -Inertia, Depression - Dejection, and Confusion -Bewilderment.58 These subscales yield an overall total mood score.

Subjects expressing an y sort of suicidality or who are otherwise thought to be at an y risk of self -harm at any time during the course of the trial or follow -up, should be referred for appropriate evaluation and care according to applicable local standards, according to the best judgment of the principal investigator and in keeping with GCP. The C -SSRS was developed by a team of researchers at Columbia University to address the need for standardized classification of suicide reports to assess suicide risk. This scale consists of a b aseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicide events and suicidal ideation, and a post baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last trial visit.

Withdrawal of consent is a critical trial event and therefore should be approached with the same degree of importance and care as is used in initially obtaining inf ormed consent. The reasons for a subject’s intended withdrawal need to be completely understood, documented, and managed to protect the rights of the subject and the integrity of the trial. A subject may initially express their desire to discontinue I MP administration, which is not equivalent to a complete withdrawal of consent for further participation (see Section 3.8.3.2). A subject may , however , indicate that further trial participation is creating a burden on their work or social schedule. Therefore, the investigator should follow the procedures outlined in Section 3.8.3.3 to determine if the subject can continue participation in the trial if modifications to his/her treatment and/or schedule of assessments can be accommodated. If a subject will miss/misses a trial visit, the investigator should contact the medical monitor to discuss the potential to retain the subject.

Subjects who sign an eICF but who are not started on treatment are permitted to be rescreened, with the exception of subj ects who tested positive for drugs of abuse. In the event that the subject is rescreened for trial participation, and the rescreening is not completed within the original screening window, a new eICF must be signed. Subjects who are randomized but not tr eated are considered withdrawals. 3.10 Definition of Completed Subjects The treatment period is defined as the time period during which subjects are evaluated for primary and/or secondary objectives of the trial irrespective of whether or not the subject actual ly consumed all doses of the IMP. Subjects who are evaluated at the last scheduled visit during the treatment period will be defined as trial completers. For purposes of this trial, subjects who complete the Day 56(± 1 day ) Visit will be defined as tria l completers. 3.11 Definition of Subjects Lost to Follow -up Subjects who cannot be contacted on or before the follow-up visit during the treatment period, who do not have a known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrew consent or AE), and for whom a survival status at the end of the trial cannot be determined will be classified as “lost to follow -up” as the reason for discontinuation. Survival status can be determined from a variety of sources, either b y obtaining acceptable documentation for death (ie, death certificate, medical records, public records, statement by a family member or primary care phy sician) or acceptable documentation for life (ie, direct contact with the subject, medical records, successful telephone contact with the subject, statement by a famil y member or primary care physician, or public records).

Accountability and compliance verification should be documented in the subject’s trial records. Subjects must be counseled on the importance of taking the IMP as directed at all trial visits. If poor compliance continues (eg, multiple missed doses result ing in less than 80% overall compliance), discontinuation of the subject from the trial should be considered. Details on the AiCure technology to be used in this trial to assess I MP compliance are provided below. 3.12.1 IMP A dherence and Reminder Sy stem This tria l will employ an IMP adherence monitoring platform (“ AiCure Platform”) for all subjects in the trial. The AiCure Platform uses artificial intelligence on smartphones to confirm IMP ingestion. In addition, built- in reminders and a communication sy stem allow real -time intervention in case of IMP interruptions. Use of th isAiCure Platform will in no way supersede or replace the physician and/or prescribed IMP protocol of the subjects. Because the AiCure Platform does not change the IMPprotocol of the subj ects, but rather encourages adherence to the predefined protocol, use of th isAiCure Platform presents minimal risk to the subjects. Use of the AiCure Platform will be required for all subjects in the trial. The monitoring AiCure Platform requires that al l subjects take each dose of the IMP while using a smartphone. The AiCure Platform will be provided to subjects preloaded on a smartphone, or subjects will download the AiCure Platform onto their own mobile device at baseline (Day 1). When at home, subje cts will receive a n IMP reminder at a time within a predefined window. This notification reminds subjects to take their IMP dose while using the AiCure Platform. Subjects will follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front -facing webcam to vis ually confirm their ingestion of the IMP.The application on the smartphone will make an automated determination of whether the subject has properl y taken their IMP at the prescribed time. There is no need for the trial site staff to Until the information herein is released by Otsuka to the publ ic domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 277-201-00001 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments 64"

The amount of guidance that the device provides to the subjects is automatically reduced as the subject becomes more proficient at using the application. After the device confirms proper IMP ingestion, video recordings will be encry pted and transmitted to a secure centralized location for further anal ysis, including testing for duplicate enrollment. The captured data and video arereviewable through a roles and rules restricted s ystem ensuring privacy of the information. The sy stem is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which protects the privacy and securit y of healthcare information. Phone numbers of the subjects may also be collected and stored in an encry pted manner. Storing the phone numbers will allow for direct communication with subjects, including automated messaging from the AiCure Platform device and contact b y the trial site staff or other monitoring personnel. At no time is the phone number visible to the trial site staff or monitoring personnel on the AiCure Platform . Individuals outside the trial sites will not be provided with subject names, nor will they be given access to subject medical records. 3.12.2 Subject Risk The AiCure Platform provides no more than minimal risk to subjects. This protocol only introduces a smartphone- based monitoring application that prompts the user to take their IMP, verifies ingestion, and stores e ncrypted data securel y for analysis. When functioning properl y, use of the AiCure Platform does not affect titration, dosage, route of administration, or treatment duration , conforming to an y trialrequirements as noted by trial site staff. It is possibl e, though very unlikel y, that the AiCure application can fail to remind subjects to take the IMP or tell them to take their IMP when not required. To date, AiCure has not encountered such a malfunction. All trial data, including any identifiable subject information, will be obtained and encry pted b y the application. Subjects will be coded according to the protocol and their identity will not be stored with the trial data obtained. After the subject has taken the IMP and confirmation of proper ingestion has been completed, the encry pted data will be automatically forwarded to a secure server. The server is compliant with the HIPAA, which protects the privacy and security of healthcare information. The data will be securel y stored and onl y accessible to the trial site staff and other authorized personnel through two -way authentication.

Individuals who are not associated with the care and treatment of subject s will not have access to subject identity or any medical records. 3.12.3 Subject Confidentiality The AiCure Platform Provider will protect subjects’ personal information to the full extent required by law. However, information from this trial, including de-identified video recording(s) of subject performance of various actions, may be submitted to the trial site, and potentially to the FDA. Both information obtained by the application, and information in the subject Informed Consent, may be examined by the trial site or the trial site’s representatives, and may also be reviewed by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, IRBs, and or Ethics Committee(s). All of these parties are bound to safeguard the rights, safet y, and well -being of all clinical trial su bjects, and to maintain all information in confidence, with special consideration given to trials that may include vulnerable subjects. The results of this trialmay be presented at meetings or in publications; however, specific subjects will not be identi fied by name in these presentations and/or publications. Information from this trial may also be retained by the AiCure Platform Provider for the purpose of improving the AiCure Platform, to allow for future anal ysis of various facial and other parameters , the reporting of high level statistical anal ysis of the AiCure Platform, to improve the internal workings of the system running on the smartphone device, or for regulatory filings by the AiCure Platform Provider to support future applications for the Pro vider’s product. 3.13 Protocol Deviations In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or mistake (eg, violation of informed consent process, I MP dispensing or subject dosing error, treatment assignment error, subject enrolled in violation of eligibility criteria or concomitant medication criteria), the investigator or designee will contact the sponsor at the earliest possible time by telephone.

70,page_70,"Protocol 277 -201-00001 Confidential -Proprietary Information 70 Version 4.0, 28 Aug 2017A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the IMP caused the AE. For the purpose of Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting, “reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certaint y about causality. An SAE includes an y event that results in any of the following outcomes: Death Life-threatening; ie, the subject was, in the o pinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. Persistent or significant incapacity /disability or substantial disrupt ion of the ability to conduct normal life functions. Requires in- patient hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization. Hospitalization itself should not be reported as an SAE; whenever possible the reason for the hospitalization should be reported. Hospital izations or prolonged hospitalizations for social admissions (ie, those required for reasons of convenience or other non -medical need) are not considered SAEs. Congenital anomal y/birth defect. Other medicall y significant events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above; eg, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Nonserious adverse events are all AEs that do not meet the criteria for a ""serious"" AE. Immediately Reportable Event (IRE): Any SAE. Any AE related to occupational exposure. Potential serious hepatotoxicity case (see Section 5.5). Rash (regardless of severity or seriousnes s) (see Section 5.4). Pregnancies are also defined as IREs. Although normal pregnancy is not an AE, it will mandate IMP discontinuation and must be reported on an IRE form to the sponsor. Pregnancy will only be documented on the AE eSource if there is an abnormality or complication.

71,page_71,"Protocol 277 -201-00001 Confidential -Proprietary Information 71 Version 4.0, 28 Aug 2017Clinical L aboratory Test Value Changes : It is the investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they become available. This review will be documented b y the investigator’s dated signature on the laboratory report. For each abnormal laboratory test result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal (ie, clinicall y significant) change from baseline for that individual subject. This determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal value is observed. The investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory tests. I f this laboratory value is considered medicall y relevant b y the investigator (subject is symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment or further evaluation), or if the laboratory value leads to discontinuation, and/or fulfills a seriousness criterion, this is considered a n AE. Severity : Adverse events will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported as indicated on the e Source . The intensity of an adverse experience is defined as follows: 1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity . 2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activit y. 3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity . IMP Causalit y: Assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the use of the IMP is defined as follows: Related : There is a r easonable possibility of a temporal and causal relationship between the IMP and the AE. Not Related : There is no temporal or causal relationship between the I MP and the AE. 5.2 Eliciting and Reporting A dverse Events The investigator will periodically assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs. To avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the non- leading question: “How have you felt since your last visit?” All AEs (serious and nonserious) reported b y the subject must be recorded on the source docu ments and e Source provided b y the sponsor. Collection of all AEs is to begin after a subject has signed the eICF. Use medical terminology in AE reporting. Adverse events should be reported as a single unify ing diagnosis whenever possible or, in the abs ence of a unify ing diagnosis, as individual signs or sy mptoms.

If a subject is suspected to be pregnant before she receives IM P, the IMP administration must be withheld until the results of serum pregnancy tests are available. If the pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive the IMP and must not be enrolled in the trial. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is taking IMP, the IMP must be withheld immediately (if reasonable, taking into consideration any potential withdrawal risks) until the result of the pregnancy test is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the IMP will be permanentl y discontinued in an appropri ate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for subject safety ) and the subject will be withdrawn from the trial. The investigator must immediately notify the sponsor of any pregnancy associated with IMP exposure during the trial and for 30 day s after the last dose of IMP, and record the event on the IRE form and forward it to the sponsor. The sponsor will forward Pregnancy Surveillance Form(s) for monitoring the outcome of the pregnancy . Protocol -required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow- up must be performed on the subject unless contraindicated b y pregnancy (eg, x -ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered, if indicated. In addition, the investigator must report to the sponsor, on appropriate Pre gnancy Surveillance Form(s), follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants will be followed for a minimum of 6 months from the date of birth. 5.7 Procedure for Breaking the Blind The investig ator is encouraged to contact the sponsor/CRO medical advisor to discuss their rationale for unblinding. However, to prevent delays to the investigator or medical personnel responding to a potentially emergent situation, unblinding of IMP will not be depe ndent upon the investigator receiving approval from the sponsor/CRO medical advisor (ie, the investigator will be able to obtain the code break information independent of the sponsor/CRO medical advisor). The investigator must contact the sponsor/CRO medi cal advisor b y telephone or e -mail with an explanation of the need for opening the treatment assignment code within 24 hours of opening the code. If the blind is broken, the Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department must be notified immediately (see the cover page of this protocol for contact information).

All nonserious events (that are not I REs) that are ongoing at the last scheduled contact will be recorded as ongoing on the e Source . For any AE having been identified throughout the trial, during anal ysis, additional relevant medical history information may be requested b y the sponsor to further ascertain causality (including, but not limited to, information such as risk -related behavior, family history and occupation). 5.8.2 Follow -up of Serious A dverse Events and Immediately Reportable Events This trial requires that subjects be activel y monitored for SAEs up to 30 (+ 2) day s after the last dose of IMP is administered. Serious AEs and nonserious I REs that are identified or ongoing at the last scheduled contact must be recorded on the AE eSource page . If updated information (eg, resolved status) on SAE or I RE status becomes available after a subject’s last scheduled contact (up to last in-clinic visit for the entire trial), this must be reported to the sponsor and recorded on the AE CRF page, according to the appropriate reporting procedures. Every effort will be made to obtain a PK blood sample from any subject who experiences an SAE. This sample should be obtained as soon as is practical after the onset of the SAE. The investigator will follow SAEs until the events are resolved, stabilized, or the subject is lost to follow -upor has died.

No formal statistical comparisons are planned. A separate population or pharmacokinetic/pharmacod ynamic modeling may be performed using the data from this trial and other trials. 7 Statistical A nalysis 7.1 Sample Size This trial is exploratory in nature, focusing on estimation of treatment effect and its variability as well as collecting data for future decision making and as a result, sample size was chosen from practical considerations. The trial will enroll approximately 201subjects in expectation to have about 150 completers at the end of the trial. I t is evaluated via simulations that this sample size wil l be sufficient for making robust further development decision based on data from OPC -64005 and a tomoxetine arms using concept of posterior probability . 7.2 Datasets for A nalysis The following anal ysis samples are defined for this trial: Enrolled Sample: Comprises all subjects who sign an e ICF for the trial. Randomized Sample: All subjects randomized into this trial. Safety Sample: Comprises randomized subjects who received at least one dose of double -blind IMPas indicated on the dosin g record. Modified Intent -to-Treat Sample: All subjects in the Randomized Sample who took at least one dose of IMP and have a baseline and at least one post randomization evaluation for the investigator -administered CAARS -O:SV ADHD S ymptoms Total Score (18-items).

The 18 -item ADHD S ymptoms Total Score (sum of the Inattentive Sy mptoms Subscale and the Hy peractive/Impulsive Sy mptoms Subscale) is considered to be the primary efficacy measure. Each item is rated on a 0 to 3 scale with 0 = Not at all, never; 1 = Just a little, once a while; 2 = Pretty much, often; and 3 = Very much, very frequently . Therefore, possible ADHD S ymptoms Total Scores range from 0 to 54. If more than 1 item is missing in a subscale, the subscale ( and the total) is considered as missing. For a single missing item, the mean score will be used to impute the missing item and then to co mpute the subscale or total scores. In general, for primary analy sis of efficacy endpoints, missing data will be handled b y analysis of mixed -effect model repeated measures (MMRM ) methodology based on observed case (OC) data from protocol -specified visits under the assumption of missing at random. The OC dataset consists of actual observations recorded at each visit and no missing data will be imputed . 7.4 Endpoint A nalyses 7.4.1 Primary Endpoint Analysis The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change from baselin e to the Day 56Visit on the 18- item, investigator -administered CAARS -O:SV score in the OPC -64005 group compared with the atomoxetine group. Anal ysis will be performed using modified intent -to-treat data set. Bayesian posterior probability of true baseline corrected difference at Week 8 between treatment arms (OPC- 64005 and a tomoxetine ) being larger than 4 points on the 18- item, investigator -administered CAARS -O:SV given estimates of means and standard deviatio ns (SD) in the treatment arms will be calculated. Estimates for means and SD will be derived from mixed-effect model as described below. Uninformative prior will be used in calculations. The change from baseline in the 18- item, investigator -administered CAARS -O:SV will be anal yzed using an MMRM methodology with the unstructured variance covariance matrix. The model will include fixed class-effect terms for treatment, trial site, visit week an interaction term of treatment b y visit week, and baseline 18-item, investigator -administered CAARS -O:SV as a covariate . The need of additional fixed effects and its interactions in the model will be explored.

Additionally , the POMS 2 -A contained an adolescent scale, which is not relevant to this trial. The text regarding rash was modified to be consistent with the informed consent form and to add clarit y around the process of rash review . Inclusion criterion #4 was modified to replace the CAADID with the ACDS v1.2 and was revised for clarity . Inclusion criteri on #5 w asmodified to replace the ADHD RS- 5 with the AISRS and to clarify the ADHD treatment . Inclusion criterion #7 was revised for clarification only . Inclusion criterion #8 was modified to replace the ADHD RS -5 with the AISRS. Exclusion criterion #3 was modified to add that subjects with suboptimal tolerability to atomoxetine are also excluded and to remove “after 18 y ears of age”. Exclusion criterion #6 was modified to remove intolerability (lifetime treatment history ) to stimulant or nonstimulant ADHD medications. Exclusion criteria #8 wasmodified to remove Axis I /II terminology and specify that current or lifetime bipolar disorder is excluded . Exclusion criterion #9 was modified to add additional DSM-5 diagnoses for clarification to the investigator. Exclusion criteria #10, #11, #12, and #27 were revised for clarification only. Exclusion criterion #14 was modified to include dermatological disorders and active hepatitis B or C . Exclusion criterion #20 was modified to be c onsistent with DSM -5 terminology and requirements for diagnosis.

How ever, only up to the 60 mg dose was used.This trial w as designed to assess the pharm acokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of a single dose of OPC -64005 at doses of 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, 6mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 70 mg, or placebo to healthy adult males, and to randomiz e 8subjects each (6 subjects for OPC -64005 and 2 subject for placebo) and 9 subjects each (6 subjects for OPC -64005 and 3 subjects for placebo) to the 1 to20mg groups and the 25 to70mg groups, respectively. However, 60 mg was the highest dose assesse d in this trial.

As a result, the MTD w as considered hardly possible to determine in this trial for the following reasons: The dosage in this cohort did not violate the MTD defined in the protocol; supraventricular tachycardia observed in this subject w as difficult to asses s; and the investigator and subinvestigator did not change the assessment of ‘nonserious’ for supraventricular tachycardia even after the Sponsor had assessed the event as serious. Although the result suggested the possibility to proceed to the next dose step of 70 mg, the dose escalation in this trial w as terminated at a dose of 60 mg.The MTD w as not determined in this trial for the following reasons: this cohort did not meet the definition of MTD as defined in the protocol; supraventricular tachycardia observed in this subject w as difficult to assess; and the investigator and subinvestigator did not change the assessment of ‘nonserious’ for supraventricular tachycardia even after the Sponsor had assessed the event as ‘serious ’. Although the result sugg ested the possibility to proceed to the next dose step of 70 mg, dose escalation in this trial was terminated at a dose of 60 mg. Section 1.2.3, Phase 1 Multiple- Dose Trial to Evaluate Pharm acokinetics, Safety, and Pharm acody namics in Healthy Adult Male and Female Subjects (United States, 277-10-206)The 30 -mg dose of OPC -64005 demonstrated significant effects in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reuptake in NE and 5 -HT, but no statistically significant effect on DA. Plasma monoamine changes for OPC -64005 in the NE and 5 -HT systems were consistent with those found in CSF. Bupropion, which was believed to be a comparator for DA activity, showed no statistically significant activity on any of the monoamine transmitters or their metabolites in CSF.Assays to detect the presence of neurotransmitter metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggested that the 30 mg dose of OPC -64005 had a significant impact on reuptake inhibition forNE and 5 -HT. However, there was no clear evidence of DA related metabolites in CSF i n either OPC -64005 samples or in those collected from subjects who received bupropion (positive control) .

The tool is applicable in clinical, medical, research, and athletic settings, where its sensitivity to change makes the assessment ideal for treatment monitoring and evaluation, as well as clinical trials. The POMS 2 -A is comprised of 65 items. This full length version yields several scale scores: Anger -Hostility, Confusion Bewilderment, Depression -Dejection, Fatigue -Inertia, Tension -Anxiety, and Vigor- Activity. Total Mood Disturbance is a function of these 6 scale scores. The Friendliness scale is scored separately. These comprehensive versions are recommended for use when a thorough evaluation of mood is desired.3.7.2.7 Profile of Mood States -Brief Form (POMS) The POMS ( Appendix 10) is a 30 -item self-report scale that generates the following subscales: Tension or Anxiety, Anger -Hostility, Vigor - Activity, Fatigue -Inertia, Depression - Dejection, and Confusion - Bewilderm ent.57 These subscales yield an overall total mood score.

The AiCure Platform uses artificial intelligence on sm artphones to confirm IMP ingestion. In addition, built -in reminders and a communication system allow real -time intervention in case of IMP interruptions. Use of this AiCure Platform will in no way supersede or replace the physician and/or prescribed IMP protocol of the subjects. Because the AiCure Platform does not change the IMP protocol of the subjects, but rather encourages adherence to the predefined protocol, use of this AiCure Platform presents mini mal risk to the subjects. Use of the AiCure Platform will be required for all subjects in the trial. The monitoring AiCure Platform requires that all subjects take each dose o f the IMP while using a smartphone.

This notification reminds subjects to take their IMP dose while using the AiCure Platform . Subjects will follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front -facing webcam to visually confirm their ingestion of the IMP. The application on the smartphone will m ake an autom ated determination of whether the subject has properly taken their IMP at the prescribed time. There is no need for the trial site staff to review the adm inistration, nor would the tri al site staff need to be available at the tim e the subject takes their IMP. The am ount of guidance that the device provides to the subjects is autom atically reduced as the subject becom es more proficient at using the application. After the device confirm s proper IMP ingestion, video recordings will be encrypted and transmitted to a secure centralized location for further analysis, including testing for duplicate enrollment. The captured data and video are reviewable through a roles and rules restr icted system ensuring privacy of the inform ation. The system is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which protects the privacy and security of healthcare information.

This protocol only introduces a smartphone -based m onitoring application that prom pts the user to take their IMP, verifies ingesti on, and stores encrypted data securely for analysis. When functioning properly, use of the AiCure Platform does not affect titration, dosage, route of administration, or treatment duration, conform ing to any trial requirements as noted by trial site staff . It is possible, though very unlikely, that the AiCure application can fail to remind subjects to take the IMP or tell them to take their IMP when not required. To date, AiCure has not encountered such a m alfunction. All trial data, including any identifiable subject inform ation, will be obtained and encrypted by the application. Subjects will be coded according to the protocol and their identity will not be stored with the trial data obtained. After the subject has taken the IMP and confirm ation o f proper ingestion has been completed, the encrypted data will be autom atically forwarded to a secure server. The server is compliant with the HIPAA, which protects the privacy and security of healthcare inform ation. The data will be securely stored and only accessible to the trial site staff and other authorized personnel through two-way authentication. The data m ay also be retained in a secure manner beyond the term of the trial and utilized to improve the operation of the AiCure Platform , categorize adherence activity by disease state or other useful categories, and/or for regulatory filings by the AiCure Platform Provider to support future applications for the AiCure Platform Provider’s product.

Collect a detailed history, including specific questioning for symptoms of hepatitis (eg, w eight loss, right upper quadrant tenderness, malaise, jaundice, hepatomegaly, dark urine) or other possible causes of the rash (eg, allergic, contact dermatitis) . 3.Perform a physical examination of the area affected by the skin rash , listing all body parts affected (eg, left or right hand, forearm , upper arm , etc.). 4.Obtain vital signs ( including body temperature). 5.Record all concomitant medications and nutritional supplements and compare them with the use of IMP and the onset and resolution of skin eruptions. 6.Take a picture of the area(s) of the rash using the Clinical Ink SureSource tablet. If the rash area is generalized, the torso, back, abdomen ,and extremities should be photographed. NOTE: Photographs should not contain any personal identifiers or parts of the body that would identify the subject (such as unusual tattoos, full -face views, etc.) . 7.
