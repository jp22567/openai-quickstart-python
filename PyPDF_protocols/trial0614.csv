Study Rationale GB001 is a highly potent and selective oral prostaglandin D 2 receptor (DP 2) antagonist. DP 2 is expressed on a variety of cells implicated in the allergic process including eosinophils, basophils, and epithelial cells (Kupczyk , 2017; Singh, 2017) as well as Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2 ) and T Helper cell type 2 ( Th2) cells (Kato, 2019). GB001 is being developed as a once- daily oral add -on maintenance treatment for patients with moderate to severe eosinophilic asthma and related diseases, and for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps (NP). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GB001 compared with placebo in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without bilateral NP . 2.2. Background Chronic rhinosinus itis (CRS) is defined as any inflammatory condition of the paranasal sinuses and associated nasal mucosa for more than 12 weeks ( Fokkens, 2007). The loss of epithelial barrier function plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of CRS, with the loss of tight junctions permitting access to the sinus stromal tissue by allergens, bacteria, and bacteria- derived antigens. Clinical symptoms include nasal obstruction and congestion, reduction in or loss of sense of smell, anterior and posterior rhinorrhea, and facial pain. These symptoms can impact greatly upon a patient ’s quality of life. Current recommendations for phenotyping CRS are based on the presence of nasal polyps (chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [CRSwNP]) or absence of nasal polyps (chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps [CRSsNP]) ( Fokkens, 2007). In a multinational study undertaken by the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network, the total prevalence of CRSwNP and CRSsNP has been estimated at 15.5% and 10.9% in the USA and Europe, respectively ( Collins, 1997; Hastan, 2011). Patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma (~30%) have a poor therapeutic response and a high recurrence rate, and their disease tends to be more resistant to treatment ( Thomas, 2008; Fokkens, 2007). Within th e group of patients with aspirin sensitivity, nasal polyps are found in 36% to 60% of patients. Patients with aspirin sensitivity, asthma, and NP, also known as aspirin -exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), are usually non- atopic and the disease prevalence increases over the age of 40 years. Notably, these patients have an increased expression of DP 2 (Rothenberg, 2017). Eicosanoid changes in paranasal sinus diseases, including AERD, are generally characterized by an up-regulation of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), lipoxin A4 (LXA4), and prostaglandin D2 (PGD 2) and a down-regulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2). Classification of CRS by nasal polyp phenotype is based on the observation that nasal polyp disease is more likely to be associated with an eosinophil- mediated Th2 -high (IL- 4, IL -5, and IL-13) cytokine profile. In contrast, CRSsNP is thought to present as a non-eosinophilic disease ( Crombruggen, 2011). Emerging data, however, suggest that NP status alone can often be inadequate for defining a Th2-high/IL-5–high eosinophilic phenotype ( Tan, 2017). The Tan"
18,page_18,"GB001, Inc. GB001 Protocol GB001-2101 Version 5.0, 16 Apr 2020 19 CONFIDENTIAL study examined tissue concentrations of IL-5 and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) as surrogate marker s for tissue eosinophi lia. While values were significantly greater in patients with CRSwNP, there was extensive overlap in ECP concentrations between patients with and without NPs. Similarly, in a cluster analysis, expression of IL- 5 in patients with CRS was identified in clust ers with and without NPs ( Tomassen, 2016). Within these two groups, CRSwNP and CRSsNP, patients with an eosinophilic phenotype, eosinophilic CRS (e CRS) have a subtype of chronic sinusitis that is thought to occur secondary to chronic and systemic eosinophil activation. Patients with eCRS show overlapping mechanisms for eosinophilia and tend to have a poor response to medical and surgical management (Ferguson, 2004). In a recent cross -sectional study of adult patients with CRS (N = 345) undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery, eCRS was defined by histopathological assessment showing > 10 eosinophils/high-power field on sinus mucosal biopsy. Blood tests were perform ed preoperatively and assessed for a full blood count including eosinophils as well as markers of inflammation and atopy. Comparisons between eCRS and non- eCRS patients were performed. Amon g all cases with CRS , 60% were identified as eCRS, of which 41% had asthma and 47% had nasal polyps. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis predicted high tissue eosinophilia at blood eosinophil levels ≥ 240 cells/ μL (sensitivity 70.9%, specificity 78.4%, area under the curve [AUC]: 0.792, p < 0.01). Th ere was no association with other markers of inflammation and atopy ( Ho, 2018). Evidence from treatment with biologics inhibiting Type 2 inflammation have demonstrated clinical benefits in patients with CRSwNP (Bachert, 2017; Bachert , 2016). T he treatment effect of GB001 has been demonstrated in patients with asthma and particularly Type 2 inflammation. Specifically, in a Phase 2 study in Japanese subjects (Study PTR-36-201), GB001 reduced asthma worsening (32.7%, GB001 5 mg ; 20.8%, GB001 20 mg) compared with placebo (52.8%, p < 0.05 for both dose levels). This effect was enhanced in subjects with eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/ μL. In a recent post-hoc analysis of 36 subjects with mild to moderate atopic asthma receiving a total daily dose of fluticasone propionate ≤ 500 μg or equivalent, who were randomized (2:1) to 30 mg of GB001 or placebo once daily for 28 days, lung function was analyzed by baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO, < 35 a nd ≥ 35 ppb) and blood eosinophil (< 250 and ≥ 250/µL) subgroups ( Ortega, 2019; Skolnick, 2019). In the overall population, GB001 had an effect on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Day 28 (difference in mean change for GB001 versus placebo of 102 mL, n = 36). Changes in FEV1 were also observed in the high baseline FeNO (n=14) and high baseline eosinophil (n=1 1) subgroups (differences of 207 mL and 133 mL, respectively). These results suggest that GB001 influences lung function in subjects with markers of eosinophilic inflammation. It is anticipated that GB001 has the potential to provide clinical benefit in patients with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis. 2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment 2.3.1. GB001 Benefit/Risk Assessment GB001, an oral DP 2 antagonist , is being developed as a controller therapy in asthma. The clinical development of GB001 includes 9 completed clinical studies and 2 ongoing clinical studies."
19,page_19,"GB001, Inc. GB001 Protocol GB001-2101 Version 5.0, 16 Apr 2020 20 CONFIDENTIAL As of 29 August 2019, a total of 459 subjects have received at least 1 dose of GB001 at any dose level. Of these, 98 subjects received a single dose of GB001 ranging from 1 mg to 200 mg, and 361 subjects received multiple doses from 5 mg to 160 mg. Of the 361 subjects who received multiple doses, about half (n = 159) were subjects with ast hma in the completed Phase 2 studies who received either GB001 20 mg for up to 12 weeks, including 2 weeks with concurrent dosing of montelukast 10 mg daily (Study ADC3680-07), or GB001 22.73 mg daily for up to 4 weeks (Study ADC3680-04) or up to 16 weeks concurrent with ICS withdrawal and discontinuation (Study PTR-36-201). Based on evaluation of asthma worsening (Study PTR-36-201), GB001 at a 20 mg dose showed efficacy in the overall population and the greatest efficacy in the subgroup of patients with eosinophil counts ≥ 300 cells/ μL. This is consistent with the current understanding of the biology regarding this pathway. As of 29 August 2019, a total of 459 subjects have received at least 1 dose of GB001 at any dose level. Drug induced liver injury is considered a potential risk of GB001 due to the occurrence of two Hy’s Law cases, one was a liver disorder (preferred term) in a healthy subject at 160 mg in Study PTR-36- 101 and one was hepatic enzyme increased (preferred term) in Study GB001-2001 which remains blinded. Details are provided in the IB. Liver monitoring is critical for the safe management of subjects. Investigators should have a low threshold for discontinuing study drug with any suspicion of drug-induced liver injury. Safety will be closely monitored by the Sponsor. In a study with another DP 2 antagonist (OC000459) which evaluated 35 subjects allergic to grass pollen, subjects were exposed to grass pollen for 6 hours on the 2nd and 8th days of treatment. During the first treatment period, there was a significant reduction in the total nasal symptom score compared with placebo ( Horak, 2012). These data support the role of DP 2 in upper airway disease and provide a foundation for potential therapeutic benefits by blocking this pathway in patients with upper airway inflammatory disease. 2.3.2. Study Design Benefit /Risk Assessment This study is designed to assess the effect of GB001 on the Sino-N asal Outcome T est-22 (SNOT -22) in comparison to placebo. To minimize any potential risk to subjects, stringent criteria are utilized during screening to exclude subjects with a history of significant comorbidities that could impact subjects’ safety. All participating subjects on active or placebo will be frequently and closely monitored during the study with optimized standard of care. This study proposes to minimize the number of subjects to be exposed to GB001, while still being able to assess potential effects on CRS disease . Based upon the study design and the close monitoring from the Sponsor and/or designee, the bene fits of participation in GB001-2101 outweigh the potential risks of exposure to GB001. The study will provide the basis of a first benefit /risk assessment of GB001 in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without bilateral nasal polyps."

Overall Design This is a Phase 2 a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi- center study to evaluate GB001 administered once a day for 16 weeks in subjec ts with chronic rhino sinusitis with or without bilateral nasal polyps. A schematic of the study design is presented in Section 1.2. 4.1.1. Study Design Prior to screening, subjects must be on a stable regimen of intranasal cortico stero ids (INCS) for ≥ 2 months. If the subject is using an INCS product other than mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) prior to the Screening visit, the Investigator must switch the subject to MFNS at the Screening visit. All subjects will be maintained on a stable background therapy of m ometasone furoate n asal s pray for the duration of the study. Screening Visit (Visit 1): I nformed consent will be obtained, and inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed . Informed consent may be obtained prior to the day of the Screening visit to allow for medication washouts or for other logistical reasons such as obtaining documentation of exacerbations, if necessary. All other screening procedures should be completed , where possible, on the day of the Screening visit. Subjects not meeting the eligibility criteria will be deemed screen failures and will not continue participation in the study (see Section 5.4). The Run-in period commences with completion of all Screening visit procedures and concludes at the Randomization visit (V isit 2) . During the Run-in period of up to 4 weeks, subjects will capture nasal symptoms and MFNS use in a Diary daily (morning and evening): • Subject’s treatment regimen with MFNS should remain stable . • 2 actuations (50 µg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily (total daily dose of 400 µg), unless subject is intolerant to a twice daily ( BID) regimen of MFNS in which case, they can stay on the dose regimen in place prior to screening . • The only dose modification of MFNS during the Run-in period may be for subjects who were switched from another INCS to MFNS and need to change to a QD regimen due to intolerability . Randomization Visit ( Day 1/Week 0/Visit 2 ): Subjects who meet the randomization eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following double- blind treatments for 16 weeks: • GB001 40 mg once per day (QD) • Matching placebo once per day (QD) Randomization will be stratified by country, the presence or absence of NP (CRSwNP and CRSsNP), and the presence o r absence of comorbid asthma among CRSwNP subjects . Presence of NP is defined by a minimum NPS of 4 out of a maximum score of 8 with a score of at least 2 for each nostril. Absence of NP is defined as an absence of NP based on visual examination or an NPS of 0 based on nasal endoscopy. Presence of comorbid asthma is defined as a diagnosis of asthma by a physician according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA ) guidelines at screening"

The CRSwNP stratum will consist of appr oximately 64 subjects, and the CRSsNP stratum will consist of approximately 36 subjects. Subjects will continue on mometasone furoate: MFNS two actuations in each nostril BID (or QD in case subject cannot tolerate the high dose) during the course of the study. Following initiation of investigational product (IP) at the clinic, subjects will visit the clinic weekly for the first 6 weeks a nd approximately every 4 weeks th ereafter through week 20, for a total of 10 additional visits (refer to Schedule of Activities, Section 1.3). Early Discontinuation of IP a nd Early Withdrawal from Study: Subjects will be requested to attend the Early Discontinuation of IP or Early Withdrawal (EW) vi sit, as appropriate, and will be strongly encouraged to comp lete any remaining study visits as per the Schedule of Activities (SoA; Section 1.3). Subjects who permanently discontinue IP and continue in the study will complete the Early Discontinuation of IP visit at the time of IP discontinuation and then return for the next visit in the visit sequence. At the vi sits after the Early Discontinuation of IP visit, study procedures will be completed except for di spensation/return of IP . Subjects who withdraw early from the study, regardless of the reason, will be requested to return to the clinic to complete the EW visit. All subjects who remain on IP through and including Visit 7 (Week 16) or who complete the EW visit will be asked to return for a Follow-up visit approximately 4 weeks after their last dose of IP to assess subject safety. Follow-up Period: Subjects can continue treatment with the stable dose of MFNS maintained over the Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled peri od, or modify treatment based on medical judgment. Total duration for study participation per subject is up to 24 weeks (inclu des a Screening visit, followed by an up to 4-weeks Run-in period to allow for collection of baseline Diary data; a 16-week Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled period; and 4-week Follow-up period). 4.1.2. Unscheduled Visit There may be a need to have a subject return to clinic for an unscheduled visit for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to : repeat of a lab test, replacem ent of IP, or evaluation of an AE. Any procedure that is conducted during a re gularly scheduled on-treatment visit may be performed at an unscheduled visit. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design 4.2.1. Study Population The study population is comprise d of: symptomatic CRS subjects with CRSsNP, defined as an absence of NP based on visual examination or an NPS of 0 based on nasal endoscopy, and evidence of an eosinophilic phenotype (eCRS), defined as a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 250 cells/μL; and symptomatic CRS subjects with CRSwNP, defined as a minimum NPS of 4 out of a maximum of 8, with at least a score of 2 for each nostril, as assesse d by endoscopic diagnosis by a blinded central reader. Subjec ts with historical evidence of neutrophilic predominant polyp disease will be excluded considering that the mechanism of action of GB001 is thought to be linked to eosinophilic Type 2 inflammation. Th e overall study population will consist of approximately 64 CRSwNP subj ects and 36 CRSsNP subjects."
24,page_24,"GB001, Inc. GB001 Protocol GB001-2101 Version 5.0, 16 Apr 2020 25 CONFIDENTIAL GB001 will be administered as an additional treatment on top of a stable standard of care ( SOC ) regimen of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS). 4.2.2. Choice of Control Group All subjects will be on background SOC. The study is placebo- controlled to minimize bias and provide an inactive control group to which the efficacy of GB001 can be compared. Comparisons between the GB001 and placebo treatment groups will facilitate differentiation of the GB001 safety profile from that of the SOC. Lastly, a placebo group, as opposed to an active control, will help to understand whether the occurrence of an AE in the GB001 group is different from that which would occur in this population in the absence of GB001. 4.2.3. Efficacy Endpoint Selection The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to Week 16 in SNOT -22. This instrument has been used in multiple clinical studies to demonstrate the impact of different types of treatment interventions in subject s with CRS. In addition, this study will explore the impact of GB001 on bilateral nasal polyps and associated sinus symptoms, using specific assessments and questionnaires. 4.3. Justification for Dose This study will assess 40 mg of GB001 in adult subjects with chronic rhino sinusitis with or without bilateral nasal polyps . In a previous asthma study ( PTR-36-201), GB001 5 mg and 20 mg doses were evaluated. While b oth doses of GB001 were effective compared to placebo in decreasing the proportion of subjects with asthma worsening/exacerbations in a treatment withdrawal design, th e 20 mg dose produc ed a larger treatment effect (20 mg: 20.8%; 5 mg: 32.7%; placebo: 52.8%). In addition, only the 20 mg dose demonstrated statistical significance for the endpoints of asthma control, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5), and time to asthma worsening relative to placebo. However , no improvements in lung function were observed, suggesting that higher doses are needed to achieve clinical benefit across different endpoints, including lung function. A comparable safety profile was observed across all treatment arms (including placebo) in this study. Considering that patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with eosinophilic inflammation manifest with more inflammation and disease severity than patients with asthma in general, a dose of 40 mg should be adequate and safe to investigate the efficacy and safety of GB001 in this patient population. The selection of this dose encompasses the totality of PK, efficacy , and safety data of GB00 1 available to date. 4.4. End of Study Definition Subjects will be regarded to have completed the study if he/she completes the Week 16 visit. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last subject in the study."

Efficacy Assessments 8.1.1. SNOT -22 The SNOT -22 (Section 10.9) is a validated questionnaire to assess the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on quality of life and utilizes a 2-week recall period. I t is a 22 -item outcome measure on a 5 -point category scale applicable to sinonasal conditions and surgical treatments. The total scores range from 0 to 110 with higher total scores implying greater impact of CRS on quality of life. A Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID ) is available: 8.90 (Hopkins, 2009)."
37,page_37,"GB001, Inc. GB001 Protocol GB001-2101 Version 5.0, 16 Apr 2020 38 CONFIDENTIAL 8.1.2. Computer Tomography (CT) CT of the sinuses will be performed at Randomization, at end of treatment (Visit 7) and if a patient is withdrawn early . For the accurate assessment of Lund-Mackay scores and 3D volumetric measurement of the maxillary sinus, the same acquisitions (sequences) will be performed and used for centralized imaging data assessments and scored by the imaging core lab oratory . Blinded central reading of the Visit 2 assessment will be used for comparison with the Week 16 visit. The final results of blinded central reading will be made available after the study. Details on CT will be available in a separate operational manual provided to t he sites. The Lund-Mackay system is based on localization with points given for degree of opacification: 0 = normal, 1 = partial opacification, 2 = total opacification. These points are then applied to the maxillary, anterior ethmoid, posterior ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal sinus on each side. The osteomeatal complex is graded as 0 = not occluded, or 2 = occluded deriving a maximum score of 12 per side ( Lund, 1993). This scoring system has been validated in several studies (Scadding, 2011; Hopkins, 2009). For subjects in whom the osteomeatal complex (OC) is missing (because of a previous surgery) the blinded central reader should consider the location of the former OC and provide a scoring (as if the OC was there). Three- Dimensional volumetric measurement of the maxillary sinus will be performed at the imaging core laboratory. This method is used to calculate: • volume of the air (mL) • volume of mucosa (mL) • percent occupied by disease • thickness of lateral wall For the analysis, blinded central reading of the CT at Visit 2 wi ll be used for comparison with Week 16. The sites will remove subject-identifying information from the imaging data header prior to sending the imaging data to the imaging core laboratory. The percent change in opacification from baseline to end of treatment will be calculated ( Van Agthoven, 2001). If a prior CT within 60 days of the R andomization visit is available and the Imaging Core Laboratory confirms their quality criteria are met, this CT may be acceptable. 8.1.3. Bilateral Endoscopic Nasal Polyp Score The bilateral endoscopic nasal polyp score (NPS) is the sum of the right and left nostril scores, as evaluated by means of blinded, centrally read nasal endoscopy. NP is graded based on polyp size described in the Table 2 below:"

Standard video se quences will be downloaded or sent to the centralized reader. Centralized imaging data assessments and scoring by an independent physician reviewer for the imaging data will be performed for all endoscopies. To confirm eligibility at V isit 2 (baseline) , only the V isit 1 blinded central reading will be made available to the site. The final results of blinded central read s will be made available after the study. 8.1.4. Disease -specific, Daily S ymptom A ssessments On a daily basis, from V isit 1 and throughout the study, the subject will use a Diary to: Respond to the morning and evening individual rhinosinusitis symptom questions using a 0–3 categorical scale (where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms) for the following symptoms: • congestion and/or obstruction • anterior rhinorrhea (runny nose) • posterior rhinorrhea (post-nasal drip) • loss of sense of smell The Diary is provided at Visit 1 and information is collected on the days /times indicated in the Schedule of Activities . Diary entries are to be completed until the Follow-up visit (Week 20). The TSS is the sum of the scores from the 4 symptom categories and ranges from 0–12. For each rhinosinusitis symptom category and the TSS, t he average of the available scores recorded during the last 7 days before V isit 2 (up to 14 scores, including the morning of Visit 2) will be used to determine the baseline value. A minimum of 4 days of the previous 7 days must be completed (inclusive of the morning entry on the day of randomization) in order to qualify for randomization (see Section 5.3) . 8.1.5. Smell Test: University of Pennsylvania Smel l Identification Test (UPSIT) The test consists of four booklets, each containing 10 odorants with one odorant per page (Doty, 1984). The test -time is about 15 min utes. The stimuli are embedded in 10–50 μ m diameter plastic microcapsules on brown strips at the bottom of each page. Above each odorant"

The subject is asked to release the odorant by rubbing the brown- strip with the tip of a pencil and to indicate which of four words best describes the odor. An UPSIT result is scored out of 40 where a higher score indicates better olfaction. 8.1.6. CRS Exacerbation Chronic rhinosinusitis exacerbation is defined as deterioration of CRS symptoms requiring treatment with an antibiotic, an anti -inflammatory drug, or a symptom reliever; an Emergency Department visit; or hospitalization ( Kuiper, 2018; Meltzer, 2006; Rosenfeld, 2015). The date of onset of a CRS exacerbation will be considered to be the first date of treatment with an antibiotic, an anti -inflammatory drug, or a symptom reliever , the date of Emergency Department visit, or the date of hospitalization, whichever occurs first. The end date of a CRS exacerbation will be considered to be the last date of treatment with an antibiotic, an anti-inflammatory drug , or a symptom reliever , or 6 days after the date of onset (for a total duration of 7 days), whichever is later. Courses of treatment separated by 7 or more days will be counted as separate exacerbations. 8.1.7. Visual Analog S cale ( VAS ) The visual analog scale (VAS) for rhinosinusitis is used to evaluate the total severity and is only validated in adult CRS to date ( Fokkens, 2007) . The subject is asked to indicate on a VAS the answer to the question: “How troublesome are your symptoms of rhinosinusitis?” The VAS ranks from 0 (Not troublesome) to 10 (Worst thinkable troublesome), see Appendix 7, Section 10.7. The disease can be divided into Mild, Moderate, and Severe based on total severity VAS score (0 to 10 cm): • Mild = VAS 0 -3 • Moderate = VAS > 3 –7 • Severe = VAS > 7–10 8.1.8. Nitric Oxide Measurement Nitric oxide may be measured at the visits specified in the SoA utilizing equipment provided by a central vendor. Nitric oxide will be measured both by oral (fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO]) and nasal (nasal nitric oxide [nNO]) methods . For more details, please refer to the Study Reference Manual. 8.1.9.

Physical Examinations • A complete physical examination will be conducted as designated in the SoA (see Section 1.3). • Height and weight will also be measured and recorded as noted in the SoA (see Section 1.3). 8.2.2. Vital Signs • Pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and blood pressure will be assessed. • Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the subject in a quiet setting without distractions ( eg, television, cell phones). • Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with the subject in a sitting position with a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. • Vital signs will be measured prior to ECG measurements . 8.2.3. Electrocardiograms • Assessment of a single 12- lead ECG will be obtained as o utlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) to determine heart rate and measure PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. The test can be repeated in triplicate if the QTcF value is slightly above the threshold. 8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments • See Appendix 2 (Se ction 10.2) for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed at the visits designated in the So A. Details for collection, processing and shipping of samples to the central laboratory are provided in a separate Laboratory Manual. • The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF . The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject 's condition. • All laboratory tests with values considered abnormal and clinically significant during participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or Medical Monitor. For ad ditional liver safety monitoring, refer to Appendix 6 (Section 10.6)."

Adverse Events , Serious Adverse Events , and Adverse Events of Interest The definitions of an AE, SAE , and AE of Interest can be found in Appendix 3 ( Section 10.3). AE will be reported by the subject (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the subject's legally authorized representative). The investigator an d any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE, SAE, or AE of Interest. 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Treatment -emergent adverse events will be collected from the first dose of IP until the end of follow up. Serious adverse events will be collected beginning at the time of consent until the end of follow up. Medical occurrences that begin after obtaining i nformed consent and before the first dose of IP will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF and not the AE section. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately upon the site learning of an event and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3 ( Section 10.3.5) . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAE s that start after conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 ( Section 10.3) . Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the pref erred method to inquire about AE occurrences ."

All SAEs and events of interest (defined in Section 10.3) will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow up (as defined in Sectio n 7.3) . Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 3 (Section 10.3) . 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs • Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the sa fety of subjects and the safety of the IP under clinical investigation are met. • The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of an IP under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators. • Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSAR according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. • An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report from the Sponsor describing a SAE or other specific safety information ( eg, summary or listing of SAEs) will review and then file it along with the IB. The Investigator will then notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Pregnancy • Details of all pregnancies will be collected as outlined in Appendix 4 (Section 10.4) . • If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4 (Section 10.4) . • Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. 8.3.6. Death Events Timelines for reporting of death events are identical to the requirements for SAE reporting. (Section 10.3.5) . 8.3.7. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AEs or SAEs CRS exacerbation is an efficacy assessment that is a disease-related outcome not qualifying as an AE unless the investigator considers the CRS exacerbation to have met the definition of an SAE (Appendix 3; Section 10.3.2) . CRS exacerbation meeting the definition of an SAE will be reported in the appropriate eCRF (Appendix 3; Section 10.3.5) .

This population will be used for safety analyses. 9.4. Statistical Analyses In general, continuous variables will be summarized using the number of subjects with non-missing data, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Continuous variable summaries will include standard error, where appropriate. Categorical variables will b e summarized using counts and percentages. Baseline value will be defined as the last non- missing value on or before the date of the first dose of IP. Analyses will generally be performed for the overall population and by stratum (CRSwNP and CRSsNP), other than endpoints associated with outcomes that are specific to the CRSwNP stratum (eg, NPS). All statistical hypothesis testing will be at an 0.050 two-sided level of significance. 9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses 9.4.1.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary endpoint of change from baseline to Week 16 in SNOT-22 score will be analyzed by a mixed- effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) using a restricted maximum-likelihood (REML)-based approach. The MMRM model will include change from baseline scores up to Week 16 as the response variable; the fixed, categorical effects of treatment group, randomization strata defined by the presence or absence of NP and comorbid asthma (ie, CRSwNP with comorbid asthma, CRSwNP without comorbid asthma, and CRSsNP), country, visit, and treatment group by visit interaction; and the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline SNOT -22 score and baseline SNOT -22 score by visit interaction. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model within -subject error. If this analysis fails to converge, a compound symmetric or first- order autoregressive covariance structure will be utilized for the primary analysis, based on the covariance structure converging to better fit as determined based on Akaike’s information criterion. Statistical inference for treatment group comparison of GB001 40 mg versus placebo at Week 16 will be derived from the above MMRM model, with results presented in te rms of a least squares mean difference, along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p- value. 9.4.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Analysis The secondary endpoints of change from baseline to Week 16 in Lund-Mackay total score and in UPSIT score will be analyzed utilizing analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models including covariates for baseline score, presence or absence of bilateral NP, and treatment group.

Women in the following cate gories are not considered WOCBP 1. Premenarchal 2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: • Documented hysterectomy • Documented bilateral salpingectomy • Documented bilateral oophorectomy For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry. Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the subject’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 3. Postmenopausal female • A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medic al cause. − A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level (eg, > 40 IU/L) in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However , in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measurement is required. • Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment."

The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of IP. − A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine or serum as required by local regulations) within 24 hours before the first dose of IP. − If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative ( eg, an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the subject must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive. Contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical studies."

If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.) Highly Effective Methodsa That Are User Dependent • Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation − oral − intravaginal − transdermal − injectable • Progestogen- only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb − oral − injectable • Sexual abstinence (Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the IP . The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.) a Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Typical use failure rates differ from those when used consistently and correctly b If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable contraceptive methods are limited to those which inhibit ovulation as the primary mode of action Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), wi thdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study. Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction)."
