Investigational Product: Selinexor (KPT -330) Study Phase: Phase 3 Title of Study: A Phase 3 Randomized, Controlled, Open -label Study of Selinexor, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone (SVd) versus Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (Vd) in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) Study Name: BOSTON: Bortezomib, Selinexor, and Dexame thasone in Patients with Multiple Myeloma Protocol Number: KCP -330-023 Indication: Relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) Overall Study Design : This Phase 3, 2-arm, randomized, active comparator-controlled, open-label, multicenter study will compare the efficacy and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and assess the safety of selinexor plus bortezomib (Velcade® or generic equivalent) plus low-dose dexamethasone (SVd) v ersus bortezomib plus low-dose dexamethason e (Vd) in adul t patients with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 prior anti-multiple myeloma (MM) regimens . After progressive disease (PD) is confirmed b y the Independent Review Committee (IRC), patients i n the Vd Arm may cross over to a regimen that includes selinexor: 1 ) SVd treatment (SVdX) for patients wh o are able to tolerate continued bortezomib, or 2 ) selinexor an d dexamethasone treatment (S dX) for patients wh o have significant tolerability issues with bortezomib . Patients who cross over will be referre d to as SVdX patients or SdX patients, respectively. The study overview is presented in the figure below. Abbreviations: IA = interim ana lysis; IRC = Independent Review Committee; ITT = intent -to-treat; PD = progressive disease; PFS = progression -free survival; SdX= selinexor plus low -dose dexamethasone treatment after crossover; SVd = selinexor plus bortezomib plus low -dose dexamethasone; SVdX = SVd treatment after crossover; Vd = bortezomib plus low -dose dexamethasone."

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 18 Version 4.0 Study Rationale: This study is based o n preliminary supportive data from patients with relapsed MM treated wit h SVd in Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP; NCT02343042 ) demonstrating that SVd has v ery high levels of anti-myeloma activity, even in patients with proteasome -inhibitor ( PI)-refractory disease, with relativel y low adverse event (AE) rates. The majority of patients in Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP) were treated with once weekly (QW) bortezomib. Cross over of patients on the control arm (Vd Arm) to SVd X will allow for direct assessment o f selinexor’s ability to restore sensitivity in PI-resistan t MM. The QW regimen of SVd, based on Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP), provides for a considerable reduction (~40%) in overall bortezomib dose versus the control arm (Vd Arm) that, in addition to the relatively low dose of seli nexor, may be associated with better tolerability ( eg, peripheral neuropathy) compared with second -line Vd and Vd -based combination regimens. Thus, this SVd regimen could serve a current and rapidly growing unmet medical need in patients with RRMM, providing for increased response rates and durability of response over Vd , with improved tolerability with respect to peripheral neuropathy -associated untoward effects of bortezomib. Objectives : Primary Disease response will be assessed according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria based on Kumar (Kumar 2016 ). • To compare progression -free survival (PFS) based on the IRC’s disease outcome assessments in patients randomized to the SVd Arm versus the Vd Arm Secondary • To compare the overall response rate (ORR) (≥ partial response [PR]) based on the IRC’s response outcome assessments in patients randomized to the SVd Arm versus the Vd Arm • To compare the incidence of any Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy events in patients randomized to the SVd Arm versus patients randomized to t he Vd Arm • To compare the number of patients with response ≥ very good partial response (VGPR), ≥ complete response (CR), ≥ stringent complete response (sCR), or minimal residual disease (MRD) negative (for pati ents who achieve CR or sCR) in patients randomized to the SVd Arm versus the Vd Arm • To compare overall survival (OS) in all patients randomized to the SVd Arm versus the Vd Arm • To compare the duration of response ( DOR ) in patients randomized to the SVd Arm versus the Vd Arm • To determine ORR1 (ORR during SVd X treatment only) • To determine PFS 1 (PFS during SVdX treatment only) • To compare time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) in patients randomized to the SVd Arm versus the Vd Arm wh o receive post -SVd/Vd /SVdX /SdX treatment • To compare time -to-response (TTR) in patients randomized to the SVd Arm versus the Vd Arm • To assess the safety and tolerabilit y of treatment with SVd versus Vd in patients with RRMM"

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 26 Version 4.0 d After discontinuation of SVd, Vd, SVdX, or SdX if feasible and clinically indicated, MM evaluations should be pe rformed every 3 months for patients who have not progressed to assess durability of response. If MM evaluations cannot be performed, at a minimum, a telephone call w ill be made to the patient (or the patient’s family) to assess the survival status, status of the patient’s MM, and overall medical condition of the patient and collect information on any antineoplastic therapies used after discontinuation of study treatment ( see Section 11.7.4 ). e SVdX/SdX patients will return to Cycle 1 for SVdX/SdX treatment. See Table 3. f Only for patients being treated with selinexor -containing regimens: Telephone call with patient to evaluate supportive care medications, concomitant medications, and AEs, and to adjust supportive care as appropriate. The telephone contact with the patient must take place on C1D3. g The window of ± 2 days for MM disease assessments that fall on in -clinic dosing visits may be extended to ± 7 days for MM disease assessments that fall on a day when dosing in the clinic is not required ( eg, C10D29). h ICF must be signed before any study -specific procedures are performed. i If the patient’s weight fluctuates substantially from baseline ( ie, >20%) during treatment, BSA should be recalculated. j BSA will be calculated on C1D1 to determine the volume of bortezomib to be administered and to ensure that no patient receive s a dose of selinexor >70 mg/m2. k BP and pulse rate should be measured after the patient has been in a supine or sitting position for 5 minutes. BP should be a ssessed on the same arm throughout the study. Vital signs do not nee d to be repeated if they are performed as part of the physical examination. l If the visit for MM disease assessments occurs on the same day as the in -clinic dosing visit, vital signs should onl y be performed once. m The following assessments may be performed between Day -28 and prior to administration of study treatment on C1D1: ophthalmic examination, 12 -lead ECG, urinalysis, coagulat ion tests, C -reactive protein, and nutritional consultation. n Patients must rest for at least 5 minutes prior to the ECG recording. o CBC with differential and LDH may be performed between Day -7 and administration of study treatment on C1D1. p For females of childbearing potential; negative serum hCG pregnancy test must be ob tained within 3 days before the first dose of study treatment. Pregnancy testing (serum hCG or urine) is also required for females of childbearing potential prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycles ≥2 while on treatment (a negative pregnancy test must be documen ted prior to administration of study drug) and at the EoT Visit (serum hCG). Pregnancy testing may also be performed as clinically indicated during the study. q Perform blood draws for PK analysi s at the time points in Table 18. PK sampling for bortezomib will be performed for up to 25 patients in the Vd Arm and PK sampling for bortezomib and selinexor will be performed for up to 25 patients in the SVd Arm at selected investigational site s that can accommodate patients for up to 4 hours. Details for PK sample collection and processing can be found in the Study Manual . r Patients randomized to the SVd Arm who have IRC -confirmed PD while they are on SVd treatment will disco ntinue SVd treatment, proceed to the EoT Visit, and be followed for survival. Patients randomized to the Vd Arm who have IRC -confirmed PD while they are on Vd treatment and meet the criteria in Section 6.2 may cross over to a regimen that includes selinexor ( Table 3): 1) SVd treatment (SVdX) for pat ients who are able to tolerate continued bortezomib, or 2) selinexor and dexamethasone treatment (SdX) for patients who have significant tolerability issues with bortezomib. Pati ents who do not elect to cross over to SVdX or SdX from the Vd Arm will discon tinue treatment, proceed to the EoT Visit, and be followed for survival. s Samples for MM disease assessments on C1D1 must be collected either on Day -1 or predose on C1D1 for baseline values. Fo r patients who achieve CR or sCR, confirmatory samples for SPEP with serum protein immunofixation, quantitative Ig, and serum FLC must be collected in dup licate at the time of response and the duplicate samples must be provided to the central laboratory. A confirmatory 24 -hour urine sample must also be collected and an aliquot will be provided to the central laboratory for UPEP with urine protein immunofixation. Refer to the Study Manual for details. t A baseline skeletal survey is to be performed within 45 days prior to C1D1. Skeletal imaging does not need to be repeated in Cycle 1. Skeletal survey results will be read by the local laboratory."

Multiple Myeloma 4.1.1. Disease Background Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hema tological malignancy (after non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL ]), representing 1% of all cancers and 2% of all cancer deaths. With over 30,000 new cases and approximately 12, 700 de aths from MM anticipated in 201 8 in the United States of America ( USA ) (ACS 2018 ) and about twice as many in Europe, there is an unmet medical need for therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) that has progressed on available agents. 4.1.2. MM Treatment The treatment of MM has improved over the last 20 years and overall survival (OS) has increased considerably with the approval of non -chemotherapeutic agents including immunomodulatory drugs , such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide, and the proteasome inhibitors (PI s) bor tezomib, carfilzomib , and oral ixazomib (which was approv ed more recently) . These agents have served as “backbone” therapies for patients with MM , are often used in combination ( eg, lena lidomide with bortezomib), and are typically combined with “low -dose” dexamethasone (ie, ≤40 mg/week) . Additional drug classes, including histone deacetylase inhibitors such as panabinostat, along with a nti-CD38 (daratumumab) and anti -CS1 (elotuzumab) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) , have recently been approved and are all contributing to prolonged survival in MM. Despite this progre ss, essentially all patients will develop refractory MM and succumb to the disease. The prognosis remain s poor for patients with RRMM who have already received at least 1 prior anti-MM regimen. For these patients, the median progression -free survival (PFS) is 6.2 to 9.4 months with bortezomib (Richardson 2007 , Dimopoulos 2016 ) and median OS is approximately 29.8 months (Richardson 2007 ). Second -line combination therapies have a significant burden of toxicity with extended sequelae, representing significant unmet medical need. Peripheral n europathy, in p articular, has an extended long -term burden fo r patients. 4.2. Selinexor A summary of the relevant background information for selinexor, including the mechanism of action, nonclinical and clinical studies , and potential risks is presented below. Please refer to the Selinexor Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more detailed information. 4.2.1. Selinexor Mechanism of Action Selinexor is an oral, first -in-class, slowly reversible, potent selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE ) compound that specifically blocks exportin 1 ( XPO1 ). Selinexor binds covalently to cysteine 528 in the cargo binding pocket of XPO1 and shuts down its nuclear export activity (Neggers 2016 , Neggers 2015 , Hing 2016 ). This results in marked nuclear accumulation of TSPs"
36,page_36,"Investigational Product (KPT -330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 36 Version 4.0 and their functional reactivation as well as abrupt reduction of eIF4E transcriptionally -dependent proto oncogene proteins. Activation of TSPs and downregulation of proto -oncogenes block the cell divisio n cycle and induce apoptosis across a range of solid and hematologic tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, while sparing normal cells. 4.2.2. Selinexor Pharmacodynamics and Dosing Frequency Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that SINE compound binding to XPO1 resu lts in a rapid and sustained loss of XPO1 protein expression and nuclear export function with a reciprocal induction of XPO1 mRNA (Ranganathan 2012 , Tai 2014 , Zhang 2013 ). Furthermore, by determining the time course and dose dependence of XPO1 target binding by selinexor, it has been demonstrated that selinexor target occupancy correlates with inhibition of XPO1 function (Crochiere 2016 ). These studies demonstrated that significant XPO1 inhibition is sustained for up to 72 hours following a single dose of selinexor, with the level of XPO1 mRNA induction and the duration of XPO1 inhibition varying with the dose. T his long pharmacodynamic ( PDn) half-life for selinexor supports once weekly ( QW) to twice weekly ( BIW ) dosing for doses in the range of 60 to 100 mg. The PDn of the selinexor effect on XPO1 mRNA in leukocytes from adult and pediatric patients in solid tumor and hematological cancer studies has been evaluated. XPO1 mRNA expression is significantly induced by 2 hours post -selinexor dose and reaches a plateau of approximately 4 - to 6-fold, which is sustained for at least 48 hours (Abdul Razak 2016 , Alexander 2016 ). Predose XPO1 mRNA expression is maintained at a level comparable to the fold induction achieved following the first dose, indicating that the maximal XPO1 inhibition in leukocytes following the first dose is maintained throughout the dosing schedule. 4.2.3. Selinexor Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics ( PK) of selinexor has been investigated in 3 completed Phase 1 studies in patients with hematological and solid tumor malignan cies as described. Overall, PK parameters were similar in all 3 Phase 1 studies including patients with advanced hematol ogic malignancies (Study KCP -330-001), advanced solid tumors ( Study KCP -330-002), and advanced soft tissue or bone sarcomas ( Study KCP -330-003). Selinexor is orally bioavailable in patients with hematological and solid tumor malignancies. The absorption is moderately rapid with a median time to peak plasma concentration (t max) of 2 to 4 hours. In dose escalation studies in patients with he matological and solid tumor malignancies (KCP -330-001 and KCP -330-002), selinexor exhibited linear PK, and dose -proportional exposure ( area under the concentration versus time curve [ AUC ] and maximum plasma concentration [Cmax]). At the therapeutic dose of 80 mg (~45 mg/m2), the mean Cmax was 680 ng/mL (1.5 μM) and AUC 0-∞was 5386 ng•hr/mL. Moreover, the consistent tmax and elimination (terminal) half -life ( t½) across the range of doses evaluated (3 to 85 mg/m2) suggest overall dose -independent absorption and clearance. PK analyses support the use of fixed, rather than body surface area (BSA) -based, dosing for selinexor. Pooled analyses of data from Studies KCP -330-001, -002, and -003, indicated that BSA -adjusted dosing of selinexor did not reduce interpati ent variability. Additionally, the impact of body weight - or BSA -normalized dosing regimens were evaluated in a population PK analysis. The population PK analysis confirmed the original observation that plasma selinexor"
37,page_37,"Investigational Product (KPT -330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 37 Version 4.0 exposure was generally not affected by BSA within each dose category (low dose of <30 mg/m2; mid-dose of 30 to 55 mg/m2, and a high dose of >55 mg/m2), with the exception of the lowest end of the low -dose category. These results suggest that there is limited value to adjusting patient dose by BSA or weight and therefore support fixed -dose administration. 4.2.4. Selinexor Metabolism/Drug -drug Interactions Metabolism data suggest that clinically relevant inhibition of the major CYP450s by selinexor is unlikely in the clinical setting an d no induction of CYP450 activity has been observed. In human plasma, the primary route of metabolism is via glucuronidation and subsequent hepatobiliary elimination. Given the route of metabolism and elimination of selinexor, the rapid onset of target inhibition, and the long PDn half -life, selinexor PD n are not expected to be impacted by co-administration of other drugs. Selinexor is not expected to alter exposures of other drugs. Across clinical studies of selinexor in >2500 patients with advanced cance rs treated with selinexor alone or in combination to date , no significant drug-drug interactions have been reported. In population PK analyses, the exposures to selinexor were not altered in the presence of any of the major human CYP modifiers, including C YP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Patients also received comedications which are inhibitors of CYP2C9/19 (eg, fluconazole), CYP2D6 (eg, bupropion, paroxetine, terbinafine), and CYP1A2 (eg, ciprofloxacin). No overt differences in PK leading to adverse events ( AEs) were observed for selinexor and no major changes in the AE profile of these (or other concomitant) drugs were reported. Selinexor does not accumulate over time, thus further minimizing its potential for drug-drug interactions . Additional PK analysis wi ll be conducted to evaluate the impact of coadministration of anticancer agents, including bortezomib, on the selinexor population PK model. 4.2.5. Selinexor Nonclinical Combination with Dexamethasone and Proteasome Inhibitors In nonclinical models, the combination of SINE compounds with dexamethasone demonstrates synergistic anti -myeloma effects. This synergism emanates from at least 2 effects of the drug combination . The first is the induction of total of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein levels and the second is through the direct suppression of the mTOR pathway by the drug combination (Argueta 2018 ). Nonclinical studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that selinexor strongly synergi zes with PIs such as bortezomib (Turner 2013 , Turner 2016 , Tai 2014 , Wu 2016 ) and carfilzomib (Kandarpa 2013 , Rosebeck 2016 ) leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of MM cell death. The mechanism for the synergy includes (a) nuclear Iκ B retention and inhib ition of NF -κB trans criptional activity (Kashyap 2016 , Turner 2016 ), (b) enhanced nuclear localizati on and activation of TSP levels (Turner 2013 , Wu 2016 ) and (c) induction of autophagy (Kandarpa 2013 , Rosebeck 2016 ). Moreover, as demonstrated by Turner (Turner 2016 ), in models of bortezomib resistant disease (refractory patient MM cells; rodent PI inhibitor resistant xenograft models), combining selinexor and bortezomib induced synergistic apoptotic cell death, tumor grow th inhibition , and in creased survival. Importantly, bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from patients with myeloma re fractory to PIs are sensitized by selinexor to bortezomib and carfilzomib ex vivo, as shown by increased"
38,page_38,"Investigational Product (KPT -330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 38 Version 4.0 induction of apoptosis by the c ombination with no increased effect on normal non -myeloma cells (Turner 2016 ). These findings mirror the clinical findings that combination treatment of selinexor and PIs can result in durable responses in pat ients with MM , including those whose disease is refractory to PIs. 4.2.6. Overall Clinical Experience with Selinexor To date, more than 2500 patients with hematologic or solid tumors have received selinexor in clinic al studies (including Karyopharm -sponsored studies a nd Investigator -sponsored studies ) in >10 disease indications, the majority of patients were treated with selinexor as a sing le agent but >300 patients received selinexor in combination with a diverse array of other anticancer agents. Single -agent Phase 1 studies with oral selinexor have been conducted in advanced hematological malignancies including MM, ac ute myeloid leukemia (AML), NHL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (KCP -330-001); in solid tumors (KCP -330-002); and in soft tissue and bone sarc omas (KCP -330-003). Broad antitumor activity has been observed in all of these studies. In addition, Phase 2 studies are ongoing in MM, AML, diffu se large B -cell lymphoma , glioblastoma, gynecological malignancies, and dedi fferentiated liposarcoma (Phase 2 and 3). In Studies (KCP -330-001 and KCP -330-012) alone, 227 patients with MM have been expos ed to selinexor ± dexamethasone: •Results of the Phase 1 Study KCP -330-001 indicate that selinexor ± low-dose dexamethasone (20 mg QW) has clear anti -MM activity in heavily pretreated patients . •In Part 2 of the ongoing pivotal Phase 2 Study KCP -330-012 (STORM), treatment with selinexor 80 mg with dexamethasone 20 mg (Sd), both orally twice per week, resulted in an ORR o f 25.4% and a CBR (patients with ≥MR) of 39.3% in patients entering the study with rapidly progressive disease refractory to currently available MM therapies with known clinical benefit (ie, penta-exposed, triple class-refractory MM) . Median duration of response was 4.4 months. The median OS in the patients with any response (≥MR; n=39) was significantly longe r than those wit h a best response of PD/NE (p<0.0001), and was even longer in patients with a best response of S D (39.3% of patients) compared with patients who had PD/NE. Despit e the highly aggressive nature of the MM in the patients, the Sd regimen was able to halt MM disease progression (SD or better) in ~80% of the patients entering the study (Study KCP-330-012 CSR) . Selinexor is also being studied in combination with PIs ( ie, bortezomib and carfi lzomib) : •Preliminary results of Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP ; NCT02343042 ) in patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM have shown that adding selinexor to subcutaneous (SC) bortezomib and oral dexamethasone (SVd regimen) resulted in improved response rates ( Section 4.2.6.1 ). •Final results of a Phase 1 investigator -sponsored study ( IST; NCT02199665 ) evaluating the combination of selinexor with carfilzomib a nd low -dose dexamethasone in patients with RRMM demonstrate encouraging activity (Jakubowiak 2016 ). The ORR for 19 patients with heavily pretreated MM was 63%."

Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP) Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP) is an ongoing Phase 1b /2 study of selinexor in combination with multiple backbone therapies for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory MM. The study is designed to independently assess the efficacy and safety of multiple regimens (with selinexor dose escalations within each arm) , including selinexor and low -dose dexamethasone plus either bortezomib (SVd), pomalidom ide (SPd), or lenalidomide . As of the data cut off of 05 J une 2018, 40 patients treated with SVd were evaluable for re sponse. Best responses based on interim u naudited data are provided in Table 12. Preliminary results include the following (Bahlis 2017 ): • The high ORR rate of 83% in patients with PI-relapsed or PI -naïve MM treated with ≤3 prior therapies treated with SVd and the PFS of 17.8 months in patients with PI-relapsed or PI -naïve MM treated with SVd support th is BOSTON study evaluating SVd vs. Vd. • The ORR of 84% in pati ents with PI -relapsed or naïve MM treated with SVd is higher than the expected ORR ≤65% with Vd alone. • The ORR of 43% in patients with PI -refractory MM treated with SVd support s the nonclinical findings that selinexor resensitizes and overcomes resistance to PIs (Section 4.2.5 ). • An ORR of 83% in PI -relapsed or naïve patients with ≤3 prior treatments (ie, the “BOSTON” Phase 3 population ). • Responses on SVd were rapid and typically occur red within 1 cycle of treatment, often improving over time .

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 40 Version 4.0 The m aximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) was not reached and prolonged tolerability and efficacy were observed in the SVd cohort . The most common treatment -related AEs in the SVd Arm were nausea , anorexia , fatigue, and diarrhea, all mainly Grades 1 -2, and thrombocytopenia with minimal bleeding . Peripheral neuropathy (all cases unrelated to selin exor) was limited to 6 patients (Grade 1: 4 patients, Grade 2: 2 p atients) of which 5 had prior bortezomib exposure. This incidence rate is consistent with the published data cited in the literature (discussed below) for QW bortezomib dosing. Based on the results from the dose escalation phase, the recommended Phase 2 do se (RP2D) is a 5-week cycle with selinexor 100 mg QW continuous, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 SC QW for Weeks 1 through 4, and dexamethasone 20 mg on D ays 1 and 2 BIW continuous. An expansion phase at the RP2D is currently ongoing with preliminary tolerability and efficacy results consistent with above findings. Of note, the QW recommended regimen of SVd in STOMP uses 40% less bortezomib and 25% less dexamethasone com pared with standard BIW (for 2 of every 3 weeks) Vd regimens, and consequently is expected to have significantly less peripheral neuropathy and other significant AEs than standard Vd , as well as to be more convenient for patients than standard Vd and the majority of V d combinati ons, which require BIW clinic visits for SC (or intravenous [ IV]) administration of bortezomib (Richardson 2007 , Dimopoulos 2016 , Palumbo 2016 , Bringhen 2010 ). These preliminary results appear to confirm the nonclinical data supporting the additive or synergistic effects of selinexor in combination with PIs (Section 4.2.5 ), with good tolerability , and support this BOSTON study of SVd versus Vd . 4.2.7. Potential Risks of Selinexor At the time of the most recent Selinexor IB update, c linical experience with selinexor had been evaluated in 1672 patients (as of the 31 Ma rch 2018 safety data analysis) . In ongoing clinical studies, the most common ly reported TEAEs have been low-grade and reversible, including nausea, fatigue, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea; thrombocytopenia and anemia, which can be higher grade, have been also reported primarily in patients with hematologic malignancies. In a previous study, 1 patient, heavily pretreated for recurrent pancreatic cancer, developed acute cerebellar syndrome following 3 doses of selinexor at 85 mg/m2 (approximately 145 mg) BSA BIW . The pati ent experienced abnormal speech and loss of coordination, and was unable to walk. This patient recover ed to near baseline with both speech and mobility over ~6 weeks. No other adult patients have reported similar symptoms to date. Eight tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) cases have been reported , including 5 patients wit h MM, 1 patient with AML , and 2 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ; as of the date of this amendment ), including 4 patients in company -sponsored studies, 2 patients in Investigator - sponsored studies, and 2 patients in the expanded access program (c ompassionate use). Further details about these patients are provided in Section 12.1.2.3.1 ."

Reproductive Risks for Selinexor Macroscopic and microscopic changes in reproductive organs were noted during rat and monkey toxicology studies, most of which partially or fully resolved during the recovery period. The long-term effects of these changes on reproductive potential are unknown. Secondary developmental effects due to reduced maternal body weights were also noted during a study o n rat embryo/fetal development. It is unknown whether similar effects may occur in humans. As it is unknown whether selinexor might have reproductive toxicity in human s, patients must agree to use effective contraception (see Contraception Requirements, Section 10.8.1 ) during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study treatment. 4.3. Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (Vd) Bortezomib, a m odified dipeptidyl boronic acid , is a reversible inhibitor of the mammalian proteasome, demonstrating rapid inhibition of 20S proteasome activity in peripheral blood following drug administration (Velcade® Prescribing Information). Bortezomib systemic exposur e is equivalent following either SC or IV administration; plasma concentrations show multi-exponential decline with a rapid initial phase followed by a prolonged terminal phase and extensive peri pheral tissue distribution. Peak PDn activit y is achieved within 5 t o 30 minutes postdose and declines slowly over the dosing interval with 22 to 48% inhibition of 20S activity observed a t 48 hours postdose (Moreau 2012, Reece 2011) . B ortezomib is cytot oxic to a variety of cancer cell types and causes a delay in tumor growth in nonclinica l tumor models, including MM. In the USA, Canada, and Europe, bortezomib (a first -in-class PI) is approved for the treatment of both newly diagnos ed and relapsed MM. In RR MM, bortezomib is given with low-dose dexamethasone as a standard treatment worldwide. SC administration of bortezomib showed comparable efficacy to IV administration with lower rates of al l AEs, in particular high-grade peripheral neuropathy (Richardson 2003 , Richardson 2005 , Moreau 2011 ). SC BIW bortezomib with low -dose dexamethasone (Vd) represent s a standard, approved therapy for early relapsed MM despite recent approvals of new MM therapies. The safety and efficacy prof iles of Vd have been extensively documented in multiple randomized, controlled studies. Further more , the well -established dose a nd combinability of the Vd control arm have supported its use in multiple recent ( NCT02136134 and NCT01568866 ) and ongoing ( NCT01734928 and NCT02755597 ) pivotal myel oma studies. Please refer to the full prescribing information for bortezomib (different local/regional trade names may be used) for the most current clinical experience and safety a nd reproductive risk information . 4.4. Study and Dose Rationale 4.4.1. Study Rationale This Phase 3 study of SVd versus Vd in patients with RRMM , who have received 1 to 3 prior anti-MM regimens, is based on preliminary supportive safety and efficacy data from patients with relapsed MM treated with SVd in the Phase 1b/2 Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP )"

Cross over of patients on the control arm (Vd Arm), which is a commonly used backbone therapy for patients with RRMM throughout the world ( Section 4.3), to SVd X follo wing Independent Review Committee (IRC)-confirmed progressive disease ( PD) will allow for direct asses sment of selinexor’s ability to restore sensitivity in PI -resistant MM (Section 4.2.5 ). Crossover from the Vd Arm to SdX will be allowed, following IRC -confirmed PD, as compassionate use for patients who are not able to tolerate continued treatment with bortezomib (Section 6.2). 4.4.2. Dose Rationale The rationale for the proposed dosing regimen used in this BOSTON study is based on the totality of clinical s afety, efficacy, PK , and PDn data from Company - and Investigator -sponsored studies of selinexor and is supported by nonc linical pharmacology data for selinexor and other SINE compounds. The QW regimen of oral selinex or (100 mg), SC bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2), and oral dexamethasone (20 mg) , which is the RP2D in Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP), enables sustained concomitant inhibition of nuclear export and proteasome activity while limiting treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) such as fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral neuropathy. The high rate of response, good safety and tolerability profile, and reduced treatment burden on patients observed with this dose regimen in Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP ) support its prospective investigation in the BOSTON study. This dose regimen is supported by the following findings: • Selinexor synergistically sensitized MM cells to the cytot oxic effects of PIs in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo while not affecting peripheral blood or non -myeloma bone marrow mononuclear cells (Section 4.2.5 ). • Data from patients enrolled in Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP) demonstrate that the combination of QW bortezomib with selinexor and low -dose dexamethasone has very high levels of anti -myeloma activity with relatively low AE rates, even in patients with PI-refractory disease ( Section 4.2.6.1 ). • The use of QW bortezomib is associated with relatively low levels of peripheral neuropathy even with extended dosing and reduced treatment burden on patients with only 1 clinic visit per week (Section 4.2.6.1 ). Moreover, when used in combination in clinical studies , QW bortezomib shows similar activity and superior tolerabili ty to BIW combination regimens ( Section 4.4.2.1 ). • As QW dosing of selinexor and bortezomib aligns the long PDn half-lives of both agents (Section 4.2.2 and Section 4.3 at their respective targets and limits effects on maturation of immune cell subsets, QW dosing is associated with low level cytopenias."

Bortezomib QW Dose Rationale The QW dose schedule provi des for a considerable reduction (~40%) in overall bortezomib dose versus the control arm (Vd Arm) that, in addition to the relatively low dose of selinexor, may be associated with better tolerability ( eg, reduced peripheral neuropathy) compared with curre nt second -line Vd and Vd -based combination regimens. Varying the dose regimen of bortezomib from QW to BIW was explored in 3 patients in the Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP) . Following DLT clearance in 4 patients at the dose level of selinexor 80 mg QW and bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 QW, 3 patients were treated with selinexor 80 mg QW and bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 BIW. All patients had MM that was refractory to a PI therapy. Responses were early and occurred within 1 month of treatment initiation. Response rates and dur ation on study were similar between these 2 dose groups (bortezomib QW [1 VGPR, 1 PR, 1 minimal response ( MR), 1 PD] versus bortezomib BIW [2 PRs, 1 MR, 1 PD]) and also in comparison with the ORR for all SVd treated patients. However, all patients on BIW bortezomib were dose reduced to QW bortezomib following Cycle 1 due to increased fatigue or cytopenias. Other clinical studies have also compared bortezo mib combinations that utilize QW versus BIW bortezomib doses and have shown similar response rates betwe en the 2 arms with improved tolerability in the QW dose group (Bringhen 2010 , Mateos 2014 , Reeder 2010 ). Based on these results, the efficacy and tolerability of the SVd regimen using QW bortezomib has been demonstrated to be optimal. Furthermore, the expected response rate of Vd regimen in patients with 1-3 prior therapies is approximately 60% (Palumbo 2016 ). Results from the ongoing Study KCP -330-017 (STOMP) for SVd in PI -relapsed or naive MM are promising with an ORR of 84%."

The study overview is presented in Figure 1. Approximately 364 patie nts will be randomized from up to 120 global investigative sites. Patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (SVd or Vd) in a 1:1 allocation, a s follows: •SVd Arm (~182 patients): selinexor + bortezomib (QW) + dexamethasone •Vd Arm (~182 patients): bortezomib (BIW) + dexamethasone Randomization (Section 8.2) will be stratified based on: •Prior PI therapies (Yes or No) •Number of pri or anti -MM regimens (1 versus > 1) •R-ISS stage at study entry, based on screening results (R-ISS Stage III versus R -ISS Stage I or II ) (Palumbo 2015 ). If data for chromosomal abnormalities (CA) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) required for R -ISS staging are not available, patients will be assigned to the R -ISS category corresponding to their ISS stage. It is planned to randomize patients within individual countries in a 1:1 allocation to SVd:Vd. The number of patients enrolled may be adjusted based on the results of the interim analysis ( IA) for sample size re -estimation (first IA) . Patients in the Vd Arm who have PD that is confirme d by the IRC will be allowed to cross over to a regim en that includes selinexor: 1) SVd treatment (SVdX) for patients who are able to tolerate continued bortezomib, or 2) SdX for patients who have significant tolerability issues with bortezomib, following the process described in Section 6.2. Patients who cross over will b e referred to as SVdX patients or SdX patients, respectively (Section 6.2). The Schedule of Assessments is provided in Table 2. Patients will have in -clinic vis its for dosing of study treatment during MM evaluations (Table 13) and telephone contacts ( Section 11.7.3 )."

Investigators will assess PD according to the IMWG criteria includi ng repeat testing if PD is based on serum and/or urine M -protein, quantitative immunoglobulins for IgA/IgD, or serum free light chain ( FLC). PD may a lso be based on new or enlarging plasmacytoma(s) or bone les ion(s) or on other symptoms and signs of clinical progression that meet the IMWG criteria. 2. All cases of PD must be confirmed by the IRC prior to crossover. 3. Crossover will not be permitted based purely on I nvestigator -assessed progression that does not meet any IMWG criteria for PD and cannot be verified by IRC ( eg, deteriorating performance status) . 4. Crossover will not be permitted if dosing of bortezomib is terminated before PD is confirmed by the IRC, unless termination of bortezomib is due to significant toxicities such as peripheral neuropathy, and all treatment measures addressing these toxicities are exhausted and documented prior to bortezomib termination. Early termination of bortezomib should be discussed and approved by the Sponsor M edical Monitor in order to allow crossover to SdX after progression is confirmed by the IRC ."

Data Safety Monitoring Board An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be set up for the study to review safety data for this study. The DSMB is made up of a group of individuals with pertinent expertise that reviews, on a predetermined schedule, safety data from this cl inical study. It is the DSMB's responsibility to weigh risks and benefits throughout the study's duration. The DSMB will provide oversight and safety monitoring of the study in compliance with applicable regulations, legislation and associated guidance mat erials for the nature of the study. As appropriate, the DSMB will provide recommendations to the Sponsor regarding continuation, modification, or discontinuation of the study based on its assessment of the reviewed safety data. This DSMB will be composed of 4 voting members ( 3 oncologists and an independent statistician) who will review safety data from the study. The DSMB membershi p, functioning, and procedures are described in the DSMB charter. 6.4. Independent Review Committee An IRC will be formed to review MM disease assessment data for this study, to independently assess disease response and time of PD. PD based on site generated MM disease assessment data must be confirmed by the IRC prior to discontinuing treatment from either arm (unless medically contraindicated). PD as a result of plasmacytoma(s) or bone lesion(s) will be reviewed by the IRC and results will be compared with baseline assessments. IRC confirmation of PD is required for all patients and, for those patients in the Vd Arm, confirmation is required prior to initiation of SVd X/SdX treatment in the crossover (Section 6.2). The IRC will review data (generated by the local and central laboratory) that will be used for the final analysis of the primary endpoint. The IRC’s assessments of PFS will be used as the basis for the evaluation of the primary endpoint. The IRC membership, functioning, and procedures (including resolution of any disagreements with Investigators regarding MM disease asses sments) are described in the IRC charter."

REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION 8.1. Screening and Registration The Screening period will start once a patient has provided written informed consent to participate in the study and ends on the day of study entry (C1D1). Patient enrollment information will be provided by the site to Karyopharm for evaluatio n and approval. U pon confirmation of key eligibility criteria , Karyopharm will approve enrollment of the patient. After approval by Karyopharm, the patient may be randomized . See Section 8.2 for randomization procedures. 8.1.1. Study Patient Number Each patient will be assigned a unique patient number and will keep this number for the duration of the study. Patient numbers will not be reassigned or reused for any reason. Patients will be identified to the Sponsor by their assigned number, date of birth, and sex. The Investigator must maintain a patient master log. 8.1.2. Rescreening Rescreening is permitted in this study. If a patient fails any of the inclusion or exclusion criteria, a patient may be rescreened after a suitable period of time (the exact length is dependent upon the reason for the screen failure) per the documented agreement of Karyopharm and the Investigator. Any patient who is rescreened must be r econsented and will retain the same patient number. A patient may only fail screening once. 8.1.3. Screen Failures A Screen Failure is defined as any patient who signs the informed consent form ( ICF) but who is not randomized into the study. The reason for not ra ndomizing the patient will be entered i n the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). The demographic information, informed consent, and inclusion/exclusion pages must also be completed for screen failure patients. No other data will be entered into the clinica l database for patients who are screen failures, u nless the patient experiences a serious adverse event ( SAE ) during the Screening period. 8.1.4. Replacement of Patients Patients who withdraw from the study without completing at least 1 cycle due to reasons that are unrelated to study treatment and/or disease state may be replaced. 8.2. Rando mization to Study Treatment An Interactive Response Technology system will be used to perform treatment randomization. Patients will be randomized to a treatment arm in a block of randomization codes that have been assigned to the patient’s country and stratum. Randomization will be performed prior to dosing. Randomization will be stratified based on the following stratification factors and will maintain the 1:1 all ocation between treatment arms (SVd, Vd) within each of the stratification categories:"

Early Termination of the Study The study may be discontinued at the sole discretion of the Sponsor for any reason, including medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study, or difficulties in the recruitment of patients. If this occurs, the Sponsor will notify ethics committees ( eg, Institution al Review Boards [IRBs]), Investigators, and regulatory authorities. The Sponsor will ensure that any patients receiving study treatment at the time of early termination of the study will be given the opportunity to continue study treatment under a separat e treatment protocol ( eg, maintenance or extension protocol). The patients will be followed for safety and antitumor responses by the clinical site Investigators as defined in the new treatment protocol. 9.2. Discontinuation of Study Treatment and/or Withdrawa l of Patients from the Study The Investigator may remove a patient from study treatment after consultation with the Sponsor for any of the following reasons: • Unacceptable AEs or toxicity that cannot be managed by supportive care (this must be linked in the study database to the AE or toxicity ev ent to support discontinuation) • Any medically appropriate reason or significant protocol violation, in the opinion of the Investigator The Investigator must remove a patient from study treatment for any of the follow ing reasons: • IRC-confirmed PD. Patients in the Vd Arm who have IRC -confirmed PD and are able to tolerate continued bortezomib treatment may cross over to SVd X and continue treatment until the they have IRC -confirmed PD during SVd X treatment if they meet the criteria in Section 6.2. Patients in the Vd Arm who have IRC -confirmed PD and who have significant tolerability issues with bortezomib may cross over to SdX treatment and continue treatment until the they have IRC -confirmed PD during SdX treatment if they meet the criteria in Section 6.2. • Patient elects to discontinue study treatment • Pregnancy Patients may discontinue study treatment for any reason. Patients who choose to d iscontinue study treatment should be encouraged to continue in the study so that follow -up in formation on PD and survival status may be obtained. Patients who do not have IRC-confirmed PD while receiving study treatment but are discontinued from study trea tment for other reasons will be followed for survival. Patients may elect to withdraw consent and decline further participation in the study at any time. Patients who withdraw consent must be withdrawn from the study. The reason for the patient’s discontin uation of study treatment/withdrawal f rom the study must be recorded i n the eCRF. The reason for discontinuation must be clearly documented in the study"

Alternative treatment may be provided if the patient does not tolerate 5 -HT3 antagon ists. 10.3.2. Recommended Supportive Care Supportive measures for optimal medical care should be pr ovided to all patients in both a rms during participation in this study. In addition to the required prophylactic therapy with 5 -HT3 antagonists ( Section 10.3.1 ), supportive care per institutional guidelines and/or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN ) Clinical Prac tice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN ) should be used as clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator. Supportive care guidelines for managing AEs are provided in Table 16. 10.3.3. Infection No prophylactic antimicrobial agent is recommended for most patients initiating therapy with selinexor. Patients with a history of recurrent infections or those at high risk for specific infections may continue their prophylactic antimicrobial regimens without modification when initiating selinexor therapy. In patients who develop fever or other signs of systemic infection, an appropriate antimicrobial should be initiated immediately. Selinexor should be suspended in any patient with a Grade 4 infection or sepsis (even in the absence of documented infection) until the patient’s clinical condition is stabilized. Selinexor can then be restarted at the previous dose once the patient’s clinical status has sta bilized, even in the setting of continued IV (and/or oral) antimicrobial agents. Selinexor is not known to have any drug interactions with standard antimicrobials . Please also see Table 16. 10.3.4. Glucocorticoid Side Effects The management of common glucocorticoid side effects is well documented. Aggressive use of proton -pump inhibitors, anti -hypertensives, glucose -lowering drugs , and other agents is strongly encouraged in order to maintain the use of dexamethasone in combination with selinexor in this study. Patients with documented osteopenia or osteoporosis should continue to take dexamethasone with selinexor as indicated in the study. Standard precautions suc h as use of bisphosphonates should be instituted unless contraindicated. 10.3.5. Overdose As selinexor is metabolized by glutathione ( GSH ) conjugation, it is possible, but not demonstrated, that hepatic GSH depletion might occur in case of extreme overdose. Theref ore, in patients who develop liver function test abnormalities, supportive measures such as SAM or other drugs that can replace GSH might be considered as part of the overall management plan. 10.4. Dose Modifications All dose modifications will be captured in th e eCRF."

Selinexor Dose Reduction Guidelines Selinexor, a specific XPO1 inhibitor, alters a variety of tumor suppressors, cell cycle regulators, oncoproteins, and transcriptional factors. Given this complex mechanism, the relationship between dose and antit umor activity, as well as tolerability, is expected to be highly dependent on both tumoral and patient factors. Consistent with this, based on observations from the ongoing studies in patients with advanced hematological and solid tumors , selinexor shows a wide therapeutic range wit h antitumor activity from 12 to 120 mg. Therefore, in order to optimize the antitumor activity and tolerability, dose reductions and/or schedule modifications will be allowed as outlined below and in Table 15 and Table 16. For some AEs, dose interruption ra ther than reduction is recommended. See Table 16 for specific recommendations. While drug -related major organ toxicities are not prominent , thrombocytop enia and a number of constitutional side effects can limit dosing with selinexor. Therefore, patients should also be treated with supportive care to reduce toxicities (see Section 10.3). In addition, it should be noted that the constitutional side effects o ften attenuate over the first 4 to 6 weeks of dosing . Finally, some patients with rapid tumor responses experience sign ificant fatigue, nausea, ma laise, and/or asthenia after 1 or more doses of selinexor. This effect has not been associated with typical markers of TLS, but if suspected, assessment of tumor response is strongly recommended in order to better inform treatmen t recommendations. The NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 will be used for grading the severity of AEs; the study treatment modifications described below are applied according to this severity grading. Toxicity will be documented as described in Section 12.1.3 . If more than 1 type of toxicity occurs concurrently, the most severe grade will determine the modification. Each dose modification or treatment delay, as well a s the reason, must be documented ( Table 15 and Table 16). Table 15 summarizes the starting dose for selinexor (100 mg ), the allowed escalation (60 mg BIW ), and the preferred dose modifications (80 to 40 mg ) for AEs listed in Table 16.

Abbreviations: IV = intravenous; LDH = lactate dehydrogenase; NCCN = National Comprehensive Cancer Network; QD = once daily; PO = oral; SC = subcutaneous: TLS = tumor lysis syndrome. a For all Grade ≥3 hematologic or non -hematologic AEs that are NOT selinexor related, after consultation with the Medical Monitor and at t he discretion of the Investigator, selinexor dosing may be maintained. b For all selinexor -related AE’s, if the below prescribed dose reductions/interruptions result in a stabilization of ≥4 week s, a re -escalation may be considered after approval from the Medical Monitor. All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. Note: When toxicities due to selinexor have returned to baseline levels or the patient has stabilized, the dose of selinexor may be re -escalated in consultation with the Medical Monitor. Additional recommendations for supportive care to help manage selinexor -related AEs are provided in Section 10.3.2 . The possibility of overlapping toxicities with bortezomib and/or dexamethasone should be considered and it is strongly recommended that the Investigator dose reduces or interrupts 1 drug at a time (see Section 10.4.2 ). 10.4.1.1. Selinexor Dose Adjustment in the Setting of Infection Patients with active uncontrolled or suspected infections should have treatment withheld until the infection has clinically resolved and/or the patient is clinically stable .

Determination of liver versus bone etiology should be made, and evaluation of gamma -glutamyl transferase, 5'-nucleotidase, or other liver enzymes should be performed. 10.4.2. Dose Modifications for Overlapping Toxicities Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are potential overlapping toxicities for selinexor wit h bortezomib. If a patient experiences drug -induced thrombocytopenia and/or neutropenia while receiving the combination under investigation in this study, the Investigator should attempt to determine which drug may be responsible and treat appropriately, i ncluding dose modifications, as necessary. If, during the management of an AE for an individual patient receiving both selinexor and bortezomib, the Investigator suspects that bortezomib may be the cause of that event, the Investigator should discuss the c ase with the Medical Monitor. If the cause cannot be attributed to a single drug, it is strongly recommended that the Investigator dose reduces or interrupts 1 drug at a time. Please refer to Table 16 for AEs presu med to be related to selinexor. The manufacturers of bortezomib have provided dose adjustment guidelines for managing Grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that occur during treatment wi th bortezomib in the prescribing information . 10.4.3. Borte zomib Dose Modifications In the event of bortezomib -related peripheral neuropathy (Grade 1 with pain or Grade 2 [moderate symptoms; limiting instrumental activities of daily living]), during treatment with 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib BIW, change treatment schedule to 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib QW. For all other bortezomib -related events, the bortezomib dose may be adjusted during treatment according to the guidelines in the prescribing information for bortezomib (diff erent local/ regional trade names may be used) . 10.4.4. Dexamethasone Dose Modifications The dose of dexamethasone should preferably remain constant throughout the study. However, f or patients with partial intolerance to dexamethasone, a dose reduction to a minimum dose of 10 to 12 mg dexamethasone BIW (ie, a total minimum dose of 20 to 24 mg weekly ) is permitted after a clear documentation of intolerance. Any dose reductions should be documented in the patient’s research record and the eCRF. 10.5. Missed or Vomited Doses 10.5.1. Missed Dose s of Stu dy Treatments ( Selinexor, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone ) Missed doses of study treatments should be managed as follows: For doses missed for protocol - or study -related reasons (eg, due to recommendation of the Investigator, such as due to an AE): • Missed dose of bortezomib f or patients in the Vd Arm Only : If a bortezomib dose was missed, the schedule of that week shoul d be altered to accommodate 2 doses in that week wit h at least 72 hours between 2 consecutive doses of bortezomib ."

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 69 Version 4.0 • Missed dose of any study treatment for all patients: If a dose of any study treatment must be missed, the next dose will be taken as per schedule. All missed and delayed doses should be documented. For doses missed for reasons not related to the protocol/study (eg, a requir ed medical procedure or an unanticipated personal emergency): • If a patient missed a full 1 - or 2-week period of study treatment dosing for events that are not related to the protocol or the study the days missed will be replaced. For example, if a patient missed C2D7 to C2D14, then the patient will start the next dosing on C2D7 following the break. Similarly, if a patient misses C3D1 to C3D15, then the patient will start the next dosing on C3D1. The schedule of MM evaluations will be maintained regardless o f drug holidays or drug interruption s (Section 11.3.1 ). 10.5.2. Vomited Doses of Selinexor If a dose of selinexor is vomited within 1 hour of ingestion, it will be replaced. If vomiting occurs more than 1 hour after dosing, it will be considered a compl ete dose. 10.6. Sponsor -supplied Study Treatment Accountability The Investigator or designee must maintain an accurate record of receipt of ship ment an d dispensing of Sponsor -supplied study treatment in a drug accountability log. A ccountability for Sponsor -suppl ied study treatment will be documented throughout the study and reconciled. Patients will be aske d to r eturn all unused Sponsor -supplied study treatment and packaging on a regular basis, at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of selinexo r.

Source: Kumar, 2016 (Kumar 2016 ). a All response categories require 2 consecutive assessments made any time before starting any new therapy; for MRD there is no need for 2 consecutive assessments, but information on MRD after each treatment stage is recommended ( eg, after induction, high -dose therapy/ASCT, consolidation, maintenance). M RD tests should be initiated only at the time of suspected CR. All categories of response and MRD require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. However, radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements except for the requirement of FDG PET if imaging MRD -negative status is reported. b Per IMWG, quantitative Ig levels by nephelometry may be used in place of SPEP for routine M -protein measurement for patients with IgA or IgD myeloma. Also, per IMWG, response may be confirmed if the patient fails to provide 24 -hour urine sample collection after screening activities occur. See “Practical considerations for application of IMWG consensus criteria” section of the gu idelines (page e340 in Kumar [Kumar 2016] ). c Derived from international uniform response criteria for MM (Durie 2006 ). MR definition and clarifications derived from Rajkumar ( Rajkumar 2011 Rajkumar 2011Rajkumar 2011). When the only method to measure disease is by serum FLC levels: CR can be define d as a normal FLC rat io of 0.26 to 1.65 in addition to the CR criteria list ed previously. VGPR in such patients requires a ≥90% decrease in the difference betwee n involve d and uninvolved FLC l evels. All response categories require 2 consecutive assessm ents made at any time before the institution of any ne w therapy; all categories also require no known evide nce of progressive or new bone lesions or extramedullary plasmacytomas if radiographic studies we re performed. Radio graphic studies are not require d to satisfy t hese response requirements. Bone marrow assessment s do not nee d to be confirmed. Each category, except for SD, will be conside red unconfirm ed until t he confirmatory test is performed. The date of the initial test is considere d as the date of response for evaluation of time dependent outcomes such as DOR. d All recommendations regarding clinical uses relating to serum FLC levels or FLC ratio are based on results obtained with the validated Freelite test (Binding Site, Birmingham, United Kingdom). e Presence/absence of clonal cells on immunohistochemistry is based upon the κ/λ/L ratio. An abnormal κ/λ ratio by immunohistochemistry requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abn ormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λ of >4:1 or <1:2. f Plasmacytoma measurements should be taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI scans, or dedicated CT scans whe re applicable. For patients with only skin involvement, skin lesions should be measured with a ruler. Measurement of tumor size will be determined by the SPD. g Positive immunofixation alone in a patient previously classified as achieving a CR will not be considered progression. For purposes of calculating time -to-progression and PFS, patients who have achieved a CR and are MRD -negative should be evaluated using criteria listed for PD. Criteria fo r relapse from a CR or relapse from MRD should be used only when calculating disease -free survival. h In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per Investigator discretion ( eg, a possible laboratory error), that value will not be considered when determining the lo west value."

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 78 Version 4.0 Questions regarding interpretation of the IMWG criteria ( Table 17) may be addressed by consulting the, “Practical considerations for application of IMWG consensus criteria,” section of the guidelines (page e340 in Kumar (Kumar 2016 ). 11.3.1.1. SPEP SPEP with monoclonal protein band (M -spike) quantification and serum protein immunofixation will be perfo rmed to assess response. 11.3.1.2. UPEP UPEP (24 -hour urine) with M -spike quantification and urine protein immunofixation will be perfo rmed to assess response . UPEP must be determined from a urine sample collected for 24 hours – no other method is acceptable. UPEP must be performed at each time point outlined in the protocol even if the patient is being followed by SPEP. 11.3.1.3. Quantitative Immunoglobulin Levels If SPEP is felt to be unreliable for routine M -protein measurement ( eg, patients with IgA or IgD myeloma), then quantitative Ig levels by nephelometry is acceptable. However, this must be explicitly repor ted, and even though nephelometry can be used for the patient to assess response , SPEP and nephelometric values cannot be used interchangeably (Durie 2006 ). 11.3.1.4. Serum FLC Serum FLC will be perf ormed to assess response . For patients whose disease is only measurable by serum FLC: • CR requires negative serum and urine immunofixation plus a normal serum FLC ra tio of 0.26 to 1.65 on 2 consecutive assessments. Laboratories may use their own reference ranges. • VGPR requires >90% decrease in the difference between involved and u ninvolved serum FLC levels on 2 consecutive assessments. 11.3.1.5. β2 microglobulin β2 microglobulin will be performed for MM staging ( Table 14) and will not be used to assess response. 11.3.1.6. LDH Serum LDH will be performed for MM staging ( Table 14). 11.3.1.7. Skeletal Survey A baseline skeletal sur vey will be performed using X -rays and/or other clinically appropriate imaging modalities ( eg, magnetic resonance imaging ([MRI] , whole body computed tomography [CT], or positron emission tomography [PET]/CT) as d etermined by the Investigator."

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 79 Version 4.0 The skeletal survey should include a lateral radiograph of the skull, anterioposterior and lateral views of the spine, and anterioposterior views of the pelvis, ribs, femora, and humeri. If lytic bone lesions or plasmacytomas are observed at baseline, thei r number and size should be recorded in the eCRF. Bone lesions and/or plasmacytomas detected by imaging at baseline should be reassessed during the study, at a frequency determined by the Investigator, using the same imaging modality that was used at basel ine to document response. • For patients without soft tissue plasmacytomas ( ie, bone lesions only), skeletal survey by X -rays or low -dose CT should be performed. Contrast is not required. • For patients with soft tissue plasmacytoma s, skeletal survey by X -rays or low -dose CT should be performed (contrast not required) and in addition MRI or CT or PET/CT, usually requiring contrast enhancement, should be performed. Skeletal imaging does not need to be repeated in Cycle 1. Skeletal survey results will be read by the local laboratory . Refer to the Study Manual for details. 11.3.1.8. Clinical Plasmacytoma Assessment If plasmacytomas are detected at baseline by physical examination/palpation , they should be counted and measured p er IMWG guidelines and recorded, and then reas sessed as clinically indicated during the symptom -directed physical examinations. 11.3.1.9. Bone Marrow Aspirate A bone marrow aspira te will be collected at Screening and a portion will be provided to the central laboratory fo r karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to confirm diagnosis and classify cytogen etic MM subtypes for R -ISS staging . Another portion of the Screening bone marrow aspirate will be used to isolate plasma, non -tumor CD138 - and tumor CD138+ cell fractions for future PDn testing (see Section 11.4.2.1 ). Evaluation of cytogenetic alterations will include deletion of 17p [del(17p)], a translocation of chromosome [t(4;14)], a translocation of chromosome 14 and chromosome 16 [t(14;16)] , and chromosome 1q21 amplificat ion. A bone marrow aspirate is required at the time of response for the MRD test for patients in either arm who achieve CR or sCR, unless after consultation with the Medical Monitor the collection and/or processing of the sample is not considered to be feasible. A portion of the bone m arrow aspirate collected at the time of response will be provide d to the central laboratory. Refer to the Study Manual for details. MRD will be assessed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of bone marrow aspirates . MRD results will be quantitative: MRD positive = number of malignant clones per 100,000 leukocytes > 0; MRD negative = number of malignant clones per 100,000 leukocytes = 0. Bone marrow aspiration may also be performed, as clinically indicated, to assess progression."

Bone Marrow Core (Trephine) Biopsy At the time of response, a bone marrow core (trephine) biopsy is required to confi rm CR and sCR. A tissue block collected at the time of response for patients in ei ther a rm who achieve CR or sCR will be provided to the central laboratory. Refer to the Study Manual for details. A bone marrow core (trephine) biopsy may also be performed, as clinically indicated, to assess progression. 11.4. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Procedures 11.4.1. Pharmacokinetic Endpoints PK sampling will only be per formed at selected investigational sites that can accommodate patients for up to 4 hours. • PK sam pling for bortezomib will be performed for up to 25 patients in the Vd Arm . • PK sam pling for bortezomib and selinexor will be performed for up to 25 patients in the SVd Arm. Blood draws for PK analysis will be performed in accordance with Table 18. For the SVd Arm, selinexor should be dosed within 15 minutes prior to bortezomib on C2D15. Details of PK sample collection and processing can be found in the Study Manual . Plasma samples will be analyzed via validated methods for plasma bortezomib and selinexor concentrations. PK endpoints may include, but are not limited to, estimations of C max, AUC, and t max.

Pharmacodynamic Studies 11.4.2.1. Bone Marrow Aspirates for PDn Bone marrow aspirate will be collected at Screening to isolate plasma, non -tumor CD138 - and tumor CD138+ cell fractions for s ubsequent PDn studies. Studies may include transcriptomic, genomic and/or proteomic analyses to identify predictive biomarkers of selinexor response and to characterize the knowledge of selinexor ’s mechanism of action . In addition, tumor cells will be used to assess the presence of the high risk mutations including del(17p), t(14;16) and t(4;14) translocations and chromosome 1q21 amplification. Cytogenetic analysis by karyotyping and FISH will be performed at a central laboratory to identify specific chromo somal translocations at sites known to show rearrangements in MM. Aspirate samples containing patient DNA may be used for pharmacogenetic research to do the following: • study the causes of human diseases • help understand how different individuals respond t o drugs • obtain information to help develop new methods to diagnose and treat diseases The samples may be stored up to 15 years, depending on the laws of country where the study is conducted. The samples will be labeled with a code rather than with patient name or any other detail that could be used to identify the patient. These samples will be stored under the control of the Sponsor. Details of PDn sample collection and processing can be found in the Study Manual . 11.5. Safety Assessments Safety evaluations wil l be performed as described below. Refer to Table 2 for the timing of all safety assessments. 11.5.1. Clinical Safety Assessments 11.5.1.1. Weight, Height , and BSA Height (without shoes) in centimeters and weight (indoor clothing without shoes) in kilograms will be measured. BSA will be calculated by the Dubois (Dubois 1916 ) or Mosteller (Mosteller 1987 ) method to determine the volume of bortezomib to be admin istered and to ensure that an individua l patient's selinexor dose does not exceed 70 mg/m2. In no case may the selinexor dos e exceed 70 mg/m2 per dose for any patient . If the patient’s weight fluctuates substantially from baseline (ie, >20%) during treatment, BSA should b e recal culated. 11.5.1.2. Physical Examination, Vital Signs, and ECOG Performance Status Complete physical examinations should include general appearance, skin, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, and neurological examinations. Symptom -directed physical examinations should include body systems as appropriate , including the presence/absence or change in size of plasmacytomas identified at Screening . These examinations will be per formed according to the standards at each institution."
82,page_82,"Investigational Product (KPT -330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 82 Version 4.0 Information about the physical examinations must be present in the source documentation at the study site. Clinically relevant findings made after the start of study dosing, which meet the definition of an AE, must be recorded i n the AE eCRF. Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( BP), pulse measurements, and body temperature (°C or °F). Vital signs should be assessed predose on the scheduled visit day, if possible. BP and pulse rat e should be measured after the patient has been in a supine or sitting position for 5 minutes. BP should be assessed on the same arm throughout the study. Note: If the visit for MM disease assessments occurs on the same day as the in -clinic dosing visit, v ital signs should only be performed once. ECOG performance status assessments (Oken 1982 ) will be performed during the study to assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patients. 11.5.1.3. Electrocardiography A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed. Patients must rest for at least 5 minutes prior to the ECG recording. The Investigator will interpret the ECG using 1 of the following categories: normal, abnormal but not clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. The date and time the ECG was performed and the following parameters will be recorded in the eCRF: heart rate, P R interval, QT interval, QRS i nterval, and QT corrected using Fridericia's formula (Fridericia 1920 ). 11.5.1.4. Ophthalmic Examination An ophthalmic examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist is require d prior to the first dose of study treatment and should be repeated if clinically indicated during the study ( eg, monitoring of pre -existing cataracts, visual disturbances). Any p atient reporting de -novo or worsening of visual symptoms should immediately be referred for further examination. All visual symptoms must be documented in the eCRF. The ophthalmic examina tion is to include the following: • Prior to dilation: − best corrected visual acuity − slit lamp examination (for cataracts or other abnormalities) − tonometry • Following dilation: − fundoscopy − slit lamp examination to document lens clarity If a cataract/lens opa city is seen during the examination, the cataract/lens opacity will be graded according to the American Optometric Association (AOA) Cataract Grading System , which is available on the AOA website (www.aoa.org)."

SAFETY D EFINITIONS, R ECORDING, AND REPORTING Note: For urgent medical issues in which the study’s Medical Monitor should be contacted, please refer to the Study Manual for complete contact information. 12.1. Adverse Events 12.1.1. Definitions • Adverse event (AE) : Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not consider ed related to the study treatment. • Treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) : Any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study tr eatment. • Adverse event of special interest (AESI): Any AE (serious or nonserious) that is of scientific and medical concern specific to the study treatment, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor is appropr iate. • Serious adverse event (SAE): Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death; is life threatening ( ie, an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. (See Secti on 12.2.3 for additional information about SAE reporting.) 12.1.2. Recording of Adverse Events All AEs that begin or worsen after the patient has provided informed consent will be recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF, regardless of whether dosing with study drug has commenced. For events that are considered by the Investigator to be related to the st udy drug, the monitoring of the AE should be continued through the end of the study, for at least 30 days following the last dose of study drug, or until resolution. Adverse events (including laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be describ ed using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be recorded as a separate AE. The Investigator should ask the patient non -leading questio ns to determine if any AEs have occurred during the study, since the last study visit. Adverse events may also be recorded when they are volunteered by the patient, or through physical examination, laboratory tests, or other clinical assessments."
87,page_87,"Investigational Product (KPT -330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 87 Version 4.0 An AE sho uld be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity of the event, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the inter ventions required to treat the event, and the outcome. 12.1.2.1. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (ie, are considered to be clinically significant, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes in study treatment), should be recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF. Whenever possible, a diagnosis, rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, anemia instead of low hemoglobin). Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteri a for an AE should be followed until they have returned to baseline levels (as measured during the Screening visit) or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is identified. When an abnormal laboratory or test result corresponds to a sign/symptom of an already reported AE, it is not necessary to separately record the laboratory/test result as an additional event. A laboratory abnormality that does not meet the definition of an AE should not be reported as an AE. A Grade 3 or 4 event (considered to be sev ere per NCI CTCAE, v. 4.03) does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined in Section 12.1.1 and/or as p er the opinion of the Investigator. A laboratory abnormality that results in a dose being held or modified would, by definition, be an AE and must be recorded as such in the eCRFs. 12.1.2.2. Adverse Events of Special Interest AESIs for selinexor include cataracts and a cute cerebellar syndrome. All cases of cerebellar toxicity, Grade 3 or higher must be reported (see Section 12.2.3 ). 12.1.2.3. Other Adverse Events 12.1.2.3.1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome As of the date of this protocol, there have been 8 reports of TLS: 4 patients in Karyopharm - sponsored studies, 2 patients in Investigator -sponsored studies, and 2 patients in the expanded access program (compassionate use). Of the 8 patien ts, 5 had MM reported as their underlying cancer and 3 had hematological malignancies (including 1 AML and 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia). The event onset latency ranged from 3 to 8 days (median 4 days). The total selinexor dose prior to event onset range d from 40 to 320 mg (median 160 mg). The outcome was reported as recovered in 4 patients and not recovered in 2 patients; the outcome was not reported in 2 patients. The Investigators assessed 7 of the events as being related to selinexor. Of the 8 cases summarized above, there were 3 cases in which the patient died as a result of a TEAE. The cause of death in each of these cases was reported as: respiratory failure secondary to advanced MM, sepsis, and respiratory failure, chemotherapy induced cardiomyopat hy and acute lymph oblastic leukemia . No fatal outcomes due to TLS have been reported in any studies with selinexor, or in the ongoing EAP . Although the incidence of TLS is low (~0.3%), the causal relationship between selinexor treatment and TLS cannot be c ompletely excluded. Early recognition of signs"
88,page_88,"Investigational Product (KPT -330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 88 Version 4.0 and symptoms in patients at risk for TLS, including identification of abnormal clinical and laboratory values, is key and Investigators must ensure that patients being treated with selinexor maintain adequate caloric and fluid intake. Close monitoring and management of patients with hematological malignancies, including MM, for potential signs and symptoms of TLS are most relevant. See Section 10.3 for supportive care and Table 16 for selinexor dose modification guidance. 12.1.3. Adverse Event Severity The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself could be of relatively minor clinical signific ance (eg, ‘severe’ headache). This is not the same as a “serious” AE. The severity of the AE will be graded by the Investi gator according to the NCI CTCAE Grading Scale, v. 4.03 (the NCI CTCAE files can be accessed online at the following URL: http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html) . If there is not a specific NCI CTCAE grading for an AE, the severity will be characterized as mild, moderate, severe, or life -threatening, according to the foll owing definitions: •Grade 1 (mild) events are usually transient and do not interfere with the patient’s daily activities. •Grade 2 (moderate) events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient and may interfere with daily activities. •Grade 3 (severe) events interrupt the patient’s usual daily activities. •Grade 4 events are those that are considered to be life -threatening. 12.1.4. Adverse Event Causality The Investigator will make a judgment regarding the relationship of the AE to study treatment, as defined below. • Not related: These events will lack a temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment, making a causal relationship not reasonably possible . Exposure to other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions may provi de a sufficient explanation for the event. •Related: There is a temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment making a definitive relationship, and the event is more likely explained by exposure to the study treatment than by any other drugs, th erapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions. 12.2. Serious Adverse Events See Section 12.1.1 for the definition of an SAE. Please note that SAEs that occur at any time between the signing of the ICF up to the first dose of study treatment, must be reported (in addition to SAEs that o ccur after the first dose of study treatment). Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they"
89,page_89,"Investigational Product (KPT -330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 89 Version 4.0 may jeopardize the pa tient and may require medical or surg ical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsi ons that do not result in in -patient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 12.2.1. Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event Elective hospitalizations to administer, or to simplify study treatment or study procedures (ie, an overnight stay to facilitate 24 -hour urine collection) or other medical procedures are not considered SAEs. A ‘serious’ hospitalization is defined as any inpatient hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility. An emergency room visit is not considered a hospitalization unless it results in an official admission as an inpatient to the hospital (eg, undesirable effects of any administered treatment) and must be documented as an SAE. Progression of the malignancy/disease (including fatal outcomes) should NOT be reported as an SAE during the study or within the safety reporting period (see Section 12.2.3 ). Sudden or unexplained death should be reported as an SAE. If there is any uncertainty about a finding being due solely to progression of malignancy/disease, the finding should be reported as an AE or SAE, as appropriate. 12.2.2. Recording of Serious Ad verse Events It is the responsibility of the Investigator to record and document all SAEs occurring from the time when the ICF is signed until at least 30 days after the patient has stopped study treatment. All SAEs must be reported on the designated Spons or’s SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded in the eCRF. The original SAE report form must be retained in the Investigator’s site file. All applicable sections of the SAE Report Form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report . The Investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to study treatment and complete the form in English. See ICH E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Attachment 1) for key data elements that are required for expedited reporting. 12.2.3. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Every SAE, regardless of the causal relationship to the study treatment, occurring after the patient has signed informed consent, until at least 30 days after the patient has s topped study treatment, must be reported to the Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance Department within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The investigational site personnel must use the SAE Report Form provided by Karyopharm for reporting any SAE to the Karyo pharm Pharmacovigilance Department."

Email: pharmacovigilance@karyopharm.com Fax: +1-617-334-7617 (USA) +49-89-9218 -5650 (Germany) Any SAE observed after the 30 -day follow -up period should only be reported to Karyopharm if the Investigator suspects that the SAE has a causal relationship to the study treatment. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported, as follow -up to the original episode, within 24 hours of the Investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent. An assessment should be made at each study visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity of the event, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions required to treat the event, and the outcome of the event. 12.2.4. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Re actions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are SAEs that are unexpected and judged by the Investigator or Karyopharm to be related to the study treatment administered. All SUSARs will be collected and reported to the competent authorit ies and relevant ethics committees in accordance with the FDA’s “Safety Reporting Requirements for Investigational New Drugs and Bioanalytical/Bioequivalence Studies” or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. In addition, Karyo pharm will communicate all cases of cerebellar toxicity, Grade 3 or higher, to regulatory authorities, central ethics committees (eg, IRBs), and Investigators, in the format of an expedited Safety Report, within 7 days of awareness of the event. If requir ed by local regulations, the Investigator is responsible for notifying his/her IRB or local ethics committee of all SAEs. 12.3. Procedures for Handling Special Situations 12.3.1. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Note: Pregnancy per se is not considered to be an AE; however, it is discussed here because of the importance of reporting pregnancies that occur during studies and because a medical occurrence observed in the mother or fetus/newborn would be classified as an AE. Female patients of childbearing potential and fertile m ale patients will be informed as to the potential risk of conception while participating in this study and will be advised that they must use highly effective contraception listed in Section 10.8.1 (ie, results in a low failure rate when used consistently and correctly) during the dosing period and for a period of at least 3 months after the end of treatment."
91,page_91,"Investigational Product (KPT -330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 91 Version 4.0 A pregnancy test will be performed on each premenopausal female patient of childbearing potential prior to the first dose of study drug, on Day 1 of Cycles ≥2 while on treatment, and again at treatment discontinuation during the End -of-Treatment visit. A negative pregnancy te st must be documented prior to administration of study drug. If a patient is confirmed pregnant during the study, study drug administration must be discontinued immediately. The Investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor of the even t and record the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Form (provided by Karyopharm). The initial information regarding a pregnancy must be forwarded to Karyopharm’s Pharmacovigilance by email or fax within 24 hours of first knowledge of its occurrence. The pregnanc y should be followed up to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. All pregnancies occurring within 3 months af ter the patient’s last dose of study drug must be reported to Karyopharm, regardless of whether the patient received selinexor or other study drugs, withdraws from the study, or the study is completed. Patients should be instructed to inform the Investigat or regarding any pregnancies. Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form (eg, maternal serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal death, congenital anomaly, or birth defect) and r eported within 24 hours in accordance with the procedure for reporting SAEs (described in Section 12.2.3 ). A pregnancy in a female partner of a male patient must be reported to Karyopharm within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Pregnancies in female partners should only be followed if the male patient is being treated with a selinexor -containing regimen. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the female partner. It is not known whether selinexor passes into the breast milk. Mothers should not breastfeed while being treated with selinexor -containing regimen. 12.3.2. Overdose, Abuse, Misuse, Medication Errors, and Occupational Exposure All incidences of over dose, abuse, misuse, medication errors , and occupational exposu re are required to be reported to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance on an SAE report form and emailed to pharmacovigilance@karyopharm.com, regardless of whether or not there is an associated AE or SAE. 12.3.2.1. Overdose An overdose is a deliberate or accidental administration of any study treatment to a study patient, at a dose greater than that which was assigned to that patien t per the study protocol. If an overdose occurs, the Investigator and Karyopharm should be notified immediately, and the patient should be observed closely for AEs. Resulting symptoms should be treated, as appropriate, and the incident of overdose and rela ted AEs and/or treatment should be documented in the patient’s medical record and in the eCRF. Information regarding the overdose is to be recorded on an SAE report form and sent to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance regardless of whether or not an AE or SAE has occurred due to the overdose. If the overdose is associated with an SAE, the SAE report form must be submitted to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance within"

If there is no AE or SAE, the report must be submitted within 24 hours of awarenes s. As selinexor is metabolized by GSH conjugation, it is possible, but not demonstrated, that hepatic GSH depletion might occur in case of extreme overdose. Therefore, in overdose cases, if patients develop liver function test abnormalities, supportive mea sures such as SAM or other drugs that can replace GSH might be considered as part of the overall management plan. 12.3.2.2. Abuse, Misuse, or Medication Error Abuse is the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study treatment which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects. A medication error is any preventable incident that may cause or lead to inappropriate study treatment use or patient harm while the study treatment is in the control of the health care professionals or patien ts. Such incident may be due to health care professional practice, product labeling, packaging and preparation, procedures for administration, and systems, including the following: prescribing, order communication, nomenclature, compounding, dispensing, distribution, administration, education, monitoring, and use. All occurrences of abuse, misuse, or medication error with any study treatment are to be recorded on an SAE report form and sent to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance, regardless of whether or not an AE or SAE has occurred due to the abuse, misuse, or medication error. If the abuse, misuse, or medication error is associated with an SAE, the SAE report form must be submitted to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of awareness. If there is no AE o r SAE, the report must be submitted within 24 hours of awareness. 12.3.2.3. Occupational Exposure Occupational exposure is the exposure to a study treatment as a result of one’s professional or non-professional occupation. For this protocol, please follow the instru ctions for preparation and administration of selinexor, bortezomib , and dexamethasone. All occurrences of occupational exposure with any study treatment are to be recorded on an SAE report form and sent to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance, regardless of whethe r or not an AE or SAE has occurred due to the occupational exposure. If the occupational exposure is associated with an SAE, the SAE report form must be submitted to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of awareness. If there is no AE or SAE, the r eport must be submitted within 24 hours of awareness."

Demographic Characteristics Demographic characteristics will be summa rized by treatment arm (SVd, Vd, SVdX, and SdX ) and overall, and will include sex, race, ethnicity (Hispanic origin), and age at time of consent. For sex, race, ethnicity, the summary statistics will be the number and percentage of patients within each cat egory. For age at time of consent, the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be provided for each arm and the total sample. No formal hypot hesis testing of treatment arm differences will be performed. 13.4.4. Baseline Characteristics and Medi cal History Baseline characteristics i nclude height, weight, BSA, ECOG performance s tatus , and smo king history. If the Dubois (Dubois 1916 ) method for calcu lating BSA is entered by the site, BSA using the Mosteller (Mosteller 1987 ) method will be derived using the formula: BSA = Square Root ([Height(cm)×Weight(kg)]/3600). A complete medical history (Section 11.2.2 ) will be ob tained from each patient. Medical history will be summari zed by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) system organ class ( SOC ) and preferred term. Baseline data will be sum marized for each treatment arm using summary statistics; no formal hypot hesis testing of treatment arm differences will be performed. Baseline symptoms will be listed only. 13.5. Efficacy Analysis 13.5.1. Primary Analysis for PFS The PFS primary endpoint is defined as time from date of randomizatio n until the first date of PD, per IMWG response criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD for the primary PFS endpoint will be assessed centrally by the IRC (see Section 6.4). Clinical deterioration in the absence of objective M -protein increase is not considered PD. Patients who end study treatment due to clinical deterioration without an objective M -protein inc rease meeting the IMWG definition of PD will be censored for the PFS analysis. Unless specified otherwise, relapse from CR by positive immunofixation or trace amount (defined as less than 0.5 g/dL) of M-protein is not cons idered to be PD . The primary analy sis of PFS will be per formed on the ITT population . The analysis will be repeated for the PP population as a supportive analysis. PFS data will be summarized with KM methodology using 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles with associated 2-sided 95% CI s, as well as percentage of censored observations and proportion of events. Patients who remain progression -free (whether they withdraw from the study or reach their maximum follow -up) will be censored at the date of their last disease assessment . A strati fied log -rank test will be used to compare the PFS distributions between treatment arms for the primary efficacy assessment ; the strata will be those used for stratified"

Hazard ratio s will be estimated by a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as the only factor , the strata will be those used for stratified randomization. A non-stratified log -rank test and a Cox proportional hazards model will be used as sensitivity analyses. Additional sensitivity a nalyses will be performed on the ITT population for the PFS primary endpoint as outlined below: • Sensitivity Analysis #1: Events are defined as documented progression as verified by the IRC or death when the patient is closely followed, whichever occurs fir st. Patients are censored at the date of last disease assessment if no progression is confirmed by the IRC, treatment is discontinued for any reason, new anticancer treatment is started, or death or progression occurs after 2 or more missed visits. • Sensitivity Analysis #2: Similar to the primary PFS endpoint analysis but where treatment discontinuation for any reason is counted as an event. • Sensitivity Analysis #3: Similar to the primary PFS endpoint analysis but where the initiation of non -study ant ineoplastic therapy is counted as an event. • Sensitivity Analysis #4: Similar to the primary PFS endpoint analysis but where clinical progression is counted as an event in addition to IRC -confirmed PD. Clinical progression is defined as the event when a pat ient discontinues the treatment with reason of PD but is not classified as PD by IRC. • Sensitivity Analysis #5: Similar to the primary PFS endpoint analysis but where the timing of IRC -confirmed PD at an unscheduled visit is changed to the next scheduled visit. • Comparison of PFS endpoint by treatment based on Investigator’s assessment. 13.5.2. Analyses of the Key Secondary Endpoints The following 3 endpoints, which are defined as key secondary endpoints, will be tested at the time of the second PFS IA according to the test sequence below: 1. ORR, defined as any response ≥PR (ie, PR, VGPR, CR, or sCR) based on the IRC’s response outcome assessments, according to the IMWG response criteria 2. Incidence of any Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy events 3. Response rates for respons es ≥VGPR based on the IRC’s assessment The hierarchical testing procedure will be used to maintain the overall Type I error of these 3 tests at a 1 -sided 0.025 level of significance. Statistical significance of the key secondary endpoints will not be claim ed until the primary endpoint of PFS has reached significance. 13.5.2.1. Overall Response Rate The secondary efficacy endpoint of ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed PR or better (ie, PR, VGPR, CR, or sCR) based on the IRC’s response outcome assessments, according to the IMWG response criteria, before IRC -confirmed PD or initiating a"

All changes in MM disease assessments will be based on baseline MM disease assessments. ORR will be assessed on the ITT population at t he time of the second PFS IA. The analysis will be repeated for the PP population as a supportive analysis. Comparison of ORR between the 2 treatment arms will be performed using the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the randomization strati fication factors. The Breslow -Day test will be used to evaluate the homogeneity of odds ratios across the strata associated with this endpoint. Patients missing post -C1D1 MM disease assessments will be imputed as non - responders. A sensitivity analysis for ORR will be conducted on ITT patients where patients who have not had the opportunity to complete at least 2 post -C1D1 MM evaluations will be considered non-responders. 13.5.2.2. Incidence of Any Grade ≥2 Peripheral Neuropathy Events The analysis for this safety en dpoint is provided Section 13.7.1.1 . 13.5.2.3. Response Rate for Responses ≥VGPR Based on the IRC’s Assessment The response rate for responses ≥ VGPR will be assessed on the ITT population at the time of the second PFS IA. The analysis will be performed in a similar manner to the secondary efficacy endpoint of ORR using the CMH test. The unadjusted number and percentage of patients will be summari zed by treatment arm (SVd versus Vd) along with associated 95% CIs and the Breslow - Day test will be performed to assess homogeneity of odds ratios across the strata. Only responses ≥VGPR that occurred before IRC -confirmed PD or initiating a new MM treatmen t will be included in the analysis. 13.5.3. Analyses of the Non-Key Secondary Effiacy Endpoints Brief summaries of the analyses for the non-key secondary efficacy endpoints are provided below. Additional details may be found in the SAP. These non-key secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized by treatment arm for the ITT population, unless otherwise stated below or in the SA P. • Overall survival : The analysis of OS will be performed by treatment arm (SVd versus Vd) based on the stratified log -rank test. The strata will be those used for stratified randomization. Median OS time with 95% CI will be estimated based on the KM method for each treatment arm.

Analysis of the Key Secondary Safety Endpoint 13.7.1.1. Peripheral Neuropathy Events The analysis of the peripheral neuropathy events will be performed at the time of the second PFS IA. Statistical significance of peripheral neuropathy endpoint will not be claimed until PFS has reached significance. Treatment differences for the incidence of any Grade ≥2 p eripheral neuropathy events (the key secondary safety endpoint) will be tested using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors. The treatment difference will be assessed using the safety population. The number and percentage of patients will also be summarized by treatment arm (SVd versus Vd) along with the odds ratio and associated 95% CIs and the Breslow -Day test will be performed to assess homogeneity of odds ratios across the strata. A sensitivity ana lysis for the incidence of any Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy events will be conducted on the safety population where all Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy events that occur for Vd patients regardless of cross -over status will be included in the sensitivity a nalysis. Similar analysis using the CMH test and the Breslow -Day test as described in Section 13.5.2 will be repeated to assess the incidence of any Grade peripheral neuropathy events on the safety population, as well as for Grades 2, 3, and 4 separately. All peripheral neuropathy events may also be provided in a data listing. 13.7.2. Analys es of the Non-Key Secondary Safety Endpoint s 13.7.2.1. Study Treatment Exposure The following study treatment exposure data will be summarized: duration of exposure, number of cycles completed, percent compliance, dose intensity (defined as total study treatment received divided by duration of exposure, presented in mg/week and mg/day), number of missed doses, number of dose interruptions, duration of dose interruption, number of dose reductions, and number of dose escalations. Additional definition and analysis details may be found in the SAP. 13.7.2.2. Adverse Events AEs will be cod ed usin g the MedDRA and displayed in tables and listings u sing MedDRA SOC and preferred term. The incidence rates of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs ; separated by relationship to study treatment as assessed by the Investigator and maximum severity ), SAEs, AEs of at least Grade 3 in severity using NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 , treatment -related treatment - emergent SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal of study treatm ent, and AEs leading to death will b e summarized. TEAEs will be AEs that start or worsen on or after the first day dose of study treatment, through 30 days after the last dose, or any event considered treatment -related by the Investigator through the end of the study ; related AEs will be AEs with an Investigator determination of related to treatment.

No formal hypothesis -testing of AE incidence rat es will be performed. The causal relationship between the occurr ence of an AE and the study treatment will be judged by the I nvestigator as not related or related (see Section 12.1.4 ). In the event a patient experiences repeat episodes of the same AE, then the event with the highest severity and/or strongest causal relationship to treatment will be used for purposes of tabulations. 13.7.2.3. Clinical Laboratory Data Clinical laboratory values will be expressed using conventional International System of Units (SI) units. For each treatment arm, the actual value and change from baseline ( Day 1, prior to the first administration of study treatment ) to each on -study evaluation will be summarized for each quantitative clinical laboratory parameter, including, but not limited to, hema tology, clinical chemistry, coagulation , and urinalysis . In the event of repeat values, the last non -missing value per study day will be used. In the event that Day 1 data are unavailable for a given patient/parameter, the screening value will substitute as the baseline value. Severity of select clinical lab oratory measures will be determined using NCI CTCAE criteria ( eg, those measures that have a corresponding NCI CTCAE grade classification). Laboratory test results with NCI CTCAE Grades ≥ 3 will be presented in a by-patient data listing. Shift tables that present changes from baseline to worst on -study values and from baseline to last on -study values relative to NCI CTCAE classification ranges will be produced.

Tumor Lysis Syndrome As of the date of this amendment, there have been 8 reports of TLS: 4 patients in Karyopharm -sponsored studies, 2 patients in Investigator -sponsored studies, and 2 patients in the expanded access program (compassionate use). Of the 8 patients, 5 had MM reported as their underlying cancer and 3 had hematological malignancies (including AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia). The event onset latency ranged from 3 to 8 days (median 4 days). The total selinexor dose prior to eve nt onset ranged from 40 to 320 mg (median 160 mg). The outcome was reported as recovered in 4 patients and not recovered in 2 patients; the outcome was not reported in 2 patients. The Investigators assessed 7 of the events as being related to selinexor. O f the 8 cases summarized above, there were 3 cases in which the patient died as a result of a TEAE. The cause of death in each of these cases was reported as: respiratory failure secondary to advanced MM, sepsis, and respiratory failure, chemotherapy induc ed cardiomyopathy and AML.

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 135 Version 4.0 Section(s) Description of Change Rationale for the Change Hospitalizations for elective surgery or other medical procedures that are not due to an AE are not considered SAEs. A hospitalization meeting the regulatory definition for ‘serious’ is any inpatient hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility. An emergency room vis it is not considered a hospitalization unless it results in an official admission to the hospital. Elective hospitalizations to administer, or to simplify study treatment or study procedures (ie, an overnight stay to facilitate 24 -hour urine collection) or other medical procedures are not considered SAEs. A ‘serious’ hospitalization is defined as any inpatient hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility. An emergency room visit is not considered a hospitalizatio n unless it results in an official admission as an inpatient to the hospital (eg, undesirable effects of any administered treatment) and must be documented as an SAE. Progression of the malignancy/ disease (including fatal outcomes) should NOT be reported as an SAE during the study or within the safety reporting period (see Section 12.2.2 12.2.3 ). Sudden or unexplained death should be reported as an SAE. If there is any uncertainty about a finding being due solely to progression of malignancy/ disease , the f inding should be reported as an AE or SAE, as appropriate. Section 12.3.2: Overdose, Abuse, Misuse, Medication Error s, and Occupational Exposure Section 12.3.2.1: Overdose Section 12.3.2.2: Abuse, Misuse, or Medication Error Changed the reporting mechanism for reporting overdose, abuse, misuse, medication errors, and occupational exposure from fax to email. Revised the timing for reporting of overdose, abuse, misuse, medication errors, and occupational exposure for events that are not AEs or SAEs from “as soon as possible” to “within 24 hours of awareness.” To align with the guidance described in the new safety language template provided by the Karyopharm Pharmacovigil ance Department"

Study Design • Added crossover to treatment with selinexor and dexamethasone (SdX) as an option for patients in the Vd Arm after PD is confirmed by the IRC if they have significant tolerability issues with bortez omib ( eg, Grade >2 peripheral neuropathy or Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy with pain ). This change was made to provide access to selinex or treatment for patients randomized to the Vd Arm who are unable to tolerate continued treatment with bortezomib after PD is confirmed (Modified sections: Synopsis, Sectio ns 4.4.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.3, 5.2.2.1, 5.2.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 9.2, 9.3, 10.2.4, 11.1, 11.3.1, 11.7.3, 11.7.4, 13.3.5, 13.4, 13.4.3, 14.6, and Tables 2 and 3 , and Figure 1; New sections: Sections 13.3.3 and 13.3.4 and Tables 7 and 11."

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 145 Version 4.0 • Revised exclusion #12 to clarify that patients treated with an investigational anticancer therapy within 2 weeks prior to C1D1 are specifically excluded from the study ( Modified section: Section 7 .3). Schedul e of Assessments • Clarified that symptom -directed physical examinations will only be performed if clinically indicated to address questions regarding invoicing symptom -directed physical examinations that came up during preparation of the site contracts ( Modified sections : Tables 2 and 12). • Clarified that clinical plasmacytoma assessments are to be performed if clinically indicated at MM Disease Assessment Visits and at Durability of Response and Survival Follow -up Visits . Also corrected the window for detection of plasmacytomas at baseline by physical examination/palpation from “within 45 days” to “within 28 days” prior to C1D1 in footnote #21 of Table 2 (Modified sections: Section 11.3.1.8 and Tables 2 and 12). • Clarified that a skeletal survey is required at the EoT Visit ( Modified section: Table 2). Study Treatment Administration • Removed the requirement for d ose escalation for patients in the SVd Arm who do not achieve at least a PR within the first 2 cycles, are tolerating SVd well, and do not have any AEs related to study treatment Grade >2 at the time of dose escala tion. Dose escalation is no longer be requ ired for these patients, however, a dose escalation may still be considered. This change was made t o provide a greater margin of safety by making a determination for escalation of the selinexor dose based on the medical status of each individual patient . Also clarified that dose escalation is an option for all selinexor -containing regimens (Modified sections: Synopsis, Section 10 .2.4.1, and Tables 8 , 11, and 14 ; New section : Section 10.2.5 ). Multiple Myeloma Disease Assessments • Added a requirement for baseline bone marrow aspirate at Screening for all because the expectation in the field is that a baseline bone marrow aspirate is necessary to obtain accurate 17p status prior to starting a new therapy, Also, clarified that a portion of the bone marrow as pirate collected at Screening will be provided to the central laboratory for karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to confirm diagnosis and classify cytogenetic MM subtypes for R -ISS staging. (Modified sections: Section 11 .3.1.9 and Table 2). • Removed turbidometry as an acceptable method for measuring quantitative Ig leve ls because, unlike nephelometry, turbidometry cannot be used to assess response . Also clarified that nephelometry may be used in place of SPEP for routine M -protein measurement for patients with IgD myeloma in addition to patients with IgA myeloma (Modified sections: Sections 11 .3.1 and 11 .3.1.3)."

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-023 17 August 2018 Confidential Page 146 Version 4.0 PK Assessments • Added PK assessments for bortezomib and selinexor in a subset of patients randomized to each arm ( ie, the Vd Arm and the SVd Arm) in order to explore exposure -response relationships and drug -drug interactions between bortezomib and selinexor, and to evaluate any differences in PK related to age, race, sex, BMI, baseline disease state, or other demographi c characteristics (Modified sections: Section 10 .2.3.1 and Table 2; New Sections 5.1.4, 5.2.4, 11.4, and 13 .6). Clinical Safety Assessments • Clarified that BSA should be recalculated if the patient’s weight fluctuates substantially from baseline ( ie, >20%) during treatment (including Vd, SVd, SVdX, and SdX) ( Modified sections: Global). Analysis Populations • Revised the definition of the per -protocol (PP) population from all ITT patients who have received “any amount” to “at least 1 dose “of study treatment to clarify that the population does not include patients who have not received study treatment (Modified sections: Synopsis and Section 13 .3.2). Efficacy Analysis • Added justification for the sample size calculation assumptions. This change was made to address the FDA request to provide justification for the assumptions for the sample size calculation ( Modified sections: Sections 13.2.1 and 13 .2.2). • Specified that an independent third party (the DSMB) will conduct and review the sample size re -estimation and that an interim analysis charter will be created to outline the operational procedures associate d with both PFS IAs. This change was made to address the FDA recommendation that the conduct/review of the sample size re-estimation be conducted by an ind ependent third party (Modified section: Section 13.2.3.1) . • Clarified timing and details for the second IA ( Modified section: Section 13.2.3.2). • Added a sensitivity analysis using the Breslow -Day test to evaluate the homogeneity of odds ratios across the st rata associated with the ORR endpoint and the two secondary efficacy endpoint analyses which are analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel - Haenszel test. This change was made to address the FDA request to include a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness o f secondary efficacy endpoints analysis results . (Modified sections: Sections 13.5.1 and 13 .5.2). • Added sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary efficacy endpoints to address the FDA request to provide sensitivity analys es to evaluate the robustness of efficacy results in the protocol, which includes different censoring rules for the analyses of time -to-event endpoints. The sensitivity analyses, based on the guidance “Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Dr ugs and Biologics” will consider the events in which patients have taken other anticancer therapy, missed assessments, or been lost -to-follow -up (Modified sections: Sections 13.5.1.1, 13.5.1.2, and 13 .5.2)."
