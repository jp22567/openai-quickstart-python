Clinical Study Protocol AE451-G-18- 004 13 Version 3.0 – 24 Jun 2019 CONFIDENTIAL 1 Introduction 1.1 Background 1.1.1 Psoriasis Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis. It is a n intractable inflammatory skin disease characterized by raised, well-demarcated, itchy erythematous circular -to-oval plaques covered with adherent silvery white scales. In addition to the skin- related manifestation, concomitant joint - and nail -related signs and symptoms may be experienced by some patients. The number of patients with psoriasis is estimated to be approximately 7.5 million in the US, 7.5 million in the EU and 420 thousands in Japan, and the worldwide prevalence is calculated to be 0.6 to 4.8% .1-4 It is also known that the quality of life (QOL) of the psoriasis patients is lower than that of patients with cancer or diabetes .5 As a result, psoriasis markedly restricts the social activities of patients. Various cytokines produced by Th1 and Th17 cells play a crucial role in the development of psoriasis. Clinical studies of biologics targeting cytokines have revealed that interleukin ( IL)-17 produced by Th17 cells and IL -23 responsible for the growth and maintenance of Th17 cells, play highly important roles in the disease progression and exacerbation of psoria sis.6-9 1.1.2 Treatment of Psoriasis The goal of psoriasis treatment is to achieve rapid remission induction, long -term control of skin manifestations and improve the QOL. The pharmacotherapy for psoriasis mainly consists of topical vitamin D 3 analogues and topical cortico steroids, and depending on the symptoms, systemic treatment such as cyclosporine and methotrexate (MTX) may be used. For patients with concomitant joint symptoms and those who have not sufficiently responded to conventional systemic treatment, biologics targeting such as tumor ne crosis factor (TNF )-ɑ, IL-23 and IL -17 may be prescribed. Cyclosporine and MTX, which form the core of the systemic treatment , exert their actions more rapidly and effectively compared with the topical drugs and can induce remission in many patients. 10 However , these drugs raise many safety concerns: long -term treatment with cyclosporine may cause nephropathy or increase the blood press ure, and MTX may lead to myelosuppression and a wide variety of other side effects . Biologic s can achieve complete remission in some patients, making a massive contribution to the advancement in treatment of psoriasis. However, biologics involve many issues that have to be resolved: (1) approximately 30% of the patients do not respond to therapy (2) increased risks for infections and cancer development (3) financial burden is high and (4) the lack of availability of long -term safety data for thes e compounds . 11 Additionally, it is known that psoriasis significantly impacts the QOL of the patients affected and there is not always a direct correlation between the severity grading of the disease (which is significantly related to the amount of body area covered by the rash) and its impact on the QOL (e.g., if the rash is limited to the face, the severity may be assessed as mild , although the QOL is significantly impaired ). Nonetheless, highly efficacious therapeutic options, such as biologics may not be selected in such cases, therefore this issue is not being addressed with the current therapeutic options. Based on these reasons, next generation of therapeutic drugs for psoriasis are expected to be cost-effective, highly efficacious and safe oral drugs that can induce remission rapidly and achiev e"
14,page_14,"JTE-451 AKROS PHARMA INC . Clinical Study Protocol AE451-G-18- 004 14 Version 3.0 – 24 Jun 2019 CONFIDENTIAL complete remission with high probability. Unlike existing drugs for systemic treatment that are indicated only for severe cases, the cost, as well as the safety profile of the new generation therapeutics must allow prescribing those to any patient regardless of the severity of the disease. 1.1.3 Retinoid -related Orphan Receptor γ (RORγ) Retinoid -related orphan receptor γ is a nuclear receptor , discovered in 199412, but its functions remained unclear for many years. In 2006, it was reported that RORγ is specifically expressed in Th17 cells and that it plays a crucial role in the differentiation of naive T cells into Th17 cells as well as in the activation of Th17 cells.13 Since then, RORγ has drawn attention as a target molecule for diseases involving Th17 cells. RORγ binds to the ROR binding element following nuclear translocation and enhances the transcriptional activities of target genes such as IL -17 and IL -23 receptors. The molecule is thus considered to be a master regulator playing a central role in the functional regulation of Th17 cells. The biologics targeting IL -17 and IL -23 are currently indicated for some autoimmune diseases in clinical settings. IL -17 is produced by Th17 cells, functions of which are regulated by RORγ and IL -23 play s an important role in the proliferation and maintenance of Th17 cells . These facts suggest that RORγ, a master regulator of Th17 cells, can play an important role in the pathogenesis and exacerbation of various autoimmune diseases. 1.2 JTE- 451 A brief summary of the nonclinical and clinical findings is included below.

From a safety perspective, study restrictions will be implemented based on the nonclinical and clinical dat a available to date. These include restrictions aiming to minimize the risk to the participating subjects, to minimize the confounding factors in the assessment process and to monitor and adequately manage any safety -related findings. Other general safety -related restrictions such as cardiovascular -system -related, hepatic and renal function- related restrictions, as well as the known safety signals associated with other compounds with similar MOA have been implemented to monitor and adequately manage safety- related findings . 1.3.2 Justification for Study Design A parallel group, placebo- controlled design will be employed in this study to evaluate the effect of JTE -451 on the efficacy and safety of JTE -451 compared to placebo in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Briefly, upon completion of all protocol -mandated screening procedures, qualified subjects will be randomized at Visit 2 in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following three parallel dose groups: JTE -451 200 mg BID (400 mg/day) , JTE-451 400 mg BID (800 mg/day) or placebo BID (approximately 50 subjects to be randomized per group) and will receive the double -blind treatment for 1 6 weeks followed by a 4- week Follow -up Period. To minimize potential confounders in efficacy response s, randomization will be stratified based on prior exposure to biologic therapy (i.e., biologic -naïve vs. biologic -experienced subjects) and body weight (i.e., <90 kg vs. ≥90 kg at Visit 2 ). No clinically meaningful food effect on the PK of JTE -451 was shown in the single ascending dose study thus, study drug will be administered regardless of meals . Based on the PK charac eristics of the compound, the protocol requires the study drug administration twice a day, at approximately 12-hour intervals . The duration of the double -blind treatment period is sufficient to obtain the proof- of-efficacy for JTE-451 in subjects with plaque psoriasis. The duration of the Follow -up Period is set to approximately 4 weeks ; standard duration for similar outpatient studies administered an"

Based on the PK characteristics of JTE -451, this period is considered conservative, as JTE -451 clears the human body within approximately one day after the last dose. The efficacy parameters assessed in this study are consistent with the standards in the industry in similar psoriasis trials (e.g., PASI, sPGA , BSA ). ps . To minimize the chances of errors, all calculations of derived parameters will be done by the Sponsor based on the appropriate core data points collected and documented by the Investigators. With respect to study entry restrictions, screening procedures and exclusion criteria to mitigate and minimize the risk of infections, including tuberculosis and viral infections have been included to ensure the safety of subjects. To minimize the risks to the subjects and to facilitate further characterization of the safety profile of JTE -451, standard safety evaluations, such as AE collection, physical exam ination , vital sign, laboratory (including biochemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis) and ECG assessments are included i n the study as part of ongoing safety monitoring activities. Data for t hese parameters will be collected throughout the study and will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. 1.3.3 Justification for Dose Selection Selection of JTE -451 doses in this study (200 mg BID and 400 mg BID) is based on the collective data from nonclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy subjects 1 and in subjects with plaque psoriasis ."

The sPGA is used to determine the severity of subject’s psoriatic lesion at a given time point. Every effort should be made to perform the sPGA assessments by the same evaluator throughout the study. The psoriatic lesion will be graded for induration, erythema and scaling based on the scales below. The sum of the 3 scales will be divided by 3 to obtain the final sPGA score . Induration (I) 0 = no evidence of plaque elevation 1 = barely palpable 2 = slight but definite elevation, indistinct edge 3 = elevated with distinct edges 4 = marked plaque elevation, hard/sharp borders Erythema (E) 0 = no evidence of erythema (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation may be present ) 1 = faint erythema 2 = light red coloration 3 = red coloration 4 = dusky to deep red coloration Scaling (S) 0 = no evidence of scaling 1 = occasional fine scale 2 = fine scale predominates 3 = coarse scale predominates 4 = thick, coarse scale predominates Add I+E+S = _______________/3 = ________ (Total Average) Physician’s Static Global Assessment based upon above Total Average 0 = Cleared, except for residual dis coloration 1 = Minimal – majority of lesions have individual scores for I+E+S/3 that averages 1 2 = Mild – majority of lesions have individual scores for I+E+S/3 that averages 2 3 = Moderate – majority of lesions have individual scores for I+E+S/3 that ave rages 3 4 = Severe – majority of lesions have individual scores for I+E+S/3 that averages 4 Note: Scores should be rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g., if the total is ≤1.49, the score should be 1; if the total is ≥1.50, the score should be 2) except if the score is >0 and <1, score should be treated as 1."

The total BSA affected by plaque -type psoriasis will be estimated from the percentages of areas affected, including head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs (see below for PASI ass essment) . The following calculations will be done: each reported percentage will be multiplied by its respective body region corresponding factor (head = 0.1, trunk = 0.3, upper limbs = 0.2, lower limbs = 0.4). The resulting 4 values will be added up to es timate the total BSA affected by plaque-type psoriasis. Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), a quantitative rating score to assess the severity of psoriatic lesions based on the area coverage and plaque appearance will be performed according to the schedule summarized in Table 1. Every effort should be made to perform the BSA and PASI assessments by the same evaluator throughout the study. The PASI score will be derived as indicated in Table 8. The head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs are assessed separately for erythema, thickening (plaque elevation, induration) and scaling (desquamation). The average degree of severity of ea ch sign in each of the four body regions is assigned a score of 0 to 4. The area covered by lesions on each body region is estimated as a percentage of the total area of that particular body region. Listed below are further practical details to help with the assessment: 1. The neck is assessed as part of the head. 2. The axillae and groin are assessed as part of the trunk. 3. The buttocks are assessed as part of the lower limbs. 4. When scoring the severity of erythema, scales should not be removed. Because the head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs correspond to approximately 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the body surface area, respectively, the PASI score is calculated using the following formula: PASI = 0.1(EH+IH+DH)AH + 0.2(EU+IU+DU)AU + 0.3(ET+IT+DT)AT + 0.4(EL+IL+DL)AL The PASI scores can range from 0, corresponding to no signs of psoriasis, up to a theoretic maximum of 72.0, corresponding to maximal signs of psoriasis."

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medical (investigational) product. Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that meets any of the following criteria : • results in death • is life-threatening • requir es inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • result s in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapacity • is a congenital anomaly or birth defect • other important medical event Note: Important medical events that may not immediately result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition above . Examples of such important medical events include all ergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Adverse Drug Reaction: All noxious and unintended responses to an investigational medicinal product (IMP)- related to any dose administered. Note: The phrase ""responses to a medicinal product"" means that a causal relationship between the medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable poss ibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction: An adverse drug reaction, the nature (specificity) or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., IB). Death: Death represents an outcome, not an event term. The medical condition with the fatal outcome should be reported unless the cause of death is unknown, in which case the term “Death” is acceptable. Inpatient Hospitalization/Prolongation of Hospitalization: Any admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a healthcare facility. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (e.g., medical floor to the coronary care unit). Initial and prolonged hospitalizations that do not meet this SAE criterio n include those due to social and/or convenience reasons (e.g., lack of personal care at home, unable to transfer to non- acute facility), admission to rehabilitation/hospice/skilled nursing facilities, emergency room visits,"

However, if the hospitalization was prolonged due to a complication of a pre -existing condition, the complication ( same diagnosis) would qualify as an SAE. Disability: A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. Life-threatening: Any AE that places the patient or subject, in the view of the Investigator, a t immediate risk of death, i.e., it does not include a n event that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. Physical Examination, Vital Signs, Laboratory Test and ECG Abnormalities: Any abnormalities fulfilling the criteria for an SA E should be reported as such, in addition to being recorded as an AE in the CRF. Any abnormal vital sign, physical finding or laboratory/ECG result which is clinically -significant (i.e., meets one or more of the following conditions) should be recorded as a single diagnosis on the AE page in the CRF: • Accompanied by clinical symptoms • Leads to permanent discontinuation of study drug • Requires a change in concomitant therapy (e.g., addition of, interruption of, discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or treatment). This does not apply to abnormal vital signs, physical finding or laboratory/ECG results that do not meet the clinical -significance criteria or parameters that are a result of an AE , which has already been reported. Pre-existing conditions detected at the Screening Visit (Visit 1), including abnormalities in ECG, physical examination, vital signs and laboratory tests, are considered to be medical history. 3.6.2 Assessing Adverse Events When completing appropriate forms for reporting the AE, the Investigator will be asked to assess the AE as follows: Seriousness of Adverse Event: • Serious : The AE meets a criterion of the SAE definition. • Not Serious: The AE does not meet a criterion of the SAE definition. Severity of Adverse Event : The severity of an AE will be graded as one of the following three grades: mild, moderate or severe. To determine the severity of AEs, refer to CTCAE, and translate Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 or higher grades of CTCAE14 into mild, moderate and severe, respectively. The investigator should determine the severity taking into account the general status of the subjec t, baseline values, outcomes as well as the severity grade into consideration. An AE of Grade 4 or Grade 5 should be assessed whether it should be reported as an SAE according to the SAE definition shown in Section 3.6.1."
51,page_51,"JTE-451 AKROS PHARMA INC . Clinical Study Protocol AE451-G-18- 004 51 Version 3.0 – 24 Jun 2019 CONFIDENTIAL • Mild: The AE is transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The AE does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living . • Moderate: The AE is alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The AE interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. • Severe: The AE interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. Relationship of Adverse Event (Causality): The Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IMP caused or contributed to the adverse event. Generally, the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest causal relationship should be documented. Factors to be taken into consideration when assessing causality include: subject’s underlying and pr e-existing conditions, prior/concomitant medications, timing of onset relative to study drug administration, the known PK characteristics of JTE-451, the currently -known safety profile of JTE-451, known class effects of similar MOA drugs and any other info rmation that is considered relevant by the Investigator. The relationship of an AE to the study drug will be assessed using the following three categories: • Not Related: The AE precedes the first administration of the study drug, or sufficient information e xists to indicate that the etiology is clearly related to a cause other than the study drug. • Possibly Related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the study drug and follows a known or plausible response pattern to the study drug, but could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. • Related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the study drug; follows a known or expected response pattern to the study drug; is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the study drug (de -challenge) and reappearance of the event on repeat exposure (re- challenge); and cannot be reasonably explained by the participant’s clinical state. Action Taken with Regard to Study Drug : The evaluation of the action taken with the study drug will be assessed using the following four definitions: • Dose Not Changed: The subject was on treatment with the study drug when the AE occurred, and the study drug dosing was maintained at the same dose level • Drug Interrupted : The subject was on treatment with the study drug when the AE occurred, and the study drug dosing was temporarily discontinued and then re- started • Drug Withdrawn: The subject was on treatment with the study drug when the AE occurred, and the study drug dosing was permanently discontinued • Not Applicable: The subject was not receiving treatment with the stud y drug when the AE occurred (i.e., AE occurred before the first study drug administration or after the last study drug administration) , or if the subject died."

However, pre- existing conditions detected as part of the screening procedures should be documented as medical history. Worsening of the underlying condition (i.e., plaque psoriasis) or signs/symptoms associated with this condition should not be reported as an AE unless they meet at least one SAE criterion. Adverse events for the randomized subjects will be reported on the AE CRF page. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Reporting by Investigators Detailed instruction regarding SAE reporting will be provided in the appropriate documents outside of this protocol. A brief, non- all-inclusive summary is provided below. Any SAE experienced by a study subject after signing the informed consent up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug will be reported to the Sponsor or designee . Additionally, SAEs that occur after this period will also be reported to the Sponsor or designee if the Investigator considers the SAE possibly related or related to the study drug. Serious adverse events (both initial reports and follow -up information) must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator’s (site’s) awareness or notification of the event. The Investigators should make every effort to provide complete information when reporting the SAE (both for initial reports, as well as for follow -ups)."

The SAE report should be amended, if the Investigators change his/her opinion of causality based on the follow-up information. • Personal information that could potentially identify the patient MUST NOT be included in any document that is sent to Sponsor or designee as per ICH GCP Principles 2.11, EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable laws and legislations. The Investigator must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided, the condition becomes chronic in nature, the condition stabilizes (in case of persistent impairment), or the subject dies. Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must submit it to the Sponsor or designee. The Investigator is also required to submit SAE reports to the IRB/IEC in accordance with local requirements. All investigators involved in studies using the same IMP will receive all Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) reports for onward submission to their local IRB/IEC as required. All SUSAR reports sent to investigators will be blinded. Reporting by the Sponsor Competent authorities and IRBs/IECs will be informed by the Sponsor or designee of SUSARs according to the local requirements. Additionally, the Sponsor or designee will report all SUSARs into the EudraVigilance system, as appropriate. Cases will be unblinded by designated personnel for reporting purposes as required. Exposure in Utero Reporting: If a female subject becomes pregnant or the female partner of a male subject participating in the study becomes pregnant after the subject receives the first dose of study drug, or within 30 days of discontinuing study drug, the Investigator should report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being notified. The subject/partner should be followed by the Investigator until completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor or designee. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator should document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as described above. Overdose Reporting: An overdose is a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a product. For the purposes of this study, overdose is defined as any confirmed use of blinded study drug of more than two tablets per dose and/or twice a day. If such situation occur s, the Investigator shoul d provide additional training to the subject on study drug dosing instructions and emphasize the importance of compliance. Currently there is no known antidote to JTE-451, thus appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive care should be provided at the Invest igator’s discretion, as needed.

Study drug will be taken BID, at approximately 12-hour intervals, regardless of meals. On the scheduled study visit days, subjects should not take study drug prior to arriving to the site. At the site, study drug will be administered from the previously supplied blister card, if available, after all study procedures have been completed (except for appropriate PK sample collection procedures as discus sed in Figure 2 ). If no tablets from the previously supplied blister cards are available, then the subject should dose from the new blister card supplied at that visit. Study drug will not be administered on the day of Visit 7. At Visit 2, three study drug blister cards will be dispensed to all subjects. From Visit 3 onwards, the subjects will be asked to return all study drug blister cards from the former visit for accountability and compliance assessment . At each visit, an unus ed blister card or a partially used blister card with the study drug available which was dispensed at the previous visit will be returned to the subjects. In addition, new study drug blister cards will be dispensed so that the subjects will receive enough study drug for the period between site visits. The subject will be instructed to use the blister cards on a first -in/first- out basis. At Visit 7, study drug will not be dispensed. If a subject discontinues study drug prematurely, the termination should be recorded as soon as possible after the decision has been made. In the event that the subject does not take the study drug on a given day during the Treatment Period, the subject should not take more than the daily dosage on the following treatment day. 3.7.6 Management of Clinical Supplies The Investigator will have responsibility for the control and proper distribution of all study drug (including any investigational product or reference product) in accordance with this protocol. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study drug will be stored at the site at recommended storage temperatures and conditions, in a secured area, free of environmental extremes, with restricted access. The Investigator should also ensure that all study drug will be dispensed only to subjects who have provided written informed consent and have met all entry criteria. Study drug accountability will be performed by the Investigator or designee at each study visit during the Treatment Period, according to the schedule of proc edures presented in Table 1. Study drug compliance will be assessed and documented per the Good Clinical Practices (GCP)."

Clinical Study Protocol AE451-G-18- 004 56 Version 3.0 – 24 Jun 2019 CONFIDENTIAL 3.7.7 Randomization Approximately 150 eligible subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be randomized into this study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio ( approximately 50 subjects per treatment group) to receive JTE-451 200 mg BID (400 mg/day) , JTE-451 400 mg BID (800 mg/day) or placebo BID. Randomization will be stratified based on prior exposure to biologic therapy (i.e., biologic -naïve vs. biologic -experienced subjects) and body weight (i.e., <90 kg vs. ≥90 kg at Visit 2 ). An IWRS will be employed for the randomization activities. It will use a stratified randomization algorithm that takes into account the strata specified above. The randomization code will be controlled by an unblinded member of the Sponsor or designee who will provide the randomization code to select laboratories (see Section 3.7.8). 3.7.8 Blinding This study is double -blind (i.e., the treatment assigned to each subject will not be disclosed to the Sponsor members or designees involved in the study, study staff at the site or to the subject). JTE-451 200 mg tablets, as well as placebo tablets will be supplied as unbranded tablets , which are identical in appearance. The laboratory performing JTE-451 plasma concentration assessments will be unblinded to facilitate analysis of only the samples from the JTE-451- treated subjects. Plasma samples from placebo -treated subjects may be analyzed as needed (see Section 3.5.6.27). 3.7.9 Breaking the Blind The study drug code may be broken by the Investigator for a particular subject only in the event of a serious adverse experience, which the Investigator feels cannot be adequately treated without knowing the identity of the study drug by using the IWRS. Every effort must be made to contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the code. If the situation is an emergency, the Investigator may break the blind to identify the treatment assignment for the specific subject only and must contact the Medical Monitor as soon as possible thereafter. The Sponsor may also elect to break the blind for cause. If the blind is broken, appropriate documentation should be completed as soon as possible. Additionally, breaking of the blind may be performed by sponsor- designated independent member not involved in the clinical conduct of the study for regulatory reporting purposes, as appropriate. 3.8 Statistical Methods This section provides an abbreviated statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the efficacy, safety and PK evaluations . A formal SAP will be developed before the database lock . Statistical matters not addressed in this section may be developed in the formal SAP. The plans outlined in this section may be modified in the SAP; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis may also be reflected in a protocol amendment, as appropriate. Other deviations to the SAP will be discussed in the study report."

A pre -analysis meeting will take place after all data have been entered into the database and cleaned, but before the release of the randomization code, to identify the PP population. The decisions made to select the PP population will be documented. 3.8.1.4 Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population The PK population consists of the randomized subjects who re ceive at least one dose of JTE -451 and have at least one usable JTE-451 plasma concentration measurement. 3.8.2 Sample Size A pproximately 150 eligible subjects (50 subjects in each treatment group) will be randomized into the double-blind treatment period. The sample size estimation is based on t he primary efficacy parameter of the proportion of subjects achieving PASI -75 at EOT . Taking into consideration a 15-20% treatment discontinuation rate, about 50 subjects per group will be randomized into the double- blind treatment period . 3.8.3 Interim Analysis No interim analysis is planned in this study. 3.8.4 Efficacy Analyses The ITT population will be used for all efficacy data analysis. The analysis of the primary efficacy parameter will be repeated on the PP population if it excludes 20% or more of the subjects from the ITT population. Additional efficacy analyses using the PP population may be performed if deemed appropriate."

Clinical Study Protocol AE451-G-18- 004 58 Version 3.0 – 24 Jun 2019 CONFIDENTIAL 3.8.4.1 Efficacy Parameters The primary efficacy parameter is the proportion of subjects achieving PASI-75 at EOT. The secondary efficacy parameters (for which data will be evaluated at Week s 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and EOT unless otherwise stated ) are: • Proportions of subjects achieving PASI -50/PASI -75/PASI -90; • Percent change from baseline in PASI; • Proportion of subjects achieving sPGA score of 0 or 1; • Change from baseline in sPGA score; • Percent change from baseline in BSA ; • Change from baseline in Skindex-16; • Change from baseline in Itch NRS ; • Change from baseline in each domain score/questionnaire of Skindex-16. 3.8.4.2 Eff icacy Data Analysis The primary efficacy analyses will compare the proportion of subjects achieving PASI -75 response in JTE- 451 dose groups (200 mg BID and 400 mg BID) with placebo at EOT, respectively. Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by prior exposure to biologic therapy (biologic -naïve or biologic- experienced) and body weight ( i.e., <90 kg or ≥90 kg at Visit 2 ) will be used for the primary comparisons. A multiple testing procedure (e.g., step -down procedure) will be considered the primary efficacy analyses of PASI -75. F or supportive analyses of PASI -75, a logistic regression model -based analysis will be performed for the pairwise comparisons between a JTE- 451 dose group and placebo, and for the evaluation of the dose response relationship. The logistic regression models will include the stratifying factors and baseline values of key efficacy parameters as covariates. The details will be described in the SAP. For dichotomous secondary efficacy parameters, similar analyses as those for the primary efficacy parameter above will be performed at EOT or by a defined time point as appropriate. For continuous efficacy parameter analysis with multiple time points, a mixed effect model will be employed. It includes fixed effects for treatment, time, treatment by time interaction, the stratification factor , appropriate baseline and subject as random effect. Appropriate baseline will be the parameter from which the efficacy parameter is derived, (e.g., PASI at Week 0 for the analysis of percent change from baseline in PASI ). The treatment effect of each JTE -451 dose group relative to placebo at the same time po int will be estimated. A linear trend test at each time point will be computed using appropriate linear contrast."
59,page_59,"JTE-451 AKROS PHARMA INC . Clinical Study Protocol AE451-G-18- 004 59 Version 3.0 – 24 Jun 2019 CONFIDENTIAL All analyses will be performed two -sided at the 5% significance level. No formal multiple comparison adjustment will be made for secondary eff icacy parameters. The estimated treatment effect (relative to placebo) from the model, along with a two -sided 95% confidence interval ( CI) and p-value, will be tabulated where appropriate. Graphical presentations of the treatment profile will be provided for the primary and secondary efficacy parameters. . Descriptive statistics of efficacy parameters over time will be presented by treatment. It will include number of subjects (N), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum for continuous parameters, and frequency for dichotomous parameters. 3.8.4.3 Treatment by Center Effect The randomization in this study is stratified by prior exposure to biologic therapy (i.e., biolog ic-naïve vs. biologic -experienced subjects) and body weight (i.e., <90 kg vs. ≥90 kg at Visit 2 ). Center effect is not considered due to the expectation that many centers will be used and only a small number of subjects will be enrolled in most centers. 3.8.4.4 Treatment by Baseline Covariate Effect The treatment -by-baseline effect will be assessed as appropriate. T he baseline will be included in the respective parametric analysis model of the efficacy parameters where appropriate. 3.8.4.5 Subgroup Analysis Subgroup analyses may be performed if appropriate. 3.8.4.6 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data There may be missing data intermittently ( e.g., a missing visit or subject dropout). For efficacy analysis of dichotomous parameters by scheduled time point, subjects with missing data will not be included in the analysis. For analysis with multiple time points, any missing data will be imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method except for subjects who withdraw for reasons related to treatment in which case any value after the withdrawal will be imputed as treatment failure. For parameters analyzed both by time point and with multiple time points, these two approaches would strengthen the findings when they are similar. For efficacy analysis of continuous par ameters, missing data will not be imputed . This is because the statistical models employed (e.g., mixed effect model ) generally provide valid estimates if the missing data mechanism is so-called “missing at random ,” a common assumption made as the first approach for analysis. 3.8.5 Safety Analyses The safety population will be used for the safety data analysis unless otherwise stated."
