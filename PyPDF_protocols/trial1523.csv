Test Product: Toripalimab Injection (JS001 or TAB001 ) Name of Active Ingredient: Recombinant humanized anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody Title of Study: A Phase III, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled, Multicenter, Double -Blind Study Comparing Toripalimab Injection (JS001) Combined with Chemotherapy versus Placebo Combined with Chemotherapy for Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer Protocol No: JS001 -015-III-NPC Indication: Nasopharyngeal Cancer Primary Investigator: Prof. Ruihua Xu Study center(s): Approximately 40 sites in China mainland, Taiwan, Sing apore. Phase: III Objectives: Primary : • To evaluate the efficacy of Toripalimab Injection (JS001) plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy ，as measured by independent review committee (IRC) -assessed prog ression free survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1 in all patients. Secondary : • To evaluate the efficacy of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, as measured by overall survival (OS). • To evaluate the efficacy of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with place bo plus chemotherapy, as measured by investigator - and IRC -assessed overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST v1.1. • To evaluate the efficacy of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, as measured by investigator -assessed PFS according to RECIST v1.1. • To evaluate the IRC - and investigator -assessed PFS rate at 1 and 2 years in each treatment arm. • To evaluate the OS rate at 1 and 2 years in each treatment arm. • To asses s disease -related symptoms and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients treated with JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy using the EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ -H&N35 and ECOG performance status assessments."
10,page_10,"11 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy. • To evaluate the incidence and titers of ADAs against JS001 and to explore the potential relationship of the immunogenicity response with pharmacokinetics, safety a nd efficacy. • To evaluate the efficacy of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy ，as measured by investigator - and IRC -assessed PFS, ORR, DoR and DCR according to irRECIST. Exploratory : • To assess predictive, prognostic, and pharmacodynamic exploratory biomarkers (including but not limited to PMBC, PD -L1, PD -1, tumor mutation burden and others) in archival and/or fresh tumor tissue and blood and their association with disease status, mecha nisms of resistance, and/or response to JS001. • To evaluate the utility of biopsy at the time of apparent disease progression to distinguish apparent increases in tumor volume related to the immunomodulatory activity of JS001 (i.e., pseudoprogression and t umor immune infiltration) from true disease progression. Study design: This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, multi -center, double blinded, Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab Injection (JS001) in combination with gemci tabine/cisplatin compared with placebo in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin as first -line treatment in patients with histological/cytological confirmation of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients who fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio according to the following stratification scheme: • ECOG performance status (0 versus 1) • Disease stage (recurrent versus metastatic) Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ra tio to receive treatment every 3 weeks ( Q3W) with JS001 plus gemcitabine/cisplatin (Arm A) or placebo plus gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy (Arm B) in the ‘during chemotherapy’ phase. During the ‘post -chemotherapy’ phase, patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B will continue treatment with JS001 or placebo as maintenance therapy Q3W until excessive toxicity or progressive disease, withdrawal of consent or Investigator’s judgement or a maximum of 2 years. Patients may continue treatment with JS001 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) beyond radiographic progression by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, provided they are experiencing clinical benefit, as assessed by the Investigator in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomat ic deterioration attributed to disease progression, as determined by the sponsor medical monitor or designee and treating physician after an integrated assessment of radiographic data and clinical status. Tumor evaluation scans will be performed at screen ing (as baseline) then every 6weeks in the first 12 months then every 9 weeks thereafter until objective disease progression. This is a double blinded , one interim efficacy analysis of PFS is planned and pre -defined stopping boundary is set for two -sided p -value . The iDMC will provide the recommendation as to whether to unblind the study or not according to the data of interim analysis and the iDMC charter if the stopping boundary is crossed . If the Sponsor accepted the recommendation and unblind the study , JS001 will be provided to the patients who were randomized to arm A and still on JS001 treatment until the treatment discontinuation criteria are met according to protocol, the placebo treatment will be terminated for the patients wh o were randomized to arm B. After the"

JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 study is unblinded , the tumor evaluation , survival follow -up, safety information, and so on information collection should be performed as required by the protocol. Planned number of patients: Expected median PFS time is about 7 months for standard chemotherapy. With an expected enrollment of 14 months, 280 patients (140 per arm) are needed to observe 200 PFS events at approximately 25 months after the first patient is randomized in order to det ect the PFS improvement of HR=0.67 with 80% power at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05, assuming the dropout rate is 5% over 12 months for PFS.

Statistical methods: Sample size determination The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint PFS. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Expected median PFS time is about 7 months for standard chemotherapy. With an expected enrollment of 14 months, 280 patients (140 per arm) are nee ded to observe 200 PFS events at approximately 25 months after the first patient is randomized in order to detect the PFS improvement of HR = 0.67 with 80% power at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05, assuming the dropout rate is 5% over 12 months for PFS.

18,page_18,"19 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 All patients receiving any amount of JS001 or placebo will be included in the safety analysis set (SS). Patients in the SS will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received. The SS will be the primary analysis set for safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and biomarker analyses. The Per -Protocol Analysis Set ( PPS) will include all ITT patients who do not have any major protocol violations which have significant impact on the primary outcome measures, and have valid baseline and primary output measures. Patients will be analyzed according to the study arm to whi ch they are randomized. Major protocol violations will be defined and inclusion of subjects in the PPS population will be finalized prior to study unblinding. The PPS population will be used for some secondary/exploratory analysis as well as sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoints. Efficacy analysis The primary objective is to compare PFS as assessed by the IRC in ITT population (all randomized patients). The non-parametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each tr eatment arm. The treatment difference in PFS will be assessed by the stratified log -rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e. HR) between the treatment arms. The HR and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Cox model will be reported. The same stratification factors used for randomization will be applied to both the stratified log -rank test and the stratified Cox model. Secondary analyses will be performed for PFS r ates at 1 year and 2 years after randomization, and OS rates at 1 year and 2 years after randomization. The number and proportion of patients with best overall response of CR or PR or SD or progressive disease will be summarized. Objective response rate an d DCR will be determined along with 95% CI. Kaplan -Meier curve will be used to estimate median DoR and OS along with 95% CI in each arm. Safety analysis Extent of exposure to each study drug will be summarized descriptively as the number of cycles received (number and proportion of patients), duration of exposure (days), cumulative total dose received per patient (mg), dose intensity, and relative dose intensity. The number (proportion) of patients requiring dose reduction, interruption, dose delay, and dru g discontinuation due to AEs will be summarized for each study drug. Frequency of the above dose adjustments and discontinuation will be summarized by category. Patient data listings will be provided for all dosing records and for calculated summary statis tics. Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA version 20.0 or higher. For each study treatment, numbers of events and incidence rates will be tabulated by preferred term and system organ class. Serious adverse events, AEs leading to death, and AEs leadin g to withdrawal of patients will be tabulated for each arm. Commonly occurring AEs, i.e. those which occur in 5% or more of the patients in each arm, will be summarized using descriptive statistics. All laboratory test results, physical examination results , vital signs measurements, weight, ECOG performance status, and 12 -lead ECG results will be summarized for each arm using descriptive statistics at each visit for raw numbers and change from baseline. Interim analysis An iDMC will be set up to evaluate sa fety data on an ongoing basis. One interim efficacy analysis of PFS is planned when approximately 130 PFS events in the ITT population have been observed. This is expected to occur approximately 18 months after the first patient is randomized, while the e xact timing of the interim analysis will depend on the actual occurrence of PFS events."

23,page_23,"24 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 1 Introduction 1.1 Background information Toripalimab Injection (JS001) is a humanized IgG 4K (gamma 4, kappa) monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for human programmed cell death -1 (PD -1), a co -inhibitory receptor expressed on T-cells and is being evaluated for the treatment of cancer. JS001 contains serine228 to proline substitution to minimize Fa b arm exchange1. As with other anti -PD-1 antibodies, JS001 has a high affinity and blocks interaction between PD -1 and its ligand, programmed cell death -ligand 1 (PD-L1; B7 -H1 or CD274). However, JS001 differs from other such antibodies in that the binding to PD -1 is more prolonged, as measured by the dissociation constant. Based on the results of nonclinical pharmacology studies performed to date, JS001 binds to human PD -1, blocks the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands. JS001 inhibits the inhibitor y signaling cascade that is triggered by interactions between PD -1 and its ligands. In primary cell - based assays using cells obtained from healthy donors and patients with cancer, JS001 increases T-cell proliferation and effector cytokine production follow ing stimulation with a variety of antigens. However, in the absence of antigen or T -cell receptor engagement by a CD3 antibody, JS001 does not induce any significant cytokine release by unstimulated or pre -stimulated human T-cells in comparison with Nivolu mab (Opdivo® [BMS]), Pembrolizumab (Keytruda® [Merck])or control IgG4 antibody, indicating a low risk of inducing cytokine storm. The binding of JS001 to its target receptor, PD -1, has been characterized using enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) -based binding to plate -immobilized PD -1 fusion protein, flow cytometry based binding to cell surface PD -1, and Biacore based binding affinity analysis. An ELISA -based binding assay demonstrated specific interaction of JS001 with recombinant human and cynomolg us monkey PD -1 extracellular domain fusion proteins, but not with mouse or rat PD-1 fusion proteins. A Flow Cytometry -based binding assay demonstrates the binding of JS001 to human and cynomolgus monkey CD4 and CD8 T -cells. JS001 was confirmed to block interactions between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. Half -maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) of JS001 were determined to be 0.8 nM for PD -L1 and 1.3 nM for PD -L2. JS001 increases T -cell proliferative response and interferon -gamma production in te tanus toxoid and Cytomegalovirus/Epstein -Barr virus (EBV)/Flu peptide recall assays. In addition, JS001 promotes nuclear factor of activated T -cells activation in a Jurkat Reporter System. JS001 binds to PD -1 expressed on activated and memory T -cells to p romote their response to antigenic stimulation. IgG4 heavy chain was selected over other heavy chain isotypes for JS001 to minimize immune effector function against the target cells. JS001 treatment as well as Nivolumab increased CD3+/CD4+/CD8+ human T -cell counts compared with IgG4 treatment. In addition, JS001 treatment leads to complete tumor remission in MC -38 syngeneic tumor model in human PD -1 knock in mice."
24,page_24,"25 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 Following a single intravenous (IV) infusion of JS001 for 30 minutes at doses up to 203 mg/kg to male and female cynomolgus monkeys, there was no effect on mortality, physical examinations, cageside observations, body weights, body weight changes, food consumption, or clinical pathology (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) . The serum concentration of JS001 was quantifiable through 648 hours post -infusion in 3 animals and through 240 hours in 1 (female dosed with 1 mg/kg) animal. At study day 28, all animals had antibodies to JS001 which were not neutralizing as indicated b y the long half -life. The no - observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) of JS001 was 203 mg/kg when administered once via IV infusion for 30 minutes to male and female cynomolgus monkeys. In a good laboratory practice (GLP) -compliant repeat dose toxicology stu dy, following 30 minute IV infusions every 2 weeks over 4 weeks (total of 3 doses) of JS001 at doses up to 100 mg/kg to male and female cynomolgus monkeys, there were no adverse effects on in -life parameters, ophthalmic examination findings, electrocardiog ram (ECG) evaluations, clinical pathology (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), cytokine production, immune phenotype, gross pathology findings, absolute and relative organ weights, and histopathology findings. Although anti -drug a ntibodies (ADA) were observed in 2/10 monkeys in the 100 mg/kg group, 8/10 animals in the 100 mg/kg group maintained drug exposure during the course of the study. Thus, the NOAEL of JS001 in this study was 100 mg/kg when administered every 2 weeks over 4 w eeks (total of 3 doses) via 30 -minute IV infusion to male and female cynomolgus monkeys. No unexpected tissue cross -reactivity was observed with JS001 in a GLP -compliant human tissue cross -reactivity study. JS001 produced plasma membrane and cytoplasmic st aining of mononuclear cells in most human lymphoid tissues (including the lymph node, thymus, and tonsil, as well as gut -associated lymphoid tissue in the colon and bronchus -associated lymphoid tissue in the lung) and select non -lymphoid tissues (including in the esophagus, kidney, and cervix [cytoplasm only]). This staining was expected based on literature reports of PD -1 expression in mononuclear cell types, including T -cells, B -cells, and other myeloid cells2,3. Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for more detailed information about the non -clinical pharmacology, PK, and toxicology of JS0014. Based on analysis of all relevant preclinical pharmacology and toxicology parameters, 1 mg/kg has been selected as a starting dose, which is predicted to have par tial receptor occupancy in the tumor tissue at 14 days post -dose. The selected starting dose is 1/100 of the NOAEL. In the absence of dose -limiting toxicity (DLT), the maximum dose will be 10 mg/kg; this dose level is predicted to provide sustained full re ceptor occupancy and represents 1/10 of the NOAEL on a mg/kg basis. An initial dose escalation Phase I study with 3+3 design was performed in patients with advanced solid tumors (melanoma, urothelial carcinoma [UC], and renal cell carcinoma [RCC])"

JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 followed by a dose expansion phase to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and anti -tumor activity of JS001 administered with 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg IV once every 2 weeks (Q2W) dosing schedule5. A total of 36 patients we re enrolled. The safety and tolerability results showed that no DLT was observed and no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached. The most common treatment -related adverse events (AEs) were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity and the emergence of AEs was not dose re lated. The clinical activity results showed that in 35 evaluable patients, an objective response rate (ORR) of 23% was reached, including complete response (CR) in 1 melanoma patient and partial response (PR) in 7 patients (3 melanoma, 2 UC, and 2 RCC). In addition, 10 patients achieved stable disease (SD) with a disease control rate (DCR) of 51%. The average time to response was 85 days. Four out of 8 patients with objective responses still had ongoing responses as of 24 May 2017, including 1 RCC patient. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis showed a dose -dependent linear exposure with the elimination half -life of 6 to 12 days and 6 out of 64 (9.4%) antidrug antibody (ADA) samples were positive. Using the flow cytometry method of assessing receptor occupancy, JS00 1 bound to the target molecule PD -1 on activated T lymphocytes with full occupancy in all patients in all cohorts after first dose of JS001. The full receptor occupancy was maintained in most patients during the study (332 day). The Phase I clinical trial data indicate that JS001 exhibits a favorable safety profile in humans. Treatment -related AEs were in line with those from approved drugs of the same class. JS001 has demonstrated promising anti -tumor activity, especially in previously unde r-evaluated acral and mucosal melanomas. Phase II/III clinical trials in selected indications are therefore desirable and currently ongoing. A multi -center, open -label, Phase II registration study (CT4) was designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of JS001 in advanced melanoma patients who had failed systemic treatment. JS001 monotherapy was given at 3 mg/kg IV Q2W until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint was ORR assessed by IRC pursuant to RECIST 1.1. The secondary endpoints included DOR, PFS and OS assessed by IRC. A total of 128 melanoma patients were enrolled, by March 15, 2018, 127 evaluable patients of FAS (Full analysis set) had been followed up for at least six months, One complete response ，21 partial respons es and 51 stable diseases were observed, representing an ORR of 17.3% and a DCR of 57.5%.In the subset of chronic UV exposure induced cutaneous melanoma subgroup, ORR and DCR was 31.03% and 65.52% respectively. There was no treatment -related death occurre d in the study. The most common treatment -related adverse events were grade 1 -2, including proteinuria (25%), ALT increase (25%), rash (22%), hyperglycemia (20%), amylase increase (18%), leukopenia (17%), anemia (16%), vitiligo (16%), AST increase (16%), p ruritus (14%) and hypothyroidism (13%). Treatment -related adverse events of grade 3 -4 occurred in 18% of patients. Therefore, at 3 mg/kg Q2W, JS001 had similar safety profile and comparable clinical efficacy with marketed PD -1 antibodies in treating metast atic melanoma. which have been filed for NDAs to the CFDA recently."
26,page_26,"27 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 A Phase Ib/II study in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is ongo ing to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of JS001 as monotherapy. The interim data showed that as of 31 Aug, 2017, 56 NPC patients (81.8% patients failed at least 2 lines of previous treatment) were enrolled into this study, 50 patients have bee n evaluated for clinical efficacy. Among these patients, 12 PR (partial response) and 13 SD (stable disease) were observed (ORR 24.0%, DCR 50.0%). Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for more detailed information about the ongoing clinical trials of JS001 . 1.2 Rationale 1.2.1 Rationale for the trial and selected subject p opulation Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), is a rare malignancy in most parts of the world with < 1 new cases/100,000 while it is endemic in a few countries6. In Southern China, and Southeast Asia, the estimated annual incidence of NPC is 25 -50 new cases/100,0006. The major cause of NPC is Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) infection in conjunction with a high risk human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allotype (mainly HLA -A*11:01 and HLA -A*02:27) populations and envi ronmental factors7,8,9. For advanced stage disease, overall survival (OS) at 5 years is < 10%10. At time of first diagnosis, according to the stage of disease, surgery, radiotherapy and chemo -radiotherapy (C -RT) are the standard treatments11. At time of t umor relapse, or in patients with metastatic disease at first diagnosis, standard first line chemotherapy consists of platinum based regimens. Targeting of epidermal growth factor receptor is also under exploration. Recently, the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin was shown to be superior to that of cisplatin and 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) in terms of progression -free survival (PFS) with an increase from 5.6 months to 7.0 months and hazard ratio (HR) of 0.55, thus establishing that regimen as the standard of care12. Since EBV induces a high level of PD -L1 expression by cancer cells, and EBV antigens aid in immune escape, there is a good rationale to explore the role of anti -PD1 antibodies in advanced NPC13. Preliminary data with anti -PD-1 antibodies used a lone in refractory disease have shown activity in early phase clinical studies, and randomized studies against chemotherapy are underway. The tolerability was as expected for this class of agent with Grade 3 -5 treatment - related AEs including hepatitis, pne umonitis, anemia, facial pain, increase blood creatinine phosphokinase, proteinuria and sepsis, with one treatment -related death due to sepsis14. However, for the first line patients, a combination of chemotherapy with a PD -1 blocker can produce immunogen ic cell death and yield synergistic efficacy. Such a dramatic increase in"
27,page_27,"28 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 survival is reported in other tumor types such as lung cancer (PFS HR 0.53 with the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy as first line therapy). Toripalimab Injection (JS001) is a humanized anti -PD-1 mAb. Preliminary efficacy of JS001 as monotherapy in an ongoing Phase Ib/II study in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, NPC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has shown encouragi ng efficacy with 4/10 PRs in the subset of patients with NPC. In that study, JS001 monotherapy was well tolerated with no safety signal for unexpected drug -related AEs. The trial will also explore the safety and tolerability of the combination of JS001 wit h gemcitabine and cisplatin to support the conduct of this study. Exploratory biomarker analyses including PD -L1 level of expression as well as additional potential predictive biomarkers will be explored in this study, if applicable. 1.2.2 Rationale for dose selection The serum trough concentration of JS001 plateaued after 3 -4 consecutive doses, with the mean steady state trough concentration (C min) at 20~40 μg/mL in the 3 mg/kg Q2W dose group (n = 37). In vitro binding study has showed that JS001 was able to fully saturate PD -1 receptors on T cell surface when its concentration was higher than 20 nM or 3 μg/m L. Given the penetration for antibody into tumor microenvironment, the concentration of JS001 in the peripheral blood is targeted at 25 μg/m L to ensure PD -1 receptor full occupancy on T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment. Results from Phase I studies showed all dose groups of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg JS001 Q2W maintained PD -1 receptor full occupancy during the entire course of treatment. Based o n the PK and receptor occupancy results, 3 mg/kg Q2W was selected as the recommended Phase II dose. In the registration trial NCT03013101 in advanced melanoma (CT4), at 3 mg/kg Q2W, JS001 had similar safety profile and comparable clinical efficacy with marketed PD -1 antibodies in treating metastatic melanoma refractory to standard therapy (Section 1.1 ). A fixed dose of 360 mg JS001 Q3W was also explored in two early phase trials. The PK comparison of two dosing regimens, 3 mg/kg Q2W (N = 11) and 360 mg Q3W (N = 9), showed that the steady state peak concentration of 360 mg Q3W dosing was 153% of 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing (166.53 μg/mL: 95% CI 121.0 to 212.0 vs 108.83 μg/mL: 95% CI 87.5 to 130.0); the steady state trough concentration of 360 mg Q3W dosing was 133% o f 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing (47.92 μg/mL: 95% CI 31.8 to 64.0 vs 36.09 μg/mL: 95% CI 27.7 to 44.5); the estimated AUC 0-Day85 of 360 mg Q3W dosing was 138% of 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing (164993 μg/mL*hr vs 119814 μg/mL*hr). PK model extrapolation predicts the 240 mg Q3W regimen having a similar steady state trough concentration (~ 32 μg/mL) and drug exposure with the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen. Based on the preliminary PK results and extrapolation from PK model, the results from RO and Phase II registration trial in melanoma, 24 0 mg Q3W is therefore selected as the recommended Phase III dose for subsequent clinical studies."
28,page_28,"29 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 1.3 Hypothesis The hypothesis of the study is that Toripalimab Injection (JS001) in combination with chemotherapy shows superiority compared with placebo in comb ination with chemotherapy in terms of PFS. 1.4 Benefit and risk assessment Chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin is now recognized as the standard of care for patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC. In a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, open -label trial, the median PFS was 7.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.4 -10.9 months) in patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.0 -7.0 months) in patients who received 5 -FU plus cisplatin treatment (HR 0.55 [95% CI: 0.44 -0.68], p<0.0001).12 The preliminary clinical benefit of Toripalimab Injection (JS001) as monotherapy in patients with NPC has been shown in a Phase Ib/II study and is consistent with the benefit that can be expected with PD -1 blockers in highly immunogenic tumors. Four out of 10 patients with NPC had PRs, and JS001 was tolerated well (data not published). In this study, chemotherapy will be given to all patients to ensure the standard of care is received and the additional clinical benefit of JS001 will be explored by compar ing PFS after JS001 in combination with chemotherapy versus PFS after placebo in combination with chemotherapy. Benefits in terms of ORR, duration of response (DoR), DCR, and OS will also be evaluated. The safety profile of chemotherapy with gemcitabine pl us cisplatin is well established. In the Phase III, multicenter, randomized, open -label trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC, the most common (> 10%) drug -related AEs for patients treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin were leucopenia, neutr openia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, nausea, and vomiting. A total of 68 (38%) and 9 (5%) patients experienced Grade 3 and Grade 4 drug-related AEs. The most common (> 10%) Grade 3 -4 drug -related AEs included leucopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. No Grade 5 drug -related AEs occurred during the study.12 Based on the known biology of the PD -1 pathway and its importance in immune function, the most likely class of JS001 toxicities are immune -related adverse events (irAE). The frequency and type of irAE manifestations have varied across clinical trials, depending on the treatment targets, patient populations, and the type and dosage of the drug. These symptoms led to dermatitis, enterocolitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies (hypophysitis, thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency) , and less often uveitis, nephritis, arthritis, and inflammatory myopathy.15,16 Treatment with anti -PD-1 agents is commonly associated with diarrhea, although colitis, endocrinopathies, skin toxicity, fatigue and flu -like symptoms (such as fever and myalgias) are less common.17 Eligibility criteria need to be established to exclude patients with a history of"

In a Phase I study of JS001 as monotherapy in patients with a dvanced solid tumors (melanoma, UC, and RCC), no DLT was observed and no MTD was reached at dose levels of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg Q2W. The most common (> 10%) treatment -related Grade 1 -2 AEs were rash, fever, leukopenia, elevated lipase, hypothyroi dism, hyperthyroidism, elevated AST, hyperglycemia, anorexia, neutropenia, elevated amylase, pruritus, elevated ALT, elevated direct bilirubin, elevated total bilirubin, elevated indirect bilirubin, elevated creatine kinase, and fatigue. Six out of 36 (17% ) patients were reported to have Grade 3 AEs and they included proteinuria, elevated lipase, elevated amylase, and elevated direct bilirubin. Serious adverse events were reported in 7 patients but they were all unrelated to JS001.5 The interim analysis of the Phase Ib/II study in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, NPC, and head and neck squamous cell ca rcinoma showed that as of Dec 30, 2017, the clinical database contained preliminary safety data from 213 patients (58 patients with GC, 59 patients with ESCC, 62 patients with NPC and 34patients with HNCC) who had received doses of JS001. Of the 213 treate d patients, 95.5% experienced an adverse event regardless of attribution to JS001. Of the adverse events, 57.9% were Grade 1 or 2 in maximum severity graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03). The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in ≥ 10% of treated patients) included ALT increased, weight decreased, blood bilirubin increased, Platelet count decreased, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, diarrhea, hyponatremia , decreased appetite, asthenia, proteinuria. Treatment -related adverse events (per investigator’s assessment of causality) were reported in 67.3% of patients. 2 Objectives and Endpoints 2.1 Primary objectives The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Toripalimab Injection (JS001) plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy , as measured by IRC-assessed PFS according to RECIST v1.1 in patients with histological/cytological confirmation of recurrent or me tastatic NPC. 2.2 Secondary objectives The secondary objectives of the study are: • To evaluate the efficacy of Toripalimab Injection (JS001) plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, as measured by OS. • To evaluate the efficacy of JS 001 plus c hemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, as measured by investigator - and IRC -assessed ORR, DoR, and DCR according to RECIST v1.1."

The primary endpoint is PFS in all patients. The availabili ty of an archival or fresh tumor biopsy sample is mandatory for histological confirmation of NPC, PD -L1 expression level and"
31,page_31,"32 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 for correlative analyses (i.e., PD -L1 expression). Follow -up optional tissue and/or liquid biopsies will be collected for explorato ry PD tests. Approximately 280 patients who fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms according to the following stratification factors: • ECOG performance st atus (0 versus 1) • Disease stage (recurrent versus metastatic) After stratification, patients will be randomly assigned by Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) to the combination of JS001 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) with gemcitabine and cisplatin given ev ery 3 weeks (Q3W) in 3 -week cycles. Day 1 (baseline) will be defined as the first day a patient receives study medication. Patients will receive JS001 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) on Day 1 of each 3 -week cycle. In Arms A & B, patients will receive gemcitabin e on Days 1 & 8 and cisplatin on Day 1 of each cycle. The chemotherapy will continue until progressive disease, excessive toxicity, noncompliance, withdrawal of consent, or a maximum of 6 cycles, whichever occurs first in the ‘during chemotherapy’ phase. D uring the ‘post - chemotherapy’ phase, patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B will continue treatment with JS001 or placebo as maintenance therapy Q3W until excessive toxicity or progressive disease, withdrawal of consent or Investigator’s judgement or a maxi mum of 2 years. Patients may continue treatment with JS001 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) beyond radiographic progression by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, provided they are experiencing clinical benefit, as assessed by the Investigator in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression, as determined by the Investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic data and clinical status. Patients will be permitted b y sponsor medical monitor or designee and treating physician to continue JS001/placebo after RECIST v1.1 criteria for progressive disease are met if they meet all of the criteria detailed in Section 4.6.2 . Study treatment doses and regimens are described in Section 5. Tumor evaluation scans will be performed at screening (as bas eline) then every 6weeks in the first 12 months then every 9 weeks thereafter until objective disease progression. The management of patients will be based solely upon the results of the tumor evaluation scans conducted by the Investigator. The Review Com mittee (IRC), consisting of independent experts will review all radiologic scans and derive the PFS, ORR, DoR and DCR , according to RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST. Details will be provided in a separate charter. To take into account the specificities of imaging a fter an immuno -modulating agent, both the RECIST version 1.1 and irRECIST will be used to evaluate tumor response. To date, it is considered that a 2 -year period of therapy is adequate to yield the maximum effect of immunotherapeutics. Therefore, after the during chemotherapy phase, responding or stabilized"

38,page_38,"39 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 To assess a ny potential impact on patient eligibility with regards to safety, the Investigator must refer to the IB for detailed information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, AEs, and other significant data pertaining to the investigational product being used in this study. Re-screening under limited conditions should be allowed after consultation with the Sponsor, e.g. when a patient narrowly misses a lab criterion and it’s correctable and not due to rapidly deteriorating condition or progressive disease. Multiple attempts should not be allowed for re - screening. 4.1.4 Patient restrictions The following restrictions may affect patient participation in this study: • Availability to attend visits according to the protocol. • Concomitant medication restrictions as described in Section 4.4. • Women of child -bearing potential must use a double -barrier method of contraception during the study and for at least 60 days following the last dose of study drug and male patients must use a ppropriate contraception methods (total abstinence or condom with spermicide) for at least 60 days after the last dose of study drug. • Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential o Nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female p artner of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 60 days after receipt of the final dose of Toripalimab Injection (JS001) /placebo in combination chemo therapy or 60 days after receipt of the final dose of JS001 /placebo monotherapy. Not engaging in sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. o Female partners (of childbearing potential) of male patients must also use a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period (the same request with female patients). • Strenuous exercise should be avoided up to 72 hours before planned study visits. 4.2 Method of treatment assignment and blinding This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with limited access to the randomization code. Toripalimab Injection (JS001) and placebo will be identical in physical appearance. The treatment each patient will receive will not be disclosed to the Investigator, study center staff, patient, Sponsor, CRO or the I RC. The treatment codes will be held by the"

After written informed consent has been obtained and eligibility has been established, personnel a t the study site will enter demographic and baseline characteristics in the I WRS. For patients eligible for enrollment, the study site will obtain the patient’s randomization number and treatment assignment from the I WRS. Randomization to one of the two t reatment arms will occur in a 1:1 ratio. Permuted -block randomization will be applied to ensure a balanced treatment assignment with respect to the prespecified stratification factors as follow s: • ECOG performance status ( 0 versus 1 ) • Disease stage (recurrent versus metastatic) Patients should receive their first dose of study treatment on the day of randomization if possible. If this is not possible, the first dose should occur within 3 calendar days after randomization. While ADA and trough concentration samples must be collected from patients assigned to the comparator arm to maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, ADA and trough concentration assay results for these patients are generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of this trial. Sponsor personnel or designee responsible for performing ADA and trough concentration assays will be unblinded to patients’ treatment assignments to identify appropriate ADA and trough concentration samples to be analyze d. Samples from patients assigned to the comparator arm will not be analyzed except by request (e.g., to evaluate a possible error in dosing). The Sponsor will offer post -trial access to the study drug Toripalimab (JS001) free of charge to eligible patient s that was assigned to Arm A after 2 years of treatment. For the patients who intent to receive study drug after completing the study will be unblinded. Only patients who are found to be randomized to Arm A may continue to receive Toripalimab ( JS001 ) recha llenge (more details refer to section 4.3.4 ). The process for breaking the blind will be handled through the IWRS. Investigators are strongly discouraged from requesting the blind be broken for an individual patient. If unblinding is necessary for patient management (e.g., in the case of a serious adverse event for which patient management might be affected by knowle dge of treatment assignment), the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by contacting the IWRS. Treatment codes should not be broken except in emergency situations. If the investigator wishes to know the identity of the study drug for any o ther reason, he or she should contact the Medical Monitor directly. The investigator should document and provide an explanation for any premature unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding, unblinding due to a serious adverse event) . Any site that breaks th e blind under inappropriate circumstances may be asked to discontinue its participation in the study."

For regulatory reporting purposes, and if required by local health authorities, the Sponsor w ill break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions (see Section 5.9) that are considered by the investigator or Sponsor to be related to study drug. At the time of end of study, patients who still are under treatment will be unblinded. Only patients who are fo und to be randomized to the JS001 arm may continue to receive JS001 treatment. Before the end of study, all the patients would be unblind ed in advance if the pre-defined stopping boundary is crossed and the Sponsor accepte d the recommendation of unblind t he study recommended by iDMC.

Thereafter, they must be administered curatively and preventively according to the severity of neutropenia. 4.5 Study assessments Flowcharts of scheduled study assessments are provided in Appendix 1. Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. All assessments must be performed and documented for each patient. Patients should be assessed for toxicity prior to each dose; dosing will occur only if th e clinical assessment and local laboratory test values are acceptable. If the timing of a protocol -mandated study visit coincides with a holiday and/or weekend that precludes the visit, the visit should be scheduled on the nearest following feasible date, with subsequent visits rescheduled accordingly. 4.5.1 Informed consent forms and screening log Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study -specific screening tests or evaluations and may be obtained withi n 28 days before initiation of study treatment. Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site."
47,page_47,"48 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that p atients meet all eligibility criteria before randomization. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients pre -screened and/or screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Patients who are treated with IMPs and who show apparent radiographic progression at a tumor response evaluation and have alternative anti -cancer therapies available to them must sign consent at that time to acknowledge deferring these treatment options befor e continuing treatment JS001/placebo, and to have a biopsy of the progressing lesion is strongly recommended. 4.5.2 Medical history and demographic data Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, non -NPC cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking history, use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior to the screening visit. NPC cancer history will include prior cancer therapies, procedures. Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity. 4.5.3 Physical examinations A complete physical examination, according to local practice, should be performed at screening. Any abnormality identified at screening should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. At subsequent visits, limited, symptom -directed physical examinations should be perfo rmed. Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes. New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 4.5.4 Vital signs Vital signs will include measurements of pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature. 4.5.5 Tumor and response evaluations"
48,page_48,"49 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 Screening assessments must include CT scans (with oral/IV contrast unless contraindicated) or MRIs o f the nasopharynx, neck, chest and abdomen. A CT (with contrast) or MRI scan of the head must be done at screening to evaluate CNS metastasis in all patients. An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at bas eline in the event of an equivocal scan. Patients with active or untreated CNS metastases are not eligible for this study. If a CT scan for tumor assessment is performed in a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanner, the CT acquisition must be consis tent with the standards for a full-contrast diagnostic CT scan. Bone scans should also be performed if clinically indicated. At the investigator’s discretion, other methods of assessment of measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1 may be used. Tumor assessme nts performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days of Cycle 1, Day 1 may be used rather than repeating tests. All known sites of disease must be documented at screening and re -assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluat ion. The same radiographic procedure used to assess disease sites at screening should be used throughout the study (e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT scans). Response will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 4) and irRECIST (see Appendix 5). Assessments should be performed by the same evaluator, if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits. Results must be reviewed by the investigator before dosing at the next cycle. Tumor assessments will be performed every 6 weeks (  7 days) for 12 months following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks (  7 days) thereafter, regardless of treatment delays, until disease progression per RECIST v1.1 (for patients in both treatme nt arms), loss of clinical benefit (for patients who continue treatment after disease progression according to RECIST v1.1) withdrawal of consent, initiation of new anti -cancer therapy, death, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. A t the investigator’s discretion, CT scans should be repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected. Patients who are treated with Toripalimab Injection (JS001) /placebo who continue to experience clinical benefit, despite evidence of radiographic progression, will continue tumor assessments as per the schedule listed above. Scans will be submitted for central review to an IRC. 4.5.6 Laboratory, biomarker, and other biological samples Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to the study site's local laboratory for analysis:"

The preferred sample types include: resections, core needle , excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies. If such specimens are not available, any type of specimens including fine - needle aspiration, cell pellet specimens (e.g., from pleural effusion and lavage samples) can also be submitted. 4.5.8 Electrocardio grams and echocardiogram A twelve -lead ECG is required at screening and as clinically indicated. ECGs should be obtained on the same machine whenever possible. Lead placement should be as consistent as possible. ECG recordings should be performed after t he patient has been resting in a supine position. An echocardiogram to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) will be conducted at screening and then if clinically indicated thereafter until discontinuation of study drug. The patients should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings and echocardiogram report. Paper copies of ECG tracings and echocardiogram report will be kept as part of the patient's permanent study file at the site. Any morphologic waveform changes or other ECG abnormalities and echocardiogram abnormalities must be documented on the eCRF. 4.5.9 Patient -reported outcomes (PRO) PRO data will be collected via the E ORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -H&N35 questionnaires to more fully characterize the clinical profile of Toripalimab Injection (JS001). The questionnaires will be translated as required in the local language. To ensure instrument validity and that data standard s meet health authority requirements, questionnaires scheduled for administration during a clinic visit will be completed in their entirety by the patient prior to the performance of non -PRO assessments which will relate to disease status assessment, and t he administration of study treatment. 4.5.10 Timing of assessment 4.5.10.1 Screening/baseline assessment"
52,page_52,"53 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 Screening tests and evaluations will be performed within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.

Results of standard -of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 may be used; such tests do not need to be repeated for screeni ng. See Appendix 1 for the schedule of screening assessments and Appendix 2 for the schedule of ADA , trough concentration , and biomarker sampling. 4.5.10.2 Assessments during treatment All treatment visits must occur within  3 days from the scheduled date unless otherwise noted (see Appendix 1). All procedures, tests and assessments will be performed on the day of the specified visit unless a time window is spec ified. Assessments scheduled on the day of study treatment administration (Day 1) of each cycle should be performed prior to study treatment infusion unless otherwise noted. If scheduled dosing and study assessments are precluded because of a holiday, week end, or other event, then dosing may be postponed to the soonest following date, with subsequent dosing and visits continuing on a 21-day schedule. If treatment was postponed for fewer than 3 days, the patient can resume the original schedule. See Appendi x 1 and Appendix 2 for the schedule of treatment period. 4.5.10.3 Assessment at treatment discontinuation visit Patients who discontinue study treatment will return to the clinic for a treatment discontinuation visit within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. The visit at which a response assessment shows progressive disease according to RECIST v1.1 or loss of clinical benefit may be used as the treatment discontinuation visit. If the study drug infusion delay ed and discontinue d subsequently, and the interval between last dose of study treatment and decision of treatment discontinuation probably is near or longer than 30 days, the investigator should complete Treatment Discontinuation Visit as early as they can after patients formally withdrawal from study treatment. See the study flowcharts provided in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 for assessments to be performed at the treatment discontinuation visit. Patients who discontinue study treatment must be followed according to the follow -up visit schedule for progression and/or survival until death, loss to follow -up, or withdrawal of consent, which will be defined as study discontinuation."

JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 • Symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator after integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy results, and clinical status • Intolerable toxicity related to study treatment, including development of an immune -mediated adverse event determined by the investigator to be unacceptable given the individual patient’ s potential response to therapy and severity of the event • Any medical condition that may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he or she continues on study treatment • Use of another non -protocol anti -cancer therapy (see Section 4.4.2 ) • Pregnancy • Radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 Exception: Patients will be permitted by sponsor medical monitor or designee and treating physician to continue Toripalimab Injection (JS001) /placebo after RECIST v1.1 criteria for progressive disease are met if they meet all of the following criteria: • Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator • Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values [e.g., new or worsening hypercalcemia]) indicating unequivocal progression of disease • No decline in ECOG performance status that can be attributed to disease progression • Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningea l disease) that cannot be readily managed and stabilized by protocol -allowed medical interventions prior to repeat dosing • Patients must provide written consent to acknowledge deferring any standard treatment options that may exist in favor of continuing JS 001/placebo treatment at the time of initial progression. Patients who experience second progression (taking as reference the smallest sum after first progression) according to RECIST v1.1 should permanently discontinue JS001/placebo treatment. In during chemotherapy phase, if patients experience progressive disease according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, chemotherapy must be discontinued without exception. The primary reason for study drug discontinuation should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. 4.6.3 Study an d Site Discontinuation"
55,page_55,"56 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons for terminating the study may include but are not limited to the following: • The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to patients. • Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory. The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study. The Sponsor has the right to close a site at any time. Reasons for closing a site may incl ude but are not limited to the following: • Excessively slow recruitment • Poor protocol adherence • Inaccurate or incomplete data recording • Non-compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice • No study act ivity (i.e., all patients have completed and all obligations have been fulfilled) 5 Assessment of Safety JS001 has been approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progression on or after previous systemic t reatment on the basis of a single arm trial in December 2018 in China. The indications for nasopharyngeal carcinoma are currently in clinical development. Human experience is currently limited and the entire safety profile is not known at this time. The fo llowing information is based on results from nonclinical and clinical studies and published data on similar molecules. 5.1 Safety plan Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this trial, including the use of stringent inclusio n and exclusion criteria (see Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 ) and close monitoring (as indicated below and in Section 4.5). See Section 5.5 for complete details regarding safety reporting for th is study. Administration of Toripalimab Injection (JS001) /placebo will be performed in a monitored setting where there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate equipment/medicine to manage potentially serious reactions. All adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for up to 60 days after the last dose of study treatment. Investigators are instructed to report all serious adverse events considered related to study"
56,page_56,"57 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 treatment regardless of time after study. The potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid or minimize such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 5.2 Risks associated with toripalimab injection (JS001) The PD -L1/PD -1 pathway is involved in peripheral tolerance; therefore, such therapy may increase the risk of immune -mediated adverse events, specifically the induction or enhancement of autoimmune conditions. Adverse events with potentially immune -mediated causes, including interstitial lung disease, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, liver function disorder, pancreatitis and hyperglycemia , have been observed in previous clinical studies which investigated safety and efficacy of JS001 in solid tumors. For further details regarding clinical safety, see the JS001 Investigator’s Brochure. Suggested workup procedures for suspected immune -mediated AEs are provided in Section 5.3.3 and Appendix 13 . 5.3 Risks associ ated with gemcitabine Infusion times of gemcitabine longer than 60 minutes and more frequent than weekly dosing have been shown to increase toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine. In cases of severe lung toxicity, gemcitabine therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care measures instituted. Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia has been reported with gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Monitor for myelosuppression should occur prior to each cycle. Hemolytic -uremic syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis , despite discontinuation of therapy, has been rarely reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gem citabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Use caution in patients with pre -existing renal impairment or hepatic insufficiency. For more details regarding the safety profile of gemcitabine, see the appropriate Package Insert . 5.3.1 Risk associated with cisplatin"
57,page_57,"58 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 Cisplatin is known to cause myelosuppression, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Cisplatin -based chemotherapy is considered to be moderately emetogenic. Patients will be monitored for cisplatin -related adverse events. For more details regarding the safety profile of cisplatin, refer to the appropriate package insert or national prescribing information as needed. 5.3.2 General plan to manage safety concerns 5.3.2.1 Monitoring Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and non serious adverse events defined and graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0. Patients will be assessed for safety (including laboratory values) according to the schedule in Appendix 1. Laboratory values must be re viewed prior to each infusion. General safety assessments will include serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistries and blood counts (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 for the list and timing of study assessments). During the study, patients will be closely monitored for the development of any signs or symptoms of autoimmune conditions and infection. All serious adverse events will be reported in an expedited fashion (see Section 5.4.2 ). In addition, the iDMC and Medical Monitor will review and evaluate observed adverse events on a regular basis. Patients wi ll be followed for safety for 60 days following their last dose of study drug. Patients who have an ongoing study treatment related adverse event upon study completion or at discontinuation from the study will be followed until the event has resolved to ba seline grade, the event is assessed by the investigator as stable, the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 5.3.3 Toripalimab injection (JS001) /placebo dosage modification and management of specific adverse events 5.3.3.1 Dose modification There will be no dose reduction for JS001/placebo in this study. Patients may temporarily suspend study treatment for up to 56 days beyond the last d ose if they experience an adverse event that requires a dose to be held. If because of adverse events JS001 /placebo is held for up to"
58,page_58,"59 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 56 days beyond the last dose, then the patient will be discontinued from treatment and will be followed for safety and eff icacy as specified in Section 5.4.1 . If a patient must be tapered off steroids used to treat adverse events, JS001/placebo may be held for additional time beyond 5 6 days (but not more than 12 weeks) from the last dose until steroids are discontinued or reduced to ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent dose. In during chemotherapy phase, for patients who suspend JS001/placebo, if the adverse event was clearly relate d to JS001/placebo alone, chemotherapy could continue after consulting sponsor Medical Monitor, if fulfill appropriate organ function. If the chemotherapy should be suspended due to the chemotherapy -related adverse events based on investigators’ judgement, the JS001/Placebo administration may be adjusted or not be adjusted accordingly. JS001/placebo may be continued if the adverse event was clearly related to chemotherapy alone. Overlapping toxicities that may be due to either chemotherapy or JS001/placebo (e.g., pulmonary, renal, or hepatic toxicity) should result in temporary disconti nuation of both chemotherapy and JS001/placebo. 5.3.3.2 Management of toripalimab injection (JS001) /placebo specific adverse events Toxicities associated or possibly associated with JS001 /placebo treatment should be managed according to standard medical practice. Additional tests, such as autoimmune serology or biopsies, should be used to determine a possible immunogenic etiology. Although most immune -mediated adverse events observed with immunomo dulatory agents have been mild and self -limiting, such events should be recognized early and treated promptly to avoid potential major complications. Discontinuation of JS001 /placebo may not have an immediate therapeutic effect and, in severe cases, immun e-mediated toxicities may require acute management with topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, mycophenolate, or TNF - inhibitors. The investigator should consider the benefit -risk balance a given patient may be experiencing prior to further ad ministration of JS001 /placebo . Adverse events that require temporary discontinuation of JS001/placebo must resolve to Grade 0 -1 and the subject must be on < 10 mg/d of prednisone or equivalent dose prior to resumption of dosing. JS001/placebo should be permanently discontinued in patients with life -threatening immune -mediated adverse events. The most common irAEs are: fatigue, pruritus, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, constipation, and nausea. Refer to most recent version of Investigator Brochure or Appendix 13 concerning the irAEs manifestations and management4."

63,page_63,"64 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 protocol -specified vital signs, and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 5.6. 5.4.1 Adverse events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutic al product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: • Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal prod uct, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product • Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in Section 5.5.5.9 . • Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline • Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is assoc iated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug • Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment of study treatment ( e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 5.4.2 Serious adverse events (immediately reportable to the sponsor) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: • Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes o r leads to death) • Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue mi ght have caused death. • Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.5.5.11 ) • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) • Is a congenit al anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study drug."
64,page_64,"65 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 • Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) The terms ""severe"" and ""serious"" are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]; see Section 5.5.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). Severity and s eriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF. Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event ; see Sectio n 5.6.1 for rep orting instructions). 5.4.3 Adverse events of special interest (immediately reportable to the sponsor) Non-serious adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event) , no need to report to HA. Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: • Suspected immune -related my ocarditis: an increase in myocardial enzymes associated with changes in the electrocardiogram or clinical symptoms. • Abnormal liver function which meet the criteria of Hy’s law: elevated ALT or AST (> 3 × ULN) in combination with either an elevated total bi lirubin (> 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia. 5.5 Methods and timing for capturing and assessing safety parameters The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Sectio n 5.4.1 for definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.6 to 5.8. For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.4.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section 5.5.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.5.4 )."
65,page_65,"66 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 5.5.1 Adverse event reporting period Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact. All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personn el, will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive proce dures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.6.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). After initiation of study drug , all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be reported until 60 days after the last dose of study drug. After this period, the investigator should report any serious adverse events that are believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see Section 5.8). 5.5.2 Eliciting adverse event information A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints. Examples of non -directive questions include the following: ""How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"" ""Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last her e?"" 5.5.3 Assessment of severity of adverse events The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v5.0) will be used for assessing adverse event severity. Table 9 will be used for assessing severity for adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

The following guidance should be taken into consideration: • Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study dr ug • Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable) • Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments • Known associat ion of the event with the disease under study • Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event"
67,page_67,"68 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 • Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the occurre nce of the event For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each protocol -mandated therapy. 5.5.5 Procedures for recording adverse events Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording a dverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.5.5.1 Infusion -related reactions Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours a fter study drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., ""infusion -related reaction"") on the Adverse Event module. If possible, avoid ambiguous terms such as ""systemic reaction."" Associate d signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction module. If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event module, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction module. 5.5.5.2 Diagnosis versus signs and symptoms For adverse events other than infusion -related reactions (see Section 5.5.5.1 ), diagnoses (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms. For example, if a patient has pain in the leg that is eventually diagnosed as being a symptom of deep vein thrombosis, then only deep vein thrombosis should be entered as an adverse event. For example, if a patient is hospitalized with shortness of breath, and pulmonary embolism, pneumonia or pneumonitis are differential diagnoses , report the appropriate adverse event term following confirmation of the diagnosis. Prior to obtaining the confirmed diagnosis, it is sufficient to report the symptoms. Once the diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse even ts based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by the adverse event(s) representing the diagnosis. 5.5.5.3 Adverse events that are secondary to other events In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or cli nical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious"
68,page_68,"69 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 secondary events. A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: • If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. • If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. • If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. • If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF . • If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated. 5.5.5.4 Persistent or recurrent adverse events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reporte d. If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme intensity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Details regarding any increases or decreases in severity will be captured on the Adverse Event Intensity or Grade Changes eCRF . If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.6.1 for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from ""non -serious"" to ""serious,"" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.5.5.5 Abnormal laboratory values Not every laborat ory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:"
69,page_69,"70 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 • Is accompanied by clinical symptoms • Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) • Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy • Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment Note: For oncology trial s, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse events. It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5  ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above o r below the normal range (e.g., ""elevated potassium,"" as opposed to ""abnormal potassium""). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as ""hyperkalemia."" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.5.5.4 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.5.5.6 Abnormal vital sign values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: • Is accompanied by clinical symptoms • Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) • Results in a medical intervention or a cha nge in concomitant therapy • Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment"
70,page_70,"71 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g. high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.5.5.4 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.5.5.7 Abnormal liver function tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (  3  ULN) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2  ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy's law). Therefore, regardless of causality (including cholestasis, or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia) investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with total bilirubin  2  ULN (of which  35% is direct bilirubin) Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with clinical jaundice The m ost appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.5.5.2 ) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), as a serious adverse event. 5.5.5.8 Deaths For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint. Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event re porting period (see Section 5.5.1 ) that are attributed by the investigator solely to progression of NPC should be recorded as “ disease progression ” on the Adverse Event eCRF. All other on -study deaths, regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor except for those that occur due to PD after the AE reporting period, will be reported in th e survival follow - up page (see Section 5.6.1 ). Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on"
71,page_71,"72 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. The term ""sudden death"" should be used only for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presu med cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour after the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, ""unexplained death"" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death"" should be replaced by the established ca use of death. During survival follow -up, deaths attributed to progression of NPC should be recorded only on the Survival eCRF. 5.5.5.9 Preexisting medical conditions A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., ""more frequent headaches""). 5.5.5.10 Worsening of nasopharyngeal cancer Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only. In most cases, the expected pattern of progression will be bas ed on RECIST v1.1 criteria. In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be on the basis of symptomatic deterioration. However, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria. If there is any uncertai nty as to whether an event is caused by disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event. 5.5.5.11 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and re ported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.4.2 ), except as outlined below. The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be serious adverse events: • Hospitalization for respite care"

An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment itself is not an adverse event, unless it results in untoward medical ef fects. Any overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be noted on the Study Drug Administration eCRF. All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded in the Adverse Event eCRF. I f the associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.6.1 ). 5.5.5.13 Patient -reported outcome data Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by the Sponsor, and safety analyses will not be performed using PRO data. However, if any PRO responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO data, the investigator will determine whether the criteria for an adverse event have been met and, if so, will report the event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.6 Immediate reporting requirements from investigator to sponsor Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial. The investigator must report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should repo rting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event. The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: • Seriou s adverse events (see Sec tion 5.6.1 for further details) • Pregnancies (see Section 5.6.2 for further details)"

JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 Instructions for reporting post -study adverse events are provided in Section 5.8. 5.6.2 Reporting requirements for pregnancies 5.6.2.1 Pregnancies in female patients Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 60 days after the last dose of study drug. A Pregnancy Report Form should be completed by the investigator and submitted to Junshi Safety Risk Management designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy). Pregnancies should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the patient s hould continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy. Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available. 5.6.2.2 Pregnancies in female partners of male patients Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 60 days after the last dose of study drug. A Pregnancy Report Form should be completed by the investigator and submitted to Junshi Safety Risk Management designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy). Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug. The pregnant partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy. Once the authorization has been signed, the investigat or will update the Pregnancy Report Form with additional information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy. An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the pos sible effects on the fetus to support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician. 5.6.2.3 Abortions Any abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significa nt), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.6.2 )."
75,page_75,"76 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 5.6.2.4 Congenital anomalies/birth defects Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.6.2 ). 5.7 Follow -up of patients after adverse events 5.7.1 Investigator follow -up The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the patient withdra ws consent. Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) shoul d be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification. All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome. 5.7.2 Sponsor follow -up For serious adverse events, and p regnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in or der to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 5.8 Post-study adverse events The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 60 days after the last dose of study drug), if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment. All deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported through use of the Long -Term Survival Follow - up eCRF. The investigator shoul d report these events directly to Junshi or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators."
76,page_76,"77 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 5.9 Expedited reporting to health authorities, inv estigators, institutional review boards, and ethics committees The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate the suspected adverse drug reaction that are both serious and u nexpected , or possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable health authorities based on local regulations. To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will assess the expectedness of these events using the JS001 Investigator's Brochure as a reference. The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference docum ent. Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed. An iDMC will monitor safety data during the study. An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the test product will be submitted to health authorities. 6 Statistical Considerations and Analysis Plan This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, multi -center, double blinded, Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy an d safety of Toripalimab Injection (JS001) in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin compared with placebo in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin as first - line treatment in patients with histological/cytological confirmation of recurrent or metastatic NPC. Primary and secondary analyses (PFS, OS) will be performed on all randomized patients (i.e., ITT) irrespective of whether the assigned treatment was actually received. ORR and DCR analyses will be performed on all randomized patients who have measurabl e disease at baseline. DOR analyses will be performed on the subset of patients who achieve an objective response. For all efficacy analyses, patients will be grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization. The Per -Protocol Analysis Set (PPS ) will include all ITT patients who do not have any major protocol violations , which have significant impact on the primary outcome measures , and have valid baseline and primary output measures. Patients will be analyzed according to the study arm to which they are randomized. Major protocol violations will be defined and inclusion of subjects in the PPS population will be finalized prior to study unb linding. The PPS population will be used for some secondary/exploratory analysis as well as sensitivity anal ysis of the primary efficacy endpoints."
77,page_77,"78 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 The safety population will include all randomized patients who received any amount of study drug. Patients who are randomized into the study but did not receive any amount of study drug will not be included in the sa fety populati on. 6.1 Determination of Sample Size The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint PFS. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. A total of 280 patients (140 per arm) are needed to observe 200 PFS events at approximately 25 mont hs after the first patient is randomized in order to detect the PFS improvement of HR = 0.67 with 80% power at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05; The calculation of the sample size is based on the following assumptions: • PFS is exponentially distributed. • The median PFS is 7 months for the standard chemotherapy. • The interim and final analyses of PFS use the Lan DeMets alpha spending function to approximate the O’Brien Fleming boundary . • The recruitment of 280 patients will take place over 14 months. • The dropout rate is 5% over 12 months for PFS. 6.2 Summaries of conduct of study The number of patients who enroll, discontinue, or complete the study will be summarized. Reasons for premature study withdrawal will be listed and summarized. Enrollment and major protocol deviations will be listed and evaluated for their potential effects on the interpretation of study results. 6.3 Summaries of treatment group comparability Demographic and baseline characteristic, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline disease characteristics, ECOG performance status, EBV virus copy number and PD -L1 expression, will be summarized by treatment arm. Baseline measurements are the last available data obtained prior to the first dose of study drug. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, and range) will be presented for continuous data and frequencies and percentages will be presented for categorical data. 6.4 Efficacy analyses 6.4.1 Primary efficacy endpoint"
78,page_78,"79 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the o ccurrence of disease progression, as determined by IRC from tumor assessments, per RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who have not experienced disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the last tumor assessment. Patients with no post -baseline tumor assessment will be censored on the date of randomization. For patients who have two consecutive missing tumor assessments, PFS will be censored at the time of the last available tumor assessment before the missing assessments. Due to COVID -19 pandemic, for patients who have two consecutive missing tumor assessments due to COVID -19 pandemic’s impact, if a subsequent tumor assessment becomes available and does not show disease progressio n, the tumor assessment will be used in the PFS analysis and if the subsequent tumor assessment is disease progression, PFS will still be censored at the time of the last available tumor assessment before the missing assessments . The hypothesis test for PF S will be conducted at a two -sided alpha level of 0.05. The null and alternative hypotheses can be phrased in terms of the PFS survival functions S A(t) and S B(t) for Arm A and Arm B, respectively: H0: SA(t) = SB(t) versus H 1: SA(t) ≠ SB(t) The two -sided log-rank test, stratified by ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1), and disease stage (recurrent vs. metastatic), as recorded in the I WRS, will be used as the primary analysis to compare PFS between the two treatment arms. The hazard ratio ( HR) for disease pro gression or death will be estimated with the use of a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. The 95% CI for the HR will be provided. Results from an unstratified analysis will also be provided. The Kaplan -Meier methodology will be applied to estimat e the median PFS for each treatment arm, and Kaplan -Meier curves will be developed. The Brookmeyer -Crowley methodology will be used to construct the 95% CI for the median PFS for each treatment arm. 6.4.2 Secondary efficacy endpoints 6.4.2.1 Overall survival The OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Data from patients who are alive at the time of the analysis will be censored as of the last date they are known to be alive. The methods outlined for PFS will be used for the OS analysis. 6.4.2.2 Objective response rate An objective response is defined as either a confirmed CR or a PR, as determined by the investigator and IRC using RECIST v1.1. Patients not meeting these criteria, including patients without any post baseline tumor assessment, will be considered non responders."
79,page_79,"80 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who had an objective response. The analysis population for ORR will be all randomized patients with measurable disease at baseline. An estimate of ORR and its 95% CI will be calcu lated using the Clopper -Pearson method for each treatment arm. CIs for the difference in ORRs between the two treatment arms will be determined using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. 6.4.2.3 Disease control rate DCR is defined as the rate of patients with CR or PR as best response or stable disease maintained for 6 weeks , as determined by the investigator and IRC per RECIST v1.1. The methods outlined for ORR will be used for the DCR analysis. 6.4.2.4 Duration of response DOR will be assessed in pa tients who have an objective response as determined by the investigator and IRC using RECIST v1.1. DOR is defined as the time interval from the date of the first occurrence of a CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that progr essive disease or death is documented, whichever occurs first. Patients who have not progressed and who have not died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment date. If no tumor assessments are performed after the date of the first occurrence of a CR or PR, DOR will be censored at the date of the first occurrence of a CR or PR plus 1 day. The methods detailed for PFS will be used for the DOR analysis. 6.4.2.5 Investigator -assessed PFS PFS assessed by investigators per RECIST v 1.1 be analyzed in the same way as done for the IRC-assessed PFS. 6.4.2.6 Survival rates of PFS and OS The OS and investigator - and IRC -assessed PFS rates at 1 and 2 years after randomization will be estimated with the use of the Kaplan Meier methodology for each treatment arm, along with 95% C I’s that are calculated with use of the standard error derived from Greenwood’s formula. The 95% CI for the difference in the OS rate between the two treatment arms will be estimated with use of the normal approximation met hod. 6.4.2.7 Progression -free survival, objective response rate, disease control rate and duration of response per immune -related RECIST"
80,page_80,"81 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 Analyses using irRECIST for PFS, ORR, DCR and DOR as determined by the investigator and IRC will be conducted. The applicable methods outlined for PFS and ORR will be used for these analyses. 6.4.2.8 Patient -reported outcomes Summary statistics (mean, SD, median, and range) of absolute scores and mean changes from the baseline will be calculated for all disease and/or treatment related symptom items and subscales of the EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -H&N35 at each assessment timepoint for each arm during the administration of the treatment and the survival follow up period. The mean (and 95% CI) and median of the absolute scores and the changes from the baseline will be reported for interval and continuous variables. Previously -published minimally -important differences will be used to identify meaningful change from the baseline within each treatment group on the disease and/or treatment related symptoms scales19). The EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -H&N35 data will be scored according to the EORTC scoring manual. In the event of incomplete data, if the scale has more than 50% of the constituent items completed, a pro -rated score will be computed that is c onsistent with the scoring manual and the validation papers of the measure. For subscales with less than 50% of the items completed, the subscale will be considered missing. PRO completion, compliance rates, and reasons for missing data will be summarize d at each timepoint by treatment arm. 6.4.3 Exploratory efficacy endpoints 6.4.3.1 Subgroup analyses To assess the consistency of the study results in subgroups defined by demographics (e.g., age, sex, and race/ethnicity), baseline prognostic characteristics (e.g., ECOG performance status, disease stage, EBV virus copy number, and PD -1 expression status), the IRC-assessed PFS in these subgroups will be examined. Summaries of PFS, including unstratified HRs estimated from Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan -Meier estimates of median PFS, will be produced separately for each level of the categorical variables for the comparisons between treatment arms. 6.5 Safety analyses Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population (see Section 6). Summaries will be presented for the safety -evaluable population by treatment arm. Study drug exposure, including treatment duration, number of doses, and dose intensity, will be summarized for each treatment arm using descriptive statistics."
81,page_81,"82 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 Verbatim description of adverse events will be mapped to MedDRA thesaurus terms and graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0. All adverse events occurring during or after the first study drug dose will be summarized by treatment arm and NCI CTCAE grade. In addition, serious adverse events, s evere adverse events (Grade 3, 4, and 5), and adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation or interruption will be summarized accordingly. Multiple occurrences of the same event will be counted once at the maximum severity. The proportion of patien ts experiencing at least one adverse event will be reported by toxicity term and treatment arm. Deaths reported during the study treatment period and those reported during the follow -up period after treatment completion/discontinuation will be summarized b y treatment arm. Laboratory data with values outside the normal ranges will be identified. In addition, selected laboratory data will be summarized by treatment arm. Serum levels and incidence of ADA against JS001 will be summarized to explore the potent ial relationship of the immunogenicity response with pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy. 6.6 Immunogenicity analyses The incidence and titers of Anti -JS001 antibodies will be summarized descriptively to explore the potential relationship of the immunogen icity response with pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy. 6.7 Biomarker analyses Whole blood biomarker samples will be separated by density gradient centrifugation to acquire Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (P BMC) and plasma. P BMC will be stored in liqui d nitrogen and plasma will be stored at -80°C until further analysis. Plasma or serum samples will be analyzed for EBV DNA copy number, proinflammatory cytokine s, immune -checkpoint related soluble proteins, etc., upon Toripalimab Injection (JS001) treatment to explore the prognosis and potential relationship with efficacy. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (P BMC) will be analyzed by flow cytometry for lymphocyte subgroup analysis, expression and modulation of PD -1 and other co -signaling receptors upon JS001 treatment to explore potential relationship with efficacy. Tumor biopsy samples prior to treatment and at the time of apparent disease progression will be collected and evaluated by immune -histochemistry (IHC) staining to explore PD -L1 expression and presence of tumor infiltration CD8+ lymphocyte (TIL). For the patients enrolled in the sites of Mainland China, the pathological classification will be uniformly and clearly classified according to the World Health Organization Classification in 2017 . When available, whole exon sequencing will be performed on tumor tissues to evaluate tumor mutation burden (TMB). PD -"

JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 L1 expression level and percentage, presence of CD8+ lymphocyte and TMB within tumor tissues will be a nalyzed for potential relationship with efficacy. 6.8 Interim analysis An iDMC will be set up to evaluate safety data on an ongoing basis, as well as the efficacy data for the planned interim efficacy analysis. All summaries/analyses by treatment arm for th e iDMC’s review will be prepared by an independent party. Members of the iDMC will be external to the Sponsor and will follow a charter that outlines their roles and responsibilities. A detailed plan will be included in the iDMC Charter. One interim eff icacy analysis of PFS is planned when approximately 130 PFS events in the ITT population have been observed. This is expected to occur approximately 18 months after the first patient is randomized, while the exact timing of the interim analysis will depen d on the actual occurrence of PFS events. The final analysis of PFS will be conducted when approximately 200 PFS events in the ITT population have been observed. This is expected to occur approximately 25 months after the first patient is randomized, whil e the exact timing of the final analysis will depend on the actual occurrence of PFS events. To control the type I error for PFS analyses at a two -sided significance level of 0.05, the stopping boundaries for PFS interim and final analys es have been compu ted with use of the Lan - DeMets approximation to the O’Brien -Fleming boundary20 as shown in Table 10.

Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of eCRFs. Sites will be responsible for data entry into the ED C system. In the event of"
83,page_83,"84 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 discrepant data, the CRO will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. The CRO will produce a Data Quality Plan that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data. Central laboratory data will be sent directly to the Sponsor or CRO, using the CRO's standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, inclu ding approval of the CRO’s data management plans and specifications. Data will be periodically transferred electronically from the CRO to the Sponsor, and CRO ’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail. System backups for data stored at the CRO and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the CRO’s standard procedures. 7.2 Electronic case report for ms eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system. Sites will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordanc e with instructions from the Sponsor. All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. eCRFs should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. At the end of the study, the investigator will receive p atient data for his or her site in a readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. 7.3 Source data documentation Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verific ation to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are r ecorded and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from au tomated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and me dico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial."
84,page_84,"85 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5. To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must pr ovide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial -related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 7.4 Use of computerized systems When clini cal observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health aut hority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable au dit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change. 7.5 Retention of records Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of IMP and NIMP, including eCRFs, Informed Consent Forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for the length of time require d by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer. After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations. No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor. Written notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location. 8 Ethical Considerations 8.1 Compliance with laws and regulations"

The Principal Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the requireme nts, policies, and procedures established by the IRB/EC. Investigators are also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol amendments (see Section 9.6). In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse events to the Sponsor, investigators must comply with requirements of local regulations for reporting serious adverse events to the local health authority and IRB/EC. Investigators may rece ive written IND safety reports or other safety -related communications from the Sponsor. Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with health authority requirements and the policies and procedure s established by their IRB/EC, and archived in the site’s study file. 8.4 Confidentiality"
87,page_87,"88 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enrolled in the study through assignment of a unique patient identification number. This means th at patient names are not included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location. Patient medical information obtained by this study is confidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separat e authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or required by law. Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare, for treatment purposes. Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses, data derived from exploratory biomarker specimens will generally not be provided to study investigators or patients unless required by law. Data gener ated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by representatives of national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, as appropriate. 8.5 Financial Disclosure Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health author ities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study. 9 Study Documentation, Monitoring, and Administration 9.1 Study documentation The investigator mu st maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented, including, but not limited to, the protocol, protocol amendments, Informed Consent Forms, and documentation of IRB/EC and governmental approval. In additio n, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive the patient data, including an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to data. 9.2 Protocol deviations"
88,page_88,"89 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 The investigator should document and explain any protocol deviations. The invest igator should promptly report any deviations that might have an impact on patient safety and data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC policies and procedures. 9.3 Site inspections Site visits will be conducted by t he Sponsor or an authorized representative for inspection of study data, subjects’ medical records, and eCRFs. The investigator will permit national and local health authorities; Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators; and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 9.4 Administrative structure This study will be sponsored and managed by Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. Approximately 40 sites in China mainland, Taiwan, Singapore, will participate in the study and approximately 280 patients will be randomized. Randomization will occur through an I WRS. Central facilities will be used for study assessments throughout the study (e.g., specified laboratory tests). Accredited local laboratories will be used for routine monitoring; local laboratory ranges will be collected . 9.5 Publication of data and protection of trade secrets Regardless of the outcome of a trial, the Sponsor is dedicated to openly providing information on the trial to healthcare professionals and to the public, both at scientific congresses and in peer - reviewed journals. The Sponsor will comply with all requirements for publication of study results. The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific congresses. For all clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization application has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to submit a journal manuscript reporting primary clinical trial results within 6 months after the availability of the respective Clinical Study Report. In addition, for all clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization application has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to publish results from analyses of additional endpoints and exploratory data that are clinically meaningful and statistically sound. The investigator must agree to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor prior to submission for publication or presentation. This allows the Sponsor to protec t proprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to the investigator."
89,page_89,"90 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of multi center trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data. In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements. Any formal publication of the study in which contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the appropriate Sponsor per sonnel. Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from the use of data from this study will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise. 9.6 Protocol amendments Any protocol amendments will be prepared by the Sponsor. Protocol amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC and to regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulatory requirements. Approval must be obtained from the IRB/EC and regulatory authoriti es (as locally required) before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients or changes that involve logistical or administrative aspects only (e.g., change in Medical Monitor or contact informati on). 10 Independent data monitoring committee An independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) will be assembled to evaluate safety data for this study. The iDMC will consist of at least 2 clinicians and 1 biostatistician with expertise in oncology trials. Th e safety of the subjects will be determined by risk/benefit assessment at periodic data review meetings until the final PFS analysis. The iDMC will also review the efficacy data for the planned interim analysis. Following the data review, the iDMC will pro vide a recommendation as to whether the study may continue, whether amendment(s) to the protocol should be implemented, or whether the study should be stopped. The final decision will rest with the Sponsor. A separate iDMC Charter document will specify th e procedures governing the conduct of the iDMC. 11 References 1.

New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Eur J Cancer 2009; 45: 228-247. 1 Inclusion Criteria Only subjects with measurable tumors at baseline can be enrolled into the trial protocol with objective tumor response rate as the primary endpoint. 2 Definition Measurable Disease—At least 1 measurable lesion. Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm); 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (when superficial); 20 mm by chest X -ray (if clearly defined). Malignant lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in s hort axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). Non-measurable Disease —All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter > 10 mm or pathological lymph node short axis ≥ 10 to <15 mm) and really non-measurable lesions . Lesions that are deemed as really non -measurable include l eptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. Exceptions of Measurable Disease: Including b one lesions , cystic lesions and lesions with prior local treatment . Bone scan, PET scan, or X-ray plain films cannot be used for measureme nt of bone lesions, but can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions . Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as C T or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. If non -cystic lesions and c ystic lesions coexist, non -cystic lesions are preferred for selection as target lesions. Tumor l esions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion."
100,page_100,"101 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 All measurements should be recorded in metric notat ion, using rulers or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 3 Measurement Methods The same method of assessment and the same tec hnique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules , palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesio ns, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible method s to measure target lesions. Conventional CT and MRI us e a continuous ≤ 10 mm thick layer. Spiral CT us es 5 mm thick layer for continuous reconstruction algorithm. This standard is suitable for thoracic, abdominal and pelvic tumors , while head and neck tumors and extremit y tumor s usually require special scheme s. Lesions on chest X -ray ma y be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. CT is preferred . Ultrasound (US) should not be used as a method of measurement of tumor lesion when the primary endpoint of the trial is objective response evaluation. T he method is not readily accepted in clinical practice. This method can be used as an alternative method to clinically measure superficially palpable lymph node s, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. US approach can also be used to confirm the complete disappear ance of superficial lesion s that are usually evaluated by clinical examination. Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must norma lize for a subject to be considered in complete response if all tumor lesions disappear . Elevations of tumor markers must be accompanied by visible disease progression to meet the requirements of disease progression. In a few cases, cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment, the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progr essive disease."

JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 4 Tumor Response Evaluation 4.1 “Target” and “Non-target” Lesions Recorded at Baseline - All measurable lesions , up to 2 lesions in each organ, the sum of up to 5 lesions, and representing all the organs involved as target lesions , are recorded and measured at baseline. - The selection of target lesions should be based on the size (lesions with a maximum diameter) and suitability , so that they can be (by imaging techniques or clinically) accurate ly and repeated ly measure d. - Calculat e the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions, and report it as baseline sum LD. Use baseline sum LD as a reference value for descri ption of objective tumor. - All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be used as non -target lesions and reported at baseline. These lesions are not required to be measured, but the presence or absence of each lesion during the entire follow -up period sh ould be recorded. 4.2 Criteria for Response Criteria for Evaluation of Target Lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Criteria for Evaluation of Non -target Lesions"
102,page_102,"103 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. A ll lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). Non-CR/SD: Persistence of ≥ 1 non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of ≥ 1 new lesions and/or u nequ ivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. * * Although u nequivocal progression of “non -target” lesions is an exception, the opinion of the treating doctor should be referred to, and the progression status later should be confirmed. 4.3 Criteria for Evaluation of Best Overall Response The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/ recurrence (the minimum measurements recorded from the start of the treatment should serv e as reference values for PD). The subject’s best overall response will generally depend on the completion of two measurements and the confirmation criteria. When the treatment is required to be discontinued due to overall deterioration of the health status, and there is no objective evidence indicating disease progression, the subject should be reported as ""symptomatic deterioration."" Objective progression should be recorded as far as possible, even after cessation of the treatment. In some cases, it is d ifficult to distinguish residual lesion from normal tissue apart. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this decision, it is advised to study the residual lesion (fine needle extraction/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status .

Adaptation of the immune related response criteria: irRECIST. Annals of Oncology . 2014. 25 (suppl_4): iv361 -iv372. RECIST 1.1 has its shortcomings for targeted imm unotherapy in oncology. Using RECIST 1.1 in immunotherapy trials would lead to declaration of progressive disease (PD) too early, when the treatment effect is not yet fully evident. RECIST also neglects the importance of the ‘flare effect’ - pseudo -progres sion effect within the so -called flare time window . Immune related Response Criteria (irRC) based on WHO criteria were published with an aim to provide better assessment of the effect of immunotherapeutic agents. With this poster we introduce irRECIST base d on RECIST 1.1, irRC and Nishino et al., 2013 findings. Our aim is to define criteria that better capture antitumor activity and reduce irRC criteria ambiguity. irRC and WHO criteria irRECIST Modifications and Clarifications Rationale for Modification At the baseline tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of all index lesions (five lesions per organ, up to 10 visceral lesions and five cutaneous index lesions) is calculated. 1.0. Baseline: Measurable Le sion Definitions and Target Lesion Selection Follow the definitions from RECIST 1.1. Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension with a minimum size of: • 10 mm in the longest diameter by CT or MRI scan (or no less than double the slice thickness) for non -nodal lesions and ≥ 15 mm in short axis for nodal lesions • 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam • 20 mm by chest X -ray Up to 5 target lesions may be selected at baseline. Lesions will be measured unidimensionally. The minimum target lesion size at baseline in irRECIST is aligned with RECIST 1.1, as outlined in Nishino et al., 2013. WHO 5.1.2 Unmeasurable Disease 1.1.

Lymphangitic pulmonary metastases. 2. Skin involvement in breast cancer. 3. Abdominal masses that can be palpated but not measured. Follow the definitions from RECIST 1.1 Non - target lesions will include: • Measurable les ions not selected as target lesions • All sites of non -measurable disease, such as neoplastic masses that are too small to measure because their longest uninterrupted diameter is < 10 mm (or < two times the axial slice thickness), ie. the longest perpendic ular diameter is ≥ 10 and < 15 mm. • Other types of lesions that are confidently felt to represent neoplastic tissue, but are difficult to measure in a reproducible manner. These include bone metastases, leptomeningeal metastases, malignant ascites, pleura l or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, ill -defined abdominal masses, skin lesions, etc. WHO criteria and indicates accordance with the same for the purposes of definitions of non-target lesions.

Not specified. 1.3 Baseline: Non -Target Lesion Selection All lesions or sites of disease not recorded as target lesions should be recorded as non-target lesions at baseline. There is no limit to the number of non -target lesions that can be recorded at baseline. In alignment with RECIST 1.1, all malignant lesions have to be selected at baseline. The excess of measurable lesions and all true non -measurable lesions will be selected as non -target lesions at baseline and followed at subsequent timepoints. Not specified. 1.4 Baseline: Bone Lesions Follow the definitions from RECIST 1.1. Regardless of the imaging modality blastic bone lesions will not be selected as target lesions. Lytic or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with a measurable soft tissue component ≥ 10 mm can be selected as target lesions. Bone lesions are to be handled the same as in RECIST 1.1. Not specified. 1.5 Baseline: Brain Lesions Brain Lesions detected on brain scans can be considered as both target or non -target lesions.

Not specified. 1.6 Baseline: Cystic and Necrotic Lesions as Target Lesions Lesions that are partially cystic or necrotic can be selected as target lesions. The longest diameter of such a lesion will be added to the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) of all target lesions at baseline. If other lesions with a non -liquid/non -necrotic component are present, those should be preferred. RECIST 1.1 does not integrate viability of tumor tissue into the assessment, and that is carried over into irRECIST. Not specified. 1.7 Baseline: L esions With Prior Local Treatment During target lesion selection the radiologist will consider information on the anatomical sites of previous intervention (e.g. previous irradiation, RF -ablation, TACE, surgery, etc.). Lesions undergoing prior intervention will not be selected as target lesions unless there has been a demonstration of progress in the lesion. In order to minimize site vs. central discrepancy information about prior intervention needs to be available to both the investigators and independent reviewers. Not specified. 1.8 Baseline: No Disease at Baseline If a patient has no measurable and no non - measurable disease at baseline the radiologist will assign ‘No Disease’ (irND) as the overall tumor assessment for any available follow -up timepoints unless new measurable lesions are identified and contribute to the TMTB. irND is a valid assessment in studies with adjuvant setting where the protocol and study design allow to include subjects with no visible disease. This had not been addressed at all i n any prior immune -response related criteria but needs to be included to also allow for these subjects to be assessed accurately. At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of the index lesions and of new, measurable lesions (≥ 5× 5 mm; up to 5 new lesio ns per organ: 5 new cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral lesions) are added together to provide the total tumor burden. 2.0 Follow -up: Recording of Target and New Measureable Lesion Measurements The longest diameters of non -nodal target and new non -nodal mea surable lesions, and short axes of nodal target and new nodal measurable lesions will be recorded. Together they determine the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) at follow -up. In alignment with Nishino et al., 2013, unidimensional measurements are used. Measurements of all measured lesions (baseline -selected target lesions and new measurable lesions) are combined into TMTB at follow -up. 2.1 Follow -up: Definition of Measurable New Lesions Proposed selection of up to 5 new measurable lesions of at least 10 mm each versus 10 new"
106,page_106,"107 JS001 - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. JS001 -015-III-NPC, Version 6.0 irRC and WHO criteria irRECIST Modifications and Clarifications Rationale for Modification In order to be selected as new measurable lesions (≤ 2 lesions per organ, ≤ 5 lesions total, per timepoint), new lesions must meet criteria as defined for baseline target lesion selection and meet the same minimum size requirements of 10 mm in long diamete r and minimum 15 mm in short axis for new measurable lymph nodes. New measurable lesions shall be prioritized according to size, and the largest lesions shall be selected as new measured lesions. measurable lesions as suggested in the irRC criteria is due to the following: 5 new measurable lesions add up at least 50 mm to the TMTB. Since PD is determined by at least a 20% increase in TMTB compared to nadir, this would mean that for irPD assessment the nadir TMTB had to be 25 cm, or 10 cm for 2 lesions in one organ, which is a significant tumor burden already for any cancer subject. That is why measuring up to 5 new lesions in total is sufficient and will not obstruct an irPD assessment. Measuring more than 5 new lesions is not needed. Larger lesions must be preferred as new measurable over smaller lesions, because there will be a greater impact of the TMTB % - increase by these larger lesions for irPD, to support a most conservative approach. Non-index lesions at follow -up time points contribute to defining irCR (complete disappearance required). 2.2 Follow -up: Non -Target Lesion Assessment The RECIST 1.1 definitions for the assessment of non -target lesions apply. The respo nse of non -target lesions primarily contributes to the overall response assessments of irCR and irNon -CR/Non -PD (irNN). Non -target lesions do not affect irPR and irSD assessments. Only a massive and unequivocal worsening of non -target lesions alone, even w ithout progress in the TMTB is indicative of irPD. Non-target lesions have a subordinate function. In the event that non -target lesions massively progress one cannot ignore such worsening and in these rare cases irPD based only on non -target lesions will b e a valid assessment option. New, non -measurable lesions at follow -up timepoints do not define progression, they only preclude irCR. 2.3 Follow -up: New Non -Measurable Lesions Definition and Assessment All new lesions not selected as new measurable lesions are considered new non - measurable lesions and are followed qualitatively. Only a massive and unequivocal progression of new non -measurable lesions When new non -measurable lesions substantially worsen in these rare cases irPD based only on new non -measurable lesions will be an assessment option."

Nikolsky sign is positive if this results in detached or sloughing epidermis demonstrating poor attachment of the epidermis to the dermis, which is the case in some autoimmune disorders (e.g. pemphigus) and SJS/TEN. Grading Management All Grades In cases of suspected SJS or any mucous membranes involvement, discontinue ICPi treatment and monitor closely for improvement regardless of grade. G1: N/A • For the SCAR adverse reactions, there is not a grade 1 category. If lower body surface area is involved with bullae or erosions, there should remain high concern that this reaction will progess to grade 3 or 4. G2: Morbilliform (“maculopapular”) exanthem covering 10 - 30% BSA with systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy or facial swelling • Hold ICPi and monitor patients closely every 3 days with grade 2 irAE’s for progres sion to involvement of greater body surface area and/or mucous membrane involvement. • Consider following patients closely using serial photography. • Initiate therapy with topical emollients, oral antihistamines and medium -to-high strength topical corticosteroids • Consider initiation of prednisone (or equivalent) 0.5 -1 mg/kg tapered over at least 4 weeks"

It may be new onset or exacerbated during therapy for non - immunologic reasons such as steroid exposure. Autoimmune T1DM results from islet cell destruction and is often acute onset, with ketosis and an insulin requirement. Diagnostic Workup: • Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of new or worsening DM, including measuring glucose at baseline and with each treatment cycle during induction X 12 weeks, then every 3 -6 weeks thereafter. To guide the work up in new onset hyperglycemia, clinicians should consider a patient’s medical background, exposure history, and risk factors for each subtype of DM. • Laboratory evaluation in suspected T1DM should include testing for ketosis in urine and an assessment of the anion gap on a metabolic panel. Anti-GAD, anti-Islet Cell or anti - Insulin antibodies are highly specific for autoimmune diabetes. Insulin and c -peptide levels can also assist in the diagn osis.

Additional Considerations: • Insulin therapy can be used as the default in any case with hyperglycemia. • Long acting therapy alone is not usually sufficient for T1DM, where half of daily requirements are usually given in divided doses as prandial coverage and half as long acting. • Insulin doses will be lower in T1DM because of preserved sensitivity (total daily requirement can be estimated at 0.3 -0.4 units/kg/day). • In T2DM, sliding scale coverage with meals over a few days provides data to estimate a patient’s daily requirements and can be used to more rapidly titrate basal needs. 5.0 MUSCULOSKELETAL TOXICITY 5.1 Inflammatory Arthritis Definition: A disorder characterized by inflammation of the joints.

This clinical research study is being sponsored by Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. (hereafter referred to as the Sponsor). 4 WHAT IS THE STUDY ABOUT? Toripalimab injection (JS001, hereafter referred to as the Study Drug) is a monoclonal antibody actin g on programmed cell death -1 (PD -1). Antibodies are a common type of proteins, through which the immune system finds and destroys bacteria, viruses and other foreign molecules. Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory, and used for the"

Currently, several antibodies have been approved for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. PD-1 is a protein present on the surface of immune cells. After binding to its ligand, P D-1 inhibits immune cells from killing cancer cells. The St udy Drug acts on PD -1, thereby stopping it from inhibiting immune cells, so that immune cells can attack cancer cells. In an initial dose escalation Phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors (melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, and renal cell carcin oma) , the Study Drug showed a good safety profile, with no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observed and no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) reached. Treatment -related side effects were similar to those from approved drugs of the same class. The most common treatm ent-related adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in intensity and the emergence of AEs was not dose related. The Study Drug has shown promising effect on certain kinds of tumors, especially in previously under -evaluated acral and mucosal melanomas . In addition, in an ongoing Phase Ib/II study, patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who had failed at least one previous line standard anti -tumo r treatment are being treate d with the study drug on its own (monotherapy). Results so far from this study indicate th at the monotherapy with study drug is effective against tumors and has manageable side effects (more than half of the AEs reported so far were mild or moderate in intensity). This study is to find out if the Study Drug combined with chemotherapy is more effective in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer than placebo combined with chemotherapy. The study will recruit approximately 280 subjects at about 40 study centers in China mainland, Taiwan, and Singapore. Participants with nasopharyngeal cancer who qualify for the study and agree to take part will be allocated into one of th e 2 groups, either to receive the Study Drug plus gemcitabine and cisplatin, or placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin . The placebo is a medicine that looks like the Study Drug but does not contain the “active ” ingredients. The group that you will be in is decided by chance, like tossing a coin or drawing names out of a hat. About 50% of patients will receive the Study Drug plus gemcitabine and cisplatin and about 50% will receive placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin . To make the comparison between Study Drug and placebo as fair as possible, t his study is “double blinded. ” This means that neither you nor the study doctor will know which kind of treatment you are receiving. The study doctor will be able to find out which treatment y ou are receiving if necessary, to treat any side effects that yo u may have. This study consists of 4 periods: a screening period, a during -chemotherapy period, a post-chemotherapy period, and a survival follow -up period. The screening period takes up to 28 days. The during -chemotherapy period starts from the first dos ing day of the Study Drug, and will continue until progressive disease, excessive toxicity, noncompliance,"

At the end of the study and if you were randomized to the JS001 arm during the study , your study doctor and the Sponsor will evaluate if you are eligible to continue the treatment with the Study Drug （JS001） after completing the study based on certain conditions (your health conditions, the efficacy and safety of the Study Drug, etc). If you are eligible, the Sponsor will continue to provide the Study Drug （JS001）free of charge to you in accordance with local regulations. Patients who were randomized to the placebo arm are not permitted to cross over to receive Study Drug （JS001）. 5 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY? The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good or bad, of the Study Drug plus gemcitab ine and cisplatin versus placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin on you and your disease, to find out which is better. In this study, you will get either Study Drug plus gemcitabine and cisplatin or placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin. You will also be a sked if you are willing to take part in an optional biomarker research involving analysis of the optional tumor tissue samples collected when your cancer appeared to have worsened. This optional biomarker research is to evaluate certain biomarkers (some mo lecules and cells in your body) which could help doctors to better understand your disease and/or your response to the Study Drug. Such analysis may include analysis of the biological feature of your tumor tissue. You will be asked to si gn a separate conse nt form if you agree to take part in the optional biomarker research. You will also be asked if you are willing to donate any remaining blood samples for the exploratory biomarker assay in case there are remaining blood samples from the mandatory analysis.

The volume of the blood samples is around 21 -25 mL.  A urine sample of 10 mL will be collected during screening for urinary routine analysis.  You will be asked about any new disease or discomfort you have experienced, as well as any medications you have used.  Tumor assessment: You will have computed tomography (CT) scans (with oral/IV contrast unless contraindicated) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx, neck, chest, and abdomen. A CT scan is an X -ray that is transmitted onto a computer that gives your doctor clearer pictures of the inside of your body. A contrast medium is like a dye that will spread through your body and will help give clearer images. An MRI scan is an imaging procedure that uses radiowaves and a magnetic field to take pictures of the inside of your body. During the MRI scan, you may be asked to lie down on your back on a table and you will need to remain still until the pictures have been taken. A CT (with contra st) or an MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or rule out the spread of cancer cell to the brain. Bone scans or other assessments to measure your disease should also be performed if your study doctor thinks them necessary.  Tumor tissue sampling: i f you have had a tumor biopsy/tumor operation, the study doctor will request the original sample from the original biopsy from the hospital where the biopsy was taken. If there is no archived sample, you will be required to have a biopsy sample from tumor tissue collected by your study doctor before or within 4 weeks after entering the study. In addition, to take part in this study, you must allow the study center to obtain the original sample, and allow the study doctor to send samples to the laboratory fo r research test. The laboratory will test your tumor samples to determine whether there are some features of your tumors, help scientists better understand the nasopharyngeal cancer, and help scientists understand why the study drug is effective or ineffec tive to your specific cancer type.

Initial Radiographic Disease Progression While receiving treatment in the study, your study doctor may find that your tumor has started to grow again. It has been shown in other similar investigational studies that i n a small number of study participants, there is evidence that although the cancer has appeared to have worsened (that is, the tumors appear to have got bigger on the scan), t he study drug is actually working. This is called “pseudo -progression ”, which happens because immune cells activated by the study drug are starting to infiltrate the cancer an d attack the cancer cells. This makes the tumor more swollen and so it appears larger on t he scan. If the Sponsor medical monitor or designee and your study doctor evaluate that you will benefit from c ontinuing the treatment and certain criteria are fully met, you will have the option to continue Study Drug (Toripalimab or placebo) treatment. In this case, you will continue to have all the same visits and assessments as detailed above. However, you must permanently discontinue Study Drug treatment when you experience second progression. Continuing study drug treatment after tumor progression is not a common standard procedure; you can also choose other alternative treatments, such as other approved drug s for the treatment of cancer or other clinical studies. You should discuss treatment opti ons with your study doctor. If after discussion, you, your study doctor, and Sponsor medical monitor consider that continuing Study Drug treatment is the best choice, then you need to sign the signature page ""Treatment Through Progression Consent Form"", to show that you agree to continue Study Drug/placebo treatment and you are willing to undertake subsequent visits in accordance with the above procedure."

Optional Exploratory Biomarker Assay If there are remaining blood samples from the mandatory analysis, and you agree to donate these remaining blood samples for the exploratory biomarker assay, tests of biomarkers in your remaining blood samples (pl asma, serum, and whole blood) will be done. The biomarkers to be tested may include but may not be limited to DNA, RNA, and other molecules. Cells in your body contain a type of molecule called deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA for short. DNA is what your gene s are made of. Genes are inherited and direct growth, development, and how the body functions. There are many differences, or variations, in DNA from one person to another. These variations may affect a person ’s chance of suffering from a particular diseas e or the way a person responds to a particul ar drug. A gene is used to make RNA, which provides instructions for cell function and helps determine the characteristics of people. It is up to you whether to donate your remaining blood samples or not. You may refuse to donate the remaining blood samples at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You wi ll receive the same treatment and care in the study whether or not you agree to donate the remaining blood samples for the exploratory biomarker assay . You should be aware that the Sponsor might not conduct all exploratory biomarker assays immediately and that your samples may be studied at any time before they are destroyed. If you are willing to donate your remaining blo od samples, you should check the corresponding boxes on the signature page of this form at the time of informed consent. Blood Tests All your test results are private and will be made known only as required by law. Blood and urine samples will be taken fo r laboratory tests. Blood volumes for each test are listed in Table 1Table 1Table 1 . The tests that will be done will include standard tests of your general health, tests of viral infections, tests of biomarkers, and a test of the drug antibody in your blood.

These react ions may include fever or chills, changes in blood pressure, or dyspnea (which may be a serious event).If you experience any of these symptoms above, please inform your study doctor immediately. The following immune -related side effects were observed, and the incidence data were obtained from a summary of safety information of 741 patients receiving the recommended therapeutic d ose of JS001 in 9 single -arm studies: •Immune -related pneumonitis (non -infectious lung inflammation, 1.8%): symptoms include, but are not limited to, the onset of cough or worsening cough, shortness of breath, and possibly fever. If you experience any of t he above symptoms, please inform your study doctor immediately. • Immune -related hepatitis (6.3%): liver function laboratory indicators, such as transaminase and bilirubin (the results of blood tests) , are abnormal. The clinical manifestations of hepatitis may be yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes, fati gue, nausea and vomiting, right epigastric pain, itchy skin, and more bleeding and abrasions than normal. The study doctor will regularly assess your liver function laboratory indicators, and if your indicators are above certain criteria, your study doctor may need to stop the study drug. • Hypothyroidism (13.6%): symptoms occur when the thyroid produces fewer thyroid hormones than normal, resulting in excessively slow metabolism. Symptoms include, but are not limited to, fatigue, increased cold sensitivity, constipation, dry skin, unexpla ined weight gain, facial swelling, muscle weakness, decreased heart rate, hair loss, and impaired memory. The condition can be treated with replacement thy roid hormones. • Hyperthyroidism (4.7%): symptoms are due to excessive production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Symptoms include anxiety or nervousness, weight loss, increased and loose bowel movements, difficulty breathing, increased heat sensitivity , and possible heart palpitations. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, treatment may include monitoring the symptoms only, treating the symptoms and/or administering medication to block thyroid hormones."

If there are suspected immune -related adverse reactions, the investiga tors may order diagnostic tests to understand the immune response and confirm the diagnosis. If your symptoms are found to be due to immune related adverse reactions, the investigators will give you treatment, which may include oral or intravenous dose of corticosteroids or immunosuppressants according to the specific situation and severity. Even though thesymptoms have resolved , the dose of corticosteroids need s to be reduced slowly to maintain its therapeutic effect and avoid recurrence or worsening of the symptoms . Side Effects for Gemcitabine  Pulmonary toxicity (to be poisonous to the lung),  Myelosuppression including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia (low level of blood platelet), and anemia,  Haemolytic -uremic syndrome (an acute illness related to the renal function) and/or renal failure,  Serious hepatotoxicity (to be poisonous to the liver), including liver failure and death. For more details regarding the safety information of gemcitabine, see the appropriated Package Insert. Side Effects for Cisplati n  Myelosuppression,  Ototoxicity (to be poisonous to the ear),  Nephrotoxicity (to be poisonous to the kidney). For more details regarding the safety information of cisplatin, see the appropriated Package Insert. Other Risks and Possible Discomfort  Blood sam ples will be taken from a vein in your arm during the study. The taking of a blood sample may cause some discomfort and bruising, and there is a potential for infection. Other risks, although rare, include nerve damage, dizzine ss and fainting.  You will hav e ECG during the study. Small sticky pads will be stuck to your chest, arms, and legs, and a machine will measure the electrical activity of your heart."

These sticky pads may cause some local i rritation and may be uncomfortable to remove.  Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured during the study. An inflatable cuf f will be placed on your arm and a machine will measure your blood pressure and heart rate, after you have been sitting down for 10 minutes. You may experience mild discomfort in your arm while the cuff is inflated.  A MRI scan is painless and will not expose you to X -ray radiation. A CT scan is a type of X -ray. Before these scans, a contrast medium may be injected into one of your veins. A contrast medium is like a dye that will spread through your body and will help give clearer images. The injection of contrast medium may cause some discomfort and bruising. There is a risk of potentially serious allergic reactions in some people w ho receive contrast medium. Some people may feel frightened by the cramped space inside the machine or by the loud, repeated sounds the machine makes. The greatest risk of having an MRI is the chance of metal objects flying through the air toward the magne t and hitting you. To reduce this risk, all people getting the MRI scan will be asked to remove all metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their pockets. Please inform the study doctor if you have metal in your body from an operation, since y ou may not be able to have a MRI scan. Also, if you have a pacemaker you should not have a MRI scan.  You may have tumor sampling during the study in order to collect more information about your disease. During the sampling, you may experience minor local b leeding, pain at the needle site, redness at the needle site, swelling unde r the skin that contains blood (hematoma), and sleepiness if you choose to receive a ""pain killer"" and/or medicine to help you relax. Rare but serious reactions includ e infection; s hortness of breath, slow heart rate, and low blood pressure if you choose to receive a ""pain killer"" and/or medicine to help you relax.  A heparin/saline lock may be placed in a vein for Study Drug administration during the site visits . The risks of a heparin/saline lock include pain, bruising, clotting, bleeding and possibl e infection at the site of the heparin/saline lock placement. Saline (salt water solution) or heparin may be used to flush the heparin/saline lock to prevent clots from forming in th e catheter . Pregnancy and Breast -feeding If you are or become pregnant, or if your partner becomes pregnant, there may be unknown risks to the baby. If you are a woman who may be able to have children, you will be given a pregnancy test at screening, and i f the result is positive, you will not be able to be in the study. If you are a sexually -active man or woman, you must use an accepted form of birth control throughout the study and for at least 60 days after the last dose of the Study Drug. Acceptable birth control methods include double barrier method"

Expl oratory : • To assess predictive, prognostic, and pharmacodynamic exploratory biomarkers (including but not limited to PBMC , PD -L1, PD -1, tumor mutation burden and others ) in archival and/or fresh tumor tissue and blood and their association with disease stat us, mechanisms of resistance, and/or response to Toripalimab Injection (JS001 ). • To evaluate the utility of biopsy at the time of apparent disease progression to distinguish apparent increases in tumor volume related to the immunomodulatory activity of JS00 1 (i.e., pseudoprogression and tumor immune infiltration) from true disease progression. 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, multi -center, double blinded, Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab Injection (JS001 ) in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin compared with placebo in combination with gemcitabine/ci splatin as first-line treatment in patients with histological/cytological confirmation of recurrent or metastatic NPC. Approximately 280 patients who fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms according to the following stratification factors: • ECOG performance status (0 ver sus 1) • Disease stage (recurrent versus metastatic) After stratification, patients will be randomly assigned by Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ) to the combination of JS001 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) with gemcitabine and cisplatin given every 3 weeks (Q3W) in 3 -week cycles. Day 1 (baseline) will be defined as the first day a patient receives study medication. Patients will receive JS001 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) on Day 1 of each 3 -week cycle. In Arms A & B, patients will receive gemcitabine on Days 1 & 8 and cisplatin on Day 1 of each cycle. The chemotherapy will continue until progressive disease, excessive toxicity, noncompliance, withdrawal of consent, or a maximum of 6 cycles, whichever occurs first in the ‘during chemotherapy’ phase. During the ‘post -chemotherapy’ phase, patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B will continue treatment with JS001 or placebo as maintenance therapy Q3W until excessive toxicity or progressive disease, withdrawal of consent or Investigator’s judgement or a maximum of 2 y ears. Patients may continue treatment with JS001 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) beyond radiographic progression by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid"

A by-patient listing for survival outcomes , a by-patient for tumor response assessment , and a by-patient listing for tumor assessment results by visit will be provided . 4.7.1 Analysis and Data Handling This study is designed to test for superiority. The null hypothesis for the treatment comparison will be that there is no difference between JS001 in combination with chemotherapy (Arm A) and placebo in combination with chemother apy (Arm B) for the primary endpoint PFS. The alternative hypothesis will be that there is a difference. Symbolically, this is expressed as follows: 𝐻0: 𝑆𝐴(𝑡)=𝑆𝐵(𝑡) versus 𝐻1: 𝑆𝐴(𝑡)≠𝑆𝐵(𝑡) where 𝑆𝐴(𝑡) and 𝑆𝐵(𝑡) are the survival distribution function of PFS for Arm A and Arm B, respectively. The study has crossed the O’Brien -Fleming boundary for the planned interim analysis of IRC-assessed PFS, with a data cutoff date of 30 May 2020, when 128 IRC -assessed PFS events had been obse rved in the ITT population. The key secondary efficacy endpoints , including IRC -assessed objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS), were to be tested hierarchically under a two -sided alpha level of 0.05 . ORR was formally tested and reache d its statistical significance at the interim analysis of PFS. OS will then be formally tested when 130 deaths are observed in the ITT population. 4.7.1.1 Adjustments for Covariates The primary and secondary efficacy analyses of PFS and O S will be stratified by ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1), and disease stage (recurrent vs. metastatic). 4.7.1.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data In general, n o imputation wil l be performed for missing data , unless specifically stated otherwise . 4.7.1.3 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity No multiple comparisons will be performed in the study ."

Patients who have not experienced disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the last tumor assessment. Patients with no post -baseline tumor assessment and no death will be censored on the date of randomization. For patients who do not experience disease progression but have started any new anti -tumor therapy, PFS will be censored at the time of the last tumor assessment before the new t herapy . For patients who have two or more consecutive missing tumor assessments , PFS will be censored at the time of the last available tumor assessment before the missing , or at the date of randomization if there was no post -baseline tumor assessment before the missing . In the COVID -19 pandemic period , for patients who have two or more consecutive missing tumor assessments due to COVID -19, in the circumstance if subsequent tumor assessment s become available and there is no immediate disease progression, the subsequent tumor assessment s will be used in the PFS analysis ; if the subsequent immediate tumor assessment is disease progression , PFS will still be censored at the last tumor assessment before the missing , or at the date of randomizatio n if there is no post -baseline tumor assessment before the missing . PFS ( month ) will be calculated as: (event date or censoring date – randomization date + 1 ) / 30.4375 . If the day of death is missing, it would be imputed with day 15. The two -sided log -rank test, stratified by ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1), and disease stage ( recurrent vs. metastatic) , as recorded in the IWRS , will be used as the primary analysis to compare PFS between the two treatment arms .

The Kaplan -Meier methodology will be applied to estimate the media n PFS for each treatment arm, and Kaplan -Meier curves will be developed. The Brookmeyer Crowley methodology[4] by using log -log transformation to survival function, will be used to construct the 95% CI for the median PFS for each treatment arm. Primary analysis will be performed using ITT population. Sensitivity analysis will be performed using PPS as well. 4.7.3 Secondary Efficacy Variable s 4.7.3.1 Investigator -Assessed PFS IRC-assessed PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest occur rence of disease progression, as determined by the independent review committee , per RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. The methods outlined for the investigator -assessed PFS will be used for the IRC -assessed PFS analysis. 4.7.3.2 Overall Survival (OS) OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Data from patients who are alive at the time of the analysis will be censored as of the last date they are known to be alive. OS (month ) is calculated as : (death date or censoring date – date of randomization + 1 ) / 30.4375 If the day of death is missing, it would be imputed with day 15. The methods outlined for PFS will be used for the OS analysis. A by -patient listing of survival follow -up status will be provided. 4.7.3.3 Objective Response Rate (ORR) An objective response is defined as either a confirmed complete response ( CR) or a partial response (PR), as determined by IRC and the investigator using RECIST v1.1. Patients not meeting these criteria, including patients wi thout any post baseline tumor assessment, will be considered non -responders. Any tumor assessment, either by the IRC or the investigator, after the first PD or the new anti-cancer therapy will not be used to determine the best overall response evaluation. ORR is defined as the proportion of patient s who had an objective response . ORR and its 95% CI will be calculated for each treatment arm, and its 95% CI will be constructed using the Clopper -Pearson method (Clopper and Pearson, 1934) ."

DoR is defined as the time interval from the date of the first occurrence of a CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that progressive disease or death is documented, whichever occurs first. Patients who have not progressed and who have not died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment date. If no tumor assessments are performed after the date of the first occurrence of a CR or PR, duration of response will be censored at the date of the first occurrence of a CR or PR. The DoR ( month ) will be calculated as: (progression date or censoring date – first date of CR or PR + 1 ) / 30.4375 The methods outlined for PFS will be used for the DoR analysis. 4.7.3.5 Disease Control Rate (DCR) DCR is defined as the rate of patients with CR or PR as best response or stable disease (SD) maintained for 6 weeks (>= 6 weeks) as determined by IRC and the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. The methods outlined for ORR will be used for the DCR analysis. 4.7.3.6 PFS rate at 1 and 2 years The PFS rate at 1 and 2 years after randomization will be estim ated with the use of the Kaplan -Meier methodology for each t reatment arm, along with 95% C I that are calculated with use of the standard error derived from Greenwood’s formula , where the PFS is the IRC and investigator -assessed PFS according to RECIST v1.1 . The 95% CI for the difference in the PFS rate between the two treatment arms will be esti mated with use of the normal approximation method. 4.7.3.7 OS rate at 1 and 2 years The methods outlined for the PFS rate will be used for the OS rate analysis."

To control the type I error for PFS analyses at a two -sided significance level of 0.05, the stopping boundaries for the PFS interim and fina l analyses were computed with use of the Lan-DeMets approximation to the O’Brien -Fleming boundary as shown in the following table: Timing and Stopping Boundary of PFS Analyses Type of Analysis Timing Since FSI (month) Planned Information Fraction (Event #) Stopping Boundary (Two -Sided p - Value) PFS interim analysis 18 65% (130) 0.011 PFS final analysis 25 100% (200) 0.047 FSI = First subject in; PFS = progression -free survival; HR = hazard ratio. The planned interim analysis was performed with the data cutoff date of 30 May 2020, when 128 PFS events, as assessed by IRC per RECIST 1.1, had been observed in the ITT population. The PFS result generated at the interim analysis was highly statistically significant and was treated as definitive. The final PFS analysis will be conducted 18 months after the last patient was randomized , when it is estimated that approximately 150 IRC-assessed PFS events will be observed in the ITT population . The final PFS analy sis will be performed for the descriptive purposes only . 4.10.2 OS Two interim analyses of OS were planned at the interim and final analyses of PFS for the descriptive purpose only, where it was expected to observe approximately 49 and 74 deaths respectively. T he final analysis of OS will be performed when approximately 130 deaths have been observed in the ITT population. 4.11 Determination of Sample Size The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint PFS. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. A total of 280 patients (140 per arm) are needed to observe 200 PFS events at approximately 25 months after the first patient is randomized in ord er to detect the PFS improvement of HR=0.67 with 80% power at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05; one interim analysis is planned when approximately 130 PFS events are observed. The calculation of the sample size is based on the following assumptions: • PFS is exponentially distributed • The median PFS is 7 months for the standard chemotherapy • The interim and final analyses of PFS use the Lan DeMets alpha spending function to approximate the O’Brien Fleming boundary • The recruitment of 280 patients will take place over 14 months,"

This is expected to occur approximately 18 months after the first patient is randomized, while the exact timing of the interim analysis will depend on the actual occurrence of PFS events. The final analysis of PFS will be conducted when approximately 200 PFS events in the ITT population have been observed. This is expected to occur approximately 25 months after the first patient is randomized, while the exact timing of the final analysis will depend on the actual occurrence of PFS events. To control the type I error for PFS analyses at a two -sided significance level of 0.05, the stopping boundaries for PFS interim and final analyses have been computed with use of the Lan-DeMets approxima tion to the O’Brien -Fleming boundary as shown in the following table: 4.10 Interim Analysis … 4.10.1 IRC-Assessed PFS One interim efficacy analysis of PFS was planned to be conducted when approximately 130 PFS events in the ITT population had been observed.

Estimate the average of the items that contribute to t he scale; this is the raw score calculate by 𝑅𝑎𝑤𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 𝑅𝑆=𝐼1+𝐼2+⋯+𝐼𝑛 𝑛 where 𝐼1, 𝐼2, …, 𝐼𝑛 are items in the scale. 2. Apply the linear transformation to 0 -100 to obtain the score 𝑆, • Functional scales: 𝑆={1−(𝑅𝑆−1) 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒}×100 • Symptom scales / items: 𝑆={(𝑅𝑆−1) 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒}×100 • Global health status / QoL: 𝑆={(𝑅𝑆−1) 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒}×100 where 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 is the difference between the maximum possible value of 𝑅𝑆 and the minimum possible value. The QLQ -C30 has been designed so that all items in any scale take the same range of values. Therefore, the range of 𝑅𝑆 equals the range of the item values. Most items are scored 1 to 4, giving 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 =3. The exceptions are the items contributing to the global health status / QoL, which are 7 -point questions with 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 =6. The QLQ -H&N35 has been designed so that all items in any scale take the same range of values as well, i.e., the range of 𝑅𝑆 equals the range of the item values. Most items are scored 1 to 4, giving 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 =3. The exceptions are the items contributing to Pain killers, Nutritional supplements, Feeding tube, Weight loss, and Weight gain , which have 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 =1.
