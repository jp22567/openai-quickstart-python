The objective will be to eval uate the ability of TAK-935 as adjunctive therapy to reduce pain as measured by the Numeric Pain Scale ([NPS], an 11 -point scale by electronic pain diary). The study will also evaluate efficacy of TAK -935 as measured by the 29 -item Patient-Reported Outcome s Measurement Information System (PROMIS -29, versio n 2.1), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale, and CRPS Severity Score (CSS). Approximately 24 subjects will be randomized to ensure 21 completers in the double -blind phase of the study. Randomi zation will be 2:1 (16 treatment: 8 placebo). This study consists of 2 parts: Part A: Double -Blind Treatment 2-to 4- week screening period. 3-week titration period. 12-week maintenance period. Taper period (maximum 6 days)/Follow -up (to occur 15 days after last dose of study drug) if the subject does not continue into the open label extension). Part B: Open -Label Extension 2-week titration period. 12-week open label period. Taper period (maximum 6 days)/Follow - up (to occur 15 days after last dose of study drug). Part A: Double -Blind Treatment (19-21 weeks including the screening period and follow -up if the subject does not continue into the open label extension) At Visit 1 (Screening), after obt aining informed consent, subjects will undergo screening procedures to assess subject eligibility in accordance with study entry criteria. Subjects who fulfill the CRPS Budapest Criteria, have symptoms for ≥6 mo nths and meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at the screening visit will be eligible for entry into the study. For a minimum of 6 of the last 7 screening days before randomization at Visit 2 (Day 1) into the study, baseline current pain intensity will be collected 3 times a day to provide an average daily 24 -hour pain intensity (NPS, an 11 -point scale by electronic pain diary). The baseline will be defined as the mean of the average screening 24-hour pain intensity score for the last 7 days before the first dose. During Part A, average 24 -hour pain intensity will be calculated as the mean of 3 measurements collected during a day. The average pain intensity score will be calculated as the mean of the average 24 -hour pain intensity score collected during the last 7 days prior t o Visit 5 (Day 21, Week 3) and Visit 8 (Day 105, Week 15) (or the last dose in Part A), which will be used for the primary endpoint Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use"

At the end of the prospective screening period, subjects will return to the clinic (Visit 2, Day 1) and if a subject does not meet the eligibility criteria the subject will be discontinued from the study and considered a screen failure. On Visit 2 (Day 1), subjects who meet the entry criteria will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to double -blind treatment with investigati onal product (IP), either TAK -935 (100 mg tablets) or matching placebo, for 15 weeks (3 -week titration period and 12-week maintenance period). All screening/baseline assessments will be collected prior to initiating treatment. At Visit 2 (Day 1), after ran domization and all predose procedures have been performed, subjects will be started on 100 mg twice daily (BID) IP (either TAK -935 100 mg tablets or matching placebo) for approximately 1 week. The first dose on Day 1 will be taken in the clinic. The subjec t will take the second dose on Day 1 and the rest of the doses at home (except for Visit 4 [Day 14], Visit 6 [Day 49], and Visit 13 (Day 203), when subjects will be instructed to take their dose on site at their study visit). The site will contact the subject by telephone on Day 4 to determine safety and tolerability. At Visit 3 (Day 7, Week 1), safety and tolerability will be assessed and if the drug is well tolerated, the dose will be increased to 200 mg BID. The site will contact the subject by telephone on Day 10 to determine safety and tolerability of this dose. Any subjects who continue with 100 mg BID and still cannot tolerate the minimum daily dose of 100 mg BID, will be withdrawn from the study. At Visit 4 (Day 14, Week 2), safety and tolerability w ill be assessed and if the drug is well tolerated with no continuing pain, the subject will remain at 200 mg BID. If the subject continues to need a higher dose, in the PI’s opinion, the dose will be increased to 300 mg BID. The site will contact the subje ct via phone on Day 17 to determine the safety and tolerability of this dose. Subjects that do not require the dose to be increased to 300 mg BID will still be required to complete a 21 -day titration period in order to confirm the tolerated dose prior to e ntering the maintenance phase. After completing 1 week for each dose adjustment at 100 mg BID increment to 300 mg BID depending on tolerance, the 3-week titration period will be completed and the subject will return to the site for Visit 5 (Day 21, Week 3) to begin the 12 - week maintenance period. After Visit 5 (Day 21, Week 3), subjects will visit the clinic approximately ever y 4 weeks (Visit 6 [Day 49, Week 7] and Visit 7 [Day 77, Week 11]). The current pain intensity will be collected 3 times a day using the electronic pain diary . From this data an average 24 -hour pain intensity score can be calculated. If at any time during either the titration or the maintenance period the subject cannot tolerate the dose, the dose may be decreased to the previous tolera ted dose. The subject may return to the clinic for an unscheduled visit at any time during either the titration period or the maintenance period if dose adjustments are needed between scheduled visits. If the subject cannot tolerate the minimum daily dose of 100 mg BID, the subject will be withdrawn from the study. If the dose has been decreased due to inability to tolerate the dose, based on the investigator’s review, the dose may be increased to the next highest dose 1 time during the titration. Dose modi fications during the maintenance period should be discussed with the medical monitor. The subject should be instructed not to alter their dose without prior approval from the investigator. Any change in dose will be documented in the subject’s clinic chart and electronic diary . Pain medications and nondrug treatments must be stable (regimented per prescription) for 1 month prior to screening and should remain stable throughout Part A. Pain medication use may be adjusted under supervision during Part B. Concurrent treatment regimen data will be collected throughout the study. A single effective rescue medication must be identified for each subject for use during the study. The prescribed maximum dose must remain stable during Part A. The use of rescue pai n medications will be assessed at each visit; subjects requiring significant increase of rescue medication (frequency or dose 50% over pre -enrollment levels or over the prescribed maximum) during Part A will be considered for withdrawal from the study at t he investigator’s and sponsor’s discretion. During Part A, all subjects will continue to enter the current pain intensity score as described 3 times a day using the NPS in the electronic pain diary. This data will be captured daily during Part A.

13,page_13,"TAK -935 Study No. TAK -935-2008 Page 13of 102 Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 03 16December 2019 Following completion of Part A, subjects will have the option to continue into Part B, a 14 -week open -label drug extension, or to enter a double -blind t aper period (maximum 6 days). For all subjects that choose not to enter into Part B (Open -Label Extension), the IP dose will be reduced to the next lower dose every 3 days (or less frequently based on the investigator’s discretion) until IP dose is discont inued. After tapering, the subjects will complete a safety follow -up pho ne call approximately 15 days after the last dose of IP. Part B Open -Label Extension (14 weeks): Because the Part A treatment assignments will remain blinded, all subjects who choose t o continue into Part B will start at 200 mg BID TAK -935 (100 mg tablets), regardless of the treatment they were on in Part A at Visit 8 (Day 105, Week 15). Subjects will remain at this dose for 1 week. The site will contact the subject by telephone, 3 days after initiatio n of this dose, on Day 108 to determine safety and tolerability. At Visit 9 (Day 112, Week 16), safety and tolerability will be assessed and if the drug is well tolerated and the subject continues to need a higher dose in the PI’s opinion, the dose will be increased to 300 mg BID. The dose may also be decreased to 100 mg BID based on tolerability at Visit 9 (Day 112, Week 16). If the subject tolerates the 200 mg BID dose without continuing pain, the dose will remain at 200 mg BID. The site w ill contact the subject on Day 115 to determine the safety and tolerability of this dose. After completing 1 week at 300 mg BID, the 2 -week titration period will be completed and the subject will return to the site for Visit 10 (Day 119, Week 17) to begin the 12 -week maintenance period. If at any time during either the titration period or the maintenance period the subject cannot tolerate the dose, the dose may be decreased to the previous tolerated dose. The subject may return to the clinic for an unschedu led visit at any time during either the titration period or the maintenance period if dose adjustments are needed between scheduled visits. If the subject cannot tolerate the minimum daily dose of 100 mg BID, the subject will be withdrawn from the study. The subject should be instructed not to alter their dose without prior approval from the investigator. Any change in dose will be documented in the subject’s clinic chart and electronic diary . After Visit 10 (Day 119, Week 17), the subjects will visit the c linic approximately every 4 weeks (Visit 11 [Day 147, Week 21] and Visit 12 [Day 175, Week 25]). The current pain intensity will be collected daily, 3 times a day, using the electronic pain diary until the end of the study. From these data an average 24 -hour pain intensity score can be calculated.

For Part A, summary statistics will be provided for the observed values of the efficacy measures at baseline and each of postdose visits by treatment group. Change from baseline and percent change from baseline will also be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group. For Part B, summary statistics will be provided for the observed values of the efficacy measures at each of the postdose visits for all subjects, as well as by treatment group in Part A. Change from baseline and percent change from baseline will also be summarized with descriptive statistics. Baseline will be the baseline for Part A. For the mean 24-hour pain intensity derived above in Part A, linear mixed models for repeated measurements will be used to evaluate the effect of TAK-935 on the prima ry and secondary endpoints. The change from baseline in the 24-hour mean pain intensity to the scheduled visits (Day 21, Week 3) and Day 105, Week 15) will be the response in the model; baseline, site, visit (Day 14 (Week 2) and Day 105 (Week 15), treatment, and treatment by visits interaction will be the fixed effects; and a completely unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed. The treatment effect at each visit will be evaluated using the difference in the least-square means of the change from baseline between TAK-935 and placebo. 95% confidence intervals for the differe nces and p-values will also be provided. Percent of responders will be summarized and compared between treatment arms in Part A. Safety Analyses: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all safety endpoints, by treatment group. Data summaries will be displayed for incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory variables, vital signs, body weight and body mass index, and electrocardiogram parameters. Interim Analysis: An unblinded interim analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Part A. All planned efficacy analysis for the primary and secondary endpoints will be performed for the data collected during Part A. Safety and PK/PD summaries will also be performed for Part A. Since this analysis will be conducted at the end of the double-blind period, this analysis will be considered as the primary efficacy assessment of TAK-935 on CRPS relative to placebo. No alpha spending or adjustment to sample size will be needed based on the results of this analysis. Sample Size Justification: Assuming a standard deviation of 2 and a 12% drop-out rate, a sample size of 24 subjects in total with randomization ratio of 2:1 is sufficient to achieve at least 65% power to detect a difference of 2 between TAK-935 and placebo by a 2-sample t-test on the change from baseline to Week 15 in mean 24-hour pain intensity NPS score at 0.10 2-sided significance level.

Mitchell (1829-1914) coined the term ‘causalg ia’ to describe this constellation occurring in veterans of the American Civil War. The term ‘reflex sympathetic dystrophy’ was used until recently when CRPS was agreed upon. CRPS can be subdivided into 3 types: (1) CRPS-I: previously known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy; (2) CRPS-II, previously known as causalgia and defined as CRPS with clinical and/or electrodiagnostic evidence of nerve damage; and (3) CRPS (not otherwise specified) which only partia lly meets diagnostic criteria, but no better diagnosis can be discerned [ 3]. CRPS-I and CRPS-II have similar outcomes and response to pain medication. Autonomic changes are often required for the diagnosis and may distinguish between acute CRPS (‘hot’ limb with edema and red co loration) a nd chronic (‘cold’ limb with at rophy and blue coloration). Although there is significant involvement of the peripheral nervous system, chronic CRPS is thought to be a central neurological disease with demonstrated alterations in both central nervous system (CNS) function as well as structural changes i ncluding alterations in cortical representations in bot h sensory and motor cortex [4]. CRPS is known as one of the most painful disorders and the risk of suicide is signi ficantly higher in patients with CRPS with one study demonstrating that 75% of patients had a high risk for suicide [ 5]. Due to the severity of the pain, amputation is rarely being considered as a therapeutic option [6]. Although the pathophysiology has not been established, overactivity of the N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are thought to play a role [7]and while no drugs are approved for CRPS, ketamine, a NMDA receptor antagonist, has established efficacy in a randomized control trial [ 8]. Use of an NMDA antagonist along with morphine, decreased pain and cerebral pain representation consistent with brain involvement in CRPS [9].

This study will also evaluate efficacy of TAK -935 as measured by PROMIS -29 versio n 2.1, PGIC, and CSS. Approximately 24 subjects will be randomized to ensure 21 completers in the double -blind phase of the study . Randomizati on will be 2:1 (16 treatment: 8 placebo). This study consists of 2 parts: Part A: Double -Blind Treatment – 2- to 4-week screening period. – 3-week ti tration peri od. – 12-week m aintenance period. –Taper peri od (m aximum 6 days)/Follow -up (15 days after l ast dose of study drug )if the subject does not continue into the open -label extension (see Sect ion 9.3.4 for details) . Part B: Open -Label Extensio n – 2- week ti tration peri od. – 12-week open label. –Taper peri od (maximum 6 days)/Follow -up (15 days after l ast dose of study drug) . Part A: Double -Blind Treatment (19 -21 weeks including the screening period and fo llow -up if the subject does not continue into the open label extension) At Visit 1 (screening), after ob taining informed consent, subjects will undergo screening procedures to assess subject eligibilit y in accordance with study entry criteria. Subjects who fulfill the CRPS Budapest Criteria, have symptoms for ≥6 months and meet all inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusio n criteriaat the screening visit will be eligible for entry into the study . For a minimum o f 6 of the last 7 screening days prior to rando mizat ion at Visit 2 (Day 1) into the study, baseline current pain intensit y will be co llected 3 times a day to provi de an average daily 24-hour pain intensit y (NPS; an 11 -point scale by electronic pain diary). The baseline will be defined as the mean of the average screening 24 -hour pain intensity score for the last 7 days before the first dose. During Pa rt A, average 24 -hour pain intensit y will be calculated as the mean of 3 measurements collected during a day . The average pain intensit y score will be calculated as the mean of the average 24 -hour pain intensit y score collected during the last 7 days befor e Visit 5 (Day 21, Week 3) and Vi sit 8 (Day 105, Week 15) (or the last dose in Part A), which will be used for the primary endpoint analysis.

On Visit 2 (Day 1), the subjects who meet the entry criteria will be rando mized in a 2:1 ratio to doubl e-blind treatment with invest igational product (IP), either TAK -935 100 mg tablets or matching placebo, for 15 weeks (3- week titration period and 12 -week maintenance period). All screening/baseline assessments will be collected prior to init iating treatment. At Visit 2 (Day 1), after rando mizat ion and all predose procedures have been performed, subjects will be started on 100 mg BID IP (either TAK -935 100 mg tablets or matching placebo) for approximately 1 week. The first dose on Day 1 will be taken in the cli nic (except for Visit 4 [Day 14], Visit 6 [Day 49], and Vi sit 13 (Day 203), when subjects will be instructed to take their dose on site at their study visit) . The subject will take the second dose on Day 1 and the remaining daily doses at hom e. The si te wi ll contact the subject by telephone on Day 4 to determine safet y and tol erabilit y. At Visit 3 (Day 7, Week 1), safet y and tolerabilit y will be assessed and if the drug is well tolerated, the dose will be increased to 200 mg BID. The site will contact the subject by telephone on Day 10 to determine safet y and tol erabilit y of this dose. Any subjects who continue wit h 100 mg BID and still cannot tolerate the minimum daily dose of 100 mg BID, will be wit hdrawn from the study . At Visit 4 (Day 14, Week 2), safet yand tol erabili ty will be assessed and if the drug is well tolerated wi th no continuing pain, the subject will remain at 200 mg BID. If the subject continues to need a higher dose in the PI’s opinio n, the dose will be increased to 300 mg BID. The site will contact the subject via phone on Day 17 to determine the safet y and tol erabilit y of this dose. Subjects that do not require the dose to be increased to 300 mg BID will st ill be requi red to complete a 21 -day t itration period in order to confirm the tolerat ed dose prior to entering the maintenance phase. After completing 1 week for each dose adjustment at 100 mg BID increments to 300 m g BID depending on tolerance, the 3- week titration period will be co mpleted and the subject will return to the site for Visit 5 (Day 21, Week 3) to begin the 12 -week maintenance period. After Visit 5 (Day 21, Week 3), subjects will visit the clinic approximately every 4 weeks (Visit 6 [Day 49, Week 7] and Visit 7 [Day 77, Week 11]). The current pain intensit y will be collected 3 times a day using the electronic pain diary. Fro m this data, an average 24 -hour pain intensit y score can be calculated. If at any time during either the titration period or the maintenance period the subject cannot tolerate the dose, the dose may be decre ased to the previous tolerated dose. The subject may return to the clinic for an unscheduled visit at any time during ei ther the ti tration peri od or the maintenance period if dose adjust ments are needed between scheduled visits.

After tapering, the subjects will co mplete a safet y follow-up phone call approximately 15 days after the last dose of IP. Part B Open -Label Extension (14 weeks): Because the Part A treatm ent assignments will remain blinded, all subjects who choose to continue into Part B will start at 200 mg BID TAK -935 (100 mg tablets), regardless of the treatment they were on in Part A at Visit 8 (Day 105, Week 15). Subjects will remain at this dose for 1 week . The site will contact the subject by telephone, 3 days after init iation of this dose, on Day 108 to determine safet y and tol erabilit y. At Visit 9 (Day 112, Week 16), safet y and tol erabili ty will be as sessed and if the drug is well tolerated and the subject continues to need a higher dose in the PI’s opinio n, the dose will be increased to 300 mg BID. The dose may also be decreased based on tolerabilit y at Vi sit 9 (Day 112, Week 16). The site will contac t the subject on Day 115 to determine the safet y and tolerabilit y of this dose. After complet ing 1 week at 300 mg BID, the 2 -week ti tration peri od will be com pleted and the subject will return to the site for Visit 10 (Day 119, Week 17) to begin the 12 -week maintenance period.

Since in a majorit y of CRPS subjects, symptoms reso lve within the first 6 months, the large unmet need is for those subjects with chronic disease. As this is proof of concept study, statist ical power of 65% was considered adequate with an alpha level of 0.10. During this study , subjects will cont inue their current medicat ions; therefore, placebo was chosen as the control group to provide maximum difference between the treatment and control arms.

The up-titration scheme and target dose regimen were chosen to maximize target engagement (ie, CH24H enzyme occupancy) and downstream changes in plasma 24HC levels for optimal drug response, while ensuring an acceptable clinical safety profile in the target patient population. A population PK/enzyme occupancy (EO)/PD model, using the totality of the information available in healthy subjects was built to characterize TAK-935 PK, and describe its relationships with brain CH24H EO and subsequent reduction in plasma 24HC levels (PD). This integrated model consists of a 2-compartment PK model with (1) transit co mpartments to account for the delayed absorption of the new tablet formulation (to be used in this study) relative to the oral solution (used in previous phase 1 studies) and (2) dose as a covariate on clearance parameters and peripheral volume of distribution to describe TAK-935 nonlinear PK. A sigmoid E max(maximum drug-induced effect) model using an effect-site compartment described the temporal relationship between TAK-935 concentrations and brain EO, while the relationship between 24HC plasma levels and TAK-935 concentrations was characterized by an indirect inhibitory response PK/PD model. Standard goodness-of-fit diagnostics, parameter precision and visual predictive checks demonstrated the appropriateness of the population PK and PK/EO/PD models.

The primary endpoint (24-hour average pain inten sity scale as measured on an 11-point scale [0-10]), and secondary endpoints (PROMIS-29 version 2.1, PGIC, and CSS) are well-characterized and accepted endpoints for pain studies. Measurements of plasma 24HC levels will be included in this study as a PD biomarker related to the mechanism of action of TAK-935. The conversion of cholesterol to 24HC is a critical process in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the brain and its release into the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. Evidence suggests that plasma 24HC levels are correlated with brain 24HC levels in healthy sub jects and are largely derived from the CNS. Data from SRD and MRD studies showed a decrease in plasma 24HC levels after administr ation of TAK-935 in healthy subjects, which was correlated with the changes in EO% measured in the brain using the P ET radioligand displacement approach (Study TAK-935-1003). Pharmacogenomic analysis may be conducted to investigate the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety. Participation of study subjects in pharmacogenomic sample collection is optional. As pharmacogenomics is an evolving science, currently many genes and their function are not yet fully understood. Future data may suggest a role of some of these genes in drug response or diseases, which may lead to additional hypothesis-generating exploratory research on stored samples.CCICCI Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the resulsults,tlll dard medard m yscale ascale rsion 2.ion 2 pain spain s tudtu be inclue incl he convhe con s in thein th sma 24Hma 24 derivederive evels aftels a s in EO%s in EO 935-35-10010 acogenoacogen drug resdrug re pharmacharm As pAs fuNon For Na: Foeda: se he Applicable Terms of Use"

At subsequent drug -dispensing visit s, the invest igator or designee will again contact the IWRS to request additional study drug for a subject. The medicat ion ID number of the study drug to be di spensed will again be provided by the IWRS. The m edicat ion ID number will be entered onto the eCRF. If sponsor -supplied drug (TAK -935 100 mg or matching placebo tablets) is lost or damaged, the si te can request a replacement from the IWRS (refer to the IWRS manual provided separately ). Each subject should be instructed as follows: Keep sponsor -supplied drugs in original containers until the time of dosing. Administer study drug as instructed. If the subject misses a dose, he or she should not be give n twice the dose the next day . Store sponsor -supplied drugs ac cording to the label and keep them out of the reach o f children. Return unused sponsor -supplied drugs at each clinic visit. Record the number of tablets taken (AM and PM) in the electroni c diary . 8.3 Randomization Code Creation and Storage For Part A, the randomization will be stratified by the invest igation site. The dummy rando mizat ion schedules will be developed by IWRS and approved by the sponsor. All rando mizat ion informat ion will be stored in IWRS. Study drug will be administered in a double -blind man ner in Part A. The study drug blind will be maintained by IWRS. The principal invest igator at each study site will receive instructions for obtaining the study drug assignment through the IWRS. During regularly scheduled m onitoring visits, a study monitor from the sponsor or a desi gnee will perform an inventory of assigned and unassigned bottles of study drug. All assigned/unassigned study drug bottl es will be reconciled before destroying at site (permitted if internal standard operating procedure [SOP] is in place) or returning to the sponsor or a designee before study closure. Study drug will be administered in an open -label manner in Part B.

The sponsor/designee must be notified immediately if the study drug blind is broken. The date, time, and reason the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documents and on the appropriate eCRF. If any site personnel is unblinded, it is recommended that the study drug be tapered down in consultation wit h the m edical m onitor, and the subject m ust be wi thdrawn from the study . However, the invest igator in consultat ion with the medical mo nitor will evaluate the possible effects of rapid withdrawal fro m the study drug versus the risk of continuing the drug. The reason for withdrawal should be recorded as, “Protocol Deviat ion.” Subjects who are withdrawn early fro m the study should undergo all procedures scheduled for the final visit at the time of withdrawal. Only the responsible invest igator or delegate and the respect ive subject’s code will be unblinded. Other study site personnel and sponsor personnel direct ly associated with the conduct of the study shoul d not be unblinded. The investigator will fo llow the early terminat ion procedures and withdraw the subject from the study . 8.5 Accountability and Destruction of Sponsor- Supplied Drugs Drug supplies will be counted and reconciled at the si te before being destroy ed at si te or returned to the sponsor or designee. NOTE: Destruction at site is permitted if internal SOP is in place by provi ding copy of cert ificate of destruction or memo confirming the destruction to be stored in the trial master file. The investigator or designee must ensure that the sponsor -supplied drug is used in accordance wit h the protocol and is dispensed only to subjects enro lled in the study . To docum ent appropri ate use of sponsor -supplied drug (TAK -935 100 m g or matching placebo tablets), the investigator or designee must maintain records of all sponsor -supplied drug delivery to the site, site inventory, dispensat ion and use by each subject, destruction at site and/or return to the sponsor or designee. Upon recei pt of sponsor -supplied drug, the invest igator or designee must verify the contents of the shipments against the packing list. The verifier should ensure that the quantit y is correct, and the medicat ion is in good condit ion. If quant ity and condit ions are a cceptable, invest igator or designee shoul d acknowl edge the recei pt of the shipment by recording in IWRS. If there are any discrepancies between the packing list versus the actual product received, Takeda must be contacted to resolve the issue. The packing list should be filed in the investigator’s essent ial docum ent file. Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use"

Proper drug accountabilit y includes, but is not limit ed to: Frequent ly verifying that actual inventory matches docum ented inventory . Verifying that the log is completed for the drug lot (or medication ID number) used to prepare each dose. Verifying that all containers used are documented accurately on the log. Verifying that required fields are co mpleted accurately and legibly. If any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified immediately. The IWRS will include all required informat ion as a separate entry for each subject to whom sponsor -supplied drug is dispensed. The invest igator or designee must record the current inventory of all sponsor -supplied drugs (TAK -935 100 m g and m atching placebo tablets) on a sponsor -approved drug account abilit y log. The fo llowing inform ation will be recorded at a minimum: protocol number and tit le, name of investigator, site ident ifier and number, descript ion of sponsor -supplied drugs, expiry date, date and amount dispensed including init ials, seal, or signature of the person dispensing the drug, and the date and amount returned to the site by the subject, including the init ials, seal, or signature of the person receiving the sponsor -supplied drug. The log should include all required informat ion as a sep arate entry for each subject to whom sponsor -supplied drug is dispensed. All study drug not returned to the site by a subject must be invest igated by the site and appropriately docum ented on the drug accoun tability log. Before site closure or at appropriat e intervals, a representative fro m the sponsor or its designee will perform sponsor -supplied drug accountabilit y and reconciliat ion before sponsor -supplied drugs are destroy ed at si te, or returned to the sponsor or its designee for destruction. The invest igator or designee will retain a copy of the docum entati on regarding sponsor -supplied drug accountabilit y, return, and/or destruction, and originals will be sent to the sponsor or designee.

For each procedure, subjects are to be assess ed by the same invest igator or site personnel whenever possible. The schedule of study procedures is l ocated in Appendix A. 9.1.1 Informed Consent Procedure The requi rements of the informed consent are described in Sect ion 15.2. Inform ed consent m ust be obtained prior to the subject entering into the stud y, and before any protocol -directed procedures are performed. A unique subject ID number (subject number) will be assigned to each subject at the time that inform ed consent i s obtained; this subject number will be used throughout the study . 9.1.2 Demographics, M edical History, and Medication History Procedure Dem ographic information to be obtained will include date of birth, sex, Hispanic ethnicit y, race as described by the subject, and smoking status of the subject at screening. Medical history to be obtained wi ll include determining whether the subject has any significant condi tions or di seases rel evant to the di sease under study that resolved at or prior to signing of inform ed consent. Ongoing condit ions are considered concurrent medical condit ions (see Secti on9.1.10 ). Medicat ion history informat ion to be obtained includes any medicat ion relevant to eligibilit y criteria and the efficacy or safet y evaluat ions stopped or started within 6 months prior to signing o f inform ed consent. Subjects will be asked if they have used ketamine therapy within the past 6 weeks prior to screening, how long ago was the therapy provi ded, what form ulation was used, whether th e therapy provi ded relief, and why the therapy was stopped. Subj ects will be asked if they experience flare -ups in their pain and, if so, how frequent ly. 9.1.3 Physical Examination Procedure A baseline physical examinat ion (defined as the assessment prior to fir st dose of study drug) will consist of a general examinat ion of the fo llowing body systems: (1) ears, nose, throat; (2)cardiovascular system; (3) respi ratory system; (4) gastrointest inal system; (5) dermatologic system; (6) extremit ies; (7) musculoskeleta l system; (8) lymph nodes; and (9) other. All subsequent physical examinat ions should assess clinically significant changes from the assessment prior to fir st dose examinat ion.

This will include testing mental status, gait, cerebellar function, cranial nerves, motor function (including strength and reflexes), and sensation. As part of the neurological exam, vision testing is recommended to include fundoscopy and best corrected visual acuity using a pocket vision screening card, if possible. 9.1.6 Weight, Height, and BMI A subject should have weight and height measured while wearing indoor clothing and with shoes off. The BMI is calculated using metric units with the formula provided below. Height is recorded in centimeters without decimal places. Weight is collected in kilograms (kg) with 1 decimal place. BMI should be derived as: Metric: BMI = weight (kg)/height (m)2 Note that although height is reported in centimeters, the formula uses meters for height; meters can be determined from centimeters by dividing by 100. Thus, for example, if height = 176 cm (1.76 meters) and weight = 79.2 kg, then BMI = 79.2/1.762= 25.56818 kg/m2, which will be rounded to 25.6 kg/m2. 9.1.7 Vital Sign Procedure Vital signs will include oral body temperat ure, respiratory rate, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic, resting more than 5 minutes), and pulse (bpm). 9.1.8 Primary Efficacy Measurements 9.1.8.1 NPS The 24-hour average pain intensity (NPS, an 11-point scale) will be calculated from current pain intensity scores collected 3 times a day as measured by the electronic pain diary daily during Parts A and B. Pain intensity will be evaluated on the a ffected limb. If more than 1 limb is involved, the subject and the investigator will determine which limb is the most problematic and the pain intensity will be evaluated for that limb throughout the study. For both Parts A and B, average 24-hour pain intensity will be calculated as the mean of 3 measurements collected during a day. The average pain intensity score will be calculated as the mean of the average 24-hour pain intensity score collected during the last 7 days before Day 21(Week 3) , Day 105 (Week 15) (or the last dose in Part A), which will be used for the primary endpoint analysis, as well as Day 147 (Week 21) and Day 203 (Week 29) (or the last dose in Part B).CCI Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to theng indoog indo a provida provi in kilogin kilog m))2 eters, ters, thth by 100by 10 BMIBMI == bodyodytemteyy n 5n 5minmi fficacy fficacy ur averagr aver y scores scoresy B.

Subjects will have the option to continue into Part B, a 14 -week open -label extensio n study , or to enter a fo llow-up period which includes a double -blind taper period (maximum 6 days) fo llowed by a 2-week fo llow-up peri od off IP. In all subjects choosing the taper period, the IP dose will be reduced to the next lower dose every 3 days (or l ess frequent ly based on the invest igator’s discret ion) unt il IP dose is discont inued. Subjects who withdraw early f rom Part A of the study will undergo dose tapering and complete all procedures scheduled for the end of Part A/early termination visit (Visit 8) at time o f withdrawal . The invest igator in consultat ion with the m edical m onitor will evaluate the possible eff ects of rapid withdrawal from the study drug versus the risk of continuing the drug. 9.3.5 Part B Because treatment assignment in Part A will remain blinded, all subjects who choose to continue into Part B will start at 200 mg BID TAK -935 (100 mg tablets). Subje cts should remain at this dose for 1 week. The site will contact the subject by phone on Day 108 to determine safet y and tolerabilit y. The subject will return to the clinic on Day 112 (Week 16, Vi sit 9) to com plete all scheduled assessments, assess safet y and tolerability, and adjust study drug dosing as needed. The dose may be decreased fro m 200 mg BID to 100 mg BID based on tolerabilit y at Visit 9 (Day 112, Week 16). After Visit 9, subjects will visit the clinic approximately every 4 weeks (Visit 10 [Day 119, Week 17], Visit 11 [Day 147, Week 21], Visit 12 [Day 175, Week 25], and Visit 13 [Day 203, Week 29]). The current pain intensit y will be co llected 3 times a day using the electronic pain diar y daily . From this data an average 24- hour pain intensit y score can be calculated. 9.3.6 End of Part B or Early Termination The end o f Part B (Vi sit 13) is on Day 203 (Week 29), at which t ime the appropriate dose de-escalat ion schedule begins. Subjects return to the clinic to complete all scheduled assessments. During the taper period, the IP dose will be reduced to the next lower dose every 3 days (or l ess frequently based on the invest igator’s discret ion) unt il IP dose is discontinued. Subjects who withdraw early fro m Part B of the study should undergo dose tapering a nd co mplete all procedures scheduled for the final fo llow-up visit (Visit 13) at time of wit hdrawal.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f a drug whether or not it is considered rela ted to the drug. Thi s includes any newly occurring event or a previous condi tion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administrati on of study drug. 10.1.3 Additional Points to Consider for AEs An untoward finding generally may: Indicate a new dia gnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre -exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered AEs.) Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion. Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure. Requi re discon tinuation or a change in dose of study drug or a concomitant medicat ion. Be considered unfavorable by the invest igator for any reason. Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms: Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (inclu ding abnorm al laboratory values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded appropriately as an AE(s). Changes in intensit y of AEs: If the subject experiences ch anges in intensit y of an AE, the event should be captured once with the m aximum intensity recorded. Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or intervent ions): Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled prior to signing of inform ed consent are not considered AEs.

Complications result ing fro m any planned surge ry shoul d be reported as AEs. Elect ive surgeries or procedures: Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion shoul d not be recorded as AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source documents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs. Procedures for CRPS are not allowed during the study , by consent. Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion, should NOT be recorded as an AE.

Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities. Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities. 10.1.7 Causality of AEs The relationship of each AE to study drug(s) will be assessed using the following categories: Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be ruled out, although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant medications and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible. Not Related: An AE that does not follo w a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/or that can reasonably be explained by other factors, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant medications and concurrent treatments. 10.2 Procedures 10.2.1 Collection and Reporting of AEs 10.2.1.1 AE Collection Period Collection of AEs will commence from the time informed consent is provided at screening (Visit 1) and continue until early termination or until the follow-up visit (Visit 13, Week 29). For subjects who discontinue prior to study drug administration, AEs are collected until the subject discontinues study participation. 10.2.1.2 AE Reporting At each study visit, the investigator will assess whether any subjective AEs have occurred. A neutral question, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” may be asked. Subjects may report AEs occurring at any othe r time during the study. Subjects experiencing an SAE must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or there is a satisfactory explanation for the change. All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study drug or not, must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed.

The PK analysis sets for Parts A and B will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and have at l east 1 m easurable TAK -935 or M -1 plasma concentration. The PD analys is set for Parts A and B will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and have at least 1 measurable plasma 24HC concentration. 13.1.2 Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics Dem ographic and other baseline characteri stics will be summarized and listed for enrolled subjects by treatm ent group and overall. Descript ive statist ics will be used to summarize data for continuous variables such as age and weight (eg, number of subjects, mean, median, standard devia tion, and range) and for categorical variables such as sex, ethnicit y, and race (number and percentage of subjects within each category). Medical history and medicat ion history will be listed by subject. 13.1.3 Efficacy Analysis For the primary efficacy endpoint, only subjects wi th a baseline and at least 1 postdose value will be included in the summary and analyses. The data from the last 7 days prior to the visit s on Day 21 (Week 3), Day 105 (Week 15) (or the last dose in Part A, whichever is earlier), Day 147 (Week 21), and Day 203 (Week 29) (or the last dose in Part B, whichever is earlier) will be used to derive the mean 24 -hour pain intensit y for the corresponding visit s.

Subject treatment will be unblinded for this interim analysis. The interim analysis will include the primary and secondary efficacy analysis as well as safety and PK/PD summaries for the data collected during Part A. Because this analysis will be c onducted at the end of the double-blind period, this analysis will be considered as the primary efficacy assessment of TAK-935 on CRPS relative to placebo. No alpha spending or adjustment to sample size will be needed based on the results of this analysis. 13.3 Determination of Sample Size Assuming a standard deviation of 2 and a 12% drop-out rate, a sample size of 24 subjects in total with randomization ra tio of 2:1 is sufficient to achieve at least 65% power to detect a difference of 2 between TAK-935 and placebo by a 2-sample t- test on the change from baseline to Week 15 in mean 24-hour pain intensity NPS score at 0.10 2-si ded significance level.

The sponsor or designee w ill require documentation noting all names and tit les of members who make up the respective IRB. If any member of the IRB has direct participat ion in this study , written notificat ion regarding his or her abst inence fro m voting must also be obtained. Those Americas sites unwilling to provide names and tit les of all members due to privacy and conflict of interest concerns should instead provide a Federal Wide Assurance Number or comparable number assigned by the Depart ment of Healt h and Human Services. The sp onsor or desi gnee will supply relevant documents for submission to the respective IRB for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the Invest igator’s Brochure, a copy of the ICF, and, if applicable, subject recruit ment materials and/or advertisem ents and other documents requi red by all applicable laws and regulations, must be submitted to a central or local IRB for approval . The IRB’s wri tten approval of the protocol and subject informed consent must be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or des ignee before commencement of the study . The IRB approval must refer to the study by exact protocol title, number, and versio n date; ident ify versio ns of other documents (eg, ICF) reviewed; and state the approval date. The sponsor will notify site once the sponsor has confirmed the adequacy o f site regulatory docum entati on and, when applicable, the sponsor has received permissio n from competent authori ty to begin the study . Study sites m ust adhere to all requirements st ipulated by their respect ive IRB. This may include notification to the IRB regarding protocol amendments, updates to the ICF, recruit ment materials intended for viewing by subjects, l ocal safety reporti ng requirements, reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the study at intervals s pecified by the respective IRB, and submissio n of the invest igator’s final status report to IRB.

Informat ion shoul d be given in both oral and wri tten form whenever possible and in the m anner deem ed appropriate by the IRB. The subject must be given ample opportunit y to: (1) inquire about details of the study and (2)decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, deter mines he or she will participate in the study, then the ICF and subject authorizat ion form (if applicable) must be signed and dated by the subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, at the time of consent and prior to the subject entering into the study . The subject shoul d be instructed to si gn using their legal names, not nicknames, using a ballpo int pen wi th either blue or bl ack ink. The investigator must also sign and date the ICF and subject authorizat ion (if applicable) at the time of consent and before the subject enters into the study; however, the sponsor may allow a designee of the invest igator to sign to the extent permitted by applicable law. Once signed, the original ICF, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject i nform ation sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the investigator’s site file. The investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subject’s medical record. Copies of the signed ICF, the signed subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) shall be given to the subject. All revised ICFs must be reviewed and signed by relevant subjects in the same manner as the original informed consent. The date the revised consent was obtained shoul d be recorded in the subject’s medical record, and the subject should receive a copy of the revised ICF. 15.3 Subject Confidentiality The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the subject’s right to protection against invasio n of privacy . Throughout this study , a subject’s source data will only be linked to the sponsor’s clinical trial database or documentation via a subject ID number. As permitted by all applicable laws and regulations, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or da te of birth, and subject init ials may be used to verify the subject and accuracy of the subject’s unique ID number.
