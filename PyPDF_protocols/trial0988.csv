EASI -90 in one of the secondary endpoints was changed to EASI -75. Clarified that the estimand is PP -NRS4 (previously PP -NRS) since the endpoint is based on achieving at least a 4 -point improvement in the severity of PP -NRS4 from baseline. Sample size determination was updated to reflect the change from EASI -75 to EASI -90 in the primary and key secondary endpoints. Clarified the CMH analyses method for the primary endpoint. The tipping point analysis was changed to multiple imputations under the assumption of missing at random. Per updated safety information, participants with increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism are excluded. Inclusion criterion updated to require a clinical diagnosis of AD at least 6 months prior to Day 1 instead of at least 1 year. The duration of AD diagnosis has not been associated with the magnitude of treatment effect of other AD therapies. Given other current inclusion criteria, such as the requirement for recent inadequate response to topical therapies and/or treatment with (or consideration for) systemic therapies, reducing this inclusion criterion to 6 months is not anticipated to affect the study results. Exclusion of prior use of dupilumab has been expanded to include all IL -4 and IL -13 antagonists. Dupilumab is"

By expanding the criterion to inclu de the drug class, we avoid inadvertently enriching the patient population with participants who are non -responders to this mechanism. Revised the baseline infection study terminology from “viral studies” to “infection studies” to allow for testing of oth er types of microorganisms. Added additional infection studies sample to be taken at each study visit. This will allow for testing of SARS - CoV- 2 or another emergent microbial organisms. Language and an appendix were added to address COVID -19 and to descri be alternative measures to be taken during public emergencies. This is in reference to the April 2020 PACL. Added statement that if the participant experiences nausea, consideration should be given to administering oral study intervention with food. A food effect and lower incidence of nausea in a fed state has been observed in some participants. Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) assessment was moved from Week 16 to Week 12. There is a 3 - month recall so if you assess at WK12 you are capturing the resou rce use from baseline to WK12 and then you capture the rest of the HCRU (more or less) when you assess at WK26. If we kept it at WK16 then we would miss the first 4 w eeks post -baseline. Added Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) for participants with a prio r diagnosis of asthma. Asthma is a common comorbidity in patients with AD and this questionnaire will provide information about whether abrocitinib has any effect on asthma control. New clinical trial data from the abrocitinib study B7451013 and from the d upilumab CAFÉ and CHRONOS studies have been added to the protocol introduction. Updates made per updated protocol template: Clarified inclusion criterion 3 for female participants ."

Clarified that the BSA for a subset of body regions (scalp, palms, and soles of feet) evaluated in EASI will be entered in the eCRF. Temporary discontinuation timeframe updated for the injectable study intervention and requirement added for participants who need systemic rescue therapy to temporarily discontinue the study intervention while taking systemic rescue therapy. Participants n eed to temporarily discontinue the study intervention while taking systemic rescue therapy because the medications taken together could further suppress the participant’s immune system and, therefore, cause an increased safety risk. Clarified that particip ants who use rescue therapy will be defined as “non -responsive” after start of rescue therapy. Added isoniazid as a prohibited concomitant medication. Clarified that the block randomization method will be used. Recall period has been updated for the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (per the December 2019 PACL). Anchors have been updated for the Skin Pain Numerical Rating Scale (per the December 2019 PACL). Informal i nterim analyses for internal decision -making have been added. Collection of prior marijua na use has been removed. The information would not be used in analyses.

Section 10.4.: Definition of postmenopausal female was revised to specify that the main condition is the absence of bleeding for 12 months without an alternative medical cause (removed portion of definition that allow ed for participants age 60 or older to be considered postmenopausal). FSH level must be assessed in women in the postmenopausal range under the age of 60 and not using hormonal contraceptio n or HRT (“may” changed to “must”). This was revised per the Czech Republic request and to be consistent with the current protocol template.

Over the past 50 years, AD has become more prevalent, especiall y in industrialized, temperate countries such as the United States (US).1,2AD is one of the most common, chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, impacting 15 -30% of all children in the US and many have disease that persists into adulthood with a lifetime prevalence of those affected in childhood reported to be 34%.3 Earlier reports indicated that, in up to 70% of cases, the disease greatl y improves or resolves b y late childhood, however more recent findings suggest that disease activit y remains manifest for a prolonged period of time. Based on a total of 7157 participants enrolled in the Pediatric Eczema Elective Registry (PEER) study , comprising a total of 22,550 person -years, it was concluded that s ymptoms associated with AD seem to persist well into the second decade of life and likel y longer.4 At every age, more than 80% of PEER study participants had s ymptoms of AD and/or were using medication to treat their AD. Of the currentl y available therapies, none offers a cure; therefore, the main aims of existing treatments are to reduce skin lesions, reduce the occurrence of acute flares, to increase the time between relapses, and to reduce pruritus and the resulting sleep disturbance.5,6 Non-medicated topical therapies include emolli ents. Medicated topical therapy for moderate to severe AD include topical corticosteroids (TCS) (eg, betamethasone, clobetasol, fluocinonide), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (eg, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus), and coal tar preparations. TCS are limited in terms of the treatment duration (eg, corticosteroid use is limited to 2 to 4 weeks) and the body region of treatment, due to consistent skin toxicities, as well as having risks associated with their broad immunosuppressive actions. TCI have a limited role as a second -line treatment, due to their limitations in the duration and the bod y region of treatment, inhibition of tumor surveillance in the skin, and safet y concerns with malignancies. Crisaborole was approved as a medicated topical therap y (phosphodiesterase 4 [PDE4] inhibitor) in December 2016 b y the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use inpatients with mild to moderate AD and is being evaluated for approval in several other regions. Additional treatments generall y reserved for severe AD include phototherapy (eg, ultraviolet A light [UVA] with or without psoralen, ultraviolet B -light [UVB] narrowband or broadband) and s ystemic agents (eg, corticosteroids, cy closporine, recombinant interferon"

Per the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines, the use of steroids should be avoided for the treatment of AD and should be exclusively reserved for acute, severe exacerbations and as a short -term bridge therapy to other sy stemic, steroid- sparing thera pies.8 Dupilumab, an injectable human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL) - 4 and -13, was approved b y the FDA in March 2017 and received marketing authorization in Europe in September 2017, for the treatment of moderate t o severe AD. Treatment with sy stemic corticosteroids has known and well documented adverse effects. Treatment with dupilumab has the risk of injection site reactions, allergic reactions, ey e and ey elid inflammations and cold sores. Another potential lim itation of dupilumab is the possibility for the development of antidrug antibodies, which may result in loss of efficacy over time and the development of safet y concerns such as serum sickness -like reactions. Furthermore, dupilumab is delivered via subcut aneous injection, which may not be a method of administration tolerated well by all patients. During a 1 -year, randomized, double -blinded study with dupilumab, in the dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (marketed maintenance dose) plus TCS group, the estimated difference from placebo of the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response rate and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) -75 response rate ( ≥75% improvement from baseline in EASI score) were 26% and 46%, respectivel y. The placebo response rate for IG A and EASI -75 was 12% and 23%, respectively .9The dupilumab res ponse rate for a ≥4-point improvement from baseline in PP -NRS4 at Week 2 and ≥90% improvement from baseline in EASI score (EASI -90) was 18% and 40%, respectively .9 There is a need for therapies for those patients who do not respond to dupilumab or who after responding, fail to improve with dupilumab. The development of potential treatments with further improvements in efficacy remains desirable. In Europe, cyclosporine is approved for use in patients with severe AD when sy stemic therap y is required. Cyclosporine use is associated with several undesirable side effects and due to its narrow therapeutic index, occasional therapeutic drug monitorin g is recommended. Known adverse effects include infections, renal toxicity , hepatotoxicity , skin malignancies, lymphoma and other malignancies. The predominant unmet medical need is for a conveniently administered therap y with an acceptable safet y profil e, for continuous and intermittent use, which is effective for moderate to severe AD. Patients with moderate to severe AD require other s ystemic treatment options beyond those which are currentl y approved. Abrocitinib is an oral tablet, providing a more convenient route of administration compared with the subcutaneous injection required for dupilumab and so it does not have the potential risk of injection site reactions. Unlike dupilumab, abrocitinib is a small molecule and there is no anticipated immuno genicity to abrocitinib, and so it is unlikely to generate antidrug antibodies and may be used intermittently ."

Abrocitinib (formerl y known as PF -04965842) is an orall y bioavailable small mol ecule that selectivel y inhibits JAK1 by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. Abrocitinib has a high degree of selectivity for JAK1 when compared, in vitro, against other kinases: 28- fold selectivity over Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), >340 -foldover Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and 43- fold over ty rosine kinase 2 (TYK2), as well as a good selectivity profile over the broader range of human kinases. The selective inhibition of JAK1 will lead to modulation of multiple cy tokine pathway s involved in the pa thophy siology of AD, including IL-4,IL-13, IL -31 and IFN -. Data from a Phase 2b proof of concept (POC) study (B7451006) that evaluated participants with moderate to severe AD have shown positive efficacy with both 100 and 200 mg, as well as an acceptab le safety profile, sufficient to support further clinical development in a larger Phase 3 program. Abrocitinib has been in Phase 3 development since December 2017 treating participants with moderate to severe AD with or without topical treatment. The fi rst Phase 3 studies , B7451012 and B7451013, that evaluated 100 and 200 mg QD abrocitinib in participants with moderate to severe AD, which completed in 2019, reported statisticall y significant improvement in efficacy endpoints in both treatment groups compared to the placebo group, with an acceptable safet y profile. This Phase 3b study will investigate whether abrocitinib provides comparable or improved efficacy and safet y compared with duplilumab in the treatment of moderate to severe AD. Statistical Me thods The objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of abrocitinib 200 mg once dail y (QD) to dupilumab 300 mg every other week (Q2W) as measured by Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP -NRS 4) response at Week 2 and EASI -90 response at Week 4. Additionally , this study is intended to demonstrate that abrocitinib 200 mg QD is non- inferior to dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and if non -inferior, to demonstrate the superiority to dupilumab as measured b y EASI -90 response at Week 16. A total sample of 600 parti cipants, with 300 participants randomized to abrocitinib, 300 participants randomized to dupilumab (1:1 randomization) is planned. The proposed sample size provides adequate power for all superiority hypotheses, as follows: Week 2: this sample size would provide at least 99% power to detect a difference assuming a difference of at least 25% in PP- NRS4 between abrocitinib and dupilumab and assuming the dupilumab response rate is 11% at Week 2."

This sample size will also provide approximately 70% power to demonst rate superiority of abrocitinib 200 mg QD to dupilumab as measured b y EASI -90 response at Week 16. The T ype I error rate is set at 5% (two sided). The familywise Type I error rate (for testing the primary and key secondary endpoints) will be strongl y cont rolled at 5% using a sequential testing approach. This is described in further detail in Section 9of the protocol and in the statistical analy sis plan (SAP). For analy sis of the primary and key secondary endpoints, the Cochran- Mante l-Haenszel test adjusted by disease severity group (moderate and severe) will be used. For participants who drop out for an y reason or use rescue therap y (Section 6.5.2) at any time during the treatment period, the response will be defined as “non -respons ive” after that point. For continuous endpoints, a mixed -effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be used. This model will include the factors (fixed effects) for treatment group, disease severity group, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, and r elevant baseline value. Within the framework of MMRM, the treatment at each time point will be derived from the MMRM model.

Overall Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy , active controlled, multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib 200 mg QD compared with dupilumab (administered per label guidelines) in adult participants on background topical therapy, with moderate to severe AD. The treatment duration is 26 weeks. A total of approximately 600 participants will be enrolled from approximately 220 sites globally. There are primary efficacy assessments at Week 2 and Week 4, and a key secondary efficacy assessment at Week 16. Efficacy and safety endpoints will be assessed throughout the entire study. Participants who complete the study through the Week 26 visit and are deemed eligible may enter the long-term extension (LTE) Study B7451015. A study design schematic is presented in Section 1.2. After providing informed consent, participants will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. Participants will undergo screening within approximately 28 days prior to randomization. Use of screening procedures exceeding 28 days prior to randomization should be discussed with the Pfizer Medical Monitor. During the screening period, systemic treatments for AD will be washed out, as applicable, according to eligibility requirements. Eligible participants must have a documented history, within 6 months of the screening visit, of inadequate response to treatment with medicated topical therapy for at least 4 weeks or must have required systemic therapies for control of their disease within the previous year. Eligible participants must meet the eligibility criteria, which includes being dupilumab naïve, at baseline. In addition, participants must be willing and able to use standardized background topical therapy, as per protocol guidelines, throughout the duration of the study. After Week 4, if medically necessary, participants with intolerable AD symptoms may receive locally-approved rescue therapy, at the investigator’s discretion, pursuant to the protocol guidelines (refer to Section 6.5.2 ). Participants may be re-screened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions. Participants for whom screen failure is related to failing the disease severity (including extent of disease) inclusion criterion and who subsequently experience worsening AD, which in the investigator’s judgement would make them eligible for participation, may be considered for re-screening. Such cases should be discussed with the Pfizer Medical Monitor (or designee) to determine if re-screening is appropriate."

Abrocitinib (formerl y known as PF -04965842) is an orall y bioavailable small molecule that selectivel y inhibits JAK1 by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. Abrocitinib has a high degree of selectivity in vitro against other kinases: 28 -fold selectivity over JAK2, >340- fold over JAK3 and 43 -foldover TYK2, as well as a good selectivity profile over the broader range of human kinases. The selective inhibition of JAK1 will lead to modulation of multiple cy tokine pathway s involved in the pathophy siology of AD, including IL-4, IL-13, IL -31 and IFN -. Abrocitinib is being developed as an oral treatment for patients with moderate to severe AD based on the existing unmet need in AD, its novel mechanism of action, and the clinical results obtained in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. The clinical developme nt program for abrocitinib includes healthy volunteers, participants with psoriasis and participants with AD. Data from a Phase 2b POC study (B7451006) that evaluated participants with moderate to severe AD have shown positive efficacy with both 100 and 20 0 mg, as well as an acceptable safet y profile, sufficient to support further clinical development in a larger Phase 3 program. 2.1.Study Rationale Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by flaky skin lesions, intense pruritus, and a general deterioration in quality of life. Over the past 50 years, AD has become more prevalent, especiall y in industrialized, temperate countries such as the US.1,2 AD is one of the most common, chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, impacting 15 -30% of all children in the US and many have disease that persists into adulthood with a lifetime prevalence of those affected in childhood reported to be 34 %.3 Earlier reports indicated that, in up to 70% of cases, the disease greatly improves or resolves by late childhood, however more recent findings suggest that disease activity remains manifest for a prolonged period of time. Based on a total of 7157 participants enrolled in the PEER study , comprising a total of 22,550 person -years, it was concluded that sy mptoms associated with AD seem to persist well into the second decade of life and likely longer.4At every age, more than 80% of PEER study participants had sy mptoms of AD and/or were using medication to treat their AD. In 833 AD participants who were aged 20 years or older when they visited the clinic and 45 years or older when they responded to a follow- up questionnaire, 59% responded that they had defined persistent AD at some time during the last 12 months.10 Of the currentl y available therapies, none offers a cure; therefore, the main aims of existing treatments are to improve skin lesions, to reduce the occurrence of acute flares, to increase the time between relapses, and to reduce pruritus and the resulting sleep disturbance.5,6 Non-medicated topical therapies include emollients. Medicat ed topical therapy for moderate to severe AD include TCS (eg, betamethasone, clobetasol, fluocinonide), TCI (eg,"
29,page_29,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 30pimecrolimus, tacrolimus), and coal tar preparations. TCS are limited in terms of the treatment duration (eg, corticosteroid use is limited to 2 to 4 weeks) and the body region of treatment, due to consistent skin toxicities, as well as having risks associated with their broad immunosuppressive actions. TCI have a limited role as a second- line treatment, due to their limitations in the duration and the bod y region of treatment, inhibition of tumor surveillance in the skin, and safet y concerns with malignancies. Crisaborole was approved as a medicated topical therap y (PDE4 inhibitor) in December 2016 by the FDA for use in patients with mild to moderate AD and is being evaluated for approval in several other regions. Additional treatments generally reserved for severe AD include phototherap y (eg, UVA with or without psoralen, UVB narrowband or broadband) and s ystemic agents (eg, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, recombinant interferon gamma (IFN -), mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate [MTX], azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin).7 There are a limited number of approved s ystemic treatments for moderate to severe AD and in the US, the only approved sy stemic drugs are corticosteroids and dupilumab. Per the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines, the use of steroids should be avoided for the treatment of AD and should be exclusively reserved for acute, severe exacerbat ions and as a short -term bridge therapy to other sy stemic, steroid- sparing therapies.8 The predominant unmet medical need is for a conveniently administered therap y with an acceptable safet y profile, for long -term use, which is effect ive for moderate to severe AD. Patients with moderate to severe AD require other sy stemic treatment options bey ond those which are currently approved. 2.2.Background 2.2.1. Atopic Dermatitis The majority of AD studies conducted across multiple age groups sugg est decreasing prevalence with older age.11Adult-onset AD does occur, though it is less common. The prevalence of AD in adults is estimated to be 10%.12Recent studies have indicated that adults with AD are more likel y to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and have a sedentary lifest yle, potentially associated with increased comorbidities, such as asthma and cardiovascular disease.13 Although great strides have been made in understanding the causes, the complex pathophy siology of AD is still not completely understood. It has been established that the pathophy siology of AD includes a defective skin barrier function, allergic responses, defective antimicrobial immune defense, and a genetic predisposition. The predominant symptom of AD, pruritus and the resulting scratching, t ypicall y sets off an amplification cycle of atopic skin inflammation. Activation of T lymphocy tes, dendritic cel ls, macrophages, keratinocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils results in a release of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This amplification cy cle sustains the inflammatory responses characteristic of the AD lesions.14 Acute AD lesions have been associated with the ty pe2 helper T cell (TH2) phenoty pe, showing dominance of IL -4, -5, -13, and -31 secretion.9,14,15Recent research showed that a"
30,page_30,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 31small incre ase of ty pe1 helper T cell (TH1) associated genes has also been detected in the acute phase.16 While IL -4-producing TH2 cells may drive the development of atopic skin lesions, chronic lesions show either the coexistence of both IL -4-producing TH2 and IFN--producing TH1 cells or TH1 dominance.14 This coexistence of TH2 and TH1 responses or TH1 dominance is more likely to be the underly ing immunopathology in adult patients who have had AD chronicall y or intermi ttently since childhood. Recent evidence also supports IL -31’s role in pruritus and inflammation in AD.9,15 In Europe, cyclosporine is approved for use in patients with severe AD when sy stemic therap y is required. Cyclosporine use is associated with several undesirable side effects and due to its narrow therapeutic index, occasional therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended. Known adverse effects include infections, renal toxicity , hepatotoxicity , skin malignancies, lymphoma and other malignancies. 2.2.2. Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab in AD Dupilumab, an injectable human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL) -4 and -13, was approved b y the FDA in March 2017 and received marketing authorization in Europe in September 2017, for the treatment of moderate to severe AD. Treatment with sy stemic corticosteroids has known and well documented adverse eff ects. During a 1 year, randomized, double blinded study with dupilumab, in the dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (marketed maintenance dose) plus TCS group, the estimated difference from placebo of the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response rate and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) 75 response rate ( ≥75% improvement from baseline in EASI score) were 26% and 46%, respectivel y. The placebo response rate for IGA and EASI- 75 was 12% and 23%, respectively. The dupilumab response rate for a ≥4-point i mprovement from baseline in PP- NRS 4at Week 2 and ≥90% improvement from baseline in EASI score (EASI - 90) was 18% and 40%, respectivel y.9 There is a need for therapies for those patients who do not respond to dupilumab or who aft er responding, fail to improve with dupilumab. The development of potential treatments with further improvements in efficacy remains desirable. In 2 randomized, placebo -controlled, Phase 3 trials of identical design (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2), adults with moderat e-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease was inadequatel y controlled by topical treatment were enrolled. Participants were randoml y assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive, for 16 weeks, subcutaneous dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo weekl y or the same dose of dupilumab every other week alternating with placebo. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who had both a score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) on the Investigator’s Global Assessment and a reduction of 2 points or more in that score fr om baseline at week 16. In SOL O 1 (671 participants), the primary outcome occurred in 85 participants (38%) who received dupilumab every other week and in 83 (37%) who received dupilumab weekl y, as compared with 23 (10%) who received placebo (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). The results were similar in SOLO 2 (708 participants), with the primary outcome occurring in 84 participants (36%) who received dupilumab every other week and in 87 (36%) who received dupilumab weekl y, as compared with 20 (8%) who"
31,page_31,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 32received placebo (P<0.001 for both comparisons). In addition, in the 2 trials, an improvement from baseline to week 16 of at least 75% on the Eczema Area and Severity I ndex was reported in significantl y more participants who received each regimen of dupilumab than in participants who received placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Dupilumab was also associated with improvement in other clinical end points, including reduction in pruritus and symptoms of anxiety or depression and improvement in qualit y of life. Injection -site reactions and conjunctivitis were more frequent in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo groups.17 In the CAFÉ stud y, the efficacy and safet y of dupilumab in combination TCS was evaluated in 325 adults wi th inadequate response to/intolerance of cy closporin A (CsA), or for whom CsA treatment was not medicall y advisable. In this 16- week, double -blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial, participants were randomized 1:1:1 to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg weekly (QW) or every 2 weeks (Q2W) or placebo. All received concomitant medium- potency TCS from Week -2 through Week 16; dosage could be tapered if lesions cleared or could be stopped for adverse reactions to TCS. Significantly more participants i n the dupilumab QW + TCS and Q2W + TCS groups achieved ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index at Week 16 vs. the placebo + TCS group (primary endpoint) (59.1% and 62.6% vs. 29.6%, respectivel y; P < 0·001 vs. placebo + TCS, bo th doses). More participants in the dupilumab QW + TCS and Q2W + TCS groups achieved ≥ 90% improvement from baseline in the EASI at Week 16 vs. the placebo + TCS group (post -hoc outcome) (37.3% and 45.8% vs. 12.0%, respectivel y). Other clinical outcomes an d atopic dermatitis symptoms were significantly improved in the dupilumab QW + TCS and Q2W + TCS groups, including pruritus, pain, sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and quality of life (QoL). Treatment groups had similar overall rates of adverse events (QW + TCS, Q2W + TCS and placebo + TCS groups: 69.1%, 72.0% and 69.4%, respectively ) and serious adverse events (1·8%, 1·9% and 1·9%, respectivel y). Conjunctivitis was more frequent with dupilumab + TCS; skin infections were more frequent with placebo + TCS.18 In the CHRONOS study , the long -term efficacy and safet y of dupilumab with medium- potency topical corticosteroids versus placebo with topical corticosteroids was evaluated in 740 adults with moderate -to-sever e atopic dermatitis. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1:3) to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg QW, dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, or placebo. At Week 16, more participants who received dupilumab plus topical corticosteroids achieved the coprimary endpoints of IGA 0/1 (39% [125 participants] who received dupilumab plus topical corticosteroids QW and 39% [41 participants] who received dupilumab Q2W plus topical corticosteroids vs 12% [39 participants] who received placebo plus topical corticosteroids; p<0·0001) and EASI -75 (64% [204] and 69% [73] vs 23% [73]; p<0·0001). Week 52 results were similar. Adverse events were reported in 261 (83%) participants who received dupilumab qw plus topical corticosteroids, 97 (88%) participants who received dupilumab Q2W , and 266 (84%) participants who received placebo, and serious adverse events in 9 (3%), 4 (4%), and 16 (5%) participants, respectivel y. No significant dupilumab - induced laboratory abnormalities were noted. Injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis were more co mmon in participants treated with dupilumab plus topical corticosteroids than in participants treated with placebo plus topical corticosteroids.9"
32,page_32,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 33Treatment with s ystemic corticosteroids has known and well documented adverse effects. Treatment with dupilumab has the risk of injection site reactions, allergic reactions, ey e and eyelid inflammation and cold sores. Another potential limitation of dupilumab is the possibility for development of antidrug antibodies, which may result in los s of efficacy over time and the development of safet y concerns such as serum sickness -like reactions. Furthermore, dupilumab is delivered via subcutaneous injection, which may not be a method of administration tolerated well by all participants.20 2.2.3. Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Abrocitinib in AD Abrocitinib is being developed as an oral treatment for participants with moderate to severe AD based on the existing unmet need in AD, its novel mechanism of action, and the clinical result s obtained in Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 studies. The clinical development program for abrocitinib includes healthy participants, as well as participants with psoriasis and with AD. Abrocitinib is an oral tablet, providing a more convenient route of ad ministration compared with the subcutaneous injection required for dupilumab and so it does not have the potential risk of injection site reactions. Unlike dupilumab, abrocitinib is a small molecule and there is no anticipated immunogenicity to abrocitini b, and so it is unlikely to generate antidrug antibodies and may be used intermittently . Key cytokines implicated in the pathophy siology of AD include IL -4, IL -5, IL -13, IL -31, and IFN-, and require Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) for signal transduction; this sugg ests that selective JAK1 inhibitors that modulate the activity of these cy tokines represent a compelling approach to the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.9Broader inhibition of cytokines, including those important in the pathogenesis of AD, may result in an increased proportion of responders, with an acceptable safety profile. B7451006 was a Phase 2b POC trial in 269 adults (ages 18-75) with moderate to severe AD investigating doses of abrocitinib at doses of 10, 30, 100, and 200 mg or placebo taken once daily for up to 12 weeks. The primary endpoint in this study was the proportion of participants achieving an IGA score of clear (0), or almost clear (1), and a 2-point improvement from baseline at Week 12. The b aseline was defined as the IGA score on Day 1 pre -dose. At Week 12, IGA response rates of abrocitinib 100 mg and 200 mg dose groups were significantl y greater than placebo in participants with moderate to severe AD. The IGA response rates of the 200 mg a nd 100 mg groups were 44.5% and 27.8%, respectively . The IGA response rate in the placebo group was 6.3% and the estimated differences from placebo in the 200 mg and 100 mg groups were 38.2% (P=0.0032) and 21.5% (P=0.0184), respectivel y. The percent cha nge from baseline (% CFB) in EASI scores at Week 12 were significantly higher for both the 200 mg and 100 mg groups compared to placebo. The estimated percent change from baseline in EASI score was - 35.2% in the placebo group, -82.6% in the 200 mg group and - 59.0% in the 100 mg group. At Week 12, the proportion of participants achieving"
33,page_33,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 34EASI -75 response was 15.6% in the placebo group, 63.7% in the 200 mg group and 41.6% in the 100 mg group. The difference from placebo was 41.8% (P<0.0001) for the 200 mg group and 26.0% (P=0.0043) in the 100 mg group. At Day 15, the proportion of response based on achieving at least a 4 -point improvement in the severit y of PP -NRS from baseline of abrocitinib 100 mg and 200 mg dose groups was greater than placebo. The estimated proportion of PP -NRS responses at Day 15 were 69.8%, 41.1% and 15.7% for 200 mg, 100 mg and placebo groups, respectively . Abrocitinib demonstrated a rapid onset of action. I n the 200 mg group, IGA and EASI scores improv ed until Week 4 and Week 6, respectively , and maintained their effect through 12 weeks of treatment. Response rates at Week 12 for the 10 mg and 30 mg groups were not significantl y different from placebo. A key differentiating feature for the JAK1 inhibi tor is rapid resolution of itch associated with AD. Significant separation from placebo was achieved for the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP- NRS) score as earl y as 2 days after initiation of treatment for the 200 mg dose group. Overall, the resu lts demonstrated dose-dependent increases in responses at Week 12 for key efficacy endpoints (IGA, EASI and PP- NRS score). Abrocitinib appeared generall y safe and well tolerated in this study . Overall, adverse events (AE)s and serious adverse events (SAE) s were numericall y higher in participants receiving abrocitinib compared to placebo but did not appear to increase with dose. The most common AEs were in the infections and infestations, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and gastrointestinal disorder s system organ class (SOC), and the majority of the AEs were mild. There were 2 cases of herpes zoster, 1 in the 10 mg group (not treatment related), and 1 in the 30mg group (treatment related). There were dose -dependent decreases in platelet counts observed in the stud y, with a return towards baseline after Week 4. Further details of the clinical development program can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). Abrocitinib has been in Phase 3 development since December 2017 treating participants wit h moderate to severe AD with or without topical treatment. The first Phase 3 studies , B7451012 and B7451013, that evaluated 100 and 200 mg QDabrocitinib in participants with moderate to severe AD, which completed in 2019, reported statisticall y significa nt improvement in efficacy endpoints in both treatment groups compared to the placebo group, with an acceptable safet y profile. B7451012 and B7451013 were replicate randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, Phase 3 studies which evalua ted the efficacy and safet y of abrocitinib monotherap y in 387 and 391 participants, respectively , aged 12 y ears and older, with moderate to severe AD. The treatment duration for both studies was 12 weeks. Eligible participants were randomized in a 2:2:1 ra tio to receive abrocitinib 200 mg or 100 mg QD or matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [IGA=3] and severe [I GA=4] AD) and age (age <18 and ≥18 y ears)."
34,page_34,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 35The co -primary efficacy endpoints were response based on the IGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 12 and response based on ≥75% improvement from baseline in EASI score (EASI -75) at Week 12. The key secondary efficacy endpoints were response based on ≥4 points improvement from baseline in the peak pruritus NRS (PP -NRS) for severit y at Weeks 2, 4, and 12 and change from baseline in PSAAD at Week 12. Both studies met both co -primary endpoints. Specifically , abrocitinib 200 mg QD was superior to placebo at Wee k 12 for both IGA and EASI- 75 responses. In B7451012, IGA response rate was 43.8% in the 200 mg QD arm and 7.9% for the placebo arm. The EASI -75 response rate was 62.7% in the 200 mg QD arm and 11.8% for the placebo arm. The treatment difference (95% conf idence interval [CI ]) for IGA was 36% (26.2, 45.7), p<0.0001 and that for EASI -75 was 51% (40.5, 61.5), p<0.0001. At Week 12, abrocitinib 100 mg QD was also superior to placebo for both IGA and EASI -75 responses. The IGA and EASI -75 response rates were 23. 7% and 39.7%, respectivel y, in the 100 mg QD arm. The treatment difference (95% CI) for IGA was 15.8% (6.8, 24.8), p=0.0037 and that for EASI-75 was 27.9% (17.4, 38.3), p<0.0001. In B7451013, the IGA response rate was 38.1% in the 200 mg QD arm and 9.1% f or the placebo arm. The EASI -75 response rate was 61.0% in the 200 mg QD arm and 10.4% for the placebo arm. The treatment difference (95% CI) for IGA was 28.7% (18.6, 38.8), p<0.0001 and that for EASI- 75 was 50.5% (40.0, 60.9), p<0.0001. At Week 12, abrocitinib 100 mg QD was also superior to placebo for both IGA and EASI -75 responses. The IGA and EASI -75 response rates were 28.4% and 44.5%, respectivel y, in the 100 mg QD arm. The treatment difference (95% CI) for IGA was 19.3% (9.6, 29.0), p=0.0008 an d that for EASI -75 was 33.9% (23.3, 44.4), p<0.0001. In addition, the treatment difference for abrocitinib 200 mg QD relative to abrocitinib 100 mg QD was 9.7% ( -0.7, 20.0) for IGA and 16.5% (5.6, 27.4) for EASI -75 at Week 12. Both studies met both the key secondary endpoints. Both abrocitinib doses showed statistically significant separation from placebo in response rates at all visits after baseline. In addition, response rates in the 200 mg QD arm were consistently higher than in the 100 mg QD arm. Chang e from baseline in the total PSAAD score at Week 12 was statistically significant for both abrocitinib doses relative to placebo. In addition, the change from baseline in the 200 mg QD arm was greater in magnitude than in the 100 mg QD arm. Safety results in both studies show that both doses of abrocitinib were well -tolerated, and there were no unexpected safet y events. The proportion of participants experiencing adverse events was higher in the abrocitinib group compared with the placebo group. The proport ion of participants experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs) and severe adverse events was"
35,page_35,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 36similar across all treatment arms. The discontinuation rates due to an adverse event were low in each treatment arm compared to placebo. This Phase 3b study will i nvestigate whether abrocitinib provides comparable or improved efficacy and safet y compared with duplilumab in the treatment of moderate to severe AD. 2.3.Benefit/Risk Assessment There was clinicall y meaningful benefit demonstrated with abrocitinib in th e Phase 2b POC study in adult participants with moderate to severe AD and the completed Phase 3 studies B7451012 and B7451013. The potential risks of treatment include those that were noted in Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies and those based on the pharmacology of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and include viral reactivation, serious and opportunistic infections, hematopoietic effects (including reduced platelet count), and malignancy and immunoproliferative disorders. The most common events were gastrointesti nal disorders, nervous system disorders, and skin/subcutaneous tissue disorders. I n Study B7451001, 2 participants discontinued from the study due to AEs. One participant in the abrocitinib 100 mg group discontinued due to an AE of second -degree atrioven tricular block, which was considered as non-treatment -related and was attributed to a pre -existing condition by the investigator. Appropriate risk evaluation and mitigation strategies have been incorporated into this protocol. It was recognized that histo ry of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important potential risk. Participants with a history or family history of VTE are excluded from this study . Overall, there is a favorable benefit- risk profile to support the continued development in Phase 3 of abrocitinib in the treatment of adult participants with AD for both the 100 mg and 200mg doses. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonabl y expected adverse events (AEs) of abrocitinib may be found in the IB19, which is the single reference safet y document (SRSD) for this study .

To help assess the specifi c, complex safet y events related to malignancies, cardiovascular events, hepatic and opportunistic infections (including other infections of special interest) in this study , Safet y Adjudication Committees, consisting of clinical experts in each of the relevant clinical areas, will be set up to harmonize and standardize assessments. I n order to allow for an unbiased safety assessment, the members of these committees will be blinded to treatment assignment. Further information about the Safet y Adjudication Committees can be found in their respective charters, including a specific description of the scope of their responsibilities, a plan where communication timelines are defined, and the exact process and definitions used by each committee to adjudicate the sa fety events that they will adjudicate. Other safety events for adjudication may be identified and included in the remit of the Safet y Adjudication Committees as appropriate. 4.STUDY DESIGN 4.1.Overall Design This is a randomized, double -blind, double -dummy , active -controlled, multi- center stud y to assess the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib 200 mg (2 x 100 mg tablets) administered orally QD compared with dupilumab 300 mg administered by subcutaneous injection every other week (as per label guideline s) in adult participants on background topical therap y, with moderate to severe AD. The treatment duration is 26 weeks. A total of approximately 600 participants will be enrolled from approximatel y 220 sites globall y. Approximately 600 participants will be randomly assigned to study intervention. There are primary efficacy assessments at Week 2 and Week 4, and a key secondary efficacy assessment at Week 16. Efficacy and safet y endpoints will be assessed throughout the entire study. Exploratory endpoints related to hand eczema efficacy will be assessed throughout the study . After providing informed consent, participants will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. Participants will undergo screening within 28 days prior to randomization. Use of screening procedures exceeding 28 day s prior to randomization should be discussed with the Pfizer medical monitor. During the screening period, sy stemic treatments for AD will be washed out, as applicable, according to eligibility requirements (refer to Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, respectively ). Eligible participants must have a documented history , within 6months of the screening visit, of inadequate response to treatment with medicated topical therap y for at leas t 4weeks or must have required sy stemic therapies for control of their disease within the previous y ear."
41,page_41,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 42Eligible participants must meet the eligibility criteria at baseline. In addition, participants must be willing and able to use standardized backgr ound topical therapy , as per protocol guidelines, throughout the duration of the stud y. Participants may be re -screened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions. Participants for whom screen failu re is related to failing the disease severity (including extent of disease) inclusion criterion and who subsequently experience worsening AD, which in the investigator’s judgement would make them eligible for participation, may be considered for re -screeni ng. Such cases should be discussed with the Pfizer Medical Monitor (or designee) to determine if re-screening is appropriate. Participants who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo Day 1 assessments and be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive abrocitinib 200 mg QD with dupilumab- matching placebo administered every other week or dupilumab 300 mg administered every other week (with a loading dose of 600 mg at baseline) with abrocitinib -matching placebo administered QD. Investigator s, participants, and the sponsor study team will be blinded as to treatment group. After Week 4, if medically necessary , participants with intolerable AD s ymptoms may receive locall y-approved rescue therap y, at the investigator’s discretion, pursuant to the following guidelines (refer to Section 6.5.2 ). The total treatment period is 26 weeks. Participants discontinuing earl y from treatment, or who are otherwise ineligible for the B7451015 LTE study , will undergo a 4 -week follow -up period. At Week 24 in the treatment period, all participants will cease injectable dupilumab or its matching placebo. Administration of abrocitinib 200 mg QD or its matching placebo will continue until Week 26. Efficacy and safet y endpoints will be assessed throughout the entire study . Participants who complete the study through the Week 26 visit and are deemed eligible may enter the LTE Study B7451015. See Section 10.12.3 for United Kingdom (UK) country -specific requirements. For stud y estimands, refer to Section 3.1. 4.2.Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study is part of the global Phase 3 clinical development program investigating the safety and efficacy of abrocitinib in participants with moderate to severe AD. Dupilumab is the most recent treatment available for the disease area and is expected to be a future standard of care. The comparison of dupilumab 300 mg to abrocitinib 200 mg in this study will provide efficacy and safet y data for use in treating participants. I n addition, medicated topical therap y is commonly used to treat moderate to severe AD. For this reason, including background medicated topicals will mimic real world medica l practice. Due to the chronic nature of AD, the stud y will allow assessment of any difference in efficacy that may persist at month 6 of treatment. This study is designed to specificall y evaluate abrocitinib and dupilumab when co -administered with backg round medicated topical therapy in adults with moderate to severe AD."
42,page_42,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 43Participants with moderate to severe AD who also have hand eczema will undergo additional hand eczema assessments. The pathophy siology of atopic and non- atopic forms of hand eczema involve cy tokines that can be affected through JAK1 inhibition, including ILγ, IL4, and IL13.45Therefore, this study includes exploratory endpoints related to hand eczema efficacy . Quantitatively evaluating nighttime scratch and sle ep via accelerometry using digital wearables and associated algorithms, to passivel y and continuously monitor participants in their “home environment, ”provides an opportunity to examine new and distinct endpoints. Moreover, this evaluation contributes to the understanding how scratch and sleep endpoints correlate to currently used measures of AD severity . The amount and duration of nighttime scratching and the duration and arousals from the total sleep opportunity (nighttime sleep) will be assessed using a ccelerometry , in selected countries. Banked Biospecimens will be collected for pharmacogenomic/genomic/biomarker anal yses and retained in the Biospecimen Banking System (BBS), which makes it possible to better understand the stud y intervention’s mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, tolerability , safet y, and/or efficacy not anticipated prior to the beginning of the study . 4.3.Justification for Dose The original dose selection for Phase 3 was based on effic acy and safet y of abrocitinib from a dose-ranging Phase 2b study , B7451006 that evaluated a 20- fold dose range (10 mg to 200mgQD) in adults with AD. The 200 mgQD dose as a monotherapy is expected to provide efficacy similar to that of currently approve d systemic treatments (eg cy closporine, systemic corticosteroids and dupilumab) in moderate to severe AD, based on dose -response modeling of IGA response in the Phase 2 study , and was therefore selected as the high dose for evaluation in Phase 3 studies. The 200 mgdose demonstrated acceptable safet y and tolerability in the Phase 2 study and in the completed Phase 3 studies (B7451012 and B7451013). Further details are available in the IB. The dosing regimen of dupilumab used in the study will be based on the approved USPI .20 4.4.End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including the last visit or the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities.

Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco Participants will abstain from using tobacco products or ingesting caffeine -or xanthine - containing products (eg, coffee, tea, cola drinks, and chocolate) for at least 30 minutes before pulse rate and blood pressure measurements. 5.3.3. Vaccine and Exposure to Infections Guidelines 5.3.3.1. Participant Specific Recommendations It is recommended that all participants sho uld be up -to-date with respect to standard-of- care vaccinations (as defined by their country health ministry or AD guidelines). Vaccination of participants with live components is prohibited within the 6 weeks prior to first dose of study intervention. 5.3.3.2. Guidance Regarding Household Contact Vaccine -Related Exposure Current routine household contact with children and others who have been vaccinated with live vaccine components may pose a risk during treatment and for 6 weeks following completion of the study .Some of these vaccines include varicella (“chickenpox”) vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and the inhaled flu vaccine. Following vaccination with live component vaccines, the virus may be shed in bodily fluids, including stool, and there is a potential risk that the virus may be transmitted. General guidelines for immunosuppressed participants suggest that exposure (through routine contact) should be avoided following vaccination (of others) with these vaccines for the stated time period: a. Varicella or atten uated ty phoid fever vaccination for 4 weeks following vaccination. b. Oral polio vaccination for 6 weeks following vaccination. c. Attenuated rotavirus vaccine for 10 day s following vaccination. d. FluMist®(inhaled flu vaccine) for 1 week following va ccination. e. Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine for 4 weeks following vaccination. f. Yellow fever vaccine for 4 weeks following vaccination. Participants should avoid exposure to vaccinated or infected persons and contact the investigator promptl y shou ld they develop signs or sy mptoms of infections. 5.3.4. Surgery During the study , no elective surgery should occur without first consulting with the Pfizer clinician or designee. Preferabl y, elective surgery should occur before the study or be delay ed until study participation is completed. The Pfizer clinician or designee should be notified if a participant requires surgery (including dental surgery ) during the study to determine whether the participant should discontinue from"
53,page_53,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 54the study and/or discontinue study intervention prior to the surgical procedure. In general, planned surgical procedures should not be performed unless the study intervention has been discontinued for at least 28 day s (unless otherwise advised by the Pfizer clinician or designee). The Pfizer clinician or designee should be notified as soon as possible if a participant undergoes a surgical procedure without first informing the study staff. 5.4.Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinica l study but are not subsequently randomly assigned to study intervention/entered in the study . A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demograph y, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE). Individuals who do not meet the criterion for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions. I ndividuals for whom screen failure is related to failing the disease sever ity (including extent of disease) inclusion criteria and who subsequently experience worsening AD, which in the investigator’s judgement would make them eligible for participation, may be considered for re -screening. Such cases should be discussed with the Pfizer Medical Monitor (or designee) to determine if re- screening is appropriate."

The study interventions will be dispensed using an IRT drug management sy stem at the Day 1 (2 sy ringes dispensed and administered), Week 2 (1 sy ringe dispensed and administered ), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16 visits (2 sy ringes dispensed per visit; 1 sy ringe administered every 2 weeks). Participants will be dispensed 3 prefilled sy ringes at the Week 20 visit (1 sy ringe administered every 2 weeks). A qualified staff member will dispense the study interventions via unique container numbers in the cartons provided, and in quantities appropriate so that participants will receive enough PFSs to cover the number of doses until the next sch eduled clinic visit. The participant/caregiver should be instructed to maintain the product in the cartons provided, and the cartons should not be opened until the study intervention is to be administered. Refer to the IP manual for instructions on how to prepare the stud y interventions for administration. Study intervention should be prepared and dispensed by an appropriatel y qualified and experienced member of the stud y staff (eg, ph ysician, nurse, phy sician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacy assistant/technician, or pharmacist) as allowed by local, state, and institutional guidance. The dupilumab and matching placebo will be administered by qualified site personnel or by the participant/caregiver according to the IP manual. The study interventions will be administered to blinded participants. 6.3.Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 6.3.1. Allocation to Study Intervention Allocation of participants to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an IRT s ystem (interactive Web -based response [I WR]). The block randomization method will be used, and participants will be stratified by baseline disease severit y (IGA = 3 vs. IGA = 4). The site personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or sel ect information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the participant number. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU ) or container number when study intervention is being supplied via the IRT sy stem. The IRT s ystem will provide a confirmation report containing the participant number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report mu st be stored in the site’s files. Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the SoA. Returned study intervention must not be re -dispensed to the participants. The study -specific I RT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT s ystem. 6.3.2. Breaking the Blind Investigators, participants and the sponsor study team will be blinded as to treatment group. At each site, an injecti on administrator/trainer will administer the first dose of dupilumab or"
59,page_59,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 60its matching placebo to train the participant (or caregiver, if applicable) in proper injection technique. At all times, treatment and randomization information will be kept confident ial and will not be released to the investigator, the study staff, or the sponsor’s study team until following the conclusion of the study, with the exception described in this section. At the initiation of the study , the study site will be instructed on p rocedures for breaking the blind. Blinding codes should only be broken in emergency situations for reasons of participant safety . The investigator is responsible for, and may break the blind for safet y reasons, where the knowledge of actual treatment is essential for the further management of the participant. The method will be an electronic process. When the blind for a participant has been broken, the reason must be fully documented and entered on the case report form (CRF). Whenever possible, the in vestigator should contact Pfizer before breaking the blind. If the blind is broken, the investigator should promptly inform the Pfizer Clinician or Medical Monitor. The participant for whom the blind has been broken will be discontinued from the study and undergo the earl y discontinuation (ED) procedures. 6.4. Study Intervention Compliance Participant compliance with study intervention will be assessed at each visit. Compliance will be assessed b y direct questioning and counting of s yringes/tablets as applicable. Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) . Participants will be issued an electronic dosing diary (eDiary ) and will be educated to record the date and time of their dosing and date and time of their last meal before taking the study intervention. Participants will also use the eDiary to record the ir daily use of standardized background topical therapy for the treatment of AD, as required and as per protocol guidelines in Section 6.5.1 , beginning at Day 1 visit through the EOT visit. Compliance with the dosing of stud y intervention will be monitored and verified b y delegated site personnel through a combination of observe d study intervention administration at study visits, the accounting of unused stud y intervention returned b y the participant at the study visits, review of the dosing diary , and discussion with the participant, which will be documented in the source docume nts. Study intervention may be temporaril y withheld for a maximum of 28 days at investigator's discretion due to abnormal laboratory tests or adverse event. Refer to Section 7.1.1 for further guidance on temporary withholding of study intervention. Doses not taken for the reasons mentioned above do not constitute protocol deviations or medication errors and should not be considered dosing errors but should be noted in the dosing log with the reason for reduced drug consumption. Compliance with background topical therap y guidelines in Section 6.5.1 will be monitored and verified b y delegated site personnel through a combination of review of the electronic diary , and discussion with the participant, which will be documented in the source documents."
60,page_60,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 61Other than for the above reasons, the following compliance cases will be considered medication errors and will be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study : Participants interrupting oral study intervention for more than 4 consecutive day s or for a total of more than 7days between visits; Participants interrupting injectable stud y intervention for ≥ 2 doses between visits (≥ 4 week visit intervals); Participants administering >8 tablets in 1 day or administering 4tablets/day for 4consecutive day s; Participants adm inistering >1 prefilled s yringe every 2 weeks, with the exception of the initial loading dose of 2 prefilled s yringes on Day 1; Participants who have an overall compliance of <80% or >120% between visits for oral study intervention; Non-compliance with ba ckground topical therap y will not be considered medication error. Any deviation from protocol specified dosing should be recorded as a protocol deviation and the investigator or designee is to counsel the participant and ensure steps are taken to improve c ompliance. In addition, if the compliance deviation reaches the thresholds defined above it should also be recorded as a medication error (See also Section 8.3.10 ). 6.4.1. Abrocitinib Compliance Study intervention should be administered in the morning. Participants should be instructed that if an oral dose is inadvertently missed then it should be taken as soon as remembered, but not within 12 hours of the next scheduled dose. From the Day 1 visit onward, participants will be dispensed abrocitinib or abrocitinib -matching placebo to take home with them for self- administration on non- study visit day s. 6.4.2. Dupilumab Compliance There are viscosit y differences between dupilumab and the matched placebo, and as such there is a potential for the administrator/trainer who may have previous experience administering dupilumab to notice this difference in viscosity . Although no injection administrator/trainer will know the treatment alloc ation of participants, as a risk mitigation against accidental unblinding affecting stud y integrit y this injection administrator/trainer will only administer injectable study intervention, or observe/train participants administering injectable study interv ention, and will account/re concile an y unused s yringes returned by participants, will be isolated fro m all other study activities, and will be treated as if unblind. Throughout the protocol, these individuals will be referred to as ""injection administrato r/trainer"" in order to make this clear distinction from other site personnel."
61,page_61,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 62When injectable study intervention is administered at the research facility , it will be administered under the supervision of the injection administrator/trainer only . If the pa rticipant is unwilling/unable to self -administer the injectable stud y intervention or arrange for a caregiver to administer the injectable study intervention, then it is permissible for the site to arrange for the participant to return to the site for admi nistration by the injection administrator/trainer. Participants will be directed to bring an y used and unused sy ringe cartons to visits following administration at home. Study sites will provide participants with a sharps container for disposal of used syringes. Participants will return this sharps container to the study site at the final visit for disposal. If an injectable dose is missed, participants (or caregivers, if applicable) should be instructed to administer the injection within 7 days from th e missed dose and then resume the participant’s original schedule. If the missed dose is not administered within 7 days, participants (or caregivers, if applicable) should be instructed to wait until the next dose on the original schedule. 6.5.Concomitant T herapy Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded along with: Dates of ad ministration including start and end dates Dosage information including dose and frequency The Pfizer clinician should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therap y. Hormonal contraceptives that meet the requirements of this study are allowed to be used in participants who are WOCBP (refer to Appendix 4 ). Participants must abstain from taking prescription or nonprescription drugs (including vitamins and dietary or herbal supplements) within 7 day s (or 14 day s if the drug is a potential enzy me inducer) or 5 half -lives (whichever is longer) before the start of study intervention until completion of the follow- up visit (refer to Appendix 10 for washout periods for CYP2C9 inhibitors and inducers), unless, in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor, the medication will not interfere with the study . Participants will abstain from all prohibited concomitant medications as described in Section 6.5.3 and Appendix 10 of the protocol. Medications that are taken in the Screening/Washout period (after informed consent is obtained and before the fir st dose of study intervention) will be documented as prior medications. Medications taken after the first dose of study intervention has been administered will be documented as concomitant medications. All concomitant medications taken during the study must be recorded in stud y records with indication (if AD), reference to an y associated adverse event, dose, and start and"

Participants will be queried about concomitant medication (including topical medications and treatments, ov er-the-counter and prescription medications and treatments, and vaccinations) at each study visit. Any new concomitant medications or dose changes to current concomitant medications should be evaluated for potential new or worsening adverse events. Unless prohibited by the protocol, participants may be administered any other medications necessary for the treatment of medical disorders as deemed necessary by the treating physician. Following Day 1, the addition of concomitant medications or any change in the dosage should be limited to those considered medically essential. Participants should refrain from starting new or changing doses of permitted prescription or non-prescription drugs, vitamins, and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichev er is longer) prior to Day 1. The concomitant medication for an y reason must be a locall y-approved medication and dose. Participants are not allowed an y other investigational drugs or treatments during the stud y. Participants should report any changes to m edications during the stud y to the investigator as soon as they occur. Medication changes must be documented in the participant’s record and eCRF. 6.5.1. Permitted Concomitant Treatments Background Topical Therapy Participants must comply with standardized backgr ound topical therap y guidance throughout the study . Medicated and non- medicated background topical therap y will not be provided directly by the sponsor. Standardized background topical therap y begins on Day 1 but topical therapies can be taken during the s creening period since washout of topical therapies for AD is not required. Standardiz ed background topical therap y refers to the guidance below, in accordance with the local standard of care and according to the Investigator’s usual practice: Non-medicated Topical Therapy Non-medicated topical emollient without other active ingredients indicated to treat AD, or other additives which could affect AD (eg, hy aluronic acid, urea, ceramide or filaggrin degradation products) must be applied at least twice dail y to all body areas affected with AD starting on Day 1 and throughout the remainder of the study . Medicated Topical Therapy TCS must be applied once daily to areas with active lesions, starting on Day 1 (Baseline) and throughout the study , according to the guidance below: Medium potency TCS (eg, Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream or fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% ointment) must be applied to body areas with active lesions that"
63,page_63,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 64are suitable for the use of medium potency TCS. Participants must be cli nically monitored for toxicity to TCS and stepped down as needed. After lesions are under control (clear or almost clear), treat once dail y for a further 7 day s, then stop; If lesions return then resume treatment with medium potency TCS, but use the approa ch described above upon lesion resolution. If the participant experiences toxicity attributable to the background TCS, the following step -down is allowed: Change from medium -potency TCS to low -potency TCS once daily (if the participant has been receiving medium -potency TCS); OR Change from a TCS to a topical calcineurin inhibitor or a phosphodiesterase t ype 4 inhibitor; OR Discontinue background medicated topical treatment, if there is documented evidence that the participant did not tolerate an y of the background medicated topical treatments allowed in the protocol. Low potency TCS (ie, hydrocortisone 1% cream) must be applied to body areas of thin skin (face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atrophy , etc.) with active lesions inste ad of medium potency TCS or to body areas where continued treatment with medium potency TCS is considered unsafe. Participants must be clinically monitored for toxicity to TCS and stepped down as needed. After lesions are under control (clear or almost cle ar), treat once dail y for a further 7 day s, then stop; If lesions return then resume treatment with low potency TCS, but use the approach described above upon lesion resolution. TCI (eg, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) or a PDE4 inhibitor (eg, crisaborole) may be used instead of corticosteroids in body areas of thin skin (face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atrophy, etc.) with active lesions or if continued trea tment with TCS of any potency is considered unsafe, and according to locally approved label at the investigator’s discretion and considering prior response or intolerance to these medications. NOTE: Background topical therap y must not be applied prior to attending a study visit, on the day of the stud y visit. Background topical therapy should instead be applied after the visit, on study visit day s."

Participants should be instructed at each visit to contact the study site investigator promptl y if there are an y intended changes or additions to concomitant medications. All medications and tre atments that could affect AD must be discontinued except oral antihistamines and low- or medium -potency medicated topical therapy . Starting on Day 1, standardized background topical therap y will be used as per protocol guidance in Section 6.5.1 . After Week 4, rescue therap y for AD with high -potency TCS or sy stemic corticosteroids may be used as per protocol guidance in Section 6.5.2. Due to the potential to affect AD with ultraviolet light exposure, participants must also avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and not to use tanning booths, sun lamps or other ultraviolet light sources during the study . Participants who received prior treatme nt with s ystemic JAK inhibitors are to be excluded from the study . Prior treatment with topical JAK inhibitors is not exclusionary . Herbal medications with unknown properties or known beneficial effects for AD must be discontinued at least 4 weeks before the first dose of study intervention. Restrictions on certain vaccinations are described in Section 5.3.3 . The Pfizer study team is t o be notified of an y prohibited medications taken during the stud y. After consulting with the Pfizer clinician, the investigator will make a judgement on the ongoing eligibility of an y participant with prohibited medication use during the study. 6.6.Dose Modif ication No dose modifications of either study intervention are allowed. 6.7.Intervention after the End of the Study No intervention will be provided to study participants at the end of the study ."

Per the study estimands, if stud y intervention is permanentl y discontinued, the participant will remain in the study to be evaluated for EOT assessments (as per the Schedule of Activities) (See Section 6.5.2) . If a participant has a clinically significant, treatment -emergent, abnormality at the time of withdrawal from the stu dy, the Pfizer Medical Monitor (or designee) should be notified and every effort should be made to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the abnormalit y. All abnormal laboratory events of clinical significance sh ould be followed until the laboratory values have returned to normal or baseline levels or are deemed clinically stable. Follow -up for abnormal laboratory findings and adverse events by the investigator is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. Note that discontinuation of study treatment does not represent withdrawal from the study . Refer to Appendix 11 for discontinuation criteria. Refer to the Schedule of Activities for data to be collected at the time of intervention discontinuation and follow- up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. Discontinuation of study intervention for abnormal liver function should be considered b y the investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in Appendix 6 or if the investigator believes that it is in best interest of the participant. If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline in Fridericia -corrected Q wave interval [QTcF] ) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study and if any change in participant management is needed. This review of the ECG printed at the time of collection must be documented. An y new clinically relevant finding should be reported as an AE. Refe r to Appendix 8 for ECG values of potential clinical concern. See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of intervention discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 7.1.1. Temporary Discontinuation An investigator can temporaril y interrupt oral study intervention for up to a maximum of 28 consecutive days and up to 2 consecutive doses of injectable study intervention for a participant, for safet y reasons or while monitoring abnormal laboratory tests if the investigator judges that this is necessary . In the case of study intervention(s) being withheld, all study intervention(s) that the participant is receiving should be with held (ie, both oral and injected study intervention, as applicable). The investigator should use their judgement with regard to unscheduled visits/laboratory /clinical assessments required to monitor the participant during this timeframe. If within this tim eframe the investigator judges that it is"
67,page_67,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 68safe to restart dosing, then the participant may restart the study intervention. If the investigator judges that it is not safe to restart dosing within this timeframe then the participant must be permanently discontinued from study intervention, have an End of Treatment visit, and enter the 4 -week follow -up period (See Secti on 10.12.3 for UK country - specific requirements). Dose s not taken for the reasons mentioned above do not constitute protocol deviations or medication errors and should not be considered dosing errors but should be noted in the dosing log with the reason for reduced drug consumption clearl y described. 7.2.Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the st udy at an y time at his/her own request or may be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator for safet y, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. See also Section 10.11. At the time of discontinui ng from the stud y, if possible, an earl y discontinuation visit should be conducted, as shown in the SoA. See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time. The early discontinuation visit applies only to participants who are randomized and then are prematur ely withdrawn from the study . Participants should be questioned regarding their reason for withdrawal. The participant will be permanentl y discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time. If the participant withdraws consent (see below) for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant w ithdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any remaining samples but data alread y generated from the samples will continue to be available, and may be used to, to protect the integrity of existing analy ses. The investigator must document an y such requests in the site study records. When a participant withdraws from the stud y because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported on the clinical trial (CT) SAE Report. Lack of completion of all or an y of the withdrawal/ earl y termination procedures will not be viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant’s safet y was preserved. 7.2.1. Withdrawal of Consent Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study interventions will remain in the study and must continue to b e followed for protocol -specified follow -up procedures. The onl y"

Participants should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow- up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment study follow -up and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being mea sured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law. 7.3.Lost to Follow up A participant will be considered lost to follow- up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed vi sit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact a ttempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as pa rt of Appendix 1. All attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical records. If it is determined that the participant has died, the site will use locally permissible methods to obtain the date and c ause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third- party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study has been included in the participant’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor -retained third -party representative t o assist site staff with obtaining the participant’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up portion of the study . The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. I f, after all attempts, the participant remains lost to follow -up, then the last -known- alive date as determined by the investigator should be reported and documented in the p articipant’s medical records. Participants may withdraw from the study at an y time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral"

Participants that discontinue study intervention will remain in the study and must have their end of treatment visit within 1 week after their last dos e and will then enter the 4 -week follow -up period. Refer to Appendix 11 for guidelines for monitoring and discontinuation. If the participant withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 8.STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perf orm the test. I n these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary to ensure the safet y and wellbeing of the participant. Guidance on the conduct of study procedures in the context of COVID -19 or other virus/infection or public health related tra vel restrictions or emergency is described Appendix 10.13. When a protocol required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for the missed test and an y corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that re quired processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or exemptio ns are not allowed. Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Participants will be screened (Visit 1) within approximately 28 day s prior to administration of the study intervention to confirm that they meet the participant selection criteria for the study . Use of screening procedures exceeding 28 day s prior to randomization should be discussed with the Pfizer medical monitor. The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) will obtain informed consent from each participant, in accordance with the procedures described in Section 10.1.3 of Appendix 1 ."

To assure consistency and reduce variability , all study visits should occur in the morning whenever possible. On day s of study visits, participants will receive their dose at the clinic during the visit. Participants are required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to all visits that include lipid profile panel testing. During the fasting period, participants should refrain from all food and liquids (water and permitted non- study medications are allowed). ECGs will be interpreted by a central reader for all visits where it is performed. Urine pregnanc y test must be performed prior to dosing with the study intervention for WOCBP through the EOT visit. Prior to attending a stud y visit, participants are allowed to shower and bathe but should not moisturize or apply emollient. Participants will be instructed about the use of standardized background topical therap y (refer to Section 6.5.1 ). Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be uti lized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. 8.1.Efficacy Assessments 8.1.1. Rater Qualifications Clinical evaluations of AD and hand eczema will be performed b y an experienced and qualified dermatologist (board certified or equivalent). An experienced and qualified non - dermatologist ph ysician or experienced medical professional with experience in the conduct of dermatology clinical trials may be permitted to perform the clinical evaluations of AD and hand eczema when designated b y the primary site Investigator. The clinical evaluator must receive and document protocol specific and applicable efficacy assessment scales training prior to performing these evaluations. To assure consistency and reduce variability, the same evaluator must assess all dermatological clinical evaluations for any individual participant throughout the study whenever possible; a back-up experienced and qualified, protocol -trained evaluator will only be allowed and documented in case of emergency or special situations when the designated evaluator is unable to perform the evaluation."

Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) The EASI quantifies the severit y of a participant’s atopic dermatitis based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and the percent of BSA affected. EASI is a composite scoring b y the atopic dermatitis clinical evaluator of the degree of ery thema, induration/papul ation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored separately ) for each of four body regions, with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body . Lesion Severity by Clinical Si gns: The basic characteristics of atopic dermatitis lesions -erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification- provide a means for assessing the severit y of lesions. Assessment of these four main clinical signs is performed separately for f our body regions: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Average ery thema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification are scored for each body region according to a 4- point scale: 0 =absent; 1 =mild; 2 =moderate; 3 =severe. Morphologic descriptors for each clinical sign severity score are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Clinical Sign Severity Scoring Criteria for the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score Description Erythema (E) 0 Absent None; may have residual discoloration (post -inflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or hy popigmentation) 1 Mild Light pink to light red 2 Moderate Red 3 Severe Deep, dark red Induration/Papulation (I) 0 Absent None 1 Mild Barel y palpable to slight, but definite hard thickened skin and/or papules 2 Moderate Easily palpable moderate hard thickened skin and/or papules 3 Severe Severe hard thickened skin and/or papules Excoriation (Ex) 0 Absent None 1 Mild Slight, but definite linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury 2 Moderate Moderate linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury 3 Severe Severe linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury Lichenification (L) 0 Absent None 1 Mild Barel y perceptible to slight, but definite thickened skin, fine skin markings, and lichenoid scale"

Body Surface Area –Efficacy (BSA Efficacy) BSA Efficacy will be derived from the sum of the BSA in handprints across 4 body regions assessed as part of the EASI assessment ( Table 3). Handprint refers to that of each individual participant for their own measurement. The BSA Efficacy ranges from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of atopic dermatitis. 8.1.3. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD ) SCORAD is a validated scoring index for atopic dermatitis, which combines extent (0- 100), severit y (0-18), and subjective sy mptoms (0 -20) based on pruritus and sleep loss, each scored using a visual analog scale (0 -10)."

Body surface area as percentage of total body surface area for each body region is as follows: Head and neck 9%; Upper limbs 9% each; Lower limbs 18% each; Anterior trunk 18%; Back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each bod y region is added up to determine the BSA affected by AD (A), which has a possible maximum score of 100%. Severity (B, maximum score of 18) A representative area of AD is selected. In this area, the severit y of each of the following signs is assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). Erythema (reddening); Edema (swelling)/papulation; Oozing/crusting; Excoriation (scratch marks); Skin thickening (lichenification); Xerosis (dry ness) (this is assessed in an area where there is no inflammation). The severit y scores are added together to give 'B' (maximum score of 18). Subjective Symptoms (C, maximum score of 20) Subjective sy mptoms, ie, itch and sleep loss, are each scored by the participant or caregiver using a visual analog scale (VAS) where “0” is no itch (or no sleep loss) and “10” is the worst imaginable itch (or sleep loss). The value for each should reflect the average on a 10 - point scale for the last 3 days/nights. These scores are added to give 'C' (maximum score of20)."

Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of Atopic Dermatitis The Investigator’s Global Assessment of atopic dermatitis is scored on a 5 -point scale (0 -4), reflecting a global consideration of the ery thema, induration and scaling. The clinical evaluator of atopic de rmatitis will perform an assessment of the overall severity of atopic dermatitis and assign an IGA score and category as described in Table 5. The assessment will be a static evaluation without regard to the score at a previous visit. Table 5.Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of Atopic Dermatitis Score Score Category Description 0 Clear Atopic dermatitis is cleared, except for any residual discoloration (post -inflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation). 1 Almost Clear Overall, the atopic dermatitis is not entirely cleared and remaining lesions are light pink (not including post inflammatory hyperpigmentation) and/or; have barely palpable hard thickened skin and/or papules and/or; have barely perceptible lichenific ation; excoriation and oozing/crusting are absent. 2 Mild Overall, the atopic dermatitis consists of lesions that are light red; with slight, but definite hard thickened skin and/or papules; with slight, but definite linear or picked scratch marks or pene trating surface injury; with slight, but definite thickened skin, fine skin markings, and lichenoid scale; oozing/crusting is absent. 3 Moderate Overall, the atopic dermatitis consists of lesions that are red; with easily palpable moderate hard thickened skin and/or papules; with moderate linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury; with moderate thickened skin, coarse skin markings, and coarse lichenoid scale; with slight oozing/crusting. 4 Severe Overall, the atopic dermatitis consists of lesions that are deep, dark red; with severe hard thickened skin and/or papules; with severe linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury; with severe thickened skin with very coarse skin markings and lichenoid scale; with moderate to se vere oozing/crusting. 8.1.5. Standardized Background Topical Therapy Participants will be instructed to keep a dail y record of use of standardized background topical therap y. At each visit, the participant’s understanding of background topical therap y requirements (refer to Section 6.5.1) and adherence to the use of background topical therap y will be checked. Participants will be re-educated as required. Standardized background"

Patient -Reported Outcomes (PROs) Participants will complete the PROs at the clinic prior to other clinical activities and study intervention administration. The PROs should be checked for completeness by the study site staff before proceeding with other steps of the clinical visit procedures. Compliance with scheduled PROs activities will be monitored. Delegated site staff will oversee the administration of PROs at site visits to ensure protocol compliance. Participants are given a handheld device to complete the PP -NRS on a daily basis. Delegated site staff will review compliance at each visit and counsel as appropriate. If a participant has repeated non - compliance, the participant should be re- trained on the device. If a participant is unable to complete the PROs on the handheld d evice due to documented difficult y using the technological devices or other limitation, the participant will be permitted to enter or remain in the study (for example, if the participant doesn’t have internet access, he or she can complete the PROs offline and then they can upload the PROs to the internet when they return to the site and have internet access). In the event of electronic malfunction, a replacement device will be shipped to the site. In instances where an electronic device is used to collect the PRO data, the electronic version may differ slightly in format or wording compared with the paper version to facilitate electronic implementation. All PROs should be completed as per the Schedule of Activitie s. 8.1.6.1. Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP -NRS) The severit y of itch (pruritus) due to AD will be assessed using the PP- NRS, a validated horizontal NRS.22,23Participants will be asked to assess their worst it ching due to AD over the past 24 hours on an NRS anchored b y the terms “no itch” (0) and “worst itch imaginable” (10). This item will be administered to all participants. Participants will enter the PP -NRS assessment into an eDiary on a daily basis from t he Screening visit through the Week 30 visit. 8.1.6.2. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) The DLQI is a validated general dermatology questionnaire that consists of 10 items to assess participant -reported health -related quality of life (daily activities, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, leisure, work and school, and treatment).24It has been extensively used in clinical trials for AD. The DLQI is a ps ychometrically valid and reliable instrument that has been translated into several languages, and the DLQI total scores have been shown to"

EuroQuol Quality of Life 5 -Dim ension 5- Level Scale (EQ -5D- 5L) The EQ -5D is a validated, standardized, generic instrument that is the most widely used preference -based health -related quality of life questionnaire in cost -effectiveness and health technologies assessment (HTA).26-29 Recently , a version was developed called EQ -5D- 5L with 5 response levels on each dimension compared to the 3 response levels in the Euroquol Quality of Life 5- Dimension 3 -Level Scale (EQ -5D-3L).26-32 Measurement properties of the EQ -5D- 5L demonstrated to be a valid version of the 3- level questionnaire that improved measurements by adding discriminatory power, reducing the ceiling, and establishing convergent and known -groups validity .26,28,30,31 Both the EuroQol EQ-5D- 3L and EQ -5D- 5L versions are well -established instruments used to measure health states and utilities in various diseases areas and assess mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety /depression and health status using a VAS.29,33The EQ-5D- 3L was used previousl y in AD studies, including the dupilumab trials, to measure utilities.17,34-36 8.1.6.4. Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) Questionnaire The HCRU is a 14-item questionnaire. This instrument is appropriate for use in participants aged 18 years and older.37 8.1.6.5. Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) The POEM is a validated 7-item PRO measure used to assess the impact of AD recalled over the past week.38-39 8.1.6.6.

Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale The Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS -Sleep) is a validated 12 -item measure used to assess sleep quality in the pastweek. The instrument has been validated for use by participants 18 years and older.41 8.1.6.8. Skin Pain Numerical Rating Scale ( SP-NRS ) The SP -NRS queries “worst skin pain” in the past 24 hours on an 11 -point scale (0 [no skin pain] –10 [worst skin pain imaginable]).42 8.1.6.9. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Asthma control for all participants with a history of asthma, regardless of whether the y are receiving medication for their asthma, should be assessed at times specified in the Sched ule of Activities (SoA) using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). The ACQ measures the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontaneousl y"
78,page_78,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 79or as a result of treatment. The ACQ has 6 questions and participants are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and to respond to the sy mptom questions on a 7-point scale (0 = no impairment, 6 = maximum impairment). The questions are equall y weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of the 6 questions and, therefore, between 0 (totall y controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled).54, 55, 56 8.1.7. Exploratory Accelerometry AD is often accompanied by nighttime pruritus as well as disrupted and reduced overall sleep. Pruritus can lead to scratching, which can result in a worsening of the lesions and a further perpetuation of the disease. All of these contribute to altered qual ity of life for the participant . Quantitatively evaluating nighttime scratch and sleep via accelerometry using digital wearables and associated algorithms, to passively and continuously monitor participants in their “home environment, ” provides an opportun ity to examine new and distinct endpoints. Moreover, this evaluation contributes to the understanding how scratch and sleep endpoints correlate to currently used measures of AD severity . Academic collaborative studies have shown nighttime scratch (number o f scratch events and scratch duration) in AD participant s correlated to the Investigator’s Static Global Assessment. In addition, accelerometry data processed b y Pfizer algorithms to measure nighttime scratch and sleep quantity were able to distinguish be tween scratch and non -scratch movements, validated b y thermal videograph y/annotation, and were able to detect sleep quantity , correlated to poly somnography measures (Clinicaltrials.gov stud y NCT03490877).53The amount and duration of nighttime scratching and the duration and arousals from the total sleep opportunity (nighttime sleep) will be assessed using accelerometry , in selected countries. Partici pants will wear wrist -worn, watch- like, accelerometry devices to continuously monitor the frequency of day and night time scratching and sleep disturbance for 1 week prior to the Day 1 visit, for 2 weeks following the Day 1 visit, and for 1 -week periods during the weeks after the Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, and Week 26 visits. Participation in accelerometry assessments is voluntary . Participants may refuse or remove the devices at an y time, either entirel y or for activities during which the devices are uncomfortable (ie, showering), without any impact on their study participation.

History, Subtype, Clinical Signs, and Extent Participants will undergo evaluation at the screening visit of the presence and chronicity of hand eczema.46Not all participants are expected to have hand eczema. For participants with bilateral hand eczema, the Investigator will identify the worse hand, which will be the target hand for evaluation throughout the stud y. Participants with hand eczema will also undergo assessments of the subt ype(s) (at sites that have capacit y for this), cli nical signs, and extent of hand eczema.46, 47 , 48, 49, 50They will also be examined to determine if they have eczema of the feet.47 8.1.8.2. Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of Hand Eczema The Investigator’s Global Assessment of hand eczema is scored on a 5 -point scale (0- 4), reflecting a global consideration of ery thema, scaling, and fissuring/cracking of the target hand, selected at the screening visit.51The clinical evaluator of hand eczema will perform an assessment of the overall severit y of hand eczema of the target hand and assign an IGA score and category as described in Table 6. The assessment will be a static evaluation without regard to the score at a previous visit. Table 6. Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of Hand Eczema Score Score Category Descriptiona 0 Clear No signs of hand eczema. 1 Almost Clear Just perceptible scaling and/or ery thema. 2 Mild Mild scaling, and/or mild erythema and/or mild cracking. 3 Moderate Moderate scaling, and/or moderate ery thema and/or moderate cracking/ fissuring. 4 Severe Severe scaling, and/or severe ery thema and/or severe cracking/fissuring. a. If the participant has bilateral hand eczema, the worse hand is assessed."

Medical History and Physical Examinations Complete AD disease history includes collection of details of AD at Screening: AD diagnosis, the use of topical treatments, s ystemic treatments and other treatments for AD. Medical history in addition to AD histor y including disease duration will be collected at screening. Medical history also includes history of alcohol, and tobacco use. Smoking status and average weekl y alcohol consumption (units/week) will be collected, where a unit contains 12 g of pure alcohol , an amount equivalent to that contained in 5 oz/150 mL (a glass) of wine, 12 oz/360 mL of beer, or 1.5 oz/45 mL of 90 proof of spirits. Additionally , a record of prior vaccinations will be obtained to determine if the participant has received tetanus, dip htheria and/or pertussis vaccines within the past 5 y ears. Complete medication history of all prescription or nonprescription drugs, and dietary and herbal supplements taken within 28 day s prior to the planned first dose, except as noted below: The followi ng timeframe prior to the planned first dose must be used for collection of the following Current/Prior Medications: 1 year: Previous non- systemic drug treatments for AD including topical treatments; Lifetime history of previous sy stemic treatment for AD a nd reason for stopping any systemic treatment for AD; Lifetime history of intolerance/allergy to an y drug, regardless of indication. Complete phy sical examinations must be performed by the investigator, sub-investigator or a qualified health professional per local guidelines. Complete physical examinations consist of assessments of general appearance; skin; head, ey es, ears, nose and throat (HEENT); mouth; heart; lungs; breast (optional); abdomen; external genitalia (optional); extremities; neurologic func tion; and ly mph nodes. In addition, height (screening visit only) and weight (screening, Week 0, Week 12, and Week 20 visits) will also be recorded. Targeted ph ysical examinations must be performed by the investigator, sub-investigator or a qualified heal th professional per local guidelines and should include skin, heart, lungs, and abdomen and examination of body systems where there are symptom complaints by the participant. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses."

Vital Signs Temperature (oral or t ympanic) , pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure will be assessed (pre -dose, if applicable). Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with the participant in a seated position, after at least 5 minutes of rest in a quiet setting without dis tractions, using a standard calibrated blood pressure measuring device. A blood pressure device that uses multiple cuff sizes based on the arm circumference is the required type of device. The appropriate cuff size for the participant must be used to ens ure accurate measurement. The arm circumference at the midpoint of the length of the upper arm should be measured to determine the appropriate cuff size in accordance with the specifications of the BP measuring device. The same properl y sized and calibra ted blood pressure cuff will be used to measure blood pressure each time. Participants should be seated in a chair, back supported, and arms bared (free of restrictions such as rolled up sleeves, etc.) and supported at heart level. Measurements should be taken on the same arm at each visit (preferabl y non - dominant). Participants should refrain from smoking or ingesting caffeine during the 30 minutes preceding the measurements. Vital signs will be measured in a seated position after 5 minutes rest and wil l include temperature, s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse. Heart rate should be measured at approximately the same time as BP for a minimum of 30 seconds. When the timing of BP and pulse (heart) rate measurements coincides with a blood colle ction or other stud y procedure, BP and pulse (heart) rate should be obtained first. 8.2.3. Chest X -Ray Chest X -ray or other appropriate diagnostic image (ie, computerized tomograph y or magnetic resonance imaging) to aid in TB status determination may be performed up to 12 weeks prior to Day 1. Chest X -rays (posterior/anterior and lateral views) are required. Official reading must be located and available in the source documentation. 8.2.4. Electrocardiograms A single 12 -lead ECG will be performed at visits specified in the Schedule of Activities after the participant has rested for at least 10 minutes quietly in the supine position. ECG will be interpreted b y a central reader. Clinically significant or exclusionary ECG findings at the screening visit will result in screen failure."

A cardiologist should be consulted if QTc intervals do not return to less than the criterion listed above after 8 hours of monitoring (or sooner, at the discretion of the investigator). In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality . It is important that leads be placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings. If a machine read Q Tc value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not be necessary if a qualified medical provider’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable range. ECG values of potential clinical concern are listed in Appendix 8 . 8.2.5. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments See Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency .

Hepatitis Testing Hepatitis B (HB) testing : HB surface antigen (HBsAg), HB core antibody (HBcAb), HB surface an tibody (HBsAb), HBV DNA (where required). Participants who are HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive, and HBsAb positive at Screening will have reflex testing for HBV DNA. Participants who have HBV DNA above the LLQ are excluded. Participants who have HBV DNA n egative or below LLQ may be randomized but will have HBV DNA testing repeated at Week 16 and Week 26 End of Treatment (EOT) visit, or Early Discontinuation (ED) visit, whichever is sooner (refer to Section 7.1.). A single HBV DNA test result above the LLQ for a participant requires immediate and permanent discontinuation from treatment. Interpretation of Hepatitis B Testing Results: HBsAg negati ve and HBcAb negative: Participant is eligible for the stud y; HBsAg positive and HBcAb negative: Participant is excluded from study participation; HBsAg negative and HBcAb positive and HBsAb positive: Participant may be eligible for study if HBV DNA is neg ative or below LLQ; HBsAg negative and HBcAb positive and HBsAb negative: Participant is excluded from study participation. Hepatitis C testing : Hepatitis C virus Antibody (HCV Ab), Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) (HCV RNA for confirmation of positive HCV Ab result).

Tuberculosis Testing A documented TB test performed within 12 weeks prior to Day 1 (Week 0) is acceptable. Perform TB test procedure using the QuantiFERON -TB Gold In- Tube Test (QFT- G). The QFT- G may be repeated once if the investigator deems this to be necessary . A Purifi ed Protein Derivative (PPD) test may be performed if the central laboratory is unable to determine results of QFT-G. Should the PPD test be required, the test must be administered and evaluated b y a health care professional 48 to 72 hours later, unless per formed and documented within the last 3 months. The test should be performed according to local standards with induration of <5 mm required for inclusion. Other TB testing may be performed at a local lab with approval from the Pfizer clinician. Participan ts with a history of tuberculosis may not require TB testing as per the protocol exclusion criteria in Section 5.2. In addition to protocol required TB testing, a chest X- ray (or other imaging as specified in Section 8.2.3 ) is required, unless previously performed and documented within 12 weeks prior to Study Day 1. Refer to Section 8.2.3. 8.2.6. Infection Studies Blood samples will be collected per the SOA and serum isolated for infection studies; these samples will be anal yzed only if the participant has suspected infection/reactivation where results are needed to assess the case. Additional sample collection instructions will be provided in the lab manual. The reta ined samples will be destroy ed upon participant completion of this study or, if the participant enrolls in the long -term extension study , the samples will be destro yed upon participant completion of that study . 8.2.7. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitori ng Site staff is to administer the C- SSRS to all participants at screening and score immediately . Based on the judgment of the investigator, the participant must either be excluded or have a risk assessment done by a qualified MHP to assess whether it is safe to participate in the trial if the participant's responses on any of the screening instruments or other screening information indicate: Suicidal ideation associated with actual intent and a method or plan in the past y ear: “Yes” answers on items 4 or 5 of the C -SSRS. Previous history of suicidal behavior in the past 5 y ears: “Yes” answer (for events that occurred in the past 5 y ears) to an y of the suicidal behavior items of the C -SSRS."
85,page_85,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 86Any lifetime history of serious or recurrent suicidal behavior (non -suicidal self - injurous behavior is not a trigger for a risk assessment unless it is indicated according to the investigator’s judgement). Clinically significant depression when the PHQ- 8 total score ≥ 15. The presence of an y current major psychiatric disorder that is not explicitly permitted in the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In the investigator’s judgement a risk assessment or exclusion is required. Written documentation of the risk assessment should be included in the participant’s clinical record (source documentation). At the baseline (randomization) visit, if there are “y es” answers on items 4, 5 or on any behavioral question of the C‑SSRS, a risk assessment must be done prior to randomization by a qualified MHP to determine whether it is safe f or the participant to continue in the trial. A copy of the risk assessment should be included in the source documents. At post -baseline visits, if there are “y es” answers on items 4, 5 or on any behavioral question of the C ‑SSRS, a risk assessment by a qualified MHP must be done to determine whether it is safe for the participant to continue in the trial. Participants who have recurrent SIB during the trial must be discontinued from the study and treated appropriatel y. If a participant endorses a 4 or 5 on the ideation subscale or an y behavioral item of the C -SSRS on two occasions and is confirmed to have active SIB on both occasions b y a risk assessment conducted b y a qualified MHP, then the participant must be discontinued from the study and treated appropriately . 8.2.7.1. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) The Columbia Suicide Severit y Rating Scale is a validated tool for investigative staff to use to evaluate suicidal ideation and behavior.43Trained site staff is to admin ister the C -SSRS to all participants at screening and assess the participant’s eligibility based on the answers. Refer to Section 8.2.7 for information on using this tool in SIB risk monitoring. When there is a positive response to any question on the C -SSRS, the investigator must determine whether an adverse event has occurred. 8.2.7.2. Patient Health Questionnaire – 8 Items (PHQ -8) The Patient Health Questionnaire –8 items is a participant -reported questionnaire consisting of 8 items to assess the participant’s depression level.44Site staff is to administer the PHQ-8 to all participants at screening and score immediatel y.

Pregnancy Testing For all WOCBP (refer to Appendix 4 for WOCBP definition), a serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mI U/mL will be performed at Screening. A urine pregnancy test will be performed at every site visit including the foll ow-up visit (EOT) to confirm the participant has not become pregnant during the stud y. Serum and urine pregnancy test kits will be provided b y the central laboratory with sample collection instructions provided in the package insert. A negative pregnancy test result is required at the baseline visit before the participant may receive the stud y intervention. Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected). Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested b y institutional review boards (I RBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required b y local regulations. Participants who have missed a menstrual period or who show an indeterminate or positive result on the urine test may not further progress in the study until pregnancy is ruled out using further diagnostic testing (eg, a negative quantitative serum pregnancy test conducted at a certified laboratory , with a sensitivity of at least 25 mI U/mL). In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy , the participant will be withdrawn from administration of the study intervention but may remain in the study . 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3 . The definitions of device- related safet y events (ADEs and SADEs) can be found in Appendix 7. Device deficiencies are covered in Section 10.7. AE will be reported b y the participant (or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legall y authorized representative). The investigator and an y qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classi fication as an SAE, or thatcaused the participant to discontinue the study (see Section 7). Each participant will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner. In addition, the investigator may be requested by Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each particip ant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing"
87,page_87,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 88any study -related procedure and/or receiving study intervention), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days; except as indicated below after the last administration of the study intervention. Follow up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the AE or SAE or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. For participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for the collection of future information, the active collection period ends when consent is withdrawn. If a participant definitively discontinues or temporarily discontinues study intervention because of an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must be recorded on the CRF and the SAE reported using the CT SAE Report Form. Investigators ar e not obligated to activel y seek AE sor SAEs after the participant has concluded study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has completed the study , and he/she consi ders the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention, the investigator must promptly report the SAE to Pfizer using the CT SAE Report Form . 8.3.1.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period as described in Section 8.3.1 are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form immedi ately upon awareness and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. 8.3.1.2. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF All nonserious AEs and SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period, which begins after obtaining informed consent as described in Section 8.3.1, will be recorded on the AE section of th e CRF. The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed and all spontaneously reported AEs and SAEs reported by the participant. 8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE sand SAE sand the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 ."
88,page_88,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 89Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the p articipant is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurrences. 8.3.3. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. For each event, the investigat or must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 7.3). In general, follow -up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality . An y information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3 . 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a n SAE is essential so that legal obligations a nd ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies a bout the safet y of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority , IRB/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigato r safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the study intervention(s) under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness."

Exposure During Pregnancy An exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if: A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention. Afemale is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental exposure during pregnancy : A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study inter vention by ingestion or skin contact. The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The initial information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy ). If EDP occurs in a participant or a participant’s partner, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. Details of the pregnancy will be collected after the start of stud y intervention and until 28 day s after the last dose If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must report information to Pfizer Safety using the CT SAE Report Form and EDP Supplemental Form. Since the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study , the information i s not recorded on a CRF; however, a cop y of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. Th e investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a follow -up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate ca n be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless prepro cedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). Abnormal pregnancy outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intra uterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a live -born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures"

Additional information about pregn ancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs follows: Spontaneous abortion including miscarriage and missed abortion; Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality , as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study intervention. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of In formation Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding An exposure during breastfeeding occurs if: A female participant is found to be breastfeeding while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention . A female is found to be breastfeeding while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention (ie, environmental exposure). An example of environmental exposure during breastfeeding is a female family member or healthcare provider who reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact. The investigat or must report exposure during breastfeeding to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The information must be reported using the CT SAE Report Form. When exposure during breastfeeding occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study , so the information is not recorded on a CRF. However, a cop y of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specificall y approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding."

Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when a person receives unplanned direct contact with the study intervention , which may or may not lead t o the occurrence of an AE. Such persons may include healthcare providers, famil y members, and other roles that are involved in the trial participant’s care. The investigator must report occupational exposure to Pfizer Safet y within 24 hours of the investig ator’s awareness, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE.

Estimand 1 composite estimand is the primary estimand for the primary and key secondary endpoints: PP -NRS4 response at Week 2, EASI -90 at Week 4, and EASI -90 at Week 16. Other binary outcome measures such as response based on PP -NRS4 and EASI -90 at all other s cheduled timepoints, EASI -75, and IGA will follow the same structure. Estimand 2, hypothetical estimand : Population: Participants with moderate -to-severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as defined by the inclusion criteria to reflect the targeted participant popu lation; Variable: Percent change from baseline in SCORAD at all scheduled timepoints ; Interventional effect: Effect of randomized treatment as if all participants maintain their randomized treatment; drop- out for an y reason and use of rescue therapy are the intercurrent events; data after dropout or use of rescue therap y at an y time during the treatment period will be censored ; Population -level summary: Difference in least -square means between abrocitinib and dupilumab. Percent change from baseline or change from baseline to each specific post baseline scheduled time points in a continuous outcome measure such as HADS, POEM, DLQI, and EQ -5D- 5L will follow the same structure as defined for SCORAD. 9.2.Sample Size Determination This is a randomized, double -blind, double -dummy , active -controlled, multi- center stud y to assess the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib 200 mgQD compared with dupilumab (as per label guidelines) in adult participants on background topical therap y, with moderate to severe AD. Th e treatment duration is 26 weeks. A total of approximately 600 participants will be enrolled from approximately 220 sites globall y. There are primary efficacy assessments at Week 2 and Week 4, and a key secondary efficacy assessment at Week 16. Efficacy and safet y endpoints will be assessed throughout the entire study."
97,page_97,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 98A total sample of 600 participants, with 300 participants randomized to abrocitinib, 300 participants randomized to dupilumab (1:1 randomization) is planned. The proposed sample size provi des adequate power for all superiorit y hypotheses, as follows: Week 2: This sample size would provide at least 99% power to detect a difference assuming a difference of at least 25% in PP- NRS4 between abrocitinib and dupilumab and assuming the dupilumab response rate is 11% at Week 2. Week 4: This sample size will provide approximately 99% power to detect a difference assuming a difference of at least 15% in Week 4 EASI -90 between abrocitinib and dupilumab and assuming the dupilumab response rate is 12%. Week 16: this sample size will provide at least 99% power to show the difference is no more than 10% favoring dupilumab in EASI -90 at Week 16 (non- inferiority (NI) with a 10% margin), assuming the abrocitinib response rate is 53% and the dupilumab response rate is 43% at Week 16. This sample size will also provide approximately 70% power to demonstrate superiorit y of abrocitinib 200 mg QD to dupilumab as measured by EASI -90 response at Week 16. While the power to detect a difference at the earl y time points of 2 and 4 weeks and non- inferiority at week 16 is strong imply ing a decrease sample size could be used, the power to demonstrate superiorit y at week 16 requires the larger number of participants. Superiority at week 16 is a valuable endpoint for the scie ntific community and prescribers justify ing the larger sample size. In addition, the study design avoids exposing participants to the use of placebo alone. While a larger number of participants are utilized, they will be guaranteed treatment on 1 of the 2 active treatment arms, which allows for potential benefit for all participants included in the study . The 10% NI margin between abrocitinib and dupilumab was chosen for Week 16 EASI -90 based on the historical data from dupilumab in treating participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis described in Section 2.2.2 . Difference and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) b etween dupilumab and placebo in combination therapy was 31.2% (22.9, 39.5). The 10% NI margin preserves around two thirds of the treatment effect of dupilumab. Added advantages of convenient route of administration, earl y onset of pruritus relief, and unlikely development of anti -drug antibodies support that a <10% difference would not be considered clinically important. In projecting the difference between abrocitinib and dupilumab in Week 16 EASI -90 in combination therap y, the following assumptions were made. Based on the monotherapy and combination therap y studies in the dupilumab program ( Section 2.2.2 ), and the monotherap y studies in the abrocitinib program ( Section 2.2.3 ), the projected difference between abrocitinib in combination with TCS and dupilumab in com bination with TCS will be similar to the projected difference between abrocitinib and dupilumab under the monotherap y setting. Similar assumptions were made for Week 2 PP -NRS4 response and Week 4 EASI- 90."

Randomly Assigned to Study InterventionAll participants who were randoml y assigned to abrocitinib or dupilumab. Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) All randomized participants receiving at least one dose of study intervention. Participants will be analy zed according to the intervention to which they were randomized. Per-Protocol Anal ysis Set (PPAS)All randomized participants receiving at least one dose of study intervention who had no major protocol violations. This set will include participants who: Were eligible for the study by way of meeting key inclusion criteria and none of the key exclusion criteria. Had valid and non- missing baseline effic acy data (EASI score). Had actual, observed EASI scores at Week 16. Took the correct randomized treatment for at least 80% and at most 120% of the assigned amount until Week 16. Had no other major protocol violations as determined b y the clinical team prior to database lock. A major protocol violation in this context is one that is likely to affect materially the efficacy responses of the participant and will be defined b y the clinical team before database is locked and an y analysis is performed for this study . Safety All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and who take at least 1 dose of study intervention . Participants will be anal yzed according to the intervention they actuall y received."

For the responder anal ysis, data after dropout or use of rescue therapy will be defined as “non -responsive” after that point. 9.4. Statistical Analyses Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical anal ysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major mo difications of the primary or key secondary endpoint definitions or their anal yses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. The SAP will be developed and finalized before database lock and will describe the participant populations to be included in the analy ses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. 9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary The primary endpoints (PP -NRS4 response at Week 2, and EASI -90 at Week 4) will be anal yzed using the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by baseline disease severit y group (moderate and severe). The difference between the abrocitinib 200 mg group and the dupilumab 300 mg group in the proportion of participants achieving the response along with its 95% confidence interval (using the normal approximation for the difference in binomial proportions) will be reported. The difference in proportions will be calculated within each randomization stratum. The final estimate of the difference in proportions will be a weighted average of these stratum specific estimates using CMH weights. This anal ysis is based on Estimand 1 composite estimand and on population defined set FAS. Secondary anal ysis 1: CMH test on population defined set FAS. This analy sis will not consider the use of rescue therapy as an intercurrent event. For participants who drop out for an y reason, the response will be defined as “non -responsive” after that point. Secondary anal ysis 2 utilizes the longitudinal nature of the binary endpoint. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) will be fit to all observed data (ie, regardless of rescue therap y and without defining missing data as “non -response”). Under the missing at random (MAR) framework, imputations will be based on the posterior predictive probability of response obtained from the posterior distribution under the mixed model. For each such completed dataset, the estimates of the proportions and CMH -"

Key Seconda ryThe non- inferiority test of the key secondary endpoint EASI -90 at Week 16 will be analyzed using the 95% CMH weighted confidence interval adjusted by baseline disease severity group (moderate and severe). NI will be declared if the lower bound of the confidence interval for the response difference (abrocitinib - dupilumab) is greater than -10%. This anal ysis is based on Estimand 1 composite estimand and on population defined set FAS. For the superiority test of the key secondary endpoint EASI -90 at Week 16 will be anal yzed using the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test adjusted by baseline disease severity group (moderate and severe) similarly to the primary endpoints. This analy sis is based on Estimand 1 composite estimand and on population defined set FAS. Secondary anal ysis 1: CMH test on population defined set PPAS. Secondary anal ysis 2: CMH test on population defined set FAS. This analy sis will not consider the use of rescue therapy as an intercurrent event. For participants who drop out for an y reason, the response will be defined as “non -responsive” after that point. Secondary anal ysis 3: Missing observations will be multiply imputed similarly to secondary anal ysis 2 of the primary endpoints. Secondary The secondary endpoints which are summarized as prop ortions such as EASI -90 at Week 12, will be anal yzed using the same method as for the primary endpoints. This would also apply to any other binary endpoint in the study , such as the proportion of response based on IGA of clear (0) or almost clear (1) and ≥2- point improvement from baseline. For continuous endpoints, a mixed effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be used. This model will include the factors (fixed effects) for treatment group, disease severit y group, visit, treatment by visit inte raction, and relevant baseline value. Within the framework of MMRM, the treatment difference will"

This analy sis is based on Estimand 2 hy pothetical estimand and on population defined set FAS. Observations after dropout or use of rescue therap y will be censored. Exploratory Will be described in the statistical analy sis plan finalized before database lock. 9.4.2. Type I Error Control Procedure The T ype I error rate is set at 5% (two sided). The familywise Type I error rate (for testing the primary and key secondary endpoints) will be strongl y controlled at 5% using a sequential testing approach. The procedure will test all hy pothesis sequenti ally. If one h ypothesis is not rejected at the 5% level, then the statistical significance will be not claimed for the subsequent hy potheses testing. The procedure will first test superiority of PP -NRS4 response at Week 2 and then EASI -90 at Week 4 between abrocitinib and dupilumab by CMH test specified in the primary analysis. If both hy potheses are rejected, the procedure will continue to test the NI of EASI - 90 at Week 16 between abrocitinib and dupilumab. The 95% CMH weighted confidence interval will be constructed for the response difference and NI will be declared if the lower bound of the confidence interval for the response difference (abrocitinib -dupilumab) is greater than - 10%. If the non- inferiorit y is achieved, the procedure will continue to tes t superiority of EASI -90 at Week 16 between abrocitinib and dupilumab by CMH test specified in the anal ysis for the key secondary endpoint. Asequential, step -down approach with the PP -NRS4 endpoint from Week 2 to earlier time points will be utilized as an additional family of hy pothesis tests once statistical significance is demonstrated at Week 2. Specifically, further hypotheses of no difference in PP -NRS4 between abrocitinib and dupilumab will be assessed at Day 15, Day 14, Day 13, Day 12, …, Day 2, in that order. An y hypotheses after the last Day for which the comparison is significant will not be considered statistically significant. All hy potheses in the sequence will be assessed at the 5% level of significance. Although this will not protect the Typ e-I error for the family of all possible comparisons, it will provide Ty pe-I error protection for the famil y of PP -NRS4 comparisons over the first 2 weeks. 9.4.3. Safety Analyses All participants who receive study intervention (safety population) will be included in the safet y analyses. All safety anal yses will be performed on the Safet y Population. The safet y data will be summarized in accordance with Pfizer Data Standards. All safety data will be"

The results from the I A will not be used to make decisions for modify ing the study design or for stopping t he study . The conclusions with regards to the primary endpoints and the secondary endpoints will be based on the final anal ysis after study completion and hence the overall famil y wise Type 1 error for this study is maintained. Sites and participants will remain blinded to treatment assignment and interim results distribution will be limited . Details will be described in a separate unblinding plan. 9.5.Interim Analyses No formal interim anal ysiswill be performed for this study . 9.5.1.

The investigator is responsible for verify ing that data entries are accurate and correct by physicall y or electronically signing the CRF. The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the CRF. The investigator must ensure that the CRFs are securel y stored at the study site in encry pted electronic form and are password protected to prevent access by unauthorized third parties. The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, I RB/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. This verification may also occur after study completion. I t is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the mon itoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk- based initiatives in operations and quality such as Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and Anal ytical Risk - Based Monitoring), methods, responsibilities and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on -site monitoring) are provided in the Clinical Monitoring Plan and contracts. The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including qualit y checking of the data. Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the CRF b y authorized site personnel are accurate, complet e, and verifiable from source documents; that the safet y and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currentl y approved protocol and any other stud y agreements, I CH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator for 15 y ears after study completion unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retent ion period. No records may be destroy ed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. The investigator must ensure that the r ecords continue to be stored securely for so long as they are maintained. When participant data are to be deleted, the investigator will ensure that all copies of such data are promptly and irrevocabl y deleted from all systems. The investigator(s) will not ify sponsor or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will"

The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the participant's medical records. The investigator will pro mptly provide copies of the inspection findings to sponsor or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide sponsor or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to an y such findi ngs. 10.1.8. Source Documents Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site. Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the stud y. Also, current medical reco rds must be available. Definition of what constitutes source data can be found in the Clinical Monitoring Plan. 10.1.9. Study and Site Closure The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for an y reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a stud y-site closure visit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time upon notification to the contract research organization (CRO) if requested to do so by the responsible IRB/IEC or if such termination is required to protect the health of Study Participants. Reasons for the earl y clos ure of a stud y site b y the sponsor may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator Discontinuation of further study intervention development Study termination is also provided for in the clinical study agreement. If there is any conflict between the contract and this protocol the contract will control as to termination rights."

Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting 10.3.1. Definition of AE AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporall y associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention. Events Meeting the AE Def inition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underl ying disease). Any abnormal laboratory test results that meet an y of the conditions below must be recorded as an AE: Is associated with accompany ing symptoms. Requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention. Leads to a change in study dosing (outside of any protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. “Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological actio n” per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy"
115,page_115,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 116assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, “lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” also constitutes an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical proc edure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 10.3.2. Definition of SAE If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/s ymptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizati on In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is"
116,page_116,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 117serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disrupt ion of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sp rained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediatel y life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Suspected transmission via a Pfizer product of an infectious agent, pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is considered serious. The event may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a Pfizer product. The terms “suspected transmission” and “transmission” are considered s ynon ymous. These cases are considered unexpected and handled a s serious expedited cases by pharmacovigilance personnel. Such cases are also considered for reporting as product defects, if appropriate. 10.3.3. Recording/Reportin gand Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE AE and SAE Recording/Reporting The table below summarizes the requirements for recording adverse events on the CRF and for reporting serious adverse events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to Pfizer Safety . These requirements are delineated for 3 ty pesof"
117,page_117,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 118events: (1) SAEs; (2) non -serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the study interventions during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. It should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report F orm for reporting of SAE information. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness SAE All All Non-serious AE All None Exposure to the study intervention during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposureAll AEs/SAEs associated with exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding Occupational exposure is not recorded.All (And exposure during pregnancy [EDP] supplemental form for EDP) Note: I nclude all SAEs associated with exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Include all AEs/SAEs associated with occupational exposure. When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laborato ry reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to Pfizer Safety in lieu of completion of the Pfizer Safet y /AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y Pfizer Safety. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to Pfizer Safety . The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE."
118,page_118,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 119Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal ever yday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a nSAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product I nformation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may besituations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to Pfizer Safety . However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to Pfizer Safety . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a nSAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements."

Follow -up of AEs and SAEs The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested b y Pfizer Safety to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the investigator will provide Pfizer Safety with a cop y of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in t he originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Pfizer Safet y within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 10.3.4. Reporting of SAEs SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to Pfizer Safety will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool ( see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours. The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing d ata. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (s ee next section) or to Pfizer Safety by telephone."

Therefore, where local regulations and IRB/ IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analy sis. Genetic research may consist of the analy sis of one or more candidate genes or the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome or anal ysis of the entire genome (as appropriate). The samples may be analy zed as part of a multi- study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to abrocitinib or study interventions of this class, treatments for the disease(s) under stud y or the disease(s) themselves. The results of genetic anal yses may be reported in the CSR or in a separate study summary or may be used for internal decision- making without being included in a study report. The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confiden tiality . The samples will be retained as indicated: Samples for banking (refer to Section 8.7.2 and Section 8.8.4 ) will be stored indefinitely or other period as per local requirements. Participants may withdraw their consent for the storage and/or use of their Ba nked Biospecimens at any time by making a request to the investigator; in this case, an y remaining material will be destro yed. Data already generated from the samples will be retained to protect the integrit y of existing analyses. Banked Biospecimens w ill be labelled with a code. The key between the code and the participant’s personally identify ing information (eg name, address) will be held at the study site and will not be provided to the sample bank."

Appendix 6: Liver Safety: Sugges ted Actions and Follow -up Assessments Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These participants fail to adapt and therefore are ""susceptible"" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonl y referred to as drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the ULN should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/o r alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 × ULN) b y several days or weeks. The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 × ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample). In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili tha t meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Participants who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law ) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR AL T values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value >2×ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2×ULN or not available; For participants with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which v alues are above the ULN at baseline: oPreexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller). oPreexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili l evel increased from baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × ULN (whichever is smaller). Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.

This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , and ph ysical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili for suspected cases of Hy’s Law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine k inase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (I NR), total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted bl ood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history , sexual history , travel history , history of contact with a jau ndiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) a nd collection of serum sample for acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/AL T and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has y et been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to de termine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology ."

Appendix 7: Medical Device Adverse Events , Adverse Device Effects, Serious Adverse Events, and Device Deficiencies Definition and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definitions of a Medical Device Incident The definitions and procedures detailed in this appendix are in accordance with I SO 14155. Both the investigator and the sponsor will comply with all local medical device reporting requirements. The detection and documentation procedures described in this protocol apply to all sponsor medical devices provided for use in the stud y (refer to Section 6.1.2 for the list of sponsor medical devices). 10.7.1. Definition of AE and ADE AE and ADE Definition An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury , or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory finding) in study participants, users, or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device. This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or comparator for stud y participants, users, and other persons. This definition also includes events considered related to procedures for stud y participants only . An AD E is defined as an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device. This definition includes any adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device as well as an y event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device. 10.7.2. Definition of SAE, SADE, and Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease)."
128,page_128,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 129An SAE is an AE that: a.Led to death. b.Led to serious deterioration in the health of theparticipant, that either resulted in: A life -threatening illness or injury . The term “life -threatening” in the definition of serious refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, that hy pothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. A permanent impairment of a bod y structure or a body function. Inpatient or prolonged hospitalization. Planned hospitalization for a preexisting condition, or a procedure required b y the protocol, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE. Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. c.Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. SADE Definition An SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in an y of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event. USADE Definition A USADE is a serious adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, severit y, or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis management file. 10.7.3. Definition of Device Deficiency Device Deficiency Definition A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity , quality , durability , reliability , safet y, or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling."

Recording/Reporting and Follow -up of AEs and/or SAEs and Device Deficiencies AE, SAE, and Device Deficiency Recording When an AE/SAE/device deficiency occurs, it is the responsibility of the injection administrator/trainer to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostic reports) related to the event. The injection administrator/trainer will then record all relevant AE/SAE/device deficiency information in the participant’s medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the appropriate form of the CRF. It is notacceptable for the injection administrator/trainer to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to Pfizer Safety in lieu of following the reporting process described in the IP Manual. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y Pfizer Safety. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to Pfizer Safety . The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. For device deficiencies, it is very important that the investigator describes any corrective or remedial actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident. A remedial action is an y action other than routine maintenance or servicing of a medical device where such action is necessary to prevent recurrence of a device deficiency . This includes any amendment to the device design to prevent recurrence. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE/SAE/device deficiency reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and no t interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe."
130,page_130,"Abrocitinib and Dupilumab Protocol B7451050 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 14 August 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 131An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE/device deficiency . A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the product information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE/device deficiency , the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE/device deficiency and has provided an assessment of causalit y. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurr ed and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that the investigator alway s make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to t he sponsor. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE/SAE/Device Deficiency The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE/SAE/device deficiency as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other healthcare providers."

Reporting of SAEs SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to Pfizer Safety will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours. The site will enter the SAE data into th e electronic sy stem as soon as the data become available. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to Pfizer Safety by telephone. SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via CT SAE Report Form Facsimile transmission of the CT SAE Report Form is the preferred method to transmit this information to Pfizer Safety . In circumstances when the facsimile is not working, notification by telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the CT SAE Report Form sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the CT SAE Report Form pages within the desi gnated reporting time frames."

Monitoring Criteria The following laboratory abnormalities require prompt retesting: Neutrophil counts <1000 neutrophils/mm3; confirmed promptly by repeat testing, ideally within 3 -5days; Platelet counts <75,000 platelets/mm3; confirmed promptly by repeat testing, ideally within 3 -5days; Any single hemoglobin value <9.0 g/dL or one tha t drops ≥2g/dL below the baseline value and is also below the lower limit of normal; confirmed promptl y by repeat testing, ideall y within 3 -5days; Any single AST and/or AL T elevation >3 times the upper limit of normal regardless of accompan ying symptoms or the total Bilirubin should prompt repeat testing. This should also prompt review of Appendix 6 (Liver Safety ); additional investigations must be conducted. Temporary Interruption to Dosing An investigator can temp oraril y interrupt oral study intervention for up to a maximum of 28 consecutive days and up to 2 consecutive doses of injectable study intervention for a participant, for safet y reasons or while monitoring abnormal laboratory tests if the investigator judg es that this is necessary . In the case of study intervention being withheld, all study interventions that the participant is receiving should be withheld (ie, both oral and injected study interventions). The investigator should use their judgement with r egard to unscheduled visits/laboratory /clinical assessments required to monitor the participant during this timeframe. If within this timeframe the investigator judges that it is safe to restart dosing, then the participant may restart study intervention. If the investigator judges that it is not safe to restart dosing within this timeframe then the participant must be permanentl y discontinued from treatment, have an End of Treatment visit and enter the 4 -week follow -up period (See S ection 10.12.3 for UK country -specific requirements). Doses not taken for the reasons mentioned above do not constitute protocol deviations or medication errors and should not be considered dosing errors but should be noted in the dosing log with the reason for reduced drug consumption clearl y described."

If a participant endorses a 4 or 5 on the ideation subscale or an y behavioral item of the C -SSRS on two occ asions and is confirmed to have active SIB on both occasions by a risk assessment conducted b y a qualified MHP, then the participant must be discontinued from the study and treated appropriatel y. Marked prolongation of the QTcF interval to >500 ms or >60 ms change from screening ECG (refer to Appendix 8 ). Serious infection (refer to definition for Serious Adverse Events in Section 10.3.2) must result in temporary interruption of study intervention. Study intervention cannot be restarted until the serious infection has resolved, and unless discussed and agreed with the medical monitor. If the participant cannot be restarted on study interv ention within 28 day s or the infection is not resolved, or there is no agreement received from the medical monitor then the participant must be permanentl y discontinued. Any bleeding event thought to be associated with a platelet count or hemoglobin reduc tion per the judgement of the investigator (or, if necessary /desired, following discussion with the medical monitor). Adverse event, per judgment of the investigator, requiring discontinuation from treatment (or, if necessary/desired, following discussion with the medical monitor). Any adverse event or laboratory abnormality , that per the investigator’s judgement requires withholding of oral study intervention for >28 consecutive day s and > 2 consecutive doses of injectable study intervention. NOTE: an y initial lab value below must be retested within 48 hours. Two sequential platelet counts <50,000/mm3. If the participant has a platelet count <25,000/mm3, study intervention should be temporarily withheld pending the confirmatory retest. Two sequential neutr ophil counts <500/mm3. Two sequential l ymphocy te counts <500/mm3. Two sequential hemoglobin assessments <8.0 g/dL or <30% from baseline value. Two sequential increases in serum creatinine that are >50% over the average of screening and baseline values AND an absolute increase in serum creatinine"

At the time of study completion or discontinuation, if a participant should exhibit elevations in serum creatinine 33% above the average of screening and baseline values, they will be re- tested every 1to 2weeks until the serum creatinine elevation is fully reversed to within 10% of the average of screening and baseline values or has stabilized. Any of the following: Two sequential AST or AL T elevations >3 times the upper limit of normal with at least one Total Bilirubin value >2 times the upper limit of normal. Two sequential AST or AL T elevations >3 times the upper limit of normal with an abnormal INR. Two sequential AST or AL T elevations >3 times the upper limit of normal accompanied b y symptoms cons istent with hepatic injury . Two sequential AST or AL T elevations >5 times the upper limit of normal, regardless of Total Bilirubin or accompan ying symptoms. NOTE: An y of the above LFT findings should prompt review of Appendix 6 (Liver Safety) for which additional investigations must be conducted. Having met Discontinuation Criteria, the participant must be permanentl y withdrawn from treatment, have their end of treatment visit, and will then enter the 4 -week follow -up period (See Sectio n 10.12.3 forUK country -specific instructions). Additional individual participant safet y monitoring, including laboratory testing or unscheduled stud y visits, in addition to these guidelines is at the discretion of the investigator and dependent on their judgment of safet y concerns. Unscheduled laboratory testing through the central laboratory may be obtained at any time during the study to assess such concerns. If a participant has a clinically significant, treatment emergent, abnorma lity at the time of withdrawal from the study, the Pfizer medical monitor (or designee) should be notified and every effort should be made to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the abnormalit y. All abnormal la boratory events of clinical significance should be followed until the laboratory values have returned to normal or baseline levels or are deemed clinically stable. Follow -up for abnormal laboratory findings and adverse events by the investigator is requir ed until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment."

Appendix 13: Alternative Measures During Public Emergencies Thealternative study measures described in this section areto be followed during public emergencies, including the COVID -19 pandemic. This appendix applies for theduration of the COVID -19 pandemic globall y and will become effective for other public emergencies only upon written notification from Pfizer. Use of these alternative study measure s are expected to cease upon the return of business as usual circumstances (including the lifting of an y quarantines and travel bans/advisories). 10.13.1. Telehealth visits In the event that in-clinic study visits cannot be conducted, every effort should be made to follow up on the safet y ofstudy participants at scheduled visits per the Schedule of Activities or unscheduled visits. Telehealth visits may be used to continue to assess participant safety and collect data points. Telehealth includes the exchange of hea lthcare information and services via telecommunication technologies (e.g., audio, video, video - conferencing software) remotely, allowing the participant and the investigator to communicate on aspects of clinical care, including medical advice, reminders, e ducation, and safet y monitoring. The following assessments must be performed during a telehealth visit: Review and record stud y intervention(s), including compliance and missed doses. Review and record an y AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to Section 8. 3. Review and record an y new concomitant medications or changes in concomitant medications since the last contact. Review eDiary for completion, including the participant’s understanding of the daily completion requirements; Review accelerometry and arrange for return of used devices and sending of new devices, if applicable. Complete contraceptive check and results of pregnancy testing. Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. Refer to Appendix 4 regarding pregnancy tests. Administer the C -SSRS and follow -up as necessary per protocol Section 8.2.7 . Study participants must be reminded to promptl ynotify site staff about an y change in their health status. 10.13.2. Home health visits A home health care service may beutilized to facilitate scheduled visits per the Schedule of Activities. Home health visits include a healthcare provider conducting an in- person study visit at the participant’s location, rather than an in -person stud y visit at the site. The following may be performed during a home health visit: Review and record stud y intervention(s), including complian ce and missed doses. Review and record an y AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to Section 8.4."

Laboratory testing Protocol -specified safet y laboratory tests may be performed b y in-home visit (e.g. h ome phlebotomy service), where allowable by law or local guidance, if the study participant is unable to visit the local laboratory utilized by the study site. There must (at a minimum) be a record of verbal consent of the participant or, as applicable for minor participants, a record of verbal consent of the participant’s legall y authorized representative including whether they consent to provide their personal information to the 3rdparty vendor for this purpose and verbal assent of the study participant. If a local laboratory is used, qualified stud y site personnel must order, receive, and review results. Site staff must collect thelocal laboratory reference ranges and certifications/ accreditations for filing at the site. Laboratory test results are to be provided to the site staff as soon as possible . The local laboratory reports should be filed in the participant’s source documents/medical records. Relevant data from the local laboratory report should be recorded on the CRF. If a participant req uiring pregnancy testing cannot visit a local laboratory for pregnancy testing, a home urine pregnancy testing kit with a sensitivity of at least 25 IU/mL may be used by the participant to perform the test at home, if compliant with local regulatory requir ements. The pregnancy test outcome should be documented in the participant’s source documents/medical records. Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. If the safet y of a participant is at risk because they cannot complete required evaluations or adhere to critical mitigation steps, then potential temporary interruption or permanent discontinuation of that participant from study intervention must be discussed with the sponsor. A benefit -risk judg ment by the investigator, agreed with the sponsor, will ultimately be required."

Electrocardiograms If the participant is unable to visit the study site for ECGs, the participant may visit an alternative facility to have the ECGs performed. Qualified study site personnel must order, receive, and review results. 10.13.4. Study intervention If the safet y of a trial participant is at risk because they cannot complete required evaluations or adhere to critical mitigation steps, then discontinuing that participant from study intervention must be considered. Study intervention may beshipped by courier to study participants if permitted by local regulations and in accordance with storage and transportation requirements for the study intervention. Pfizer does not permit the shipment of study intervention by mail. The tracking record of shipments and the chain of custody ofstudy intervention must be kept in the participant’s source documents/medical records. Examples of potentially acceptable delivery methods (not an all -inclusive list): Site staff delivery with confirmation of temperature monitoring and time in transit (time study intervention leaves site until delivered to participant); Site courier with co nfirmation of temperature monitoring and time in transit (time study intervention is picked up at site until delivered to participant. There must (at a minimum) be a record of verbal consent of the participant, including whether they consent to provide the ir personal information to a 3rd part y vendor for this purpose. Note : If no temperature monitoring is available, assess and document if average temperature in the geographic area is within the stability range, anticipating shipping transit times and possible travel delay s –and ensure to discuss this further with the sponsor. 10.13.5. Adverse events and serious adverse events If a participant has COVID -19 during the study , this should be reported as an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) and appr opriate medical intervention provided. Temporary discontinuation of the study intervention may be medicall y appropriate until the participant has recovered from COVID -19. It is recommended that the investigator discuss temporary or permanent discontinuati on of study intervention with the study medical monitor. 10.13.6. Efficacy assessments The efficacy assessments may be assessed b y a qualified rater and PROs administered on the tablet may be completed as part of a home health care visit but cannot be completed as part of a TeleHeath visit."
