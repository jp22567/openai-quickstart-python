The importance of cough as a clinical problem globally has led to multiple societies publishing guidelines on the dia gnosis and management of cough [Morice, A. H., et al 2004] [Chung, K. F., et al 2006] [Morice, A. H., et al 2006] [The committee for The Japanese Respiratory Society guidelines 2006] [Kardos, P., et al 2010] . In these clinical guidelines, cough is categorized based upon the duration of t he cough; within each c ategory acute, sub -acute, and chronic are likely diagnostic possibilities [Irwin, R. S., et al 2006] . Acute cough is present for less than 3 weeks and most often due to acute viral upper respiratory tract infection. A cough that has been present longer than 3 weeks is either sub -acute (3 to 8 weeks) or chronic (>8 weeks). Chronic cough may affect up to approximate ly 12% of the adult population [Chamberlain, S. A., et al 2015] . For approximately two-thirds of these patients, a potential co- morbid condition can be identified and the cough effectively managed b y optimizing therap y for the condition. A minority of patients with a potential co -morbid condition cannot be effe ctivel y managed b y optimizing therap y for the condition and are considered to have refractory chronic cough. Also, the cause of chronic cough remains unexplained in 5% to 10% of patients seeking medical attention specific to their cough [Gibson, P., et al 2016] . This protocol aims to study participants with either refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough. Professional guidelines describe s ystematic approaches to the evaluation and management of chron ic cough. These guidelines are based largel y on consensus opinion and observational data from the medical literature. There are currently no treatments approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of chronic cough. Given the prolonged nature, significant morbidity, and lack of effective treatment, unexplained or refractory chronic cough is a major unmet medical need. Mechanism of Cough Each cough occurs through the stimulation of a com plex reflex arc. Cough is initiated following activation of airway sensory nerves in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Airway sensory nerves are tailored to detect changes in the phy sical and chemical environment, and if required, elicit protective re flex events such as cough. These reflexes are normally protective; however, in disease, a irway reflexes can become h yper responsive, leading to an increase in s ymptoms and a pathologic cough. P2X3 receptors are ligand -gated ion channels that respond to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and are almost exclusively localized on C -fiber sensory neurons, which innervate the upper and lower airway s and are the main nerve fibers responsible for cough. Adenosine triphosphate is released by damaged, stressed, and inflame d tissues. The action of ATP at sensory neurons in the periphery and spinal cord contributes to neural excitability and may cause h yper responsiveness through binding to P2X3 -containing receptors and stimulating of C-fiber neurons [North, R. A. 2004] [Khakh, B. S. 2006] . Antagonism of P2X3 -containing 0574PH"
28,page_28,"PRODUCT: MK-7264 28 PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:027-03 MK-7264 -027-03 FI NAL PROTOCOL 26-APR -2019 receptors is predicted to normalize sensory neuron sensitivity , based on data from P2X3 knock- out mice and the effects of small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) knock -down and pharmacological antagonists [Barclay , J., et al 2002] [Cockay ne, D. A., et al 2000] [Souslova, V., et al 2000] . Adenosine triphosphate and P2X3 -containi ng receptors have been shown to be involved in airway s sensitization and their involvement provides a rationale for P2X3 antagonism in the treatment of cough. Cough Hypersensitivity Syndrome Recently , the term cough hy persensitivity syndrome has been propo sed to describe a group of patients with chronic cough and si milar clinical characteristics [Chung, K. F. 2014] . These similar clinical characteristics include irritation in the throat or uppe r chest, cough triggered by stimuli that do not normally cause cough , increased cough sensitivity to inhaled stimuli, and cough parox ysms. A potential biologic explanation for cough h ypersensitivity syndrome suggests an associated sensory neuropathy characterized by sensory nerve hyper-sensitization. Sensory nerves are susceptible to sensitization by neuroactive mediators and altered expression of ion channels which regulate sensory nerve excitability to man y chemical stimuli. As described above, the action of ATP at sensory neurons may cause h yper responsiveness through binding to P2X3 -containing receptors and contribute to the pathophy siology of patients with chronic cough. As described elsewhere in the protocol, the data from Protocol 012 support the role of P2X3 antagonism in the treatment of patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. MK-7264 Development Program MK-7264, a P2X3 receptor antagonist, is a clinical agent being developed for the treatment of cough. The current MK -7264 cough development plan consists of two 12 -month Phase 3 studies in participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough: 1study (Protocol 027) with a 12-week Main study period and a 40 -week Extension study period, and a second study (Protocol 030) with a 24 -week Main stud y period and a 28- week Extension study period. 2.1 Study Rationale The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of MK -7264, an orall y available P2X3 antagonist, in participants, at least 18 y ears of age, who have either refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Current therapies for acute and sub -acute cough (narcotic, non -narcotic, and over -the-counter medications) have limited and/or unproven efficacy and an undesirable side effect profile. There are currently no approved therapies for chronic co ugh. Previous Phase 2 studies have demonstrated dose -related efficacy and an acceptable safet y and tolerability profile for MK -7264 in participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough (see MK -7264 Investigator’s Brochure [IB]). This Phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy and safet y of MK -7264 in participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. 0574PH"

The duration of intervention for each participant is as follows: Screening Period: a minimum of 7 day s and up to approximately 14days(see Section 8.10.1) Baseline: 1 day (including 24 hours of objective measurement of cough) (see Section 8.10.2) Main study period (12 -week treatment period after Baseline): 84 days(see Section 8.10.3) Extension study period (40 -week treatment period after the Main study period): 281days(see Section 8.10.4) Follow -up period: 14 days (see Section 8.10.6) During the Main study period, pa rticipants may be required to be seen b y study site personnel for 2consecutive day s (eg, Visit 2 to Visit 3, the day before Visit 4 and Visit 4, the day before Visit 5 and Visit 5, and the day before Visit 6 and Visit 6) so that the cough monitor can be a ttached and removed (see Section 1.3 ).Study site staff or mobile research nurse services may be utilized (if locally available and approved for use), so participants have the opportunity to travel to the study site on 1day instead of traveling to the stu dy site for 2consecutive day s. Individual participation is expected to be approximately 56 weeks from Screening through the Follow -up period. Specific procedures to be performed during the study , as well as their prescribed times and associated visit windows, are outlined in the SoA in Section 1.3. Details of each procedure are provided in Section 8. This study will use an adaptive design based on pre -specified criteria, using an independent, external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to monitor safet y and e fficacy. There will be 1planned interim efficacy anal ysis when approximately 40% of the total randomized participants have completed, or discontinued prior to completion of the Main study period. The study may be stopped for futility according to the resu lts of the interim anal ysis. Results of the interim analy sis will be reviewed by the external DMC, which will make recommendations to the Executive Oversight Committee (EOC) of the Sponsor to continue, modify or stop the stud y according to the plan described in Section 9. 0574PH"

H., et al 2009] . The impact of chronic cough on HRQoL as assessed by the L CQ is included as the third secondary endpoint. The goal is to demonstrate that a greater pro portion of participants treated with MK -7264 relative to placebo achieve a clinically meaningful improvement from baseline in HRQoL defined as a ≥1.3- point increase in the L CQ total score at Week 12. 4.2.1.2 Safety Endpoints The safet y data for MK -7264 to date has been described in detail in the MK -7264 IB. In support of the safet y objective to evaluate the safet y and tolerability profile of MK -7264, the safet y and tolerability endpoints will be assessed by clinical evaluation of AEs and inspection of other stud y parameters including vital signs, physical examination, and standard laboratory safety tests at timepoints specified in the SoA. Adverse events are graded and r ecorded according to Section 8.4 andAppendix 3 . 4.2.1.3 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints The relationship betw een MK -7264 plasma concentrations and cough frequencies/side effects will be explored. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses will be conducted to understand the exposure -response relationships between MK- 7264 and efficacy and safety data. 4.2.1.4 Pharmacodynamic Endpoints No pharmacod ynamic biomarkers that will require modeling are planned for this study. 4.2.1.5 Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research 4.2.1.5.1 Planned Genetic Analysis Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to therap y, susceptibility to, severit y, and progression of disease. Variable response to therap y ma y be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of t he disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and I RB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA anal ysis from consenting participants. DNA samples will be used for research related to the study intervention(s), the disease under study , and related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assay s including diagnostic tests related to the disease under study, related diseases, and study intervention(s). Genetic research may consist of the analy sis of 1 or more candidate genes or the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome [or anal ysis of the entire genome] (as appropriate). 0574PH"
36,page_36,"PRODUCT: MK-7264 36 PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:027-03 MK-7264 -027-03 FI NAL PROTOCOL 26-APR -2019 DNA samples will be analy zed for variation across the entire genome. Analy ses may be conducted if it is hy pothesized that this may help furthe r understand the clinical data. The samples may be analy zed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to understand study disease or related conditions. 4.2.1.6 Future Biomedical Research The Sponsor will conduct future biomedical resear ch on DNA spe cimens for which consent was pr ovided during this clinical study . Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere in the protocol (as part of the main study ) and will only be conducted on specimens from appropriatel y consented participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for future biomedical research is to explore and identify biomarkers that inform the scientific understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The ov erarching goal is to use such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that participants receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct time. The details of this future biomedical research substudy are presented in Appendix 6. 4.2.2 Rationale for t he Use of Comparator/Placebo A placebo is included in this study to maintain the study blinding, allowing for an unbiased assessment of efficacy and safet y. Participants may discontinue the stud y intervention at an y time. Given that there is no approved treatment for chronic cough, use of a placebo is justified. 4.3 Justification for Dose 4.3.1 Dose sfor This Study The dose for this stud y will be either MK -7264 15 mg BID or MK -7264 45 mg BID as determined b y the individual allocation per the assigned treatment g roup (see Section 6). The known mechanism of action of MK -7264 and related clinical study results support that the efficacy of MK -7264 in decreasing cough, and the prevalence of the most common AE, dysgeusia, are both dose related. In order to allow patients and prescribers appropriate flexibility based upon individual clinical needs, the MK -7264 development program has targeted 2 different doses to study in the Phase 3 program. 4.3.2 Maximum Dose/Exposure for This Study Themaximum dose/exposure for this study will be at 45 mg BID. Participants who a re administered MK-7264 (either 15 mg BID or 45 mg BID)will be exposed to MK -7264 for approximately 365 days (see Section 6 ). 0574PH"

Based on PK studies, MK- 7264 is rapidly absorbed with a median time to reach maximum plasma concentration of 1. 0 to 2.0 hours. I n addition, the half -life of MK -7264 is approximately 7 to 10 hours and consistent with a BID dosing schedule. For this study , 12 weeks duration of intervention for the Main study period was selected based on regulatory guidance regarding duration of therapy for s ymptomatic treatment in chronic diseases. The study includes an extension for a total duration of intervention of up to 1 y ear, in order to provide a more robust assessment of the longer -term safet y, tolerability and efficacy of MK-7264 in the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. 4.4 Beginning and End ofStudy Definition The overall study begins when the first participant signs the ICF. The overall study ends when the last participant completes the last study -related telephone -call or visit, withdraws from the study , or is lost to follow -up (ie, the participant is unable to be contacted b y the investigator). 4.4.1 Clinical Criteria f orEarly Study Termination Early study termination will be the result of the following specif ied criteri on: a.During the interim anal ysis, based on the interim data, if the futility criteria are met, then the study may be stopped for futility . 5 STUDY POPULATION This study will enroll male and f emale participants with chronic cough ≥1 year and a diagnosis of refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough according to the American College of Che st Phy sician (ACCP) guidelines [Irwin, R. S., et al 2006] . For the purposes of this study , refractory chronic cough is defined as participants who have had a clinical evaluation that suggested a co -morbid condition that may be associated with chronic cough (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], asthma, or upper airway cough syndrome [UACS] ), the partic ipant has received appropriate diagnostic work -up and at least 2 months of therap y,prior to Screening ,according to ACCP guidelines, and the participant continues to cough despite being on therap y. Also for the purposes of this study , unexplained chronic cough is defined as participants who have had a clinical evaluation of their cough per ACCP guidelines and this evaluation has not suggested a co -morbid condition that may be associated with chronic cough. Participants with refractory chronic cough or unex plained chronic cough and who are at least 18 years of age will be enrolled in this study . 0574PH"

Study intervention supplies will be collected at V isit13 or Discontinuation . 8.1.9.1 Timing of Dose Administration Study intervention will be administered orally , BID, approximately 12 hours apart for approximately 84 day s (12 weeks) during the Main study period and then administered orally , BID, approximately 12 hours apart for approximately anothe r 40 weeks during the Extension study period. 8.1.10 Discontinuation and Withdrawal Participants who discontinue study intervention prior to completion of the study should be encouraged to continue to be followed for all remaining stud y visits. When a participant withdraws from participation in the study , all applicable activities scheduled for the discontinuation/early withdrawal study visit as described in Section 1.3 should be performed (at the time of withdrawal). Any AEs that are present at the time of withdr awal should be followed in accordance with the safet y requirements outlined in Section 8.4. 8.1.10.1 Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical research. Participants may withdraw consent at an y time by contacting the principal investigator for the main study . If medical records for the main study are still available, the investigator will contact the 0574PH"

Subsequently ,the particip ant's consent for future biomedical r esearch will be withdrawn. A letter will be sent from the Sponsor to the investigator confirming the withdrawal. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the participant of completion of withdrawal. An y analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal or alread y performed prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research study data and results. No new analys es would be generated after the r equest is received. In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the investigator is no longer required b y regulatory authorities to retain the main study records) or the specimens have been completel y anon ymized, there will no longer be a link between the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for specimen withdrawal cannot be processed. 8.1.11 Participant Blinding/Unblindi ng STUDY INTERVENT ION IDENT IFICATION INFORMAT ION IS TO BE UNMASKED ONLY IF NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PARTICIPANT. EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE NOT TO UNBLIND THE PARTI CIPANT UNLESS NECESSARY. For emergency situations where the investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) needs to identify the study intervention used b y a participant and /or the dosage administered , he/she will contact the emergency unblinding call center b y telephone and make a request for em ergency unblinding. As requested b y the investigator or medically qualified designee, the emergency unblinding call center will provide the information to him/her promptly and report unblinding to the Sponsor. Prior to contacting the emergency unblinding call center to request unblinding of a participant’s intervention assignment, the investigator who is a qualified physician should make reasonable attempts to enter the intensit yof the AEs observed, the relation to study intervention, the reason thereof , etc., in the medical chart. If it is not possible to record this assessment in the chart prior to the unblinding, the unblinding should not be delayed. In the event that unblinding has occurred, the circumstances around the unblinding (eg, date, reason, and person performing the unblinding) must be documented promptly , and the Sponsor Clinical Director notified as soon as possible. Once an emergency unblinding has taken place, the principal investigator, site personnel, and Sponsor personnel may be unblinded so that the appropriate follow -up medical care can be provided to the participant . Participants whose trea tment assignment has been unblinded by the investigator or medicall y qualified designee and/or nonstudy treating ph ysician must be discontinued from study intervention, but should continue to be monitored in the study. Additionally , the investigator or medically qualified designee must go into the I RT sy stem and perform the unblind in the I RT sy stem to update drug disposition. In the event that the 0574PH"

In the instance of identify ing MK-7264 crystalsin the urine , the participant will be discontinue d from the study intervention (see Section 8.3.7 for further details) . If a participant has confirmed MK -7264 cry stals, it will be known that the participant was receiving MK- 7264, but not which dose . In this circumstance, formal non- emergency unblinding should not be performed . 8.1.12 Calibration of Equipme nt The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clini cal study that provides information about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained is reliable and/or reproducible. Documentation of equipment calibrat ion must be retained as source documentation at the study site. 8.2 Efficacy Assessmen ts Compliance with the efficacy and safety assessments (along with study intervention use) is essential, and an y non -compliance noted b y the investigator or designee should r esult in consultation with the participant on corrective measures needed to ensure compliance. 8.2.1 Objective Cough Counts The assessment of 24 -hour coughs per hour (ie, average hou rly cough frequency based on 24-hour sound recordings) will be evaluated using t he VitaloJAK™ cough monitor , a 510k approved device (Premarket Notification per the US Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act) that has been implemented successfully in clinical studies of potential cough therapies, including 2Phase 2 studies of MK- 7264. The VitaloJ AK™ cough monitor is a digital recording device that uses 2 input channels: biometric sensor and air microphone. The first records sounds from the lungs and trachea through a chest contact biometric sensor, which is attached to the skin at the top of the sternum. The second channel captures ambient sounds through a lapel air microphone. The device will be carried in a cloth belt bag worn around the participants’ waist, and all sounds the participant makes during cough monitoring will be recorded o n the compact flash (CF) card. T he CF card contains the full, raw, sound recording data that is the output from the validated cough monitor and is the source for the recording data. The sound recordings on the CF cards are uploaded to the Vitalograph Web Portal for storage and anal ysis to generate cough data per Vitalograph standard operating procedures , and the Web Portal is the so urce for the cough counts data. Sites will be uploading the CF card recordings to the Vitalograph Web Portal; however, if after troubleshooting the sites are unsuccessful, the site will securel y ship the CF card to 0574PH"
57,page_57,"PRODUCT: MK-7264 57 PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:027-03 MK-7264 -027-03 FI NAL PROTOCOL 26-APR -2019 Vitalograph for uploading. Long -term storage of the CF cards may be done by Vitalograph for those sites unable to provide long -term storage of the cards. When the digital recording arrives at the central reading center, a human analyst uses standardized criteria to identify transitions between awake and a sleep states. To reduce review time, the 24- hour recordings are processed through a computerized algorithm that removes periods of silence and a high proportion of non -cough sounds. A cough anal yst then evaluates the abbreviated recording b y listening to b oth audio channels and inspecting the visual wave form of potential cough sounds. The anal yst tags the explosive portion of each cough using software built for anal ysis and annotation of sound recordings (Vitalograph Web Portal). Cough counts are then tall ied automatically for the 24- hour period from the annotated audio file. Awake cough counts are tallied only during the time the participant is determined to be awake for the awake coughs per hour assessment. The cough monitor will be attached to the parti cipant at Visit 2 and the day before for Visits 4-6and Discontinuation during the Main study period (see Section 1.3). Attachment should occur before approximately 11 AM and the cough monitor should be worn for 24 hours (see VitaloJAK™ site manual for further details). The participant should not remove the cough monitor during the 24 -hour period; the monitor will be removed during the actual visit, at the clinic, by site staff the next day . The f irst dose of study intervention administered is at V isit 3 after the cough monitor is removed, after the pre -dose PK sample collection, and before approximately 11AM. Attachment of the cough monitor may be managed by study site staff or mobile nurses if available and approve d.On the day of a study site visit after Visit 3 (or mobile nurse visit where applicable) when the cough monitor will be attached, study intervention dosing should occur prior to the cough monitor being turned on. Therefore, the cough monitor should first be attached, the participant should then be dosed, and then the cough monitor should immediately be turned on (see Figure 2).

On the day of a study site visit when the cough monitor will be removed, the morning dose should not be taken at home and instead will be given as a wi tnessed dose at the study site. Therefore, dosing will occur after the cough monitor is removed (once 24- hour reco rding has completed) , after the pre -dose PK sample collection, and before approximately 11 AM (see Figure 3). PK=Pharmacokinetic; V =Visit . Figure 3 C ough Monitoring: Removal Procedure It is recommended that the monitor first be removed (once the 24 -hour recording has completed) to avoid an y interference. Pre -dose PK should then be collected, prior to study intervention dosing . All visits, where the cough monitor will be attached/removed, should be scheduled prior to 11 AM to meet the attachment/removal timeframes, as well as the PK sample collection(s), and study site dosing requirements. If cough data is not usable and patient is required to return to the clinic to repeat , it should only be repeated upon Sponsor approval . Participants who discontinue study interven tionearly will continue to be monitored in the study and should be encouraged to continue to complete the assessment of 24 -hour coughs per hour for the remaining visits (as outlined in the SoA) through the end of the study. 8.2.2 Electronic Patient -reported Out comes At Screening (Visit 1), each participant will be properly trained and instructed on the use of an electronic diary (eDiary ) for completing the ePRO measures. Participants should bring their eDiary device for all study visits, and should be contacted and reminded to do so (eg, b y telephone or text) before each stud y site visit. 0574PH"

Each investigator site will contact individual participants who are non -compl iant in order to retrain and/or remind them to complete their assessments as per Section 1.3 (SoA). Participants will be instructed to complete dail y ePRO measures (CSD and Cough Severit y VAS) at approximately the same time in the evening as outlined in the SoA .If a participant fails to complete the CSD and/ or Cough Severit y VAS ePRO measure (s), the eDiary will allow the participant, based on recall, to complete measures at an y time in the next 24 hours (also see vendor’s site manual for further details). Participants will also be asked to complete visit e PRO measures ( Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire [ HARQ ], LCQ, SF- 12, EQ5D 5L, WPAI and/or PGIC) on the day of the visits as outlined in the SoA (also see vendor’s site manual for further details). If a parti cipant fails to complete the HARQ, LCQ, SF -12, EQ5D 5L, WPAI and/or PGIC ePRO measure(s), the eDiary will allow the participant, based on recall, to complete these measures at an y time in the next 48 hours. I f these visit PROs are not completed, based on r ecall, within the 48 hours, participants may be asked to complete them at a later date . All Visit 2 e PRO measures MUST be activated and completed prior to thefirst dose of study intervention /Randomization (see vendor’s site manual for further details). Electronic PRO measures must be activated as outlined in the SoA. Visit8, Visit 11, V isit 13, and the Discontinuation Visit ePROs are “activated” b y entering actual visit/event dates in the vendor portal ( Engage ). All other visit ePROs are activated at the clinic visit using the site menu on the device or remotel y using a PIN if the participant forgets to bring the device to the clinic visit. Participants who discontinue study intervention early will continue to be monitored in the study and should be enco uraged to continue to complete the e PRO measures (along with the assessment of 24 -hour coughs per hour) for the remaining visits (as outlined in the SoA) through the end of the study . Data collection for all ePRO measures will be dependent on ePRO device and software availability. 8.2.2.1 Cough Severity Diary Participants will be asked to record their cough frequency, intensit y, and disruption due to cough using the 7 item CSD. Participants will rate each item using an 11 -point sc ale ranging from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating greater severit y. Participants will complete the CSD at approximately the same time daily,beginning at Visit 1until Visit 9 (with a minimum requirement of 7 days of completion prior to first dose of study intervention/R andomization ). During the Extension study period, completion of the CSD will be required daily , at approximately the same time for a 1 week period, beginning 1 week prior to Visit 11 and beginning 1 week prior to Visit 13. Participants should be contacted (eg, by telephone or 0574PH"

Participants will complete the Cough Severit y VAS at approximately the same time daily , beginning at Visit 1 unt il Visit 9 (with a minimum requirement of 7 day s of completion prior to first dose of stud yintervention/R andomization ). In order to confirm participant eligibility, stud y site staff will be required to review/confirm the: Participant met the Screening Cou gh Severit y VAS criteria from the measurement done on the day of Visit 1 (or from the next day ,if the evening measure was missed). Participant met the Baseline Cough Severity VAS criteria from the measurement done on the day prior to Visit 2 ,prior to con ducting an y other Visit 2 procedures (or from the morning of Visit 2 ,prior to conducting any Visit 2 procedures , if the evening measure was missed). A score of ≥40 mm on the Cough Severity VAS, at both the Screening and Baseline visits is required for randomization into the study . During the Extension study period, completion of the Cough Severity VAS will be required daily , at approximately the same time for a 1 week period, beginning 1 week prior to Visit 11 and beginning 1 week prior to Visit 13. Participants should be contacted (eg, by telephone or text) during the Extension study period to remind them to complete the Cough Severity VAS during these weeks. 8.2.2.3 Leicester Cough Questionnaire Participants will be asked to complete the 19- item L CQ to assess the impact of their cough severit y on ph ysical, social and ps ychological functioning. 8.2.2.4 12-item Short Form Survey The SF -12 is a validated, 1 2-item questionnaire designed to assess general health- related quality of life. It is a widely used instrument that has been shown to be responsive to changes in disease severity following intervention. The SF -12 is scored such that a total score and 8domain scores can be calculated with higher scores indicating better func tioning: Phy sical Functioning, Role Ph ysical, Role -Emotional, Bodily Pain, General Health, Social Functioning, Mental Health, and Vitality . Data obtained from the SF -12 will be used in health economic anal yses. 0574PH"

The WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, ie, worse outcomes. Participants will be asked to indicate if they are currentl y empl oyed and to respond to the following questions referring to “the past 7 days”: work hours missed due to health problems, work hours missed for other reasons, hours actually worked, the degree to which their health has affected productivity while working, a nd the degree to which their health affected productivity in regular unpaid activities. 8.2.2.6 EuroQo L5L Dimensions Questionnaire The EQ5D -5L is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status used for estimating preference weights for that health status. By combining the weight with time, quality adjusted life years can be computed. The EQ5D -5L descriptive s ystem comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression. Each dimension has 5 levels and the participant will be asked to indicate their health state using a 5- level rating scale. The EQ VAS records the participant’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS where the endpoints are labeled ‘best imaginable health state’ and “worst imaginable health state”. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual participant. 8.2.2.7 Patient Global Impression of Change Questionnaire Participants will be asked to rate the change in their chronic cough compared to the start of the study using the PGIC with response options ranging from “very much improved” to “ very much worse”. 8.2.2.8 Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire Unlike the other cough questionnaires used in this study (ie, LCQ, CSD, and Cough Severit y VAS), HARQ was designed as an aid to diagnosis rather than assess quality of life impacts or cough severit y. The HARQ has demonstrated good psychometric properties and no redundant items. The HARQ consists of 14 questions with responses on a numeric scale from 0to 5. A score of ‘‘0’’ means that no problems are caused b y the cough s ymptom and ‘‘5’’ means severe/frequent problems. The HARQ will be used to more completely characterize the patient population. 0574PH"

The total amount of blood/tissue to be drawn/collected over the course of the study (from prestud y to poststudy visits), including approximate blood/tissue volumes drawn/collected b y visit and by sample ty pe per particip ant, can be found in Section 8. Planned timepoints for all safet y assessments are provided in the SoA. 8.3.1 Chest Radiography/Computed Tomography Thorax Scan A chest radiograph or computer tomograph y scan of the thorax should be performed locall y for participants, at Screening, if this has not been done within the last 5 years and after the onset of chronic cough. The chest radiograph or computer tomograph y scan of the thorax should not demonstrate any abnormality considered to be significantly contributing to the chronic cough or an y other clinicall y significant lung disease in the opinion of the principal investigator (or sub investigator, see inclusion criterion 1, Section 5.1 ). 8.3.2 Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination will include assessments of the following: general appearance; skin and ly mphatic; ey es, ears, nose, throat; cardiovascular s ystem; respiratory system; abdomen/gastrointestinal sy stem; urological sy stem; musculoskeletal and neurological s ystems. Other body systems may be examined. Any clinically significant abnormalities in phy sical examinations noted after Visit 1 will be recorded as AEs in the eCRF . A brief directed ph ysical exam may be performed at any study site visit th at does not alread y include a ph ysical exam if deemed necessary by the investigator due to signs/sy mptoms. A physical exam (complete or directed) can be performed at an y unscheduled visit if deemed necessary by the investigator. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 8.3.3 Vital Signs and Weight and Height Measur ements Vital sign measurements, including s ystolic blood pressure (mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), heart rate (beats per minute), r espiratory rate (breaths per minute), and body temperature (in centigrade) will be collected as outlined in the SoA. All blood pressure measurements should be performed on the same arm, preferabl y by the same person. Height (cm) and weight (kg) will also b e collected as per the SoA .

Clinically signif icant abnormal findings should be recorded in the AE eCRF. 8.3.5 Spirometry A spirometry assessment will be performed locally at Screening using a calibrated spirometer. Assessments will include FEV 1, FVC ,and FEV 1/FVC ratio. Spirometry should be performed in ac cordance with guidelines established by the ATS/ERS (Available from: http://www.thoracic.org/statements/). For safet y reasons, spirometry should be performed with the participant sitting, using a chair with arms and without wheels; however, if necessary toundertake the testing with the participant standing or in another position, this should be noted in the participant’s study file. Spirometry performed within the past y ear of Screening is acceptable if the investigator confirms that spirometry was done du ring a period where the participant was clinically stable (eg, not during an upper respiratory infection). 8.3.6 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments •Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing an d frequency . •The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record an y clinically relevant changes occurring during the stud y in the AE section of the case report form (CRF).

Participants will be monitored for hematuria using urinary dipstick (performed at the stud y site) and urinary crystals and hematuria through urinaly sis (performed at the central laboratory ).Dipstick and urinaly ses (including microscop y) will be collected as outlined in the SoA. Ifduring screening ,a participant has cry stalluria and/or unexplained hematuria (defined as , for example ,participants without a history of recent menses, urinary tract infection, or recent procedure/ins trumentation that would explain the hematuria ; Note: any other explanation for hematuria finding must be reviewed with the Sponsor. ), the investigator should : Review and confirm if the finding is a new finding or a previousl y documented finding . Evaluate the participant’s medical history to identify conditions (ie,prior renal disease, prior history of kidney stones, medications, gastrointestinal conditions) and make a clinical determination if the participant is at high or low risk of potential complications/worsening due to an associated renal/urinary condition or its treatment, or requires a change in therap y for that condition that may interfere with interpretation of safet y data collected during the study . If high risk, the participant should notbe enrolled and should be considered for further evaluation. If low risk, the participant may continue with screening. If after randomization , the participant has confirmed, unexplained hematuria and/or urinary crystals per the central laboratory , an additional urine sample will need to be collected. One half of the sample will be sent to the central lab oratory for reconfirmation of unexplained hematuria and/or urin ary crystals. The other half of the sample will be collected via a specialized filter and shipped to Sponsor or designee and assessed for the presence of MK-7264 urinary crystals via Raman spectroscopy . Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to the chemical struc ture of the molecule and MK -7264 has a unique chemical structure compared to common urinary crystals. See vendor’s site manual for further procedural details. If a participant ha sconfirmed MK -7264 urinary crystals, the Sponsor will inform the investigator and require discontinuation of the participant from study intervention with the recommendation to follow -up at approximately 2-week intervals with additional specialized urine anal yses performed until resolution of the MK -7264 urinary crystals. Once a par ticipant has confirmed MK -7264 cry stals, it will be known that the participant was receiving MK-7264 (formal unblinding should not be performed [see Section 8.1.11]). 0574PH"

Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legall y authorized representative). The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detectin g, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safet y events. Investigators remain responsible for following up AE, SAEs, and other reportable safety events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3 . The investigator, who is a qualified ph ysician, will assess events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safet y events with respect to seriousness, intensity /toxicity and causality . 8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE , SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/randomization must be reported b y the investigator if the participant is rece iving placebo run -in or other run -in treatment, if the event cause the participant to be excluded from the study , or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therap y, diet, or a pr ocedure. From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through last stud y-related intervention safet y follow -up telephone call, all AEs, SAEs and other reportable safet y events must be reported b y the investigator; however, for those participants who discontinue from the stud y intervention but continue to be monitored, only the AEs and other reportable safet y events that are shown in Table 3need to be reported. This specific approach for reporting starts from completion of the safet y follow -up telephone call/visit following cessation of intervention until the last study -related off -intervention telephone call/visit. Additionally , any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at an y time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph must be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the event is considered drug -related. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE or other reportable sa fety events in former stud y participants.

Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE, SAE, and other reportable safety events including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, events of clinical interest (ECI), cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the partici pant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). In addition, the investigator will make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in randomized participants for outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3. 8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation are met. The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation. All AEs will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs, and investigators in accordance 0574PH"

Investigato r safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR s) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it along with the I Band will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements . 8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeed ing Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, an y pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously reported to the investigator or their designee) that occurs during the stud y are r eportable to the Sponsor. All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy . Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign h ydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, misca rriage, and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 8.4.6 Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AEs or SAEs There are no disease -related events and/or disease -related outcomes not qualify ing as AEs or SAEs. 8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest (ECI s) Selected nonserious and SAEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the Sponsor. Events of clinical interest for this study include: a.An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* *Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. T he purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underl ying etiology.

Study intervention should be taken once in the morning and once in the evening. If more than the protocol -specified intervention is taken within a 1- dayperiod (ie , >2tablets/day from either bottle )this is regarded as an overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose . Oral doses of u p to 1800 mg BID for 14 days were explored in earlier clinical studies without any untoward clinical effects (see MK -7264 IB). Overdose should be treated according to the participant’s clinical signs and s ymptoms . Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Sponsor Clinical Director based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 8.6 Pharmacokinetics The date and time for the last dose of study intervention taken prior to the study visit on which the PK sample was collected should be recorded in the eCRF. In addition, the date and time of the PK sample collection should also be recorded in the eCRF. 8.6.1 Blood Collection for Plasma MK -7264 Blood s ample swill be collected at several visits during th e stud y for determination of MK-7264 as outlined in the SoA. Samples will be collected pre -dose at the specified study site visits (ie, the morning dose of study intervention will be taken after the PK sample is collected). Onl y at Visit 3, there will be 2 PK sample collections: 1at pre -dose and the other at 2hours (±30minutes) post-dose. Scheduled PK sample collections for all other visits, as outlined in the SoA, will be predose onl y. There will not be any dosing at Visit 13, but PK sample collection will be done. MK-7264 plasma concentrations will be determined using a validated LC -MS/MS assay .

If an y participant fails to meet the study entry criteria, screen ing procedures may be repeated once based on investigator judgment after initial screening, and after consultation with the Sponsor. However, participants will not be permitted to rescreen if inclusion criteria for the Cough Se verity VAS was not met at Visit1. Participants who are consented and then are considered for washout of prohibited therap y (see Section 6.5) , should complete the washout prior to completing other screening procedures. For these individuals, t he screening period would begin after the completion of washout and when the participant returns to the clinic. Participants who washout of 0574PH"

Participant s who are consented may ,at the i nvestigator’s discretion, consider beginning the completion of daily ePROs (CSD and VAS) on the day of Visit 1prior to completing other screening procedures (in order to first determine if the participant meets the Visit 1 VAS entry criterion). For participants who meet the Visit 1 VAS criterion, t he screening period is noted as starting when the participant has provided consent. Participants who meet the Visit 1 VAS inclusion criterion should return to the clinic as soon as possible (within the recommended scheduling windows) after availability of the Visit 1 VAS score to complete the remaining Visit 1 procedures. 8.10.2 Baseline The Baseline visit must be scheduled between 7 day s and approximately 14 day s after Screening. Blood for PK assessments will be collected during Visit 2, and should be collected before attachment of the cough monitor (to avoid interference) as cough assessments will begin at Visit 2. The cou gh monitor should be attached before approximately 11AM and worn for 24hours. 8.10.3 Main Study Period Participants will be required to be seen in the clinic at Visit 3 to have the cough monitor removed that was attached at Visit 2. Additionally , 1day prior to Visits 4, 5, 6, and Discontinuation (from the Main study period) participants should return to the clinic to have the cough monitor attached. Attachment of the cough monitor at these visits, may be managed b y stud y site staff or mobile nurses (if locally available and approved for use), who will attach the cough monitor at the home of the participant. Cough monitors will be removed at study site Visits 4, 5, 6, and Discontinuation (from the Main study period). Refer to the vendor’s site manual for additional details. For all stud y site visits, participants are to be reminded to bring their eDiary device with them to the visit. 8.10.4 Extension Study Period Participants will continue their assigned treatments during the 40 -week Extension study period. Cough counts will not be collected during this period. Electronic PRO measures will continue to be completed as outlined in the SoA . 8.10.5 Discontinued Participants Continuing to be Monitored in the Study If a participant is discontinued from the stud y intervent ionearly, the Discontinuation Visit assessments are to be performed at the final study site visit. 0574PH"

Thus, participants who discontinue from study intervention prior to completion of the study should continue to be monitored to obtain relevant information through the end of the study . Study site visits/ telephone calls shou ld be made at timepoints that correspond to each remaining study visit. Such contacts will allow collection of follow -up information, limited to AEs, concomitant medication use, objective cough counting and eDiary assessments as outlined in the SoA (Sectio n 1.3). Concomitant therapies specifically prohibited (see Section 6.5) while the patient was on study intervention are no longer prohibited after discontinuation of study intervention. For these participants who have discontinued study intervention early, sites will be instructed to exert diligent efforts to continue to contact them. To enable sites to reach participants, the participants should provide primary and secondary contact information (eg, home telephone, work telephone, mobile tele phone). Sites must document the outcome of the telephone contact(s), to demonstrate diligent efforts have been made. If a participant does not agree to be contacted for follow -up for each of the remaining visits (as described in Section 7.1), the participant should be encouraged to accept a telephone contact at least at the final visit date (at the end of Main study period if they discontinue intervention during the Main study or at the end of the Extension study period if they discontinue intervention during the Extens ion). Additionally , the ICF will explain the importance of continued data collection from participants, including the use of continued contact by tele phone. 8.10.6 Posts tudy All participants will be required to complete the safety follow -up telephone call approx imately 14 day s (+ 7 day s) after the last dose of study intervention to determine if an y AEs have occurred since discontinuing study intervention . If the safet yfollow -up telephone contact occurs less than 14 days after the last dose of study intervention, a subsequent follow- up tele phone call should be made at approximately 14days (+ 7 day s) post the last dose of study intervention . 9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. If, after t he study has begun, but prior to any unblinding, there are changes made to the primary and/or key secondary hypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those h ypotheses, then the protocol will be amended (consistent with I CH Guidance for Industry E9). Chan ges to exploratory or other non -confirmatory anal yses made after the protocol has been finalized, but prior to unblinding, will be documented in a supplemental Statistical Analysis Plan (sSAP) and referenced in the CSR for the study . Post -hoc explora tory anal yses will be clearl y identified in the CSR. Separate anal ysis plans (ie, separate documents from the sSAP) will be developed to detail other planned anal yses including those specific to the analy sis of PK data and e PROs. 0574PH"

The comprehensive plan is provided in Sections 9.2 t hrough 9.12. Study Design OverviewA Phase 3, Randomized, Doubl e-blind, Placebo-c ontrolled, 12-m onth Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of MK -7264 in Adult Participants with Chronic Cough (PN027) Treatment AssignmentParticipants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups: MK -7264 45 mg BID, MK -7264 15 mg BID, or placebo. Analysis PopulationsEffic acy: Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) population which consists of all randomized participants who have taken at least 1dose of study intervention and have at least 1 Baseline and at least 1post-Baseline endpoint observation during the treatment period; and Per -protocol (PP) population which excludes participants due to important deviations from the protocol from the FAS population. Safety : All Participants as Treated (APaT) population ,which consists of all randomized participants who received at least 1dose of study intervention . Primary Endpoint 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 Statistical Methods for Key Efficacy AnalysesThe primary anal ysis will be based on the FAS population. The primary anal ysis approach will be conducted utilizing the longitudinal analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. I n this model, the response vector consists of the change from baseline in log-transformed 24 -hour coughs per hour at each post -Baseline visit. The model will include factors for treatment group , visit, the interaction of treatment group by visit, gender, and region; and the log-transformed baseline v alue and the interaction of log-transformed baseline value by visit as covariates. The model will use all available 24 -hour coughs per hour data at baseline and on Week 4, 8 and 12. Contrasts will be constructed to compare each of the 2 MK-7264 treatment groups to the placebo group at each post-Baseline visit. The least squares mean change from baseline (in log scale) with the associated standard errors will be displayed for each treatment group. Estimated treatment differences (MK -7264 − placebo) along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will also be presented for each MK -7264 treatment group. In addition, the geometric mean of the 24 -hour coughs per hour will be presented b y treatment group and by visit. The percent difference in the change from baseline between MK -7264 and placebo will be estimated by 100*(ediff-1), where diff is the difference provided b y the anal ysis of the log transformed variable. 0574PH"

The tiers differ with respect to the anal yses that will be performed. Tier 1 safet y endpoints will be subject to inferential testing for statistical signi ficance with p- values and 95% CIs provided for between -group comparisons. Tier 2 safety endpoints will be evaluated via point estimates and 95% CIs for between -group comparisons. Tier 3 safet y endpoints will be evaluated via point estimates only. Interim Analyses One planned interim efficacy anal ysis will be performed in this study . Results will be reviewed b y an external DMC. The interim analysis is summarized below. Details are provided in Section 9.7. Timing: To be performed when approximately 40% of participants have either completed, or discontinued prior to completion of the Main study period. Testing: Futility anal ysis based on the primary endpoint of 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 will be provided. Additional interim safety reviews will also b e conducted at regular intervals. Multiplicity The T ype-I error rate over the multiple treatment group comparisons and multiple endpoints will be controlled by a step down testing procedure in a pre -specified order (det ails are described in Section 9.8). Sample Size and Power CalculationsThe planned sample size is 720 participants. For the primary endpoint of 24 -hour coughs per hour at Week 12, the study has at least 90% power to detect 20% and 30% relative reductions (versus placebo) for the MK -7264 15 mg BID or MK -7264 45 mg BID, respectivel y, at an overall 2 -sided 0.0499 alpha level. The det ails are described in Section 9.9. 9.2 Responsibility for Analyses/In -house Blinding The statistical anal ysis of the data obtained from this study will be the respons ibility of the Sponsor. This study (both the Main study period and the Extension study period) will be conducted as a double -blind study under in -house blinding procedures. At the end of the Main study period, a cop y of the database will be locked after me dical/scientific review has been completed, and data have been declared final and complete .The stud y team will be unblinded in order to perform and review the full anal ysis of data from the Main study period, as well as author a CSR for regulatory submiss ion. A separate, blinded Sponsor team (ie, blinded to participant -level intervention assignment) will then be assigned to continue the conduct of the Extension study period. All personnel who are unblinded for the Main study period will be excluded from an y future data review at the individual participant level. 0574PH"

The investigator site personnel and the participants will be blinded to intervention assignment until the entire study completion. The Clinical Biostatistics department will generate the randomized allocation schedule(s) for study intervention assignment. Unblinding for Interim Efficacy and Safety Analyses Planned interim anal yses are described in Section 9.7. Study enrollment is likely to be ongoing at the time of any interim analy ses. Blinding to intervention assignment will be maintained at all investigational sites. The results of interim anal yses will not be shared with the investigators prior to the completion of the study. Results of the interim efficacy and safet y analyses will be provided by the external unblinded statistician to the DMC. Limited additional Sponsor personnel may be unblinded to the treatment -level results of the interim anal yses, if required, in order to act on the recommendations of the DMC. The extent to which individuals are unblinded with respect to results of interim anal yses will be documented b y the unblinded statistician. The DMC will serve as the primary reviewer of the results of the interim efficacy and safety analyses and will make recommendations for discontinuation of the study or modification to an EOC of the Sponsor. If the DMC recommends modifications to the design of the protocol or discontinuation of the study , the EOC may be unblinded to the results at the treatment -level in order to act on these recommendations. Additional logistical details will be provided in t he DMC Charter. Key aspects of the interim an alyses are described in Section 9.7. The external unblinded statistician will not be involved in any discussions regarding modifications to the protocol, statistical methods, identification of protocol deviation s, or data validation efforts after the interim anal yses. 9.3 Hypotheses/Estimation The primary and secondary hypotheses for this stud y are stated in Section 3. 9.4 Analysis Endpoints Efficacy and safety endpoints for evaluation are listed below, followed b y the descriptions of the derivations of selected endpoints. 9.4.1 Efficacy Endpoints Primary Efficacy Endpoint 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 0574PH"

Data Handling Rules for Cough Data In general, each 24- hour session starts with awake status and is composed of an awake monitoring period and a sleep monitoring period. If a participant did not have a sleep time available before the end of the recording sessio n, it will be considered that the participant was awake during the entire session. The last monitoring period of a session will be censored after the end time of the session. The cough data will contain all cough events occurring during that 24- hour monito ring period as well as the information about “sleep time” and “awake time”. Any session with a duration of recording <20 hours will be considered as missing. If a session has a duration less than 24 hours but no less than 20 hours, the 24- hour coughs per h our will be based on the actual duration of the session. 0574PH"

The variable of change from baseline in log -transformed 24 -hour coughs per hour will be used in the anal ysis of the p rimary endpoint. For each post -Baseline visit, the primary efficacy variable of anal ysis is defined as f ollows: Change from baseline in log -transformed 24 -hour coughs per hour = Log (24 -hour coughs per hour at post -Baseline visit) –Log (24 -hour coughs per hour at Baseline ) The primary anal ysis of the primary endpoint will be on the natural log scale of the cough rate data. Awake Coughs per Hour Awake is time between waking up and sleep during the 24 -hour monitoring period. The awake coughs per hour are defined as follows: Awake coughs per hour =Total number of cough events during the monitoring period (24-hour interval) the participant is awake/Total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period the participant is awake. Similar to the primary efficacy variable, change from baseline in log -transformed awake coughs per hour will be used in the anal ysis and defi ned as below: Change from baseline in log -transformed awake coughs per hour = Log (Awake coughs per hour at post -Baseline visit) –Log (Awake coughs per hour at baseline). 0574PH"

Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy data, regardless of participant exposure to study intervention , will be included in efficacy analy ses. Primary Efficacy Analysis Cough monitoring is conducted for baseline and 24 hours after administration of the study intervention on Weeks 4, 8, and 12. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is 24 -hour coughs per hour at Week 12. As the change from baseline in 24 -hour coughs per hour may have a skewed and wide distribution, the data will be log -transformed prior to analy sis for the primary approach. The primary anal ysis of the primary endpoint will b e on the natural log scale of the cough rate data. The variable of change from baseline in log -transformed 24- hour coughs per hour will be used in the anal ysis of the primary endpoint. A negative result indicates a decrease in cough rate, while a positive result indicates an increase in cough rate.

As the change in awake coughs per hour may have a skewed and wide distribution, the data will be log -transformed (natural log) prior t o analy sis. The variable of change from baseline in log transformed awake coughs per hour will be used in the anal ysis. Responder endpoints will be anal yzed by the logistic regression model. The logistic regression model will include terms for treatment group, visit, the interaction of treatment group by visit, gender, region, baseline, and the interaction of baseline b y visit for the underlying continuous response.

Handling of Missing Data The missing data approach is specified in the above mentioned primary and secondary efficacy endpoints analy sis sections. All other analy ses will be conducted based on the observed data only . Additional sensitivity analy ses with respect to the handling of mi ssing data will be specified in the sSAP. 9.6.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses The safet y endpoints will be anal yzed based on the data collected in the Main study period, as well as based on the cumulative data collected across both the Main and Extension study periods. Safety and tolerability will be assessed b y clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs. The anal ysis of safet y results will follow a tiered approach ( Table 5). The tiers differ with respect to the anal yses that will be performed. Tier 1 safet y endpoints will be subject to inferential testing for statistical significance with p -values and 95% CI s provided for between -group comparisons. Tier 2 safety endpoints will be evaluated via point estimates and 95% CIs for between -group comparisons. Tier 3 safet y endpoints will be evaluated via point estimates only . Taste -related AEs (including d ysgeusia, ageu sia, and hy pogeusia, as well as other related terms) will be classified as belonging to “Tier 1”. The unadjusted p -values and point estimates with 95% CI s from the pairwise comparison between each of MK -7264 dose versus placebo will be provided. The defini tion of taste -related AEs will be finalized and documented before the database lock of the Main study period. The frequency of taste -related AEs across pre -defined time intervals will be provided, where the time intervals will be defined as: >0 to ≤1 week , >1 to ≤4 weeks, >4 to ≤8 weeks, and >8to ≤12 weeks in Main study period; and >12 to ≤24 weeks, >24 to ≤38 weeks, and >38to≤52 weeks in Extension study period. In each time interval, the denominator for calculation of percentage will be the number of participants exposed at the beginning of the time interval and the numerator will be the number of participants with at least 1taste-related AE occurring in this time interval. Only the first event will be counted and all recurrent events will not be inclu ded. The broad clinical and laboratory AE categories consisting of the percentage of participants with any AE, a drug related AE, a serious AE, an AE which is both drug- related and serious, an oral paresthesia AE, an oral hypoesthesia AE, and who discontin ued due to an AE will be classified as belonging to “Tier 2”. 0574PH"

Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 4 participants in an y treatment group exhibit the event; all other adverse experiences and predefined limits of change will belong to Tier 3. The threshold of at least 4 events was chosen because the 95% CI for the between -group difference in percent incidence will alway s include zero when treatment groups of equal size each have less than 4 events and thus would add little to the interpretation of potentially meaningful diffe rences. Because man y 95% CIs may be provided without adjustment for multiplicity , the CIs should be regarded as a helpful descriptive measure to be used in review, not a formal method for assessing the statistical significance of the between -group differen ces in adverse experiences and predefined limits of change. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 safety endpoints will be analy zed using t he Miettinen & Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] .

(MSD) Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials I. Introduction A.Purpose MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant s inclinical trials is the overriding concern in the design of clinical trials . In all cases, M SD clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations (eg, International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice [ICH - GCP]) and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. B.Scope Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator- initiated trials , which are not under the full control of M SD. II.Scientific Issues A.Trial Conduct 1.Trial Design Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of M SD or comparator products. Alternatively, M SDmay conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine patient preferences, etc. The design (ie, participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial. P articipants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 2.Site Selection MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by M SD personnel to assess the ability to success fully conduct the trial. 3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity Investigative t rial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completene ss, and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per M SD policies and procedures, if fraud, scientific/research misc onduct, or serious GCP -noncompliance is suspected, the issues 0574PH"
90,page_90,"PRODUCT: MK-7264 90 PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:027-03 MK-7264 -027-03 FI NAL PROTOCOL 26-APR -2019 areinvestigated . When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified . B. Publication and Authorship Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish primary and secondary results of its registered trials of marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the prespecified plans for data analysis. To the extent scientifically appropriate, MSDseeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing , in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity. MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the re commendations published by the International Committee of Medica l Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. M SD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications. III.Participant Protection A. Ethics Committee Review (Institutiona lReview Board [IRB ]/Independent Ethics Committee [ IEC]) All clinical trials will be reviewed an d approved by an IRB/IEC before being initiated at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the ethics committee prior to implementation, except changes required urgently to protect participant safety that may be enac ted in anticipation of ethics committee approval. For each site, the ethics committee and M SDwill approve the participant informed consent form. B. Safety The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local stand ard of care. All participation in M SD clinical tria ls is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is obtained . Participants may withdraw from a n MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them. C. Confidentiality MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or representative), ethics committee, and/or regulatory authorities will have access t o confidential medical records t hat might identify the participant by name. D. Genomic Research Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an ethics c ommittee. IV. Financial Considerations A. Payments to Investigators Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is M SD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of M SD trials. M SD does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts. MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, M SDmay compensate referrin g physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially eligible participants. 0574PH"
91,page_91,"PRODUCT: MK-7264 91 PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:027-03 MK-7264 -027-03 FI NAL PROTOCOL 26-APR -2019 B.Clinical Research Funding Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by M SDand that the investigator or sponsoring institution is being pai d or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, all publications resulting from M SDtrials will indicate M SD as a source of funding. C. Funding for Travel and Other Requests Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices . V. Investigator Commit ment Investigators will be expected to review M SD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. 10.1.2 Financial Disclosure Financial Disclosur e requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration Regulations, Financial Disclosure b y Clinical I nvestigators (21 CFR Part 54). I t is the Sponsor's responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for Financial Di sclosure information is required. It is the investigator's/subinvestigator's responsibility to comply with any such request. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by the Sponsor in accordance with 21 CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financ ial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor to allow for the submission of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further agree to provide this information on a Certification/Disclosure Form, commonly known as a financial disclosure form, provided by the Sponsor. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this information to the Sponsor in the United States for these purposes. This may involve the transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data. 10.1.3 Data Protection Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. An y participant records or datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only ; participant names or an y information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred. The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the participant. The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authori zed personnel appointed by the S ponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and b y inspectors from regulatory authorities. 0574PH"

Events meeting the AE definition •Any abnormal laboratory test results (hemat ology , clinical chemistry, or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the invest igator. •Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. •New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . •Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. •Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. •For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the AE term should reflect the clinical s ymptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose without any associated clinical sy mptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” •Any new cancer or progression of existing cancer. 0574PH"

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 1.Results in death 2.Is life -threatening • The term “ life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which h ypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 3.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization •Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre -existing c ondition that has not worsened is not an SAE. A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s medical history . 4.Results in persistent or significant disability/inca pacity •The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 0574PH"

I n such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of intensity •An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe. •The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and othe r reportable safet y event) reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: -Mild: An event that is easily tolerated b y the participant, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with every day activities (for pediatric studies , awareness of symptoms, but easily tolerated). -Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal every day activities (for pediatric studies, definitely acting like something is wrong). -Severe: An event that prevents normal ever yday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe (for pediatric studies, extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities). Assessment of c ausality •Did the Sponsor ’s product cause the AE? •The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor ’s product caused the AE will be provided b y an investigator who is a qualified ph ysician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causalit y noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causalit y was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame .

This code is a ra ndom number which does not contain any personall y identify ing information embedded within it. The link (or key ) between participant identifiers and this unique code will be held at the stud y site. No personal identifiers will appear on the specimen tube. 5. Biorepository Specimen Usage Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for anal yses using good scientific practices. Anal yses utilizing the future biomedical r esearch specimens may be performed b y the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a univ ersity investigator) designated by the Sponsor. The investigator conducting the anal ysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the specific scope o f analy sis outlined in this substudy . Future biomedical r esearch specimens remaining with the third party after specific analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor. 6. Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical re search and ask that their biospecimens not be used for future biomedical r esearch. Participants may withdraw consent at an y time by contacting the principal investigator for the main study . If medical records for the main study are still available, the inv estigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently, the participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main stud y use only. If specimens were collected from study participants specificall y for future biomedical research, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and destroy ed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. I t is the respons ibility of the investigator to inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or alread y performed prior to the request being received b y the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research study data and results. No new analyses would be generated after the request is received. In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the inve stigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main study records) or the specimens have been completely anony mized, there will no longer be a link between the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed. 0574PH"

Retention of Specimens Future biomedical r esearch specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential analysis for up to 20 y ears from the end of the main study . Spe cimens may be stored for longer if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions have been adequately addressed. Specimens from the study site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to the Sponsor -designated biorepository . If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular stud y, the study site will ship directl y to the Sponsor -designated biorepository. The specimens wil l be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facilit y which operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destro yed according to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the biorepository database. 8. Data Security Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated study administrator research personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication i s highl y secure, and is accomplished using network securit y policies and practices based on international standards to protect against unauthorized access. 9. Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants No information obtained from explorator y laboratory studies will be reported to the participant, famil y, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the participant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive capability , and concerns regar ding misinterpretation. If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to rapidl y report this information to doctors and partici pants.

The Phase 3 studies are designed as randomized, parallel treatment for 1 year with either placebo or 1 of 2 MK-7264 dose levels (15 mg BID, 45 mg BID). However, it is currentl y unknown how participants will respond to cessation of treatment with MK -7264 after 1 y ear of th erapy. Though limited, short -term data from Protocol 012 (the phase 2b dose ranging stud y with MK -7264) suggests that participants treated with MK -7264 for 12 weeks and observed 14 day s after discontinuation of tre atment showed a mean cough frequency off-treatment that did not increase compared to baseline (Week 0 ), suggesting no evidence of immediate rebound cough . The addition of the Off -treatment Durabilit y Study Period via the proposed amendment is intended to explore the impact of withdrawing MK -7264 therap y in RCC/UCC patients who have been treated for 1 year. 3 Hypothesis, Objectives, and Endpoints Objectives Endpoints Exploratory Objective: To evaluate the off -treatment durability after 1 year of treatment with MK-7264, over the course of 3 months off treatment Cough Severit y VAS LCQ CSD PGIC EQ5D -5L Objective: To evaluate the time to“loss of response” in on- treatment responders over the course of 3 months off treatmentTime to loss of response based on VAS Time to loss of response based on CSD Time to first use of a medication for cough 4.1 Overall Design Approximately 150 total participants ,in either this study orP030 at selected sites and countries, will enter a n Off -treatment Durabilit y Study Period at their last visit of the Extension Study Period (V13). The duration of this period will be approximately 3 months. Individual participation in the entire stud y is expected to be approximately 66weeks from Screening (Visit 1) through the end of the Off-treatment Durability Study Period (Visit 17) . Specific procedures to be performed during the Off-treatment Durability Period of the study , as well as associated visit windows, are outlined in the SoA above .

This database lock will occur independent of enrollment into the Off -treatment Durability Study Period. The data from the Off-treatment Durability Study Period will be summarized in a separate report from th e Main and Extension Study Period data. The investigator site personnel and the participants will be blinded to intervention assignment until the entire study is completed. 9.3 Hypotheses/Estimation No hy pothesis will be tested for the Off -treatment Durab ility Study Period . Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (as appropriate) will be provided for the efficacy and safety endpoints. 9.4 Analysis Endpoints The main anal yses will be performed in all subjects who enter the Off-treatment Durability StudyPeriod. It is acknowledged that this population will include participants with vary ing measures of cough impact and severit y as assessed by the ePROs both at the end of the 1- yeartreatm ent (ie , Week 52), as well as compared to prestudy baseline (i e,Week 0). The primary metric of treatment durability will compare the ePRO measurement after 12 weeks off -treatment, t o the measurement at Week 52 (ie , immediately prior to treatment discontinuation), and will specificall y seek to describe the proportion of participants who either fail to maintain their treatment response, or who maintain treatment response. One way to describe “failure to maintain the response” for a given ePRO, as an example, is that either the 12 weeks off -treatment measurement is de creased by at least X% of the Week 52 response, or the participant needs treatment for cough. The actual threshold would be based on considerations about clinical lyimportant differences and real-world data experiences. The definition will be specific to e ach ePRO. In addition, the data will be explore dto examine the impact of on- treatment response to MK-7264 on the outcome measures described above. Specificall y, the on -treatment measurement (defined as the dif ference in the Week 52 measurement compared to Week 0) will be categorized using different threshold definitions of “response”, and the subsequent off-treatment ePRO measurement in the Off -treatment Durability Study Period will be explored as a function of the on -treatment response. One way to descr ibe the “on -treatment response” for VAS, as an example, is that a participant has a Week 52 measurement at least X -mm lower than the Week 0 measurement. The definition will be specific to each ePRO. The final details about the anal ysis endpoints, as well a s other aspects of the anal yses, will be documented in anOff-treatment Durability Study Period memo , separate from the treatment period supplemental SAP, to be finalized before the completion of the Off-treatment Durability Study Period. 0574PH"
