Patients will be enrolled on the basis of their breast cancer suscep tibility gene ( BRCA1, BRCA2 )s t a t u s into one of two cohorts ( BRCA1 /2 (+ve) and BRCA1 /2 (-ve)). The BRCA1/2 (+ve) and BRCA1/2 (-ve) cohorts will be randomised and analysed separately. Within each cohort, patients will be randomised by prospective allocation in a 2:1 ratio (Olaparib:matching placebo) to the treatments as specified below: !Olaparib tablets (oral [p.o.]), 300 mg twice daily (bd; except where this dose and formulation was previously not tolerated; Section 6.7) !placebo tablets to match, p.o. bd Randomisation will be stratified by: ∀ Use of prior bevacizumab (yes versus no) ∀ Number of prior regimens of platinum-containing chemotherapy ( ≤3 regimens versus ≥4 regimens) Investigators will be required to provide tumour assessment information using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 at baseline (a maximum of 28 days prior to randomisation). Following randomis ation, patients in all study arms must have tumour assessments every 12 weeks (±7 days) until objective disease progression. More information is provided in Section 5.1. Patients should continue to receive study treatment until objective radiological disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 or as long as in th e Investigator’s opinion they are benefiting from treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation criteria. Once a patient has stopped treatment, a 30 days post last study drug visit will be performed during which adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications and the co mpleted health-related quality of life (HRQ oL) questionnaire will be collected. Thereafter, data on subsequent therapies according to routine clinical practice, adverse events of special interest (AESI) and survival will be collected until the data cut-off date for the final analysis."

The minimum periods for which patients must have taken maintenance PARPi without progression to be eligible for this retreatment study are: ∀ For the BRCA1 /2 (+ve) cohort, the duration of exposure must have been ≥18 months following a first line of chemotherapy or ≥12 months following a second line or subsequent line of chemotherapy ∀ For the BRCA1 /2 (-ve) cohort, the duration of exposure must have been ≥12 months following a first line of chemotherapy or ≥6 months following a second line or subsequent line of chemotherapy. A month is defined as being from the start date to the same date in the next month (e.g. 01 January to 01 July is 6 months). These pe riods are of continuous PARPi administration and are measured from the date of the first dose to the date of the last dose of PARPi. During this period no new anticancer treatment for disease progression can have been administered, but patients may have had short breaks (maximum 14 days on any occasion) for holidays, control of toxicity or non-cancer treatments, for example. Unblinding of patients who received blinded treatment with a PARPi as an experimental arm should be medically justified Patients may have, but do not need to have, a specific confirmatory homologous recombination repair (HRR) or homologous reco mbination deficiency (HRD) test. Patients with BRCA variants of unknown significance will be regarded as BRCA1 /2 (-ve) for the purposes of this study. Patients should also have received subsequent platinum-based chemotherapy, excluding bevacizumab, following progression during or following prior PARPi therapy and have achieved, in the opinion of the Investigator, at least a partial radiological response, or not have a rising CA-125 following optimal de bulking surgery with no measurable disease. In addition, patients must be randomised into the OReO study within 8 weeks of their last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy (last dos e is the day of the last infusion). Duration of Treatment Unless patients experience unacceptable toxicit y or withdraw from the study treatment or from the protocol, patients should continue to receive study treatment until there is objective radiological disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1 or as long as in the Investigator’s opinion they are benefiting from treatment."

Study Treatment, Dosage, and Mode of Administration Olaparib is available as a film-coated tabl et containing 150 mg or 100 mg of Olaparib. Patients will be administered study treatment orally at a dose of 300 mg bd. The planned dose of 300 mg bd will be made up of two 150 mg tab lets bd with 100 mg tablets used to manage dose reductions (except where this dose and formulation was previously not tolerated; Section 7.2). The comparator in the OReO study is placebo to match Olaparib 150 mg or 100 mg tablets. Statistical Methods All personnel involved with the analysis of th e study will remain bli nded to study treatment until database lock and protocol violators are identified. Data cut off and subsequent database lock for the Primary Analysis will occur after the later of the two cohorts reaches the defined number of progression or death events. Efficacy data will be summarised for both cohorts using the full analysis set (FAS), including all ra ndomised patients. The primary outcome, PFS, will be analysed using a stratified log- rank test and the effect of Olaparib retreatment will be estimated by the hazard ratio (HR) and associated 95% confidence interval and P-value. Kaplan-Meier plots will be presented by treatment arm. The analysis of other time-to -event endpoints will use the same methodology as for PFS (see Section 8). HRQoL using the FACT-O tool will be analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of the change from baseline in TOI score for each scheduled post-baseline visit, based upon a subset of the FAS. HRQoL mean scores will be analysed accounting for baseline scores and the stratification factors. Time to deterioration will be analyse d using survival analysis methodology as per the PFS endpoint. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis of PFS and other time-to-event endpoints will be performed as appropriate and as described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). A comprehensive SAP will be prepared, and any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments completed prior to un-blinding of the data. Analyses will be performed in collaboration between AstraZeneca or its representatives and representatives of GINECO-ENGOT (Groupe d’Investigateurs Nationaux pour l’Étude des Cancers Ovariens et du sein [GINECO]; European Network for Gynaecological Oncological Trial [ENGOT]). The analyses to be performed for the purpose of generating the clinical study report will be included in the study SAP that is prepared by the clinical research organisation (CRO), which"

All analyses in the SAP will then be generated by the CRO. Sample Size The benefit of Olaparib retreatment over matching placebo will be evaluated in both cohorts through the primary endpoint of PFS. Recently published data (Study 19, NOVA, SOLO2) of PARPi therapy following a second or subsequent line of platinum based chemotherapy indicated that a median PFS which does not exceed 5.5 months can be expected in the placebo-treated patients ( Table 1 ). Table 1 Median PFS of Study 19, SOLO2 (Olaparib) and NOVA (Niraparib) Patients According to BRCA Status and Treatment Arm, and Selection of Patients in OReO According to Previous Exposure to PARPi BRCAm placebo arm late relapseBRCAm Olaparib arm late relapseBRCAwt placebo arm late relapseBRCAwt Olaparib arm late relapse Median PFS (months) Study 19 4.3 11.2 5.5 7.4 NOVA 5.5 21.0 3.9 9.3 SOLO2 5.5 19.1 n/a n/a Selection in OReO according to previous PARPi exposure for relapse patients> 12 > 6 Selection in OReO according to previous PARPi exposure for first line patients> 18 > 12 BRCAm = BRCA1 /2 mutated; BRCAwt = BRCA1 /2 wild type; n/a = not applicable This study tests the hypothesis that patients judged to have received benefit from an init ial maintenance course of PARPi, based on a duration of prior exposure specified according to their BRCA status, and number of prior courses of platinum-based chemotherapy, and who retain sensitivity to platinum-based chemother apy, will benefit from repeat exposure to olaparib. The data above indicates that in platinum sensitive patients, regardless of BRCA status, placebo maintenance following second-line chemotherapy results in a median PFS of"
14,page_14,"Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis Drug Substance Olaparib, AZD2281, KU-0059436 Study Code D0816C00014 Version 4.0Date 15 October 2020 14 (150)less than 5.5 months. Patients entering OreO may do so after a second or subsequent line of platinum based chemotherapy, and despite being selected for benefit from prior PARPi, are considered unlikely to demonstrate a longer median PFS on placebo than the similar patient populations tested in Study 19, SOLO2, a nd NOVA. Finally, the benefit from PARPi maintenance retreatment is assumed to be less than obtained on first treatment. So the expected median PFS for both the BRCA1/2 (+ve) and BRCA1/2 (-ve) cohorts has been estimated to be approximately 4.5 months for patients receiving placebo. Sample sizes have then been calculated based on an expectation of a clinically meaningful duration of benefit (HR 0.5 for both cohorts). In the BRCA1/2 (+ve) cohort it is assumed that the median PFS from randomisation for patients in the placebo arm will be approx imately 4.5 months. In total, 85 progression or death events from 120 patients will have 85% power to demonstrate significant PFS benefit at the 2- sided 5% level if the assumed true treatment effect resulted in a HR of 0.5; this translates to a 4.5 month (100%) increase in median PFS beyond the 4.5 months expected for patients onplacebo, if PFS is exponentially distributed and allowing a 10% drop-out rate. An observed HR of 0.63 or less will be required to achieve this level of significance. Assuming 34 months of non-linear recruitment, 85 events are expected to occur approximately 41 months after the first patient in (FSI) is enrolled into this cohort of the study. In the BRCA1/2 (-ve) cohort it is assumed that the median PFS from randomisation for patients in the placebo arm will be approx imately 4.5 months. In total, 74 progression or death events from 108 patients will have 80% power to demonstrate significant PFS benefit at the 2- sided 5% level if the assumed true treatment effect resulted in a HR of 0.5; this translates to a 4.5 month (100%) increase in median PFS beyond the 4.5 months expected for patients on placebo, if PFS is exponentially distributed and allowing a 10% drop-out rate. An observed HR of 0.61 or less will be required to achieve this level of significance. Assuming 36 months of non-linear recruitment, 74 events are expected to occur approximately 42 months after the FSI is enrolled into this cohort of the study. Considering both cohorts it is expected that approximately 228 patients in total will be enrolled into the study. The assumptions made in calculating the sample size will be evaluated at the time of the planned interim analysis. FAS (Intent-to-Treat Principle) The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomised patients and will compare the treatment groups on the basis of randomised treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. Patients who were randomised but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment are included in the FAS. Therefore, all efficacy data will be summarised and analysed using the FAS on an ITT basis as the primary analysis set. Demographic and baseline characteristics will also be analysed using the FAS on an ITT basis. Safety Analysis Set"

If a patient receives at least one dose of Olaparib study treatment they will be summarised in the Olaparib arm for safety summaries (e.g., Olaparib arm will include patients randomised to Olaparib who receive at least one dose of Olaparib or placebo patients who receive at least one dose of Olaparib study treatment in error at any time). If a patient randomised to Olaparib receives only placebo treatment then the patient will be summarised as a part of the placebo arm. All safety data will be summarised and analysed using the safety analysis set. Interim Analysis In the BRCA1/2 (+ve) cohort an interim analysis for fut ility will be pe rformed after 50% of the target PFS events (i.e. after 43 events). Based upon the assumed accrual and event rate it is estimated that this will occur after approximately 29 months. Using a conditional power non-binding futility analysis the c ohort may stop for futility if the hazard ratio > 1.056. Under the null hypothesis the probab ility of st opping for fut ility is 0. 433 and under the alternative hypothesis it is 0.01. In the BRCA1/2 (-ve) cohort an interim analysis for fut ility will be pe rformed after 50% of the target PFS events (i.e. after 37 events). Based upon the assumed accrual and event rate it is estimated that this will occur after approximately 30 months. Using a conditional power non binding futility analysis the c ohort may stop for futility if the hazard ratio > 1.02. Under the null hypothesis the probab ility of st opping for fut ility is 0.477 and under the alternative hypothesis it is 0.02.

Patients must have received a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin, cisplatin or oxaliplatin) and must have had, in the opinion of the Investigator, at least a partial radiological response, or not have a rising CA-125 following opti mal debul king surgery with no measurable disease. The prior period of exposure to PARPi will be used as a measure of benefit from previous PARPi therapy. Olaparib Mechanism of Action Investigators should be familiar with the current Olaparib (AZD 2281) Investigator brochure (IB). Olaparib (AZD2281, KU-0059436) is a potent PARPi that is being developed as an oral therapy, both as a monotherapy (including main tenance) and for combination with other anti- cancer agents in several tumour types. Olaparib tablets are currently approved for the maintenance treatment of patients with platinum sensitive relapsed EOC both in the European Union and the United States of America. PARP inhibition is a novel approach to targeting tumours with deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms. PARP enzymes are essential for repairing DNA single strand breaks (SSBs). Inhibiting PARPs leads to the persistence of SSBs, which are then converted to the more serious DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during the process of DNA replication. During the process of cell division, DSBs can be efficiently repaired in normal cells by homologous recombination repair (HRR). Tumours with homologous recombination deficiencies (HRDs), such as ovarian cancers in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations ,cannot accurately repair the DNA damage, which may become lethal to cells as it accumulates. In such tumour types,"
27,page_27,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Olaparib, AZD2281, KU-0059436 Study Code D0816C00014 Version 4.0Date 15 October 2020 27 (150)Olaparib may offer a potentially efficacious and less toxic cancer treatment compared with currently available chemotherapy regimens. BRCA1 and BRCA2 defective tumours are intrinsically sensitive to PARP inhibitors, both in tumour models in vivo (Rottenberg et al. 2008 , Hay et al. 2009 ) and in the clinic ( Fong et al. 2009 ). The mechanism of action for Olaparib results from the trapping of inactive PARP onto the single-strand breaks preventing their repair ( Murai et al. 2012 , Helleday 2011 ). Persistence of SSBs during DNA replication results in their conversion into the more serious DNA DSBs that would normally be repaired by HRR. Olaparib has been shown to inhibit selected tumour cell lines in vitro and in xenograft and primary explant models as well as in genetic BRCA1/2 knock-out models, either as a stand-al one treatment or in combination with established chemotherapies. AstraZeneca considers that the patient population involved in this study falls under the advanced cancer, limited life expectancy definiti on outlined in International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) S9 guideline ""Non-clinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals"" and meets the requirements outlined in the guideline. 1.2 Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Control Groups Experience with Olaparib BRCAm Ovarian Cancer The results of a pivotal Phase II trial (D0810C00019; Study 19), showed the benefit of Olaparib as maintenance monotherapy in patients with platinum sensitive relapsed High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) especially in BRCAm1tumours. Study 19 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-c ontrolled study to evaluate `maintenance treatment with Olaparib (capsule formulation) in patients with platinum sensitive relapsed HGSOC (including patients with primary peritoneal and/or fallopian tube cancer) who had received ≥2 previous platinum regimens and were in partial or complete response following their last platinum-containing regimen. The primary endpoint in Study 19 was Investigato r-assessed PFS. In total, 265 patients were randomised to Olaparib 400 mg twice daily (bd; 136 patients) or placebo (129 patients). The primary analysis was carried out following 154 PFS events and demonstrated that maintenance treatment with Olaparib led to a significant PFS improvement versus placebo 1BRCAm status is defined as a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 classified as ""deleterious"" or ""suspected deleterious"" in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for standards for interpretation and reporting of sequence variants ( Richards et al. 2008 ). The OReO study will recruit patients with BRCA1/2 mutations that are either germline ( gBRCAm ) or somatic ( sBRCAm ; i.e., occurring in the tumour only)."

A subgroup analysis (pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan [SAP]) showed that Olaparib led to a greater clinical benefit in patients with a known gBRCAm ; gBRCAm status was determined retrospectively for all consenting patients (n=166) using blood samples taken before randomisation. Somatic (i.e., tumour only) BRCA1/2 status was determined from archival tumour samples from 196 patients. The results showed an increased PFS benefit for BRCAm patients (HR, 0.18; 95% CI 0.10-0.31; median: 11.2 versus 4.3 months; P<0.00001) compared with non- BRCAm (HR,0.54; CI 0.34-0.85; median:7·4 months vs 5·5 months; P=0·0075) In the latest analysis of overa ll survival (OS; 70% maturity), data for BRCAm patients resulted in an OS HR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.41-0.94; median: 34.9 months versus 30.2 months) (Ledermann et al. 2016 ). Olaparib tolerability was similar in BRCAm patients and the overall population. The findings from Study 19 are supported by clinical data from over 350 additional patients with BRCAm ovarian cancer in 6 other Olaparib trials demons trating consistent response rates. Results from the Phase III confirmatory trial (Study D0816C00002; the SOLO2 study) conducted with the tablet formulation (300 mg bd), in BRCAm patients showed a median PFS for the Olaparib treated patients of 19.1 months, compared with 5.5 months for the placebo group (HR of 0.3; 95% CI 0.22-0.41; P<0.0001). The tablet dose was chosen based on data from Study D0810C00024 (Study 24). Study 24 explored the tablet formulation in terms of bi oavailability, tolerability, and activity and selected the 300 mg bd dose for further development on the basis that this dose was considered to have similar efficacy in terms of tumour shrinkage in BRCAm ovarian cancer patients compared with the 400 mg bd capsu le dose. In the Study 24 ovarian cancer population, comparison of the change in tumour size data for 300 mg Olaparib tablets bd with 400 mg Olaparib capsules bd showed the two treatments had similar effects on efficacy (Week 8 difference=1.8%, 95% CI: -22.8%, 26.4%; P=0.881). Both capsule and tablet formulations have a similar tolerability profile. Toxicities considered to be associated with administration of Olap arib include haematological effects (anaemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, mean corpuscular volume [MCV] elevation), decreased appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, upper abdominal pain, dysgeusia, fatigue (including asthenia), increase in blood creatinine, headache and dizziness. Further information is provided in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC). Patients who have received platinum-based chemotherapy followed by PARPi as maintenance monotherapy to progression, and thereafter treated with a further line of platinum-based chemotherapy receive no further treatment until progression, according to current treatment paradigms."

There is a potential that such patients could also respond to a r etreatment with PARPi therapy, particularly those with BRCA1/2 mutations, since ge nomic instab ility in BRCA1 andBRCA2 can be enhanced by chemotherapy agents affecting DNA repair, potentially making them more susceptible to PARP inhibition following a platinum therapy response. At present, it is not known whether retreatment with a PARPi therapy after a re sponse to retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy agents may work in a similar manner, but there is agreement amongst clinicians that exploring retreatment is an unmet need. Niraparib Experience in gBRCA1/2 Ovarian Cancer ENGOT-OV16/NOVA was a Ph ase III, ra ndomised, double-bli nd placebo-controlled trial of niraparib, a PARPi, as maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer with predominantly high-grade serous histologic features ( Mirza et al. 2016 ). Patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of a germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA1/2 ) mutation (203 patients in the gBRCA1/2 cohort and 350 patients in the non- gBRCA1/2 cohort). They were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive niraparib (300 mg) or placebo once daily. Patients who received niraparib had a significantly longer median PFS duration than those who received the placebo: 21.0 versus 5.5 months in the gBRCA1/2 cohort (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.41) and 12.9 months versus 3.8 months in the non- gBRCA1/2 cohort for patients who had tumours with HRD (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.59) and 9.3 months versus 3.9 months in the overall non- gBRCA1/2 cohort (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61). Therefore, compared to placebo, niraparib improved PFS (primary endpoint) regardless of BRCA1/2 mutation or HRD tumour status (P was <0.001 in all three primary efficacy populations). In the niraparib group, the most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) were thrombocytopenia (in 33.8%), anaemia (in 25.3%) and neutropenia (in 19.6%), which were managed with dose modifications. Rationale for the OReO study Prior experience has demonstrated that PARPi therapy improves median PFS when used in patients who are at least partially platinum sensitive. Following progression on PARPi maintenance therapy many of these patients are found to retain sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is not known whether these pati ents will benefit from an additional period of PARPi maintenance therapy. The OReO study will investigate the efficacy and safety of Olaparib maintenance retreatment in patients with relapsed non-mucinous EOC, who have had disease progression following maintenance therap y with a PARPi and who remain sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy. Multiple studies of patients given no maintenan ce therapy following first line platinum-based chemotherapy show that they can expect a median PFS of between 12 and 18 months, with the"

This has provided the rati onale for requiring patients who received PARPi initially after first line therapy to have been exposed for 18 months ( BRCA1/2+ve ) and 12 months (BRCA1/2-ve), in an attempt to select those patients benefiting from a PARPi. A similar approach has been adopted for those receiv ing their initial PARPi after later lines of chemotherapy, with the 12 months required for BRCA1/2+ve being consistent with the PFS seen in Study 19, and the 6 months for BRCA1/2-ve 1.3 Benefit/Risk and Ethical Assessment Please see current edition of the SmPC for the most recent summary of the risks of Olaparib. 1.4 Study Design This is a Phase IIIb, randomised, double-blind, pl acebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Olaparib retreatment, versus matching placebo, in non- mucinous EOC patients (including patients with primary peritoneal and/or fallopian tube cancer). To be eligible, patients must have received maintenance therapy with a PARPi, and must have had at least a partial radiolog ical response to their most recent course of platinum- based chemotherapy, or may have no evidence of disease (if optimal cytoreductive surgery was conducted prior to chemotherapy), and no evidence of a rising CA-125. All patients must have a confirmed genetic status for BRCA1 /2. Patients will be randomised into one of two cohorts depending on their known BRCA1/2 status (see Figure 1 ): ∀ The first cohort will enrol patients with confirmed BRCA1 /2 (+ve) status (somatic, sBRCA1 /2, or germline, gBRCA1 /2) ∀ The second cohort will enrol patients who are known gBRCA1 /2 (-ve) and may include some patients who have an undetected sBRCA1 /2 mutation. Within each cohort, patients will be randomised by prospective allocation in a 2:1 ratio (Olaparib:matching placebo) to the treatments as specified below: ∀ Olaparib tablets (oral [p.o.]), 300 mg bd (except where this dose and formulation was previously not tolerated; Section 6.7) ∀ placebo tablets to match, p.o. bd Randomisation will be stratified by: ∀ Use of prior bevacizumab (yes versus no)"

These pe riods are of continuous PARPi administration and are measured from the date of the first dose to the date of the last dose of PARPi. During this period no new anticancer treatment for disease progression can have been administered, but patients may have had short breaks (maximum 14 days on any occasion) for holidays, control of toxicity or non-cancer treatments, for example. Patients may have, but do not need to have, a specific confirmatory HRR or HRD test. Patients with BRCA variants of unknown significance will be regarded as BRCA1 /2 (-ve) for the purposes of this study. Patients should also have received subsequent platinum-based chemotherapy, excluding bevacizumab, following progression during or after pri or PARPi therapy and remain platinum sensitive. For the purposes of this study, platinum sensitivity means that the patient had a Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 partial or complete response (as determined by the Investigator) to the most recent line of platinum-based chemotherapy, or may have no evidence of disease (if optimal cytoreductive surgery was conducted prior to chemotherapy), and no evidence of a rising CA-125. In addition, patients must be randomised into the OReO study within 8 weeks of their last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy (last dose is the day of the last infusion). Investigators will be required to provide tumour assessment information using RECIST 1.1 and health-rel ated quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires at baseline (a maximum of 28 days prior to randomisation). Following randomisation, patients in all study arms must have tumour assessments every 12 weeks (±7 days) until objective disease progression. More information is provided in Section 5.1. Patients should continue to receive study treatment until objective radiological disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 or as long as in th e Investigator’s opinion they are benefiting from treatment and they do not meet any other disc ontinuation criteria.

Randomisation codes will be assigned strictly sequentially as patients become eligible for randomisation. 3.4 Procedures for Handling Incorrectly Enrolled or Randomised Patients Patients who fail to meet the eligibility cr iteria should not, under any circumstances, be enrolled or receive study medication. There can be no exceptions to this rule. Patients who are enrolled, but subsequently found not to m eet all the eligibility criteria must not be randomised or initiated on treatment and must be withdrawn from the study. Where a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is ra ndomised in error, or incorrectly started on treatment, the Inve stigator should inform the AstraZeneca study physician immediately, and a discussion should occur between the AstraZeneca study physician and the Investigator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the patient from treatment. The patient’s circumstances should be discussed with the ENGOT trial Principal Investigator before the decision to withdraw is made. The AstraZeneca study physician must ensure all decisions are appropriately documented. 3.5 Methods for Assigning Treatment Groups Eligible patients from both cohorts will be randomised separ ately in a 2:1 ratio (Olaparib:matching placebo). The actual treatment given to individual patients w ill be determined by a randomisation scheme that has been loaded into the In teractive Vo ice Response System / Interactive Web Response System (IVRS /IWRS) database. A blocked randomisation will be generated for all centres. The ra ndomisation scheme w ill be str atified based on the following: ∀ Use of prior bevacizumab (yes versus no) and ∀ Number of prior regimens of platinum-containing chemotherapy ( ≤3 versus ≥4 regimens). Specific information concerning the use of IVRS/IWRS will be provided in a separate manual. It is recommended that patients commence study treatment on the day of randomisation if possible, and if not, then ideally within 3 days. 3.6 Methods for Ensuring Blinding Olaparib and matched placebo treatment will be blinded. The study medication will be labelled using a unique MedID number, which is linked to the randomisation scheme. The active and placebo tablets and their packaging will look identical to ensure blinding of the study medication."

Routines for this will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be provided to each centre. The treatment code must not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomisation. The Investigator documents and reports the action to AstraZeneca or its agent, without revealing the treatment given to patient. AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to study treatment a nd that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. Investigators and patients will not be un-blinded to study treatment for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual patient have been made and documented. After the final data cut- off (DCO), all patients will be un-blinded to study treatment. 3.8 Restrictions 3.8.1 Grapefruit Juice It is not recommended to consume grapefruit juice while on study therapy. 3.8.2 Contraception Female patients of child bearing potential, who are sexually active, must agree to the use of one highly effective forms of contraception a nd their partners must use a male condom throughout the period of taking study treatment and for 1 month (female patients) after last dose of study drug. For details refer to Appendix D (Acceptable Birth Control Methods). 3.9 Discontinuation of Study Treatment Patients may be discontinued from study treatment in the following situations: ∀ Patient decision. The patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment ∀ AE ∀ Severe non-compliance with the study protocol as judged by the Investigator and/or AstraZeneca ∀ Bone marrow findings consistent with MDS/AML"

The Principal Investigator/Investigator will perform the best possible observation(s), test(s) and evaluation(s) as well as give appropriate medication and all possible measures for the safety of the patient. They will also immediately inform AstraZeneca of the withdrawal. AEs will be followed up (see Section 6), completed questionnaires (e.g., for patient reported outcomes [PROs]) and all unused study treatme nt should be returned by the patient. By discontinuing from study treatment, the patient is not withdrawing from the study. Patients should be followed for progression (if discontinuation in the absence of progression) and overall survival following treatment discontinuation as per the protocol schedule. Any patient discontinuing study treatment should be seen at 30 days post discontinuation for the evaluations outlined in the study schedule. The patient’s tumour status should be assessed clinically and, if appropriate, disease progression should be confirmed by radiological assessment. After discontinuation of study medication, the Principal Investigator/Investigator will perform the best possible observation(s), test(s) and evaluation(s) as well as give appropriate medication and all possible measures for the safety of the patient. In addition, they will record on the electronic case report form (eCRF) the date of discontinuation, the reasons, manifestation, and treatment at the time of discontinuation. If patients discontinue study treatment, the site monitor must be informed immediately. Patients will be required to attend the treatment discontinuation visit. The patient should return all study medication. After discontinuation of the study medication at any point in the study, all ongoing AEs or SAEs must be followed until resolution unless, in the Investigator’s opinion the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patients underlying disease, or the patient is lost to follow up (see Section 6.3.2 ). All new AEs and SAEs occurring during the 30 calendar days after the last dose of study medication must be reported (if SAEs, they must be reported to AstraZeneca within 24 hours as described in Section 6.4) and followed to resolution as above. Patients should be seen at least 30 days after discontinuing st udy med ication to collect and/or comp lete AE information. For guidance on reporting AEs after the 30 day follow up period see Section 6.3.1.1 . Any patient who has not yet shown objectiv e radiological disease progression at withdrawal from investigational product should continue to be followed as per RECIST as detailed in Section 5.1. All patients must be followed for AESIs, survival and subsequent therapies, up to the final analysis. If a patient is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.10."

The patient’s circumstances should be discussed with the ENGOT trial Principal Investigator and the sponsor AstraZeneca before the decision to withdraw is made. ∀ Patient lost to follow-up ∀ Death. 3.10.1Screen Failures Screening failures are patients who do not fulf il the eligibility criteria for the study, and therefore must not be randomised. These patien ts should have the reason for study withdrawal recorded as ‘Incorrect Enrolment’ (i.e., patient does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria). This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures (not randomised patients). RE-SCREEN: subjects that initially failed the screening process for minor, potentially correctable abnormalities, such as laboratory testing, are allowed to be resubmitted to the screening process. Re-screened subjects will be re-consented and given a new subject number, as if they have not previously undergone the screening process. The site would follow the same procedures as they would with a new subject. The patient must still be randomised within 8 weeks from the last dose of chemotherapy. 3.10.2Withdrawal of the Informed Consent Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (study treatment and assessments), without prejudice to further treatment. A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. The Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study. If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then her enrolment/randomisation code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced."

The status of ongoing, withdrawn (from the study) a nd “lost to follow-up” patients at the time of an OS analysis should be obtained by the site personnel by checking the patient notes, hospital records, contacting the patient’s general practitioner and checking publicly available death registries. In the event that the patient has actively withdrawn consent to the processing of their personal data, the vital status of the patient can be obtained by site personnel from publicly available resources where it is possible to do so under applicable local laws. 3.11 Discontinuation of the Study The study may be stopped if, in the judg ment of AstraZeneca, together with that of the ENGOT Principal Investigator and after the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), the trial patients are placed at undue risk because of clinically significant findings that: ∀ Meet individual stopping criteria or are otherwise considered significant ∀ Are assessed as causally related to study drug ∀ Are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study. Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patient at the time of discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the eCRF. All reasons for discontinuation of treatment must be documented. The study, or one cohort, may also be stopped at any time after the Primary Analysis if in the judgment of AstraZeneca, the ENGOT Principal Investigator and the Trial Steering Committee, there is insufficient clin ical benefit from re-treatment. In terminating the study, AstraZeneca will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interests. 4 STUDY PLAN AND TIMING OF PROCEDURES The scheduled screening assessments are summarised in Table 2 ."

The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the case report forms (CRFs) as specified in the study protocol and in accordance w ith the instructions provided. The Investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the clinical study agreement (CSA). The Investigator will sign the completed CRFs. A copy of the completed CRFs will be archived at the study site. The Principal Investigator/Investigator will record data on the observations, tests, and assessments specified in the protocol on the CRFs provided. The CRF will be accompanied with ‘Instructions for the Investigator’, which should be followed. These instructions provide guidance for the recording of study data in the CRF including how to change data incorrectly recorded. 5.1 Efficacy Assessments 5.1.1 CT and MRI Scans Assessments (RECIST 1.1) Following the baseline assessment, subsequent tumour assessments according to RECIST 1.1 should be performed every 12 weeks (±7 days ) relative to the date of randomisation, up to objective disease progression by RECIST 1.1."

The imaging modalities used for RECIST assessment will be CT or MRI scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with other regions as clinically indicated for the assessment of disease. Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged. The methods of assessment of tumour burden used at baseline must be used at each subsequent follow-up assessment. Radiological examinations performed in the condu ct of this study should be retained at site as source data. All treatment decisions will be based on site assessment of scans. It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible. If scans are performed outside of scheduled visit ±7 day window interval and the patient has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent scans at their time points as originally scheduled. Patients will be evaluated until ob jective radiological disease progression by RECIST 1.1 as per the study schedule (see Table 2 andTable 3 )regardless of whether study treatment is discontinued or d elayed and/or protocol violations, unless they withdraw consent. 5.1.2 Tumour Evaluation RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used to assess patient response to treatment for determining PFS times. The RECIST 1.1 guidelines for measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions and the objective tumour response cr iteria (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], or progression of disease [PD]) are presented in Appendix F . The methods of assessment of tumour burden used at baseline - CT or MRI scans of chest, abdomen, pelvis, must be used at each subsequent follow-up assessment. Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual patients. Following the baseline assessment, efficacy for all patients will be assessed by objective tumour assessments every 12 weeks #7 days after randomisation, until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1. Any othe r sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged. If a patient discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subsequent cancer therapy) prior to progression then the patient shoul d still continue to be followed until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1. Categorisation of objective tumour response assessment will be based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria of response: CR, PR, SD, and PD. Target lesion (TL) progression will be calculated in"
63,page_63,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Olaparib, AZD2281, KU-0059436 Study Code D0816C00014 Version 4.0Date15 October 2020 63 (150)comparison to when the tumour burden was at a minimum (i.e. smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study). In the absence of progression, tumour response (CR, PR, and SD) will be calculated in comparison to the baseline tumour measurements obtained before starting treatment. For patients with non-measurable disease only at baseline, categorisation of objective tumour response assessment will be based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria of response: CR, PD, and non CR/non PD. If the Investigator is in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, particularly with response to non-target lesion or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment until the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated and reassess the patient’s status. If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial scan should be declared as the date of progression. To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of non -target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to quality for unequivocal progression status. Following progression, patients should continue to be followed up for survival according to the institution’s local practice as outlined in the study plan. It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible. Please refer to the study plan in Table 2 andTable 3 . 5.1.3 CA-125 Measurements At the same time as the CT or MRI scans, CA-125 measurements will be taken, and used in conjunction with the (RECIST 1.1) radiological data using the GCIG criteria (see Appendix H) as a measure of tumour progression. The outcomes according to GCIG criteria will be assessed as a secondary objective. It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible. If CA-125 assessment is performed outside of the scheduled visit ±7 day window interval, every attempt should be made to assess the next CA-125 at the scheduled time points. Repeat measurements should be taken ≥1 week after a value suggesting progression. Patients will be evaluated until objective disease progression, based on progressive serial elevation of serum CA-125 according to the GCIG criteria, or un til discontinuation for other reasons."

If it is not possible to conduct cytogenetic analysis or flow cytometry on the bone marrow aspirate, then attempts should be made to carry out the tes ts on a blood sample. Full reports must be provided by the Investigator for documentation on the Patient Safety database. These data are not required to be entered into eCRF. 5.2.4 ECG 5.2.4.1 Resting 12-lead ECG ECGs are required within 7 days prior to starting study treatment and when clinically indicated. 12-lead ECGs will be obtained after the patient has been rested in a supine position for at least 5 minutes in each case. The Investigator or designated physician will review the paper copies of each of the timed 12-lead ECGs on each of the study days when they are collected. ECGs will be recorded at 25 mm/sec. All ECGs should be assessed by the Investigator as to whether they are clinically significantly abnormal / not clinically significantly abnormal. If there is a clinically significant abnormal finding, the Investigator will record it as an AE on the eCRF.

In addition, QoL questionnaires will be collected at the discontinuation of study treat ment visit, at 30 days post last dose. The timing of assessments coincide with other clinical assessments (when the patient will be attending clinic) in order to minimise patient burden while maximizing both compliance and the association of the PRO with the clinical outcomes. Patients who had RECIST 1.1 disease progression will complete the questionnaires during the 12-weekly survival follow-ups for up to a period of 2 years from patient randomisatio n. The reason for any missing assessment will be collected in the CRF. Subscales will be derived from the FACT-O according to the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Administration and Scoring Guidelines (See Section 8.4.5 for full details). The endpoint for HRQoL analysis will be the FACT-O Trial Outcome Index (TOI). Other subscales will be considered as exploratory endpoints. 5.4 Biomarker Analysis 5.4.1 Collection of Samples Blood samples for biomarker analysis will be taken during the study. 5.4.1.1 CA-125 Blood samples for the disease specific marker, CA-125, will be collected at screening (Visit 1) and every 12 weeks (±7 days), at the same time as the CT or MRI scans, until objective disease progression, based on progressive serial elevation of serum CA-125 according to the GCIG criteria, or until discontinuation for other reasons. 5.4.1.2 Archival or Fresh Tumour Sample All patients are required to submit an archival tumour sample or, if preferred, a recent tumour sample, for post-analysis testing of their genetic status. Confirmation is required in clinical notes regarding availability of sample during the screening period; however, samples are only required to be submitted once the patient has been randomised. Samples should be submitted as paraffin bloc ks, alternatively, sections mounted on glass slides prepared from the block can be provided. Material provided will be used for additional exploratory work, which may be conducted to elucidate the mechanism of response, understand the mode of action of study treatment, or improve the understanding of disease progression. Please refer to the laboratory manual for further details regarding tissue collection, shipping and storage."

Biological samples (e.g., archived tumour samples) will be collected and may be analysed for biomarkers to assess correlations with disease activity, effects of study drug, clinical outcomes, and toxicity. 5.5.1 Storage, Re-use and Destruction of Biological Samples Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years from the date of the Last Patient’s Last Visit, after which they will be destroyed. Th e results of this biomarker research will be reported either in the clinical study report (CSR) itself or as an addendum, or separately in a scientific report or publication. The results of this biomarker research may be pooled with biomarker data from other studies with the study drug to generate hypotheses to be tested in future research. 5.5.2 Labelling and Shipment of Biological Samples The Principal Investigator ensures that samples are labelled and shipped in accordance with the Laboratory Manual. 5.5.3 Chain of Custody of Biological Samples A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. The Principal Investigator at each centre keeps fu ll traceability of collected biological samples from the patients while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate). The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival. AstraZeneca keeps oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study sites and auditing of external laboratory providers. Samples retained for further use are registered in the AstraZeneca Biobank during the entire life cycle. 5.5.4 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of/destroyed, and the action documented. If samples are already analysed , AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results of this research. As collection of the biological samples is an opti onal part of the study, then the patient may continue in the study.CCI"

An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver), or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, ECG). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs. 6.1.1 Olaparib AEs of Special Interest AESIs are events of scientific and medical interest specific to the further understanding of Olaparib’s safety profile and require close monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigators to AstraZeneca. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. AESIs for Olaparib are the important identified risks of MDS/AMLand the important potential risks of new primary malignancy (other than MDS/AML) and pneumonitis."
72,page_72,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Olaparib, AZD2281, KU-0059436 Study Code D0816C00014 Version 4.0Date15 October 2020 72 (150)ANY event of MDS/AML, new primary malignancy, or pneumonitis should be reported to AstraZeneca Patient Safety whether it is cons idered a non-serious AE (e.g., non-melanoma skin cancer) or SAE, and regardless of Investigator’s assessment of causality or knowledge of the treatment arm. A questionnaire will be sent to any Investigator reporting an AESI, as an aid to provide further detailed information on the event. During the study there may be other events identified as AESIs that require the use of a questionnaire to help characterise the event and gain a better understanding regarding the relationship between the event and study treatment. 6.2 Definitions of SAE A SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run-in, treatment, washout, follow- up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: ∀ Results in death ∀ Is immediately life-threatening ∀ Requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation ∀ Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions ∀ Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect ∀ Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix A to the Clinical Study Protocol. 6.3 Recording of AEs 6.3.1 Time Period for Collection of AEs AEs will be collected from time of signature of informed consent, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after the last dose of treatment. Only AESIs will be collected during long-term follow-up. SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent. After any interim analysis, any ongoing AEs/SAEs need to be unlocked and followed for resolution."
73,page_73,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Olaparib, AZD2281, KU-0059436 Study Code D0816C00014 Version 4.0Date15 October 2020 73 (150)6.3.1.1 AEs After the 30 day Follow-up Period For Pharmacovigilance purposes and characterisation, any case of MDS/AML or new primary malignancy occurring after the 30 day follow up period should be reported to AstraZeneca Patient Safety whether it is considered a non-serious AE [e.g., non-melanoma skin cancer] or SAE, and regardless of Investigator’s asse ssment of causality or knowledge of the treatment arm. Investigators will be asked during the re gular follow up for overall survival if the patient has developed MDS/AML or a new primary malignancy and prompted to report any such cases. At any time after a patient has completed the study, if an Investigator learns of any SAE including sudden death of unknown cause, and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the event is causally related to the investigational product, the Investigator should notify AstraZeneca, Patient Safety. If patients who are gaining clinical benefit are allowed to continue study treatment post DCO and/or post study completion then all SAEs must continue to be collected and reported to Patient Safety within the usual timeframe. Otherwise, after study treatment completion (i .e. after any scheduled post treatment follow-up period has ended) there is no obligation to actively report information on new AEs or SAEs occurring in former study patients. This includes new AEs/SAEs in patients still being followed up for survival but who have co mpleted the post treatment follow up period (30 days). 6.3.2 Follow-up of Unresolved AEs Any SAE or non-serious AE that is ongoing at the time of the 30-day follow up, must be followed up to resolution unless the event is considered by the Investigator to be unlikely to resolve, or the patient is lost to follow up. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 6.3.3 Variables The following variables will be collect for each AE: ∀ AE (verbatim) ∀ The date and time when the AE started and stopped ∀ CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade ∀ Whether the AE is serious or not ∀ Investigator causality rating against the study treatment (yes or no)"
74,page_74,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Olaparib, AZD2281, KU-0059436 Study Code D0816C00014 Version 4.0Date15 October 2020 74 (150)∀ Action taken with regard to study treatment ∀ Treatment administered with the following as a result of the AE: antibiotics oral, antibiotics I.V., red blood cell transfusion, platelet transfusion, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or G- CSF, erythropoietin, anticoagulan t p.o., parenteral anticoagulant ∀ AE caused patient’s withdrawal from study (yes or no) ∀ Outcome. In addition, the following vari ables will be collected for SAEs: ∀ Date AE met criteria for serious AE ∀ Date Investigator became aware of serious AE ∀ AE is serious due to ∀ Date of hospitalisation ∀ Date of discharge ∀ Probable cause of death ∀ Date of death ∀ Autopsy performed ∀ Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) ∀ Causality assessment in relation to Other medication ∀ Description of AE. Severity of AE For each episode of an AE, all changes to th e CTCAE grade attained as well as the highest attained CTCAE grade should be reported. It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 6.2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of"
75,page_75,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Olaparib, AZD2281, KU-0059436 Study Code D0816C00014 Version 4.0Date15 October 2020 75 (150)disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2. The grading scales found in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE version 4 will be utilised for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assigned CTCAE grades the recommendation is that the CTCAE criteria that convert mild, moderate, and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used. A copy of the CTCAE version can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov). 6.3.4 Causality Collection The Investigator will assess causal relationship between study treatment and each AE, andanswer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study treatment product?’ For SAEs causal relationship will also be assesse d for other medication and study procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A to the Clinical Study Protocol. 6.3.5 AEs Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the patien t or reported in response to the open question from the study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?’ , or revealed by observati on will be collected and recorded in the CRF. When collecting AEs, the rec ording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 6.3.6 AEs Based on Examinations and Tests The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore onl y be reported as AEs if one of the following is met: !Any criterion for an SAE is fulfilled !Causes study treatment discontinu ation !Causes study tr eatment interruption"
76,page_76,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Olaparib, AZD2281, KU-0059436 Study Code D0816C00014 Version 4.0Date15 October 2020 76 (150)!Causes study treatment dos e reduction !The Investigator believes that the abnor mality s hould be re ported as an AE. If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clin ical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting Investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low haemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non- mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. 6.3.7 Hy’s Law Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3 X ULN together with TBL ≥2 X ULN may need to be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix C : Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law. 6.3.8 Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to the disease for which the study treatment is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under studyshould be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study. 6.3.9 New Cancers The development of a new primary cancer (including skin cancer) should be regarded as an AE (see Section 6.1.1 ). New primary malignancies are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the inclusion of the patient into the study. They do not include metastases of the original cancer. Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are considered to be disease progression. 6.3.10Lack of Efficacy When there is deterioration in the cancer, for which the study treatment(s) is being used, there may be uncertainty as to whether this is lack of efficacy or an AE. In such cases, unless AstraZeneca or the reporting physician considers that the study tr eatment c ontributed to the"

The report should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death. This information can be captured in the ‘death eCRF’. ∀ Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE. A post mortem maybe helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to AstraZeneca within the usual timeframes. 6.4 Reporting of Serious AEs All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the study treatment, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF. If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately. Investig ators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it."

If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator/study site personnel how to proceed. Investigators or other site personnel send relevant CRF modules by fax to the designated AstraZeneca representative. The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the AstraZeneca drug. 6.5 Overdose There is currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose with Olaparib and possible symptoms of overdose are not established. Study treatment must only be used in accordance with the dosing recommendations in this protocol. Any dose or frequency of dosing that exceeds the dosing regimen specified in this protocol should be reported as an overdose. Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomat ically a nd should be managed appropriately. ∀ An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE m odules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module. ∀ An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF module. If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site. For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply, see Section 6.4. For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days."

The outcomes of any conception occurring from the date of the first dose of study medication until 1 month after the last dose of study medication must be followed up and documented. Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study treatment under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnorma lity) should be followed up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study. If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZen eca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies. The same timelines apply when outcome information is available. 6.6.2 Paternal Exposure Not applicable. 6.7 Management of Study Treatment Related Toxicities (Dose Reductions) Any toxicity observed during the course of the study could be managed by interruption of the dose of study treatment or dose reductions. Re peat dose interruptions are allowed as required, for a maximum of 4 weeks on each occasion. If the interruption is any longer, the study team must be informed. Study treatment can be dose reduced to 250 mg bd as a first step and to 200 mg bd as a second step. If the reduced dose of 200 mg bd is not tolerable, no further dose reduction is allowed and study treatment should be discontinued. Patients known to be intolerant of the standard dose of the tablet formulation, based on previous use, may start on a dose of 250 mg Olap arib/placebo bd. They may then step down"

Investigator judgement to continue study treatment with supportive treatment (e.g., transfusion) or interrupt dose for a maximum of 4 weeks. If repeat Hb <10 but ≥8 g/dL, dose interrupt (for max of 4 weeks) until Hb ≥10 g/dL and upon recovery dose reduction to 250 mg bd as a first step and to 200 mg bd as a second step may be considered. Hb <8 g/dL (CTCAE Grade 3)Give appropriate supportive treatment (e.g., transfusion) and investigate causality. Interrupt study treatment for a maximum of 4 weeks until improved to Hb ≥10 g/dL. Upon recovery dose reduce to 250 mg bd as a first step and to 200 mg bd as a second step in the case of repeat Hb decrease. Common treatable causes of anaemia (e.g., iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies and hypothyroidism) should be i nvestigated and appropriately managed. In some cases management of anaemia may require blood transfusions. For cases where patients develop prolonged haematological toxicity ( ≥2 week interruption/delay in study treatment due to CTCAE grade 3 or worse anaemia and/or development of blood transfusion dependence), refer to Section 6.7.1.3 for the management of this. 6.7.1.2 Management of Neutropenia, Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia Table7 Management of Neutropenia, Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia Toxicity Study treatment dose adjustment CTCAE Grade 1-2 Investigator judgement to continue treatment or if dose interruption, this should be for a maximum of 4 weeks; appropriate supportive treatment and causality investigation CTCAE Grade 3-4 Dose interruption until recovered to CTCAE grade 1 or better for a maximum of 4 weeks.

Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF is not recommended, however, if a patient develops febrile neutropenia, study treatment should be stopped and appropriate management including G-CSF should be given according to local hospital guidelines. Please note that G-CSF should not be used within at least 24 h (7 days for pegylated G-CSF) of the last dose of study treatment unless absolutely necessary. Platelet transfusions, if ind icated, should be done according to local hospital guidelines.

If any blood parameters remain clinically abnormal after 4 weeks of dose interruption, the patient should be referred to haematologist fo r further investigations. Bone marrow analysis and/or blood cytogenetic analysis should be c onsidered at this stage according to standard haematological practice. Study treatment should be discontinued if blood counts do not recover to CTCAE grade 1 or better within 4 weeks of dose interruption. Development of a confirmed MDS or other cl onal blood disorder should be reported as an SAE and full reports must be provided by the Investigator to AstraZeneca Patient Safety. Study treatment should be di scontinued if patient’s diagnosis of MDS and/or AML is confirmed. 6.7.2 Management of Non-haematological Toxicity Repeat dose interruptions are allowed as required, for a maximum of 4 weeks on each occasion. If the interruption is any longer than this the study monitor must be informed."

Study treatment can be dose reduced to 250 mg bd as a first step and to 200 mg bd as a second step. Treatment must be interrupted if any NCI-CTCAE grade 3 or 4 AE occurs which the Investigator considers to be related to administration of study treatment. 6.7.2.1 Management of New or Worsening Pulmonary Symptoms If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e .g., dyspnoea) or radiolog ical abnormalities occur in the absence of a clear diagnosis, an interruption in study treatment dosing is recommended and further diagnostic workup (including a high resolution CT scan) should be performed to exclude pneumonitis. Following investigation, if no evidence of abnormality is observed on CT imaging and symptoms resolve, then st udy treatment can be restarted, if deemed appropriate by the Investigator. If significant pulmonary abnormalities are identified, these need to be discussed with the Study Physician. 6.7.2.2 Management of Nausea and Vomiting Events of nausea and vomiting are known to be associated with Olaparib treatment. In study D0810C00019 nausea was reported in 71% of the Olaparib treated patients and in 36% of the placebo treated patients, and vomiting was repor ted in 34% of the Olaparib treated patients and in 14% of the placebo treated patients. Thes e events are generally mild to moderate (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) severity, intermittent and manageable on continued treatment. The first onset generally occurs in the first month of treatment for nausea and within the first 6 months of treatment for vomiting. For nausea, the incidence generally plateaus at around 9 months, and for vomiting at around 6 to 7 months. No routine prophylactic anti-emetic treatment is required at the start of study tr eatment; however, patients should receive appropriate anti-emetic treatment at the first onset of nausea or vomiting and as required thereafter, in accordance with local treatment practice guidelines. Alternatively, study treatment tablets can be taken with a light meal/snack (e.g., 2 pieces of toast or a couple of biscuits). As per international guidance on anti-emetic use in cancer patients (European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO], National Comprehens ive Cancer Network [NCCN]), generally a single agent antiemetic should be considered e.g., dopamine receptor antagonist, antihistamines or dexamethasone. 6.7.2.3 Interruptions for Intercurrent Non-Toxicity Related Events Study treatment dose interruption for conditions other than toxicity resolution should be kept as short as possible.

All dose reductions and interruptions (including any missed doses), and the reasons for the reductions/interruptions are to be recorded in the eCRF. Study treatment should be stopped at least 3 da ys prior to planned surgery. After surgery study treatment can be restarted when the wound has healed. No stoppage of study treatment is required for any needle biopsy procedure. Study treatment should be discontinued for a minimum of 3 days before a patient undergoes radiation treatment. Study treatment should be restarted within 4 weeks as long as any bone marrow toxicity has recovered. Because the AEs related to Olaparib may include asthenia, fatigue, and dizziness, patients should be advised to use caution while driving or using machinery if these symptoms occur.

Manufacturer will also be included in the Quality section of the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier. 7.2 Dose and Treatment Regimens For all centres, study treatment tablets will be packed in high-density polyethylene bottles with child-resistant closures. Each container will contain sufficient medication for at least 28 days plus overage. Study tr eatment w ill be dispensed to patients on Day 1 and every 28 days for the first 12 weeks, and then 12 weekly thereafter until the patient completes the study, withdraws from the study or closure of the study. Study treatment is available as a film-coated tablet containing 150 mg or 100 mg of Olaparib, or placebo. Patients will be administered study treatment orally bd at 300 mg bd continually, or lower if 300 mg is not tolerated on initial PARPi tr eatment. Two x 150 mg Olaparib (or placebo) study treatment tablets s hould be taken at the same time each day, approximately 12 hours apart with one glass of water. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved or divided. Study treatment tablets can be taken with or without food. If vomiting occurs shortly after the study treatment tablets are swallowed, the dose should only be replaced if all of the intact tablets can be seen and counted. Should any patient enrolled on the study miss a scheduled dose for whatever reason (e.g., as a result of forgetting to take the tablets or vomiting), the patient will be allowed to take the scheduled dose up to a maximum of 2 hours after that scheduled dose time. If greater than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose is not to be taken and the patient should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time. Unless patients experience unacceptable toxicit y or withdraw from the study treatment or from the protocol, patients should continue to receive study treatment until there is objective radiological disease progression as assessed by RE CIST 1.1 or as long as in the Investigator’s opinion they are benefiting from treatment a nd they do not meet any other discontinuation criteria. Once patients have been discontinued from study treatment, other treatment options will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Patients and Investigators will not be routinely un-blinded"

No cross-over to Olaparib is permitted for patients who have progressed on the placebo treatment arm. Dose Reductions For guidance on dose reductions for management of AEs refer to Section 6.7. For guidance on dose reductions when concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided see Section 7.7. Renal Impairment If subsequent to study entry and while still on st udy therapy, a patient’s estimated CrCl falls below the threshold for study inclusion ( ≥51 mL/min), retesting should be performed promptly. A dose reduction is recommended for patients who develop moderate renal impairment (calculated CrCl by Cockcroft-Gault equation of between 31 and 50 mL/min) for any reason during the course of the study: the dose of study treatment should be reduced to 200 mg bd. Because the CrCl determination is only an estimate of renal function, in instances where the CrCl falls to between 31 and 50 mL/min, the Investigator should use his or her discretion in determining whether a dose change or discontinuation of therapy is warranted. Olaparib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease; if patients develop severe impairment or end stage disease is it recommended that study treatment be discontinued. 7.3 Labelling Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local regulatory guidelines. The labels will ful fil GMP Annex 13 requirements for labelling. Label text will be translated into local language. Specific dosing instructions will not be included on the label; the site must complete the “Patient Dispensing Card” with the details of the dosing instructions at the time of dispensing. The patient emergency contact details will not be on the label, but can be found in the informed consent and the “Patient Dispensing Card”. For emergency purposes the patient must be in possession of the emergency contact details at all times. 7.4 Storage All study drugs should be kept in a secure place under appropriate storage conditions. The study treatment label on the bottl e specifies the appropriate storage."

The administration of all study drugs (including investigational products) should be recorded in the appropriate sections of the Case Report Form. Patients should be given clear instructions on how and when to take their study treatment. Patients will self-administer study treatment. Study site staff will make tab let counts at regular intervals during treatment. Compliance will be assessed by the tablet count and the information will be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF. After the tablet count has been performed, the remaining tablets will not be returned to the patient but will be retained by the investigative site until reconciliation is completed by the study monitor. All patients must return their bottle(s) of study treatment at the appropriate scheduled visit, when a new bottle will be dispensed. Patients will be instructed to notify study site personnel of missed doses. Dates of missed or held doses will be recorded by the patient on their patient diary andby the site staff on the eCRF. Patients must return all containers and any remaining tablets at the end of the study. 7.6 Accountability The study drug provided for this study is for use only as directed in the study protocol. It is the Investigator/institution’s responsibility to establish a system for handling study tr eatments, including IPs, so as to ensure that: ∀ Deliveries of such products from AstraZeneca or its representative are correctly received by a responsible person ∀ Such deliveries are recorded ∀ Study treatments are handled and st ored safely and properly as stated on the label ∀ Study treatments are only dispensed to patients in accordance with the protocol. The study personnel will account for all study drugs dispensed to and returned from the patient. At the end of the study, it must be possible to reconcile delivery records with records of usage and destroyed/returned stock. Records of usage should include the identification of the person to whom the study treatment wa s dispensed, the quantity and date of dispensing and unused study treatment returned to the Investigat or.

Any discrepancies must be accounted for on the appropriate forms. Certificates of delivery and return must be signed, preferably by the Investigator or a pharmacist, and copies retained in the Investigator site file. Dispensing and accountability records will continue to be collected for as long as patients continue to receive study treatment, although they will not be entered on the database after the database has closed. Study site personnel, if applicable, or the AZ monitor will account for all study drugs received at the site, unused study drugs and for appropriate destruction. Certificates of delivery, and destruction should be signed. 7.7 Concomitant and Other Treatments The use of any natural/herbal products or other traditional remedies should be discouraged, but use of these products, as well as use of all vitamins, nutritional supplements, and all other concomitant medications must be recorded in the CRF. All concomitant medications will be collected at screening. At subsequent visits, only antibiotics, anti-emetics, transfusions, erythropoietin, G-CSF a nd concomitant medications associated with an AE will be collected. Medications That May NOT Be Administered No other anti-cancer therapy (chemother apy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy (hormone replacement therapy is acceptable), radiotherapy, bi ological therapy or other novel agent) is to be permitted while the patient is receiving study medication. Live virus and live bacterial vaccines should not be administered whilst the patient is receiving study medication and during the 30 da y follow up period. An increased risk of infection by the administration of live virus and bacterial vaccines has been observed with conventional chemotherapy drugs and the effects with Olaparib are unknown. Restricted Concomitant Medications Strong or Moderate CYP3A inhibitors Known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, boosted protease inhibitors, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (ciprofloxacin, erythromyci n, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil) should not be taken with study treatment. If there is no suitable alternative concomitan t medication then the dos e of study treatment should be reduced for the period of concomitant administration. The dose reduction of study treatment should be recorded in the CRF with the reason documented as concomitant CYP3A inhibitor use. ∀ Strong CYP3A inhibitors – reduce the dose of study treatment to 100 mg bd for the duration of concomitant therapy with the strong inhibitor and for 5 half lives afterwards."

Strong or moderate CYP3A inducers Strong (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine, enzalutamide, and St John’s Wort) and moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil) of CYP3A shoul d not be taken with study treatment. If the use of any strong or moderate CYP3A indu cers are considered necessary for the patient’s safety and welfare this could diminish the clinical efficacy of Olaparib. If a patient requires use of a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer then they must be monitored carefully for any change in efficacy of study treatment. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitorsIt is possible that co-administration of P-gp inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, azithromycin) may increase exposure to Olaparib. Ca ution should therefore be observed. Effect of Olaparib on other drugsBased on limited in vitro data, Olaparib may increase the exposure to substrates of CYP3A4, P-gp, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), organic cation transporters (OCT1, OCT2), organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), and multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE1, MATE2K.). Based on limited in vitro data, Olaparib may reduce the exposure to substrates of CYP3A4, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and P-gp. The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced if co-administered with Olaparib. Caution should therefore be observed if substr ates of these isoenzymes or transporter proteins are co-administered. Examples of substrates include: ∀ CYP3A4 – hormonal contraceptive, simvastatin, cisapride, cyclosporine, ergot alkaloids, fentanyl, pimozide, sirolimus, tacrolimus and quetiapine ∀ CYP2B6 – bupropion, efavirenz"

Anticoagulant Therapy Patients who are taking warfarin may participate in this trial; however, it is recommended that prothrombin time, INR and APTT be monitored carefully at least once per week for the first month, then monthly if the INR is stable. Subcutaneous heparin is permitted. Anti-emetics/Anti-diarrhoeal Drugs From screening onwards, should a patient develop nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea, then these symptoms should be reported as AEs (see Section 6.3) and appropriate treatment of the event given. Palliative Radiotherapy Palliative radiotherapy may be used for the treatment of pain at the site of bony metastases that were present at baseline, provided the Investigator does not feel that these are indicative of clinical disease progression during the study period. Study treatment should be discontinued for a minimum of 3 days before a patient undergoes therapeutic palliative radiation treatment. Study treatment should be restarted within 4 weeks as long as any bone marrow toxicity has recovered. Administration of Other Anti-Cancer Agents Patients must not receive any other concurrent anti-cancer therapy, including investigational agents, while on study treatment. Patients may continue the use of bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone disease and corticosteroi ds for the symptomatic control of brain metastases provided the dose is stable before and during the study and they were started at least 4 weeks prior to beginning study treatment.

Reasons for starting subsequent anti-cancer therapies including access to other PARP inhibitors or investigational drugs will be collected and included in th e analysis of overall survival. 7.7.1 Other Concomitant Treatment Other medication other than that described above, which is considered necessary for the patient’s safety and wellbeing, may be given at the discretion of the Investigator and recorded in the appropriate sections of the CRF. In addition, any unplanned diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedure performed during the study period must be recorded in the CRF. 7.8 Post Study Access to Study Treatment Not applicable. 8 STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY ASTRAZENECA VENDOR 8.1 Statistical Considerations All personnel involved with the analysis of th e study will remain bli nded to study treatment until database lock and protocol violators are identified. Data cut off and subsequent database lock for the Primary Analysis will occur after the later of the two cohorts reaches the defined number of progression or death events. Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives. A comprehensive SAP will be prepared and any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments completed prior to un-blinding of the data. Further details of the analyses will be provided in the SAP. 8.2 Sample Size Estimate The benefit of Olaparib maintenance retreatment over matching placebo will be evaluated through the primary endpoint of PFS and supporting secondary endpoints. Recently published data (Study 19, NOVA, SOLO2) of PARPi therapy following a second or subsequent line of platinum based chemotherapy indicated a median PFS of less than 5.5 months can be expected in the placebo treated patients (see Table 1 ), irrespective of whether they are BRCA1/2 (+ve) or BRCA1/2 (-ve). In the BRCA1/2 (+ve) cohort it is assumed that the median PFS from randomisation for patients in the placebo arm will be approximately 4.5 months. In total, 85 progression or death events from 120 patients will have 85% power to demonstrate significant PFS benefit at the 2-CCI"

An observed HR of 0.63 or less will be required to achieve this level of significance. Assuming 34 months of non-linear recruitment, 85 events are expected to occur approximately 41 months after the first patient in (FSI) is enrolled into this cohort of the study. In the BRCA1/2 (-ve) cohort it is assumed that the median PFS from randomisation for patients in the placebo arm will be approximately 4.5 months. In total, 74 progression or death events from 108 patients will have 80% power to demonstrate significant PFS benefit at the 2- sided 5% level if the assumed true treatment effect resulted in a HR of 0.5; this translates to a 4.5 month (100%) increase in median PFS beyond the 4.5 months expected for patients on placebo, if PFS is exponentially distributed and allowing for a 10% drop-out rate. An observed HR of 0.61 or less will be required to achieve this level of significance.. Assuming 36 months of non-linear recruitment, 74 ev ents are expected to occur approximately 42 months after the FSI is enrolled into this cohort of the study. Considering both cohorts it is expected that approximately 228 patients in total will be enrolled into the study. 8.3 Definitions of Analysis Sets 8.3.1 Full Analysis Set (Intent-to-Treat Principle) The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomised patients and will compare the treatment groups on the basis of randomised treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. Patients who were randomised but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment are included in the full analysis set (FAS). Therefore, all efficacy and HRQoL data will be summarised and analysed using the FAS on an ITT basis as the primary analysis set. Demographic and baseline characteristics will also be analysed using the FAS on an ITT basis. 8.3.2 Safety Analysis Set All patients who received at least one dose of randomised study tr eatment, Olaparib or placebo, will be included in the safety analysis set. If a patient receives at least one dose of Olaparib study treatment they will be summarised in the Olaparib arm for safety summaries (e.g., Olaparib arm will include patients randomised to Olaparib who receive at least one dose of Olaparib or placebo patients who receive at leas t one dose of Olaparib study treatment in error at any time). If a patient randomised to Olaparib receives only placebo treatment then the patient will be summarised as a part of the placebo arm. 8.3.3 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set Not applicable."

Patients who have not progressed or di ed at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST assessment. However, if the patient progresses or dies after two or more missed visits, the patient will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment. Given the scheduled visit assessment scheme two missing visits will equ ate to more than 26 weeks since the previous RECIST assessment, allowing for early and late visits. If the patient has no evaluable visits or does not have a baseline assessment they will be censored at day 1 unless they die within two visits of baseline (25 weeks allowing for visit window). The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates not visit dates. RECIST assessments/scans contributing towards a particular visit may be performed on different dates.

(b) When censoring a patient for PFS the patient will be censored at the latest of the RECIST assessment/scan dates contributing to a particular overall visit assessment. Overall visit assessments will be determined for each assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) and will contribute to the derivation of PFS. Objective progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions (compared to previous minimum sum) and an absolute increase of >5 mm, or an overall non-target lesion assessment of progression or a new lesion. 8.4.2 Overall Survival OS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Note: Survival calls will be made in the week following the DCO date for the analysis, and if patients are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is post the DCO date these patients will be censored at the date of DCO. 8.4.3 Time to Subsequent Therapies As a supportive summary to PFS, time to start of first subsequent therapy or death will be assessed. Time to first subsequent therapy or death is defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the earlier of first subsequent therapy start date, or death date. Any patient not known to have had a further subsequent therapy or death will be censored at the last known time to have not received subsequent ther apy. If a patient terminated the study for reason other than death before first subsequent therapy, these patients will be censored at the earliest of their last known to be alive and termination dates. Additionally, time to start of second subsequent therapy or death will be assessed. Time to second subsequent therapy or death is defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the earlier of the date of second subsequent therapy start date, or death date. Any patient not known to have had a further second subsequent therapy or death will be censored at the last known time to have not received second subsequent therapy.

Time to progression by RECIST or CA-125 or death is defined as the time from randomisation to the earlier date of RECIST progression or CA-125 progression or death by any cause. Patients without a CA-125 progre ssion or a RECIST progression who are still alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of their last evaluable RECIST assessment and/or their last available CA -125 measuremen t, whichever is the earliest at the time of analysis. Patients that do not have any evalu able RECIST assessments or any CA-125 results post randomisation will be censored at the date of randomisation. 8.4.6 Calculation or Derivation of HRQoL Endpoints The FACT-O consists of 39 questions: the 27 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy –General (FACT-G) items and 12 Additional Concerns items consisting of specific ovarian cancer symptoms). The questionnaire will be scored into subscales according to the FACIT scoring guidelines as follows:- ∀ Physical Well-Being (PWB): Score range 0-28"

The higher the score, the better the HRQoL for all subscales. Missing items will be dealt with as described in the FACIT Administration and Scoring Guidelines. If at least 50% of items in a subscale have been answered the subscale score will be prorated. Subscale scores will be missing if less than 50% of items within that subscale have been answered. Total scores will only be calculated if all component subscales have valid scores. The reason for any missing assessment will be collected in the CRF. The subscale of primary interest will be the TOI score. Other subscales will be considered as exploratory. Change from baseline scores will be calculated at each visit.Four outcome measures will be calculated: ∀ Change from baseline score ∀ The actual change from baseline score will be derived for each visit where there is available data. For example; at visit X, the calculation will be (subscale score at visit X – Baseline subscale score). Actual change from baseline for the individual subscale scores will be calculated in a similar way. Subscale-specific minimally important differences (MID) will be used for interpretation where available ( Yost and Eton 2005 ). ∀ Proportion of patients with a PRO response (improved PRO Score) The proportion of patients with an improved score ( ≥MID points change from baseline), worsened ( ≤MID points change from baseline) or no change (changes of less than MID points in either direction) will be calculated at each vi sit.

It will be derived as the best symptom improvement response the patient achieved, based on evaluable QoL data collected from randomisation up to the earliest of starting any subsequent cancer therapy or death. Therefore, the following criteria will be used to assign a best overall score response for each patient based on the individual visit responses ( Table ). Table 9 HRQoL: Best Overall Score Best overall score response Criteria Improved Two visit responses of “improved” a minimum of 28 days apart without an intervening visit response of “worsened” No change Does not qualify for overall score response of “improved”.

Other Does not qualify for one of the above. An improvement rate (in the absence of subsequent cancer therapy) will be calculated as the % of all analysed patients with a best overall score response of improved.

SAEs and deaths will be summarised and listed. Each AE event rate (per 1000 patient years) will also be summarised by preferred term within each system organ class. For each preferred term, the event rate will be presented and will be defined as the number of patients with that AE divided by the sum of the duration from the start of treatment to 30 days after the last tr eatment dose (for patients without the event) and the time to the AE (for patients with the event) in each group multiplied by 1000. Haematology and clinical chemistry will be summarised by treatmen t group for change from baseline using descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and number of observations) and by worst grade during the treatment period using descriptive statistics (frequency and percent). Shift tables for change in grade from baseline by treatment group may be presented. For all laboratory variables which are included in the current version of CTCAE, the grade will be calculated. Vital signs will be summarised by tr eatment group using descriptive statistics ( mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and number of patients). 8.5.3 Subgroup Analysis In the final analysis of PFS and other time-to-event endpoints, subgroup analyses may be conducted to assess consis tency of treatm ent effect across potential or expected prognostic factors. An analysis will not be performed if there are too few events available for a meaningful analysis of a particular subgroup (i.e., if there are less than 20 events in a subgroup). Pre-specified subgroups will be described in the SAP. 8.5.4 Interim Analysis In the BRCA1/2 (+ve) cohort an interim analysis for fut ility will be pe rformed after 50% of the target PFS events (i.e. after 43 events). Based upon the assumed accrual and event rate it isestimated that this will occur after approximately 29 months. Using a conditional power non binding futility analysis the c ohort may stop for fu tility if the hazard ratio > 1.056. Under the null hypothesis the probab ility of st opping for fut ility is 0.433 and under the alternative hypothesis it is 0.01.

In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a patient. For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an Investigator might know a patient’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic data. Also Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the patient’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate. 10.3 Ethics and Regulatory Review An Ethics Committee should approve the final study protocol, including the final version of the Informed Consent Form and any other written information and/or m aterials to be provided to the patients. The Investigator will ensure the distribution of these documents to the applicable Ethics Co mmit tee, and to the study site staff. The opinion of the Ethics Committee should be given in writing. The Investigator should submit the written approval to AstraZeneca before enrolment of any patient into the study. The Ethics Committee should approve all advertising used to recruit patients for the study. AstraZeneca should approve any m odifications to the Informed Consent Form that are needed to meet local requirements. If required by local regulations, the protocol should be re-approved by the Ethics Committee annually. Before enrolment of any patient into the study, the final study protocol, including the final version of the Informed Consent Form, is a pproved by the national regulatory authority or a notification to the national regulatory authori ty is done, according to local regulations. AstraZeneca will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the national regulatory authorities. AstraZeneca will provide Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Co mmit tees, and Principal Investigators with safety updates/reports according to local requirements. Each Principal Investigator is responsible for providing the Ethics Co mmittees with reports of any serious and unexpected adverse drug reacti ons from any other study conducted with the study treatment. AstraZeneca will provide this information to the Principal Investigator so that he/she can meet these reporting requirements. 10.4 Informed Consent The Principal Investigato r(s) at each centre will:"

Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study ar e not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the st udy, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. ∀ Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatment ∀ Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment wi th N-acetylcysteine ∀ Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm ∀ Blood dyscras ias (e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation ∀ Development of drug dependency or drug abuse"

Exposure to suspect drug. Has the patient actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? ∀ Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties? ∀ De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug? ∀ No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. ∀ Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge. ∀ Laboratory tests. A specific laborat ory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship. In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: ∀ Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug? ∀ Is there a known mechanism? Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the case, it is likely that the event( s) will be assessed as ‘not related’."

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry. The Investigator is respons ible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. HL criteria are met if ther e is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than drug-induced liver in jury (DILI) caused by the investigational medicinal product (IMP). The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. Definitions Potential Hy’s Law AST or ALT ≥3 X ULN together with TBL ≥2 X ULN at any point during the study following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in ALP. Hy’s LawAST or ALT ≥3 X ULN together with TBL ≥2 X ULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, e.g., elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur. Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases In order to identify cases of PHL it is im portant to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination:"

INTRODUCTION This appendix details the implementation of RECIST 1.1 Guidelines ( Eisenhauer et al 2009 ) for the D0816C00014 study with regards to Investigator assessment of tumour burden including protocol-specific requirements for this study. 2. DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE, NON-MEASURABLE, TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study. Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable lesion which has not been previously irradiated and not chosen for biopsy during the screening period. Measurable: A lesion, not previously irradiated and not chosen for biopsy during the screening period, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. If only one measurable lesion exists, it is acceptable to be us ed (as a target lesion) as long as it has not been previously irradiated and baseline tumour assessment scans are done at least 14 days after the screening biopsy is performed. Non-measurable: ∀ All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15mm short axis at baseline*). ∀ Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural / pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by CT or MRI. ∀ Previously irradiated lesions** ∀ Skin lesions assessed by clinical examination ∀ Brain metastasis"

Therefore, lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and must be selected as Non-Target Lesions (NTL) at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment. Special Cases: ∀ Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic–blast ic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, can be consider ed measurable if the soft tissue component meets th e definition of measurability. Blastic lesions are considered non-measurable. ∀ Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for measurability from a radi ological point of view, but if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these should be selected as target lesions. Target lesions: A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as target lesions (TL) at baseline. Non-Target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline. 3. METHODS OF ASSESSMENT The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow-up visits."

App. Table 1 Summary of Methods of Assessment Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions CT (preferred) MRICT (preferred) MRI Clinical examination X-ray, Chest x-ray*CT (preferred) MRI Clinical examination X-ray, Chest x-ray*Ultrasound*Bone Scan*FDG-PET* *Not mandatory per D0816C00014 protocol; can be used if clinically indicated and are acceptable methods for New lesion identification. 3.1. CT and MRI CT and MRI are generally considered to be the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure TL selected for response assess ment and to assess N TL and identification of any new lesions. In the D0816C00014 study it is recommended that CT examinations of the Chest, abdomen and pelvis, will be used to assess tumour burden at baseline and follow-up visits. CT examination with intravenous (i.v.) contrast media administration is the preferred method. MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or it is medically contra-indicated. For brain lesion assessment, MRI is the preferred method although CT is acceptable. 3.2. Clinical examination In the D0816C00014 study, clinical examination will not be used for assessment of TL. Clinically detected lesions can be selected as target lesions if they are assessed by CT or MRI scans. Clinical examination can be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions. 3.3. X-ray 3.3.1. Chest X-ray In the D0816C00014 study, chest x-ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL as they will be assessed by CT examination or MRI examination. Chest X-ray can, however, be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions."

Plain X-ray In the D0816C00014 study plain x-ray may be used as a method of assessment for bone NTL and to identify the presence of new bone lesions. 3.4. Ultrasound In the D0816C00014 study, ultrasound examination will not be used for assessment of TL and NTL as it is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accur ate assessmen t of tumour size and it is subjective and operator dependent. Ultrasound examination can, however, be used to identify the presence of new lesions. If new clinical symptoms occur and an ultrasound is performed then new lesions should be confirmed by CT or MRI examination. 3.5. Endoscopy and laparoscopy In the D0816C00014 study, e ndoscopy and laparoscopy will not be used for tumour assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumour assessment. 3.6. Tumour markers In the D0816C00014 study tumour markers wi ll not be used for tumour res ponse assessments as per RECIST 1.1. 3.7. Cytology and histology In the D0816C00014 study histology will not be used as part of the tumour response assessment as per RECIST 1.1. Cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment is required when the measurable tumour has met criteria for response or stable disease. In such circumstances, the cy tology is necessary to differentiate between response / stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease (if the neoplastic origin of the fluid is confirmed). Where cytology findings are not available, any effusion that significantly wors ens (from trace to large) or appearance of clinically significant effusion (requiring change in drug therapy) during the study treatment will be considered to be progression of NTL, or disease progression due to new lesions. 3.8. Isotopic bone scan Bone lesions identified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by CT, MRI or X- ray at baseline should be recorded as NTL and followed by the same method as per baseline assessment. In the D0816C00014 study isotopic bone scans may be used as a method of assessment to identify the presence of new bone lesions at fo llow-up visits. New lesions will be recorded"

The Investigator should consider the positive hot-spot to be a significant new site of malignant disease and represent true disease progression in order to record the new lesion. Confirmation by CT, MRI and x- ray is recommended where bone scan findings are equivocal. 3.9. FDG-PET scan In the D0816C00014 study FDG-PET scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, according with the following al gorithm: New lesions w ill be recorded where there is positive FDG uptake* not present on baseline FDG-PET scan or in a location corresponding to a new lesion on CT/MRI at the same follow-up visit. If there is no baseline FDG-PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on CT/MRI scans then follow-up CT/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical indicated, in order to confirm new lesions. * A positive FDG-PET scan lesion should be re ported only when an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue is observed. 4. TUMOUR RESPONSE EVALUATION 4.1. Schedule of evaluation Baseline assessments should encompass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the disease under evaluation and should additionally investigate areas that may be involved based on signs and symptoms of individual patients and should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment (refer to Study Plan and section 5.1 from the study protocol). Follow-up assessments will be performed every 12 weeks (± 1 week) after randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 even if a patient discontinues treatment prior to progression or receives other anti-cancer treatment. Any other sites at which new disease is suspected s hould also be adequately imaged at follow-up. If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the patient has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their scheduled visits. This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some patients being assessed at a different frequency than other patients. 4.2. Target lesions (TL) 4.2.1. Documentation of target lesions A maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including lymph nodes), representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline."

It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected. The site and location of each TL should be docu mented as well as the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes). All measurements should be recorded in millimeters. At baseline the sum of the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters. Special cases: ∀ For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter. For pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis. ∀ If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is > 5mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan. ∀ If a lesion has completely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. ∀ If a TL splits into two or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts. ∀ If two or more TL merge then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be recorded for one of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion(s). ∀ If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5mm should be assigned. If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, even if it is below 5mm. ∀ If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an estimate of the size of the lesion. ∀ When a TL has had any intervention e.g. radiotherapy, embolisation, surgery etc., during the study, the size of the TL should st ill be provided where possible."

Evaluation of target lesions This section provides the definitions of the cr iteria used to determine objective tumour visit response for TL. App. Table 2 Evaluation of target lesions Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the target lesions were not assessed or not evaluable or had a lesion intervention at this visit. Note: If the sum of diameters meets the progressive disease criteria, progressive disease overrides not evaluable as a target lesion response 4.3. Non-Target lesions (NTL) 4.3.1. Evaluation of non-target lesions All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline. Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status should be followed at subsequent visits. At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response should be recorded by the Investigator. This section provide s the definitions of the criteria used to determine and record overall response for NTL at the investigational site at each visit."

All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). Non CR/Non PD Persistence of one or more NTL Progression (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression may be due to an important progression in one lesion only or in several lesions. In all cases the progression MUST be clinically significant for the physician to consider changing (or stopping) therapy. Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant when one or some of the non-target lesions were not assessed and, in the Investigator's opinion, they are not able to provide an evaluable overall non-target lesion assessment at this visit. Note: For patients without target lesions at baseline, this is relevant if any of the non-target lesions were not assessed at this visit and the progression criteria have not been met. To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of non-target lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest ‘increas e’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 4.4. New Lesions Details of any new lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment. The presence of one or more new lesions is assessed as progression. A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumour. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumour assessments should be continued until the new lesion has been confirmed. If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then the progression date should be declared using the date of the initial scan."

Symptomatic deterioration Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy. Patients with ‘symptomatic deterioration’ requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should continue to undergo tumour assessments where possible until objective disease progression is observed. 4.6.
