Development Phase: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Efficacy objective: To assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with prurigo nodularis . Safety objective s: To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of ser lopitant in adults with prurigo nodularis . To assess whether serlopitant produces physical dependence. Study Design: This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with prurigo nodularis (PN). Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 10 weeks. After completion of the treatment period or e arly discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subjects will enter a 5- week follow- up (post-study drug observation) period. The study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of 19 weeks: • Screening period: 2 -4 weeks • Treatment period: 10 weeks • Follow-up period: 5 weeks During the screening period, all subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation and will be assessed for chronic pruritic conditions frequently associated with PN. Subjects who present with idiopathic PN at screening may req uire additional assessments as deemed necessary by the investigator (e.g. endomysial antibody with reflex to titer for subjects with signs or symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, skin biopsy for subjects with signs or symptoms of bullous pemphigoid or cut aneous T-cell lymphoma , urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori, or allergy testing ). All screening procedures must be completed within 31 days before the Baseline visit. The minimum screening period for all subjects is 14 days to allow for collection of electronic diary ( eDiary) screening data. Subjects who require a screening period longer than 14 days will have a telephone contact at least 15 days prior to the scheduled Baseline visit to remind them to complete the eDiary as previously instructed at the Screening visit. Subjects will be provided an eDiary at the S creening visit. Subjects must be willing and able to complete the eDiary every day within a consistent timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies , for the duration of the study. At the Baseline visit (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopitant 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period"

Planned or anticipated major surgical procedure or other activity that would interfere with the subject’s ability to comply with protocol -mandated assessments (e.g. extended international travel) during the subject’s participation in the study. Study Drug: Serlopitant 5 mg oral tablets and matching placebo. Dosage: Serlopitant: 5 mg once daily by mouth for 10 weeks, following a 3 -tablet loading dose on the first day of the treatment period. Matching placebo: Once daily by mouth for 10 weeks, following a 3 -tablet loading dose on the first day of the treatment period. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is the WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 10. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 4 • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 2 Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows : • Change from baseline in WI -NRS to other timepoints • WI-NRS 3-point responder rate at Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to Week 10 • Change from baseline in DLQI Question 1 to Week 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Stage to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 Safety Endpoints: Safety endpoints are as follows : • Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) • Change from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters following study drug exposure • Change from baseline in vital sign and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters following study drug exposure • Change from baseline in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) • Change from basel ine in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) • Assessment of physical dependence following study drug exposure, in the monitored 5-week post-drug observation period Decision Rule and Sample Size: This study will u se a 5% two-sided alpha level.

Statistical Methods: Efficacy analyses will be based upon an intent -to-treat philosophy. The primary efficacy population will be the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population that will include all randomized subjects who were dispensed study drug . Analyses performed on the Per Protocol populati on will be considered supportive. Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment group to which they are randomized . Efficacy Analyses: The primary efficacy endpoint is a binary variable taking on values of responder or non-responder. Subjects will be considered a responder if they have at least a 4-point reduction in WI -NRS between baseline and Week 10. Missing data imputation will be used for subjects who fail to complete the eDiary at Week 10, unless the subject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or the subject used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status will be defined as non -responder. The primary endpoint will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group and study week. The difference in the primary efficacy outcome measure between treatment groups will be tested using a Cochran Mantel Haenszel test controlling for the stratification factors. Testing of the key secondary efficacy endpoints will also be employed. Safety Analyses: The incidence of all adverse events ( AEs) and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated by treatment received. These AEs will be classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment- related AEs, AEs by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented. Clinical safety laboratory values will be measured by a central laboratory. Summary statistics for actual values and for changes from baseline will be tabulated for laboratory resu lts by scheduled visit. Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at any post-baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline laboratory values will be tabulated. The overall ECG assessment (abnormal or no rmal) will be summarized along with a summary of how many subjects developed a post treatment abnormal result. Summary statistics for t he HADS and ESS actual values and change from baseline will be presented by scheduled visit. In order to assess physical dependence and withdrawal, data collected during a 5 -week post-drug observation period will be summarized. Study Sites: Approximately 50 study sites. Expected Duration of Subject’s Participation : 19 weeks: 2-4 weeks of screening, 10 weeks of treatment, and a follow -up period of 5 weeks. This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) . CC CC"

Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 16 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Pruritus in Prurigo Nodularis Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a distinctive and easily diagnosable chronic skin condition characterized by the presence of multiple highly pruritic and often symmetrically distributed nodules and papules on the skin ( Jorizzo 1981). The nodules and papules in PN can range in size from approximately 0.5 to 3.0 cm and often appear hyperkeratotic , sometimes crateriform, in appearance. Plaques are occasionally present, and the lesions of PN frequently exhibit other features secondary to prolonged and severe scratching behavior, such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, erosion, ulceration, crusting, and bleeding ( Zeidler 2016). PN, a long-term reaction to the chronic scratching and picking of patients with chronic pruritus (Zeidler 2016), is a skin condition seen predominantly in older adults, with median prevalence age in the 50s and 60s and a slight female preponderance ( Iking 2013, Tan 2014, Ständer 2013) . In one patient population survey, pediatric patients accounted for <2% of the total population, with the youngest patient 11.9 years o f age (Iking 2013). Although only limited epidemiology data for PN have been published, a claims -based analysis commissioned by Menlo Therapeutics suggest that the United States (US) prevalence may be in the range of ~ 355,000 affected individuals. Based on a quantitative survey of 73 dermatologists conducted in parallel with the claims -based analysis, approximately 23% of patients with PN have an underlying atopy- related condition , while over 50% are considered to be idiopathic ( Navigant 2017). The m edian duration of disease burden has been reported to be 6-7 years ( Iking 2013, Tan 2014, Schuhknecht 2011). The dominant symptom in PN is an intense and chronic pruritus that is associated with a high degree of patient burden and restricted quality of life (QOL) ( Zeidler 2016). As measured by global scales of pruritus intensity (numeric rating scale ( NRS) and visual analog scale (VAS)), median levels of pruritus intensity have been reported to be 7-8 points ( Iking 2013, Tan 2014, Schuhknecht 2011). The pruritus experienced in PN can often prevent patients from adequately performing their daily activities (Vaidya 2008), and patients with PN have been found to suffer from greater rates of depression and anxiety than cont rol groups in numerous studies ( Jorgensen 2016, Rowland Payne 1985, Dazzi 2011). 1.2 Conditions Associated With Prurigo Nodularis As PN is considered to be a disease induced by chronic pruritus and ongoing scratching activity, a variety of chronic pruritic conditions have been i dentified as potential underlying etiologies for the pruritus, including atopic dermatitis (AD), other inflammatory or bullous skin diseases, chronic renal failure, human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) infection, hepatitis C infection, and multifactorial dis ease (i.e. two or more co- existent conditions associated with chronic pruritus) ( Fostini 2013, Lee 2005). The mechanism s linking chronic pruritus to the development of PN are not clear, as only a subset of patients with chronic pruritus develop PN, and over half of patients with PN have no underlying etiology identified. Even when specific underlying conditions are identified, management of these condition(s) does not usually result in resolution of PN signs or symptoms, nor can all underlying conditions be treated.

These data point to a high level of unmet medical need in the overall PN population, as the majority of patients with PN either have no underlying condition identified that can be treated, or treatment of the underlying condition is inadequate to control their PN ( Wallengren 2004). 1.3 Current Treatment Options for Prurigo Nodularis Treatment of PN remains a challenging and extremely frustrating experience for both patients and physicians. I n the majority of cases, responses are limited and unsatisfactory , and once the cycle of pruritus- excoriation-pruritus begins, it is difficult to stop . Identification and treatment of underlying chronic pruritic conditions is often the first step in management of PN. If this does not result in resolution of the pruritus, or if no underlying condition is identified, treatment specifically for PN and its associated pruritus is implemented. First-line pruritus therapies, including topical agents such as topical corticoster oids and calcineurin inhibitors , often provide inadequate response ( Saco 2015) and the therapeutic ladder for PN involves systemic agents with progressively riskier safety profiles . These include naltrexone, gabapentin, mirtazapine, phototherapy, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), powerful immunosuppressants such as methotrexate and cyclosporine, and thalidomide (Ständer 2015b, Spring 2014, Feldmeyer 2012, Lim 2016). None of these therapies are indicated for the treatment of PN , and their usage is often based on limited evidence, such as case reports or small open-label studies. 1.4 Substance P and the Neurokinin- 1 Receptor Repeated itching, scratching , and picking over long time periods serve as the pathophysiological basis for the development of PN. Although different underlying disease states may be responsible for the chronic pruritus , the distinctive and easily recognizable features of PN point to a common fina l pathway resulting in this unique clinical presentation . Immunohistochemical staining studies of PN biopsies have demonstrated that nerve fibers immunoreactive for Substance P (SP) are found in increased numbers in lesional skin compared to non- lesional skin or controls (Abadía Molina 1992), suggesting a role for SP signaling in PN. These findings are consistent with the robust body of evidence indicating the key role of SP signaling through its primary receptor, the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK 1-R), in the transmission of itch across multiple disease states (Santini 2012, Akiyama 2015, Crowe 1994, El-Nour 2006, Lotts 2014, Hon 2007, Ward 2004, Slattery 2011). SP is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, a group that also includes neurokinin A and neurokinin B ( Hökfelt 2001). SP has been implicated in a number of biological functions, both physiological and pathophysiological, including pruritus perception, vomiting reflex, pain perception, and immunomodulatory responses ( Lotts 2014, Andoh 1998, Steinhoff 2014). The biological actions of SP are mediated by tachykinin receptors, which consist of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains coupled to G-proteins. Three tachykinin receptors have been identified: the neurokinin-1, neurokinin-2,"
18,page_18,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 18 and neurokinin-3 receptors ( Harrison 2001). Th e NK1-R in particular has been studied in great detail. NK1-R is the primary receptor for SP in the human body, and is found on multiple cell types, include central and peripheral neurons, keratinocytes, and mast cells. NK1-R stimulation has been shown to be an important pathway for pruritus perception (Ständer 2015a ). Inhibition of this pathway results in decreased pruritus and scratching reflexes in animal models ( Akiyama 2015). Preceding the development of serlopitant for pruritus-related conditions, a commercially available NK 1-R antagonist ( Emend USPI) has been used as a therapy to decrease pruritus in patients with chronic pruritus due to etiologies such as cutaneous T -cell lymphoma ( Duval 2009, Torres 2012 , Booken 2011) and erlotinib-induced pruritus (Santini 2012, Gerber 2010). Additionally, in a study of 20 patients with chronic pruritus of various etiologies treated with aprepitant , 16/20 patients (80%) experienced a considerable reduction of itch intensity (Ständer 2010). 1.5 Serlopitant 1.5.1 Serlopitant Background and Nonclinical Summary Serlopitant is a small molecule, highly selective NK1-R antagonist that is administered orally and metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with a plasma half -life of 45-86 hours. It binds with high affinity to the human NK1-R with a dissociation constant ( Kd) of 46 pM; displacing SP binding with a half- maximal inhibition concentration (IC 50) of 61 pM. Serlopitant is a potent functional antagonist of SP-induced inositol phosphate generation. Serlopitant has been extensively studied in animal toxicology studies, including chronic toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. In non-clinical chronic toxicology studies in rats, mice and dogs, treatment related findings of potential clinical significance included increased salivation, decreased body weight gain and food consumption, slight changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters, mild increases in liver weight and mild histomorphologic changes. The histomorphologic changes were seen only in rats (not in dogs or mice) and included: very slight ovarian intersti tial cell hypertrophy, mammary gland and uterine atrophy; decreased corpora lutea; increased histiocytes in lung and mesenteric lymph nodes; slight skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration; slight increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow; and slight to moderate vacuolation in kidney tubules. These nonclinical findings occurred at systemic exposures exceeding those anticipated to provide efficacy of serlopitant for pruritus indications in humans (1 to 5 mg tablet daily). No cardiac lesions have been observed in dog toxicity studies up to 9 months in duration nor in a 3- month mouse range-finding study and 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study at exposure higher than the lowest level which caused cardiotoxicity in rats. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats for histomorphological changes in the reproductive tract, mammary gland and bone marrow provides a 2.5-fold margin for the maximum-targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily). The rat NOAEL for histomorphological changes in muscle and kidney provides a 5-fold margin for the maximum- targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily). In summary, the nonclinical toxicity noted with serlopitant provides no contraindications to the continuation of clinical trials via the oral route. Findings in the developmental toxicity"

Single doses up to 400 mg have been well tolerated in young adult males and single doses up to 25 mg have been well tolerated in the elderly. Multiple doses of up to 50 mg a day for 4 weeks have been well tolerated in healthy young males, and a single (loading) dose of 15 mg followed by daily doses of 5 mg for 2 weeks have been well tolerated in elderly males and females. Forty -one (41) subjects received 4 mg liquid filled capsule (LFC) daily (bioequivalent to 5 mg tablets) for 1 year. Plasma concentrations of serlopitant appear to increase in a dose-proportional fashion in both young males and elderly subjects (males and females). Peak plasma concentrations after a single oral dose occurred at ~2 to 4 hours in both young and elderly subjects. A single loading dose of up to 15 mg followed by 6 to 8 weeks of up to 5 mg daily doses has been well tolerated in adults with chronic pruritus and PN. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrate good plasma exposures with oral dosing, linear dose-dependent increases in plasma concentration and systemic exposure, a plasma t1/2 appropriate for once daily dosing, and mild effects of concomitant food ingestion. Central nervous system (CNS) positron emission tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated good CNS penetrance and > 90% NK1 receptor occupancy (RO) at plasma exposures anticipated to be safe and well tolerated. Three long -lived active hydroxylated metabolites are observed in humans: M1/M1a (L-001256771), M2/M2a (L-001194442), and M3 (L-001426583). These metabolites were present at lower concentrations and were 2 - to 9-fold less potent in vivo than the parent compound. The integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis concluded that these metabolites are unlikely to contribute significantly to occupancy of the CNS NK 1-R in humans. 1.5.3 Serlopitant in Pruritus -Related Studies Serlopitant has been evaluated in two completed Phase 2 studies of subjects with chronic pruritus (TCP -101 and TCP-102). TCP-101 TCP-101 was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multi-center study that compared serlopitant 0.25 mg, 1 mg, or 5 mg vs . placebo for the treatment of chronic pruritus. A total of 257 adult subjects 18-65 years of age with chronic pruritus were randomized to receive one of the four dose groups in a 1:1:1:1 randomization. Subjects received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 and thereafter received 1 tablet per day for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was itch severity as measured on a VAS, summarized as a percentage change from baseline. Mean percent decreases from Baseline in VAS score were larger in the active -treatment groups versus placebo at every scheduled post- baseline study visit. Overall, the results were the most profound for the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg groups. For the percent change from Baseline in VAS pruritus scores (the primary efficacy variable), the Week 6 pairwise least"
20,page_20,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 20 squares mean difference compared to placebo was 5.8 mm, 13.2 mm, and 14.2 mm for serlopitant 0.25 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg, respectively. The frequency of treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) and study drug related adverse events (AEs) was higher in the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg groups compared to the serlopitant 0.25 mg group, and the frequency in all three treatment groups were higher than in the placebo group. The frequency of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was comparable in the serlopitant 5 mg and placebo group and higher than in the serlopitant 0.25 mg and 1 mg groups. There was one serious adverse ev ent (SAE) reported in the serlopitant 1 mg group (spontaneous abortion, considered not related). There were no deaths. The most common AEs in the serlopitant groups were diarrhea (6.2%, 1 mg group), upper respiratory tract infection (4.7%, 0.25 mg group), somnolence (4.7%, 5 mg group), nasopharyngitis (4.6%, 1 mg group), headache (4.7%, 5 mg group), urinary tract infection (3.1%, 5 mg group), dry mouth (3.1%, 1 mg group), nausea (3.1%, 1 mg group), arthralgia (3.1%, 0.25 mg group), musculoskeletal pain (3.1%, 1 mg group) and pruritus (3.1%, 1 mg group). The most common AEs in the placebo group were headache (6.3%), nasopharyngitis (3.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.2%), urinary tract infection (3.2%) and asthma (3.2%). TCP-102 TCP-102 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled multi- center study that evaluated serlopitant 5 mg vs. placebo for the treatment of PN . A total of 128 adult subjects 18-80 years of age with PN were randomized to receive serlopitant or placebo in a 1:1 randomization. Subjects received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 followed by 1 tablet per day for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the average VAS score as recorded at the study visits. Results at Week 4 and Week 8 were the primary timepoints. Serlopitant 5 mg was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus as measured by change in average VAS from baseline. For the primary endpoint, change from baseline at Week 4 and Week 8 by repeated measures analysis, the decrease from baseline was sig nificantly greater in the serlopitant group than the placebo group, with a mean difference (serlopitant minus placebo) of -1.0 at Week 4 and - 1.7 at Week 8. The mean difference at Week 2 was also significant, -0.9. In a post -hoc analysis of the percentage of subjects who were 4-point responders on average VAS at Week 8, 25.0% of placebo subjects and 54.4% of serlopitant subjects were 4 -point responders. TEAEs were reported for 71.9% of serlopitant- treated subjects and 61.9% of placebo -treated subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the serlopitant group were nasopharyngitis (17.2% serlopitant, 3.2% placebo), diarrhea (10.9% serlopitant, 4.8% placebo), and fatigue (9.4% serlopitant, 6.3% placebo). Treatment- related TEAEs were reported fo r 48.4% of serlopitant-treated subjects and 34.9% of placebo- treated subjects. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in the serlopitant group were fatigue (7.8%) and diarrhea, peripheral edema, dizziness, and headache (each 6.3%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe TEAEs were reported for 9.4% of serlopitant -treated subjects and 4.8% of placebo-treated subjects. There were no deaths during the study. Five subjects (3 serlopitant, 2 placebo) had SAEs. The SAE s were actinic elastosis, dep ression, dizziness, and vertigo in"
21,page_21,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 21 the serlopitant group; and bradycardia, syncope, respiratory failure, and neurodermatitis in the placebo group. Nine subjects (3 serlopitant, 6 placebo) discontinued due to TEAEs. No clinically relevant changes were obser ved in chemistry, hematology, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Potential Risks and Benefits: The results of the Phase 2 studies in PN and chronic pruritus , together with the extensive nonclinical and clinical safety data and experience with serlopitant to date and the scientific rationale for NK 1-R inhibition in the treatment of pruritus, serve to support further evaluation of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in patients with PN. The potential benefits of continued clinical study outweigh the potential risks. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for further information regarding serlopitant. 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES The efficacy objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the t reatment of pruritus in adults with PN . The safety objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in adults with PN , and to assess whether serlopitant produces physical dependence. 3 STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Overall Study Design This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with PN. The study will be conducted at approximately 50 study sites. Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 10 weeks. After completion of the treatment period or early discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subj ects will enter a 5 -week follow-up (post-study drug observation) period. This study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of 19 weeks: • Screening period: 2-4 weeks • Treatment period: 10 weeks • Follow-up period: 5 weeks Informed consent will occur prior to any protocol-mandated procedures, including the stopping of any excluded therapies. This may occur prior to the Screening visit. During the screening period, all subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation and will be assessed for chronic pruritic conditions frequently associated with PN. Subjects who present"
22,page_22,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 22 with idiopathic PN at screening may require additional assessments as deemed necessary by the investigator (e.g. endomysial antibody with reflex to titer for subjects with signs or symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, skin biopsy for subjects with signs or symptoms of bullous pemphigoid or cutaneous T- cell lymphoma, urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori , or allergy testing). All screening procedures must be completed within 31 days before the Baseline visit. The minimum screening period for all subjects is 14 days to allow for collection of electronic diary (eDiary) screening data. Subjects who require screening period longer than 14 days will have a telephone contact at least 15 days prior to the scheduled Baseline visit to remind them to complete the eDiary as previously instructed at the Screening visit. Screening procedures may be deferred following discussion with the medical monitor should more than 31 days be required (e.g. to wash out of certain excluded therapies or to treat their underlying condition). Screening procedures may be repeated (i.e ., the subject may be rescreened ) following discussion with the medical monitor should the subject have had difficulty complying with eDiary assessments, require further training in the assessments, or have other relevant needs that may delay enrollment in the study but are not expected to impact safety or efficacy assessments. Subjects will be provided an eDiary at the Screening visit. Subjects must be willing and able to complete the eDiary every day within a consistent timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies, for the duration of the study. At the Baseline visit (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopitant 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). Starting on Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day. Study drug may be taken with or without food. The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 10 of treatment. Subjects who complete the 10-week treatment period and required follow-up period may be given the opportunity to enroll in a one-year open- label safety study (MTI -107) with daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg. 3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection In the TCP-102 study in pat ients with PN , serlopitant 5 mg taken daily for 8 weeks was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus , in both the overall study population as well as the subgroup of subjects with an atopic diathesis. Similarly, in the TCP -101 study in patients with chronic pruritus , serlopitant 5 mg and 1 mg taken daily for 6 weeks were superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus , in both the overall study population and the subgroup of subjects with an atopic diathesis. In both the TCP-102 and TCP-101 studies, serlopitant was generally well -tolerated and demonstrated an overall favorable safety profile at the doses evaluated."
23,page_23,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 23 The current MTI -105 study is designed to confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment o f pruritus in patients with PN. The 5 mg dose of serlopitant was selected for this study based on the favorable efficacy, safety , and tolerability profile of serlopitant at this dose level. Over 250 subjects have been exposed to serlopitant at doses of 5 mg tablet-equivalent daily for at least 6 weeks, and ~ 40 subjects have been exposed up to one year. Human CNS PET RO data for serlopitant in healthy young males (Study P002) demonstrated that a serlo pitant 5 mg LFC once daily dose is likely to achieve ~ 94 % NK1 RO at steady state. 3.3 Study Endpoints 3.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale ( WI-NRS) 4-point responder rate at Week 10. 3.3.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 4 • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 2 3.3.3 Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: • Change from baseline in WI-NRS to other timepoints • WI-NRS 3-point responder rate at Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to Week 10 • Change from baseline in DLQI Question 1 to Week 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity (IGA PN -A) to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Stage (IGA PN -S) to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 3.3.4 Safety Endpoints Safety endpoints are as follows: • Incidence of TEAEs and SAEs • Change from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters following study drug exposure"

The use of any concomitant medication must relate to the subject’s medical history or to an AE, except for vitamins/nutritional supplements, emollient use, and routine preventative immunizations. 5.7.1 Allowed Therapies and Treatment Goals for Underlying Conditions Treatment of an underlying, treatable chronic pruritic condition is allowed, if stable for at least 6 weeks prior to the Baseline visit, and continued throughout the treatment period . Treatment of the underlying systemic pruritic condition should be optimized per standard of care and treatment goals must be tailored based on age, sex, and concurrent health status and drug tolerance. While resolution of metabolic or endocrine disorders or eradication of an underlying infection may not always be feasible, every effort should be m ade to ensure the condition is well controlled, to prevent or reduce exacerbations and to prevent limitation on the activities of daily living . When applicable, laboratory evidence of control should be obtained. For example, if renal insufficiency is implicated as causal for pruritus, treatment would be expected to have meaningfully reduced the creatinine (compared to that at the time of diagnosis) and to maintain the creatinine at < 2.5 the ULN; control of diabetes is supported by a hemoglobin- A1c of < 7.5%; control of thyroid disease is supported by normalization of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or by a TSH within 1.5 times the ULN in elderly patients; iron deficiency is corrected with a serum iron within 0.8 time s the lower limit of"

Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 29 normal; eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection generally requires a negative urea breath test and fecal antigen test and endoscopy; and the viral load should be undetectable if viral infections such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or HIV were previously diagnosed. Any previously active skin disease is considered to be well controlled if it is globally considered clear or almost clear (permissible to have p ost-inflammatory pigmentation, fine scale, faint pink erythema, barely perceptible induration/papulation, and no oozing or crusting). Use of gentle cleansers and bland emollients ( including those with urea) is encouraged for all subjects. If bland emolli ent use is elected, it must be initiated at least 2 weeks (14 days) prior to Baseline visit , and continued throughout the treatment period . Treatment with non -systemic corticosteroids or antihistamines that do not involve skin application (e.g. inhaled, intranasal, ophthalmic, or intra- articular) is allowed. Leukotriene inhibitors will be permitted for treatment of conditions other than PN (e.g. asthma). 5.7.2 Excluded Therapies Initiation or use of topical therapy with corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriene, PDE-4 inhibitors is not permitted within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit or throughout the treatment period, but such therapy may be initiated during the follow-up period if needed. Initiation of bland emollient is not permitted within 2 weeks (14 days) prior to Baseline visit or throughout the treatment period, but such therapy may be initiated during the follow-up period if needed. The following therapies and activities are excluded from the Screening visit through the treatment period, and through the follow-up period: • NK1-R antagonists (other than study drug) • Systemic immunosuppressive/ immunomodulatory therapies (including but not limited to systemic corticosteroids, PDE -4 inhibitors, cyclosporine, mycophenolate -mofetil, methotrexate, azathioprine, thalidomide, interferon-gamma, or phototherapy) • Biologic therapies (other than therapies such as insulins, vaccines) • Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (See Appendix B ) • Use of an indoor tanning facility, or natural sun exposure resulting in significant tanning or sunburn • Any investigational therapy The following therapies and activities are excluded from the Screening visit through the treatment period, and use is disc ouraged, though permitted, through the follow-up period:"
30,page_30,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 30 • Topical therapies or emollients with anti-pruritic properties (including but not limited to anti-histamines, menthol or menthol derivatives, polidocanol, camphor, pramoxine, and capsaicin) • Systemic therapies with recognized anti- pruritic properties (including but not limited to H1 antihistamines, doxepin, gabapentin, pregabalin, cannabinoids, kappa-opioid receptor agonists, and mu- opioid receptor antagonists) Use of any excluded therapies (including those for the treatment of pruritus or PN lesions, or as rescue therapy) should be reported as soon as possible, and will be recorded as protocol deviations for subjects who receive them. 5.7.3 Rescue Therapies The initiation of non-study drug therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN lesions, or flare of previously inactive skin disease, is strongly discouraged throughout the treatment period. However, should rescue therapy be required for the safety and well-being of the subject, such use will be reco rded and analyzed ( see Section 8.2) . The subject may remain on study drug, unless the rescue therapy is an NK 1-R antagonist, a systemic biologic therapy, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, an investigational therapy, or any therapy that may jeopardize the subject’s safety if study drug is continued, in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion. 5.8 Assignment to Treatment 5.8.1 Randomization Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive serlopitant 5 mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Stratified permuted block randomization will be used. Randomization will be stratified by the subject’s reported WI -NRS score for the 1- week period prior to the Baseline visit (6.5 to < 9, 9 to 10). An IWRS will be used to perform the randomization. 5.8.2 Blinding This study will be conducted as a double-blind study with the treatment assignment concealed from the subjects, the investigators and their staff, the Sponsor, and any designees of the Sponsor as required . The placebo will be formulated to be indistinguishable from the active study product. Study materials will be packaged and issued in a manner designed to maintain the blind for subjects and all study personnel involved in the direction and execution of study procedures, study assessments, and collection of data. The randomization code for each subject will be available to the sites for use only in an emergency situation. For details of the procedure for unblinding of individual subjects in cases of emergency see Section 7.6."

Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 31 5.9 Treatment Compliance Records of study drug used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits will be kept during the study. Subjects will record in the eDiary the doses administered, as well as whether a dose was taken within 2 hours of eating a meal. Subjects will be asked to return all partially used and empty bottles to the study site at each visit . The site staff will count and record the number of remaining tablets in each returned bottle . The site staff will review the subject’s eDiary to help evaluate compliance with dosing at each study visit. Discrepancies between compliance as assessed by tablet counts and doses recorded in the eDiary will be reconciled and documented. Dosing dates and times will be recorded. A subject who has deviated significantly from the once-daily dosing regimen will be counseled. 6 STUDY SCHEDULE AND ASSESSM ENTS When applicable, efficacy and safety instruments will be provided with instructions for administration , in study-specific manuals for site reference. 6.1 Efficacy Parameters 6.1.1 Itch Numeric Rating Scale The Itch NRS is a validated, self -reported instrument for m easurement of itch intensity. It uses a 24-hour recall period and asks subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11 -point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Higher scores indicate greater itch intensity. In this study, the subject is asked to rate the intensity of their worst itch (WI-NRS) during a 24- hour recall period ; the questionnaire is provided in Appendix C . Initial WI-NRS score collected during Screening visit will be collected on paper. All subsequent WI-NRS assessments will be reported by subject via eDiary. Subjects will record their WI-NRS scores once daily via eDiary at approximately the same time each d ay (+/- 3 hours) throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up periods, as outlined in Appendix A. Subjects may be allowed to adjust the timing of eDiary completion within the first week of Screening as needed. Standardized training and instructions will be provided to all subjects prior to eDiary use. 6.1.2 Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity The IGA PN-A is an instrument used to assess the overall activity of PN lesions at a given time point, as determined by the investigator. It consists of a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), as provided in Appendix D. The IGA PN- A uses clinical characteristics of excoriations, crusting, and/or bleeding as guidelines for the overall activity assessment. The n umber of pruriginous lesions should not be considered for this assessment. IGA PN-A scores will be captured as o utlined in Appendix A. Each assessment during the study must be done by the Principal Investigator ( PI) or designee. Every effort should be made to ensure that all assessments for a given subject are done by the same individual throughout the study. However, a change in assessor for a given subject, though not ideal, will not be considered a protocol deviation."

Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 32 6.1.3 Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Stage The IGA PN-S is an instrument used to assess the overall number and thickness of PN lesions at a given time point, as determined by the investigator. It consists of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) , as provided in Appendix D . The IGA-PN-S uses clinical characteristics of number of nodules and their thickness as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. IGA -PN-S scores will be captured as outlined in Appendix A. Each assessment during the study must be done by the PI or designee. Every effort should be made to ensure that all assessments for a given subject are done by the same individual throughout the study. However, a change in assessor for a given subject, though not ideal, will not be considered a protocol deviation. 6.1.4 Dermatology Life Quality Index Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI) is a dermatology specific QOL instrument designed to assess the impact of the skin disease on a subject’s QOL over the prior week. It is a ten - item questionnaire that ass esses overall QOL and six aspects that may affect QOL (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment), and is provided in Appendix E . The DLQI questionnaire will be collected as outlined in Appendix A. 6.1.5 PN Photographs At selected investigative sites, optional photographs of representative areas with PN involvement will be taken at multiple time points, as outlined in Appendix A . These areas may include the extensor surfaces of both arms and both legs (overview of both legs, detail of lower legs), and the abdomen and back. The central photography vendor will provide photographic equipment to the sites for use during the study. The PI and designees will be trained on the use of the camera and the appropriate lighting and positioning of the representative area with PN involvemen t. Detailed instructions will be provided in the Photography manual . 6.2 Safety Parameters Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol-defined AEs and SAEs; vital signs; physical examinations; clinical laboratory assessments; ECGs ; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug as outlined in Appendix A. 6.2.1 Vital Signs Vital signs will include measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, a nd temperature after the subject has been calmly resting (s eated or supine) for a minimum of 5 minutes. Vital signs will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A and at unscheduled study visits when clinically indicated. On study visits when clinical laboratory tests are performed, assessment of vital signs should precede blo od draw."

ECGs should precede measurement of vital signs and blood dra w for clinical laboratory tests and will be performed as outlined in Appendix A and at unscheduled study visits when clinically indicated and read centrally. ECG machine and detailed instructions will be provided by the ECG vendor. 6.2.5 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale The HADS is a QOL instrument designed to assess the severity of anxiety and depression over the prior week, developed in a hospital outpatient clinic, but also valid in community settings and primary care medical practi ce. The questionnaire takes approximately 2 to 5 minutes to complete, and is provided in Appendix F . The HADS questionnaire will be collected as outlined in Appendix A. 6.2.6 Epworth Sleepiness Scale The ESS is a QOL instrument intended to measure daytime sleepiness by use of a very short questionnaire. The questionnaire takes approximately 2 to 3 minutes to complete, and is provided in Appendix G. The ESS questionnaire will be collected as outlined in Appendix A. 6.2.7 Assessment of Potential for Physical Dependence NK 1-R antagonist dependence has not previously been described and therefore a drug class- specific, reliable and sensitive instrument for the assessment of withdrawal symptoms has not been developed. A surrogate assessment tool, such as those developed for opioid or benzodiazepine dependence, is not available. In order to provide a comprehensive set of assessments for physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms following chronic exposure to the study drug, the HADS and ESS instruments will be administered at baseline and throughout the study period, as well as 3-days and 7-days following the last dose of study drug, and then weekly throughout the 5-week post-study drug observation period. In addition, vital signs will be assessed at each post-study drug observation visit, and an ECG and laboratory analyses will be assessed at the"

I n accordance with legal requirements and International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH) –GCP guidelines, every subject or his/her legal representative has the right to withdraw from the study at any time and without providing reasons. If provided, the reason (adverse event, study burden, lack of efficacy, other) a subject withdrew consent will be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). The PI or site staff must make every effort to contact subjects who are suspected of being lost to follow -up. Attempts to contact such subjects must be documented in the subject’s source documents. 7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 7.1 Definitions 7.1.1 Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. AEs include treatment emergent exacerb ations of pre-existing illness es and AEs that occur as a result of protocol- mandated interventions. 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event An AE is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outcomes: • Death • Life-threatening AE (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is not “life-threatening”) • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization"
45,page_45,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 45 • Persistent or significan t incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • Congenital anomaly/ birth defect • Important medical event (i.e. an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but which may be considered serious by the investigator or Sponsor, as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The following are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event), an elective surgery planned prior to signing consent, admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g. routine colonoscopy). The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE (e.g. mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical significance (e.g. se vere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulatory reporting obligations. Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on the eCRF. 7.1.3 Abnormal Physical Exam, Laboratory, Vital Sign, and Electrocardiogram Findings Abnormal physical exam findings that are clinically significant and are identified prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history. New or worsening clinically significant abnormal physical exam findings identified after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. Only abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g. require active management or are associated with accompanying symptoms/signs) will be recorded as medical history or AEs on the eCRF. Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history, and abnormal findings that occur after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. If the clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated with a confirmed disease or condition (e.g. elevated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with"
46,page_46,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 46 chronic kidney disease), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease) needs to be recorded on the AE eCRF (rather than listing indi vidual test findings as AEs). Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AEs or SAEs. 7.1.4 Deaths Any deaths that occur from the time of informed consent to the follow-up visit, regardless of attribution, must be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the death. See Safety Form Completion Instructions for complete instructions. The Sponsor should be provided a copy of any post-mortem findings and/or relevant medical reports, including histopathology. 7.1.5 Pregnancies and Contraception Requir ements for Females For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and is pre -menopausal, unless permanently surgically sterile (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) . A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause in a previously menstruating female. For the purposes of this study, acceptable contraception is defined below based on Nonclinical Safety Stu dies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals: ICH M3(R2) dated January 2010, and other available guidelines (“U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use” 2010; “Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials” 2014; “M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals” 2010) : All female subjects of childbearing po tential must use highly effective contraception, which includes the use of one or more of the following acceptable methods: 1. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) 2. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, only if planned for the entire duration of the study period and consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle for the subject 3. Hormonal contraception associated with con sistent inhibition of ovulation; these may include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravaginal, implantable, injectable, or transdermal delivery methods 4. Intrauterine device/system 5. Exclusive (sole) monogamous intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., vasectomized) or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castrated) male partner; the male partner must have received medical assessment of the surgical success"
47,page_47,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 47 Progesterone-only oral contraceptives are excluded as a highly effective method of contraception, as they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. Male or female condoms with or without spermicide, and female caps, diaphragms, and sponges with spermicide, or combinations (double barrier) are also excluded as highly effective contraceptive methods. Any pregnancy occurring in a female subject or the female partner of a male subject, from the first study drug administration through the required follow -up visit must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. See Sa fety Form Completion Instructions for complete instructions . The investigator will follow the pregnancy to delivery or other pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy in a female clinical trial subject or female partner of a male clinical trial subject is not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies ( for example, spontaneous abortion) may qualify as SAEs and should be reported as such even if they occur after the Follow -up visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be recorded and reported as SAEs. See Safety Form Completion Instructions for complete instructions. 7.1.6 Worsening of Pruritus or PN Pruritus or PN should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if considered by the investigator to have worsened in severity beyond the subject ’s typical fluctuations . It is important to include a description of the nature of the unexpected worsening when recording the AE or SAE (e.g. new PN lesions in previously uninvolved skin). 7.2 Methods and Timing for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 7.2.1 Adverse Event R eporting Period Any AE occurrence during the study must be recorded on source documentation and eCRF at the site, in accordance with protocol instructions. AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the first study drug administration through the follow-up visit. After the required follow -up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug- related should be reported. After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by the investigator to be caused by a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs should only be reported on the source documents and SAE form, not on the AE eCRF. Subjects who undergo screening procedures but are not randomized into the study will not have SAEs recorded in the clinical database. 7.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each subject contact through the follow-up visit. All AEs and SAEs, whether reported by the subject or noted by authorized study personnel, will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page,"
48,page_48,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 48 and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator wil l make an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality. 7.2.3 Assessment of Severity All AEs entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 ( “Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” 2010 ) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event. If the AE cannot be found in the event- specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the investigator should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Table 1 . Table 1 Adverse Event Grading Grade Severity Alternate Descriptiona 1 Mild (apply event -specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 2 Moderate (apply event -specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADLb) 3 Severe (apply event -specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADLc 4 Very severe, life threatening , or disabling (apply event -specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 5 Death related to AE a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or reported AE is not in the NCI CTCAE listing. A semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within the altern ate description of the grade. b Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. c Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. Source: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 Note that severity, a measure of intensity, is not equivalent to seriousness, a regulatory definition of outcome. Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for the definition of an SAE. If an adverse event changes in severity during the same study period (e.g., treatment period), only the highest severity grade will be recorded on the eCRF."
49,page_49,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 49 7.2.4 Assessment of Causality The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious). An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contribu ted to an AE. Causality of an AE will be assessed by the investigator using the following terms: • Likely Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely factors than the study drug. • Likely Unrelated: A reaction that, considering all potential etiologies, is most likely due to factors other than the study drug. 7.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The investigator must make every effort to follow all AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution until judged resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that study drug treatment or participation in the study is not the cause of the AE or SAE. 7.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor and Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee The Sponsor or designee is under obligation to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities related to investigational drugs in c linical trials. The Sponsor or designee must be notified within 24 hours of an AE when the investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE, regardless of the cause or relationship to study drug. An SAE related to study participation occurring before study drug administration and after informed consent should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. If the investigator learns of any SAE at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the SAE is considered likely related to study drug, the SAE should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. Please see the Safety Form Report Completion Instructions for safety reporting instructions. The investigator must also comply with applicable requirements concerning reporting of SAEs to the IRB or Ethics Committee (EC ). This may include initial or follow -up notification of an SAE or other safety information. 7.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and Study Investigators The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting reports of serious, unexpected related adverse events to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis, according to the ICH E2A Guideline and to other regulatory authorities according to national and local regulations as required. The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for prompt submission to the IRB or EC of any expedited SAE reports submitted to regulatory authorities. All investigators"
50,page_50,Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 50 participating in ongoing clinical studies with serlopitant will receive copies of the SAE reports submitted on an expedited basis to regulatory authorities. 7.6 Emergency Unblinding Emergency unblinding is available 24 hours per day/7 days per week and will be performed via IVRS. An investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only when knowledge of the investigational product is essential for the welfare of a subject. There is no specific antidote for serlopitant and usual supportive medical management is recommended in the case of a medical emergency.

Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 51 8 STATISTICAL METHODS All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. One interim analysis may be performed. Endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group and visit. For continuous variables, the following information will be presented: n (number of subjects), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables counts and percentages will be used. Summary stat istics for imputed efficacy data will be reported based upon imputed data. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Subjects who withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, will be defined as non-responder. As one sensitivity analysis, the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last available on-therapy observation for a subject will be used to estimate subsequent missing data points). As a second sensitivity analysis, a repeated measures model will be used on observed data. Additionally, a tipping point analysis will be done as a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint. Baseline for measures other than the eDiary daily measures will be the last recorded value prior to the start of treatment. For daily measures including the WI- NRS, baseline will be the average result measured over the week prior to treatment. A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 8.1 Decision Rule and Sample S ize This study will use a 5% two -sided alpha lev el. While the alpha level is two -sided, clinically relevant result s require a serlopitant benefit. Statistical significance for the key secondary efficacy endpoints requires statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. stepdown testing from primary to key secondary endpoints). The key secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested in order starting with the Week 4 WI-NRS 4-point responder rate , and then the Week 2 WI-NRS 4-point responder rate. The target sample size of 2 80 randomized and dosed subjects (140 per group) has been determined based upon a 1:1 allocation of subjects to treatment groups and a 5% alpha level. Completed Phase 2 studies indicate that placebo responder rates vary between 20% and 25% and serlopitant rates between 33% and 47%. A sample size of 280 subjects provides > 90% power assuming a placebo responder rate of and a serlopitant rate of . The sample size calculations have been performed in PASS 13 (“PASS 13 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software” 2014 ) and use a Chi-Squared test. The primary analysis will control for the stratification factors. It is expected that this unstratified power estimate will under-estimate the true power as it does not take the variance reduction resulting from stratification into account ( Matts 1988). CCI CCI"

Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 52 8.2 Handling of Missing Data Should a determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre- treatment, follow-up) be required for adverse events or concomitant medication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a partial date, the event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are available indicate this is not possible. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation. Subjects who withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, will be defined as non-responder. Imputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently, so the pattern of missing observations in one treatment group cannot influence missing value estimations in another. For each imputation process, 25 imputations will be performed. If a subject fails to complete their eDiary for the week prior to Week 10, the primary endpoint (WI-NRS) data will be missing , unless the subject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy , or the subject used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status w ill be defined as non-responder. If the Week 10 value is missing for any other reason, the change from baseline value will be based on imputed data. Missing Week 10 WI-NRS values from which the 4- point responder status is derived will be estimated by MCMC. Missing WI-NRS data will be derived for the analysis using the method of MCMC multiple imputation. Since both primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints require WI-NRS, the following steps will be followed: 1. Using the daily eDiary data, calculate Base line and Week 2 through Week 10 values by averaging available values. In order to compute a week’s average, a minimum of 4 values must be available for that week. The weekly average will be imputed when there are fewer than 4 values available. 2. From step 1, create a dataset for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and those needing estimation by MCMC. The missing WI- NRS values in each dataset will be filled in using the MCMC method to generate 25 datasets. The resulting datasets for eac h treatment arm will be combined into one complete dataset. Syntax: proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. Nimpute=25 <options>; where trtpn=(TRT); /* Note TRT = [1, 2]; depending on treatment group */; mcmc chain=single; var baseline week1 week2 week3 week4 week5 week6 week7 week8 week9 week10; run; 3. From each complete dataset, the dichotomous responder rate will be determined. Each complete dataset will be analyzed as specified for the particular analysis."
53,page_53,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -105 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 53 Each complete dataset formed by m ultiply imputed data will be analyzed as specified for the particular analysis. The results from the analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS® PROC MIANALYZE . In the case of the primary analysis and the secondary responder analyses, the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) statistics computed in the analyses of WI-NRS responder rates will be normalized using the Wilson -Hilferty transformation prior to combining them using SAS® PROC MIANALYZE A total of 2 random seeds will be needed to impute mi ssing data. Those random seeds have been pre-specified by using a random number generator: • WI-NRS Serlopitant: Seed= 1537248074 • WI-NRS Placebo: Seed= 474752918 8.3 Analysis Population s The primary efficacy population will be the I ntent-to-Treat (ITT) and will include all randomized subjects who were dispensed study drug. Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment group to which they are randomized. The primary safety population will be all treated subjects with at least one post -baseline assessment. For safety analyses, subjects will be classified based upon the treatment received. The Per Protocol ( PP) population will include all subjects in the safety population who complete the Week 10 evaluations without any significant protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). Analyses performed on the Per Protocol population will be considered supportive. The PP population will include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria: • Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria; • Receives a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (See Appendix B ); • Receives an excluded medication for treatment of pruritus or PN; • Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e. subjects must comply with 80−120% of the expected dosage of study medication during participation in the study); • Out of visit window at the Week 10 visit by ±7 days Subjects that discontinue from the st udy drug due to an adverse event related to study treatment or documented lack of treatment effect will be included in the PP population. Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations."

Prior therapies (including over- the-counter medications) used to treat the signs and symptoms of PN within the prior 2 years will be reported. Prior medications will be summarized by ATC level and preferred drug name and listed. Concomitant medications will be summarized by ATC level and preferred drug name and listed. Concomitant medication use will be quantified and analyzed. 8.7 Treatment Compliance and Extent of Exposure Compliance with study drug dosing will be determined based on tablet counts recorded on the eCRF. Compliance will be calculated by analyzing expected number of tablets returned versus actual number of tablets returned. Summaries of treatment exposure will also be produced. 8.8 Efficacy Analyses All efficacy endpoints will be summarized within the ITT and PP populations using descriptive statistics by time point and treatment. Results including averaged imputed values will be summarized at Baseline, Week 2 (if available), 4, 10 and Follow- up, and the change from baseline for these measures will be summarized at Week 2, 4, 10 and Follow-up. The WI-NRS and change from baseline will also be presented for each study day. 8.8.1 Primary Efficacy The difference in the primary efficacy ou tcome measure ( WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 10) will be tested using a CMH test controlling for the ‘as randomized’ stratification factors. Conceptually the hypotheses being tested are: H0:PPlacebo ≥ PSerlopitant H a: PPlacebo < PSerlopitant where P Placebo is the percent of placebo responders and P Serlopitant is the similar percent for serlopitant. The primary endpoint will utilize the missing data rules as outlined in Section 8.2."

The preceding tests are to be conducted for the ITT population and the PP populations. 8.8.3 Additional Secondary Efficacy Additional secondary efficacy endpoints which may be drawn from the primary and key secondary imputations (including all WI -NRS endpoints) will be analyzed using the imputed data. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints otherwise will be analyzed using available data. P-values will be included for descriptive purposes only. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints which are dichotomous (responder) will include analyses analogous to the primary and key secondary efficacy analyses. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints based on change from baseline will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group and stratification factor as fixed effects and the baseline value as a covariate. Both least squares means and observed means will be presented. To confirm the assumptions for the ANCOVA model (i.e., that the errors are normally distributed with equal variances), residuals will be examined using the Shapiro- Wilk test. If there is overwhelmingly strong evidence that the assumptions are not satisfied, the data will be rank-transformed prior to submitting to the ANCOVA. Results of the rank -transformed analysis then will be considered the primary analysis; however, results of the non- rank- transformed analysis will also be presented. 8.9 Sensitivity Analyses 8.9.1 Last Observation Carried Forward In the first set of sensitivity analysis, missing values will be imputed using LOCF. Data will be imputed using LOCF unless the sub ject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or the subject used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status will be defined as non -responder.
