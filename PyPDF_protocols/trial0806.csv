5,page_5,"6 MC167B 1.0 Background Recurrent glioblastoma remains a problem despite modern treatment techniques despite advances in modern therapy; glioblastoma continues to portend a dismal prognosis . In modern trials, median progression -free sur vival remains short at around 7 months, with nearly all patients experiencing tumor progression by 36 months. [1, 2] 1.1 Many recurrences occur outside the high -dose radiotherapy v olume : The current standard for tumor delineation includes T1 contrast -enhanced and T2 FLAIR MRI. It is well established that high -grade gliomas infiltrate into peritumoral edema. [3] In a major prospective trial from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the clinical target volume (CTV) included any residual tumor and resection cavity plus 2 -cm ma rgins. [1] Current Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocols include the addition of postoperative edema plus 2 -cm margins for CTV.[ 4] With these volumes, at least 75% of recurrences occur within the 95% isodose line of the 60 Gy volume. [5, 6] In add ition, up to 20% of failures are located completely outside of the 95% isodose line. [6] 1.2 18F-DOPA -PET offers better localization of primary tumor than MRI alone : While it is well established that regions of contrast enhancement and edema are likely to contain tumor, it is thought that infiltration of tumor may additionally occur along neuronal tracts. [7] Given that up to 20% of patients may experience progression outside the aforementioned MRI changes, a need exists to develop a complementary imaging modality. While standard 18 -fluoro -deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18F- FDG -PET) is generally insufficient in visualizing brain tumors, a mino acid PET tracers, such as 3,4 -dihydroxy -6-[18F] fluoro -L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offer several advanta ges.[8] 18F-DOPA -PET shows high uptake in tumor tissue and low uptake in normal tissue. Unlike contrast enhancement, 18F-DOPA -PET crosses the intact blood brain barrier freely via an amino acid transporter. [9] In a pilot study at Mayo Clinic, increased 18F-DOPA -PET uptake was seen in 13 of 16 hig h-grade biopsy specimens, while MRI T1 contrast enhancement was only present in 6 of the 16 specimens. [10] With this knowledge, Mayo Clinic is currently enrolling patients with newly -diagnosed high -grade gliomas in a radiotherapy trial where dose -escalation is planned for regions of high 18F- FDOPA uptake. 1.3 Pseudoprogression can be difficult t o differentiate from true tumor progression : Following treatment with radiotherapy, inflammatory changes are often seen on MRI. Thus, strict criteria are used to categorize the nature of the tumor’s response. The historical standard criteria were publishe d by Macdonald et al. and required >=25% increase in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions, any new lesion, or clinical deterioration in order to declare progression. [11] These"
6,page_6,"7 MC167B criteria have come into question, as there can be significant interobserver variability, particularly in measuring irregularly shaped or cystic tumors. In addition, changes in contrast enhancement are typically nonspecific and simply represent a disrupted blood - brain barrier. Thus, fluctuations in contrast enhancement may be caused by inflammatory changes in the treated region, anti- angiogenic agents and radiation necrosis. [12] Pseudoprogression, defined as an increase in contrast enhancement that subsides without anti -neoplastic therapy, is common after standard treatment with radiotherapy and temozolomide. [13] This process is thought to be driven by radiation - induced increased permeability of the blood brain barrier. Because pseudoprogression typically occurs within 12 weeks of radiotherapy inside the high -dose region, the updated Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology (RANO) criteria require new enhancement outside the 80% isodose line or viable tu mor on histopathologic sampling for progression to be declared less than 12 weeks after radiotherapy. [14] These criteria help differentiate pseudoprogression from true progression, though challenges in interpreting changes in imaging after 12 weeks still remain. 1.4 Bevacizumab produces a moderately high response rate in gl ioblastoma : While angiogenesis is common among a spectrum of tumors, it is particularly frequent in glioblastoma. Commonly, the tumor parenchyma produces vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF -A), which in turn up -regulates the VEGF pathway. [4] Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with activity against the VEGF -A ligand, which in turn reduces VEGF pathway up -regulation. [15] A randomized study comparing bevacizumab with or without irinotecan in patients with recurre nt glioblastoma demons trated moderately high response rates in the 30 -35% range as determined by MRI. [16] A sin gle-arm phase II study treating recurrent glioblastoma with bevacizumab followed by bevacizum ab and irinotecan after further progression produced a response rate of 35% as defined by Macdonald criteria. [17] These trials led to FDA approval for bevacizumab use in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. This led to RTOG 0825, a randomized placebo -controlled trial comparing standard radiotherapy and temozolomide with or without adjuvant bevacizumab. This study revealed an improvement in progression -free survival but not overall survival. [4] A subsequent study compared concurrent radiotherapy, temoz olomide and bevacizumab to radiotherapy and temoz olomide alone, demonstrating a similar improv ement in progression -free but not overall survival. [18] Responses were often measured radiographically, which may not be the most reliable indicator of respo nse to anti - angiogenic agents. 1.5 MRI changes after bevacizumab may not accurately reflect tumor response : While rapid responses in MRI contrast enhancement after initiation of treatment with VEGF pathway inhibitors are relatively common, it is not cl ear whether these changes truly reflect tumor regression or simply restoration of the blood- brain barrier.[ 19] Furthermore, increasing non -enhancing T2 FLAIR regions have been reported and may potentially represent tumor progression after bevacizumab.[ 20] This has driven"
7,page_7,"8 MC167B spec ulation that the improvement in progression -free but not overall survival with bevacizumab may be primarily driven by radiographic changes that do not fully correlate with true tumor response. 1.6 Reirradiation is often used for treatment of progression : Repeat courses of radiotherapy are often considered for progressive disease refractory to systemic therapy. Conventionally fractionated doses between 36 and 46 Gy have been used with minimal neurologic toxicity.[ 21-23] Hypofractionated doses of 24 -50 Gy in 3.5-5 Gy fractions have also been used with mini mal toxicity when limiting doses to <40 Gy .[22, 24-29] Mayer and colleagues proposed a cumulative normal tissue dose limit (2 Gy per fraction equivalent) of <10 0 Gy to limit the risk of radionecrosis. [30] In general, the target volume includes a minimal expansion beyond MRI contrast enhancement. [21, 24-27, 29] Median survival after reirradiation ranges from 7 to 10 months. [21-27, 29] The best outcomes are seen when more time elapses between primary radiation and reirradiation and in patien ts with lower- grade histology .[24-26, 31] In an analysis of patterns of recurre nce after reirradiation, 60 -70% recurrences were located in -field with the remainder located out of field. [25, 32] Thus, MRI contrast enhancement may not accurately reflect tumor location potentially resulting in imprecise targetin g of radiation target volumes. 1.7 18F-DOPA -PET may allow better localization of recurrent disease than MRI : Because of the shortcomings of MRI in accurately differentiating tumor progression from pseudoprogression, in addition to the difficulty in tru ly assessing the response to bevacizumab, a novel imaging modality would prove useful in accurately classifying responses to treatment. In addition, more precise target delineation in the re-irradiation setting is particularly attractive; so as to allow fo r not only better target coverage but potentially reduced unnecessary coverage of normal tissue. The lack of dependence of 18-FDOPA- PET uptake on blood -brain barrier breakdown is enticing, as many of these patients are currently receiving or recently received bevacizumab and may have alterations in the blood -brain barrier. 1.71 Preliminary results – 18F-DOPA -PET identifies glioma outside conventional MRI in patients with imaging findings consistent with recurrent disease . In our two studies (MC1078 and MC1373), 13 patients with suspected recurrent disease had an 18F-DOPA -PET/CT scan and MRI performed prior to stereotactic resection or biopsy. The PET scan was rigidly reg istered to the T1 -weight scan using MIM Maestro (MIM Software Inc, Cleveland, OH). The registered PET images were transferred to the Stealth Station Neuronavigation System (Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Memphis, TN) and stereotactic biopsy locations were plan ned based on the PET SUVmax and locations of PET and MRI discordance (Figure 1). Of 45 biopsy specimens graded by Dr."

Of these, 14 (93%) contained tumor and 10 (66%) were high -grade. Of t he 33 specimens containing high -grade glioma, 20 (61%) were from regions of MRI contrast enhancement and 26 (79%) were from regions of 18F-DOPA avidity."

17,page_17,"18 MC167B 7.4 Comparison of volumes To examine volumes delineated using 18F-DOPA -PET and MRI, the union, intersection and discordant regions of PET and MR volumes will be quantified. For patients with PET uptake outside of the MR volume, the percentage of PET uptake encompassed by several different margins beyond th e MR defined volume will be determined, and the maximal distance (in millimeters) between the margin of the MR volume and the margin encompassing 100% of the PET uptake will be quantified. Both PET T/N ratio >2.0 and T/N ratio > 1.5 will be used to defin e the PET volume. 7.41 Exploratory analysis for other T/N thresholds and SUV levels will be investigated 7.5 Radiation therapy 7.51 Target delineation Following informed consent and co -registration of PET and MRI datasets with the planning CT acquired during standard CT simulation, the radiation oncologist will define the target volumes to use for radiation treatment planning. 7.52 Target delineation will be based on MRI and PET imaging, defining a gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), and planning target volume (PTV) as defined below. In the event that gross disease is multifocal on MRI or FDOPA- PET, contours do not need to be contiguous. 7.5121 GTV_MRI = sta ndard o f care MRI contrast enhancement 7.5122 GTV_PET = high signal PET disease 7.5123 GTV_ high = boolean of GTV_MRI and GTV_PET 7.5124 CTV_ high = GTV_high 7.5125 PTV_ high = CTV_ high with a 0 -2 mm expansion, based on the radiation oncologist’s clinical judgment 7.53 Treatment planning and delivery The prescription dose will be 35 Gy delivered in 10 fractions of 3.5 Gy each.

[30] Assuming the brain received a previous dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions, keeping the dose less than or equal to 31 Gy will result in an NTD cumulativ e of 99.5 Gy. 7.55 If the patient previously received less than 60 Gy in 2 Gy equivalent fractions, the brain constraint can be relaxed as to keep the NTD cumulative below 100 Gy. 7.56 Plans created using proton therapy will utilize robust optimization as per the departmental standard. No PTV will be needed for these patients."

[24-27, 30] 7.13 Quality of life Quality of life (QOL) and cognitive function will be evaluated with the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor Module (MDASI -BT) and the Brief Fatigue Index (BFI) . Every patient will be asked to complete the whole form packet at baseline and at each MRI evaluation for a maximum of 6 ev aluations.

Serious Adverse Event - Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious. Serious problems/events can be well defined and include; • death • life threatening adverse experience • hospitalization • inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity • persistent or s ignificant birth defect/anomaly and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opinion of the sponsor investigator may have adversely affected the rights, safety , or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the research data. All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non- serious adverse events . Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSO) - Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the fol lowing three criteria: • Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including individuals who are not resea rch subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospitalization - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opinion of the local investigator may adversely affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND • Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is ""unanticipated"" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is ""unanticipated"" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND • Related : A problem or event is ""related"" if it is possibly related to the research procedures. • Preexisting Condition - A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically"

All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the C TCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downlo aded from the CTEP web site: ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm ) 10.21 Adverse event monitoring and reporting i s a routine part of every clinical trial. First, identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. Next, determine whether the event is expected or unexpected and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure. W ith this information, determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report (see Section 10.25 ). Expedited and routine reports are to be completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Sections 10.4 and 10.6. All expected AE reports must also be sent to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) according to local IRB’s policies and procedures. 10.22 Assessment of Attribution / 18 F-DOPA Patients will be observed for adverse events for approximately 15 -20 minutes post 18F-DOPA injection by the Nuclear Med icine health professionals administering the scan. If AE is observed a second AE assessment is required < 24 hours post injection which will be performed by study staff. 10.22 1 When assessing whether an advers e event is related to the 18FDOPA injection, the following attribution categories are utilized: PET adverse events Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the PET scanning and 18F-DOPA injection Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the PET scanning and 18F-DOPA injection Possible - The adverse event may be related to PET scanning and 18F-DOPA injection Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the PET scanning and 18F- DOPA in jection Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the PET scanning and 18F-DOPA injection"
24,page_24,"25 MC167B Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationshi p between the agent and the adverse event. 10.3 Expected vs. Unexpected / 18F-DOPA • The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agent- specific adverse event information provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol. • Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent-specific adverse event information provided in section 15.0 of the protocol. NOTE: “Unexpected adverse experiences” mean any adverse experience that is neither identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk, in the information neither provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the consent form. 10.4 Expedited Reporting Requirements for IND/IDE Agents / 18F-DOPA"
25,page_25,"26 MC167B NOTE: Use paper Adverse Event Expedited Report- Single Agent to report SAEs.

Any death occurring within 1 day after 18F-DOPA agent was last administered or within 30 days of the last radiation dose, regardless of attribution requires expedited reporting within 24 hours. Any death occurring greater than 1 day after the l ast 18F-DOPA agent was administered with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite requires expedited reporting within 24 hours. Reportable categories of Death • Death attributable to a CTCAE term. • Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by cessation of life during the first 28 days of life. • Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. • Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unob served cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. • Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” u nder the system organ class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be su bmitted. 10.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems / 18F-DOPA When an adverse event has been identif ied, the study team will take appropriated action necessary to protect t he study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and log.

34,page_34,"35 MC167B 11.0 Treatment Evaluation 11.1 Measurement of Effect Tumor respons e will be assessed, using contrast and non -contrast brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with assessment based on the RANO criteria, until progression of disease (up to 2 years). 11.2 Definitions : Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by the Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology (RANO) Working Group. [14] Note: Lesions are eith er measurable or non -measurable using the criteria provided below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy. 11.21 Measurable Disease Defined as bi -dimensionally contrast -enhancing lesions with clearly -defined margins by MRI with two perpendicular diameter s of at least 10 mm, visible on 2 or more axial slices which are preferably at most 5 mm apart with 0 mm skip. In the event the MRI is performed with thicker s lices, the size of a measurable lesion at baseline should be two times the slice thickness. In the event there are inter -slice gaps, this also needs to be considered in determining the size of measurable lesions at baseline. Measurement of tumor around a cyst or sur gical cavity is problematic. In general, such lesions should be considered n on- measurable unless there i s a nodular component measuring at least 10 mm in d iameter. The cystic or surgical cavity should not be measured in determining response. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decim al fractions of centimeters). 11.22 Non-measurable Disease This is defined as either uni -dimensionally measurable lesions, masses with margins not clearly defined, or lesions with maximal perpendicular diameters <10 mm. 11.23 Target Lesions All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured (sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters) at baseline. Target le sions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameters) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements by imagin g techniques. Occasionally, the largest lesions may not be suitable for reproducible measurements and the next largest lesions which can be measured reproducibly should be selected."
35,page_35,"36 MC167B 11.24 Non -target Lesions For patients with recurrent disease who have multiple lesions of which only one or two are increasing in size, the enlarging lesions should be considered the target lesions for evaluation of response. The other lesions will be considered non-target lesions and should also be recorded. Rarely, unequivocal progression of a non -target lesion requiring discontinuation of therapy, or development of a new contrast -enhancing lesion may occur even in the setting of stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR) in th e target lesions. These changes would qualify as progression. Non -target lesions also include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum number of 5. Measurements of these lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted through out follow -up. 11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. Baseline evaluations should ideally be performed within 21 days before the beginning of tr eatment. These techniques should be performed with cuts of 4 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. The MRIs will be evaluated both locally and centrally by a core lab. 11.4 Response Criteria 11.41 Evaluation of Target Lesions 11.411 Complete Response (CR): Requires all of the following: • Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non - measurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks • No new lesions • Stable or improved non -enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions • Patients must be off corticosteroids • Stable or improved clinically • Patients with non -measurable disease cannot have a complete response. The best response possible is stable disease. 11.412 Partial Response (PR): Requires all of the following: • ≥50% decrease compared to baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks • No progression of non -measurable disease • No new lesions • Stable or improved non -enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of cortic osteroids compared to baseline scan • The corticosteroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the dose at time of the baseline scan • Stable or improved clinically"
36,page_36,"37 MC167B 11.413 Stable Disease (SD): Requires all of the following: • Does n ot qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression • Minimum 4 weeks duration • Stable non -enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan. In the event that the corticosteroid dose has been increased, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose • Stable clinically 11.414 Progression: Defined by any of the following: • ≥25% increase in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions compared to the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline (if no decrease) or best response, on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids • Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non -enhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan or best response following initiation of therapy, not due to co -morbid events (e.g. radiation therapy, demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, post -operative changes, or other treatment effects) • Any new lesion • Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor (e.g. seizures, medication side effects, complications of therapy, cerebrovascular events, infection, etc.) or changes in corticosteroid dose. The definition of clinical deterioration is left to the discretion of the investigator but it is recommended that a decrease in 20% of KPS or from any baseline to 50% or less be considered, unless attributable to co -morbid events. • Failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition • Clear progression of non -measurable disease 11.415 Pseudoprogression (PsP): All of the following must be true: • Progression of contrast enhancing lesions and or T2/FLAIR is restricted to the initial radiation therapy volume. • There are no new enhancing lesions outside of the initial radiation therapy volume. • Patients are stable or improved clinically. • PsP may be diagnosed at any time during therapy (beyond the typical 12 week window defined by RANO)."

The literature reports no deleterious effect was revealed in toxicity testing of 18F-DOPA -PET, and concludes the toxicological safety of the product is guaranteed given the toxicity data of the variou s potential impurities. 18F-DOPA -PET is currently in production at this institution, and is used to image malignant gliomas for research studies MC 1373 (IRB 13 -005102) and MC 1374 (IRB 13 -005106)."
43,page_43,"44 MC167B 16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology 16.1 Study Overview This is a single -arm, single -stage phase II Simon’s Optimum study with an analysis that will compare progression- free survival (PFS) at 3 months for recurrent glioma patients after radiotherapy targeting volumes designed with both 18F-DOPA -PET and MRI information with historical controls. 16.11 The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of patients that experience progression -free survival at 3 months based on our hypothesis that the combination of more accurate targe t delineation of high -grade glioma by 18F- DOPA -PET will improve overall tumor control. 16.2 Statistical Design 16.21 Decision Rules The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of patients treated with 18F- DOPA -PET guided radiotherapy who are alive and have not progressed within 3 months. A success will be a patient who is a live and without evidence of progressive disease within 3 months from registration . Media n PFS after bevacizumab failure ranges between 1 -2 months. [17, 34] Thus, the largest success proportion where the proposed treatment would be considered ineffective in this population is 20 %. The followin g Simon’s Optimum design uses 20 patie nts to test the null hypothesis that the propo rtion of successes is at most 20% with an overall significance level (alpha) of 0.186 , and a power of 85.9 % to detec t a true success proportion of 40%. 16.22 After 10 evaluable patients are accrued to this study and followed for at least 3 months, if 2 or more successes are alive an d progression -free at 3 months, the results will wait until conclusion of the study. If 1 or fewer patients are alive without evidence o f progression at 3 months, the study will be stopped and the treatment will be deemed ineffective in this population . 16.23 After 20 evaluable patients are accrued to this study and followed for at least 3 months, if 6 or more successes are ob served we may recommend further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this patient population. 16.24 We will not suspend accrual between stages to allow the first 20 patients to become evaluable, unless undue toxicity is observed. 16.3 Sample Size The design to be utilized is fully described in section 0. A maximum of 20 evaluable patients will be accrued to this pilot study unless undue toxicity is"
44,page_44,"45 MC167B encountered. We anticipate accruing an additional 2 patients to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation or other reasons. Maximum projected accrual is therefore 22 patients. We anticipate screening 30 patients to register a total of 22 patients necessary for study design. 16.4 Accrual Time and Study Duration Based on institutional experience, we deliver RT to an average of 25 recurrent glioma patients annually. Our plan to accrue 10 patients per year is based on including less than 50% of our recurrent glioma RT population, which is readily achievable. We plan to accrue patients for years 1 -2, leaving years 3 -4 for follow -up and analysis. Therefore, the overall study duration is expected to be 48 months. 16.5 Power and Significance Levels Assuming the number of successes is binomially distributed, the s ignifican ce level is 0.186 and probability of declaring that this regimen warrants fu rther studies (i.e. statistical power) under various success proportions and the probab ility of stopping accrual after the first stage can be tabulated as a function of the true success proportion as shown in the following table. 16.6 Other considerations: Adverse events and patterns or fa ilure observed in this study as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken into account in any decision to terminate the study. 16.7 Analysis plan The analysis for this trial will commence at the planned time points (see Section 4.0) and at the time patients have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. Such decisions will be made by the statistician and the study chair, in accord with the Cancer Center Statistics (CCS) Standard Operating Procedures, availability of data for secondary endpoints, and level of data maturity. The earliest date anticipated in which results will be available for manuscript, abstract or presentation format is when 20 patients have either prog ressed or been followed for at least 3 months. Subgroup analyses will be included for this primary endpoint to assess known prognostic factors such as MGMT status, age, and time from prior RT to reirradiation. 16.71 Primary Endpoint: 16.711 Definition: the primary endpoint of this trial is proportion of patients experiencing progression -free survival at 3 months. All patients meeting eligibility criteria who have a signed consent form on record and who have begun 18F-DOPA - guided reirradiation treatment at Mayo Clinic will be evaluable for the endpoint. All eligible patients will be followe d until death or a maximum of 4 years. Time to disease progress ion is defined as the time from study registration to the earliest date documenting disease progression. I f a patient d ies without evidence of disease"
45,page_45,"46 MC167B progression, the patient will be censored on the last date the tumor was evaluated. If a patient is declared to be a major treatment violation, the patient will be censored on the date the treatment violation wa s declared to have occurred. In the case of a patient starting tre atment and then never returning for any evaluation, the patient will be censored for progression on the last day of therapy. 16.712 Estimation: the proportion of suc cesses will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner. [37] 16.713 Over Accrual: if more than the target number of patients are accrued, the additional patients will not be used for evaluation of stopping rules or in any decision making process. The will be included in the final point estimates and confidence limits. 16.8 Definitions and Analysis of Secondary and Correlative Endpoints Subgroup analyses will be included as appropriate for these secondary endpoints to assess known prognostic factors. 16.81 Overall Survival: compare overall survival (OS) at 12 months for patients after radiation therapy targeting volumes designed using 18F- DOPA in addition to MRI contrast enhancement with historical controls. Survival time will be determined from the time of initial diagnosis to deat h from any cause. Survival from reirradiation will be determined from the time of study registration to the ti me of death from any cause. The distributions of the survival time will be estimated using the Kaplan - Meier method. [38] 16.82 Volumetric Comparison: to differences in the 18F-DOPA -PET avid region with abnormalities on MRI, the treating radiation oncologists will first define treatment volumes for GTV_MRI using the T1 -post contrast MRI scans while blinded to the PET study. A volume named T2_FLAIR _NCET will be defined by outlining T2 hyperintensity on T2 FLAIR MRI sequences. Then the PET study will be fused with the contouring software to allow automated contouring of GTV_PET defined by the T/N ratio > 2.0 (and T/N > 1.5). These contours will be reviewed by the treating radiation oncologist and then expanded as noted above. The volume of overlap and non -overlap between the GTV_MRI, T2 _FLAIR _NCET and GTV_PET will be calculated. Paired t -test statistical analysis will be performed to determine if any differences exist and the level of statistical significance between treatment volumes defined by MRI only and the treatment volumes defined by both PET and MRI. The analysis of volumes from 20 patients will have 80% power to detect differences in volumes with an effect size of 0.63 using a pared t -test with 0.05 two -sided signif icance level. Alternate metrics for comparison will also be assessed including spatial overlap, distance, correlations, and 3D shape comparisons."
46,page_46,"47 MC167B 16.83 Patterns of Failure: observe patterns of failure after reirradiation using 18F-DOPA -PET to guide treatment volumes. The MRI scan in dicating progressive disease will be fused with our treatment planning scan and the region of progression will be contoured by an investigator blinded to the GTV_MRI, T2_FLAIR _NCET , GTV_PET, PTV_high, and isodose lines. A volumetric analysis will then be performed to define the doses delivered to the absolute and relative volume of the region where recurrence is defined. 16.84 Adverse Events: determine acute and late toxicity after radiotherapy treatment using 18F-DOPA -PET to delineate treatment volumes. The rate of acute and late treatment -related toxicities for recurrent high -grade glioma patients treated with 18F-DOPA -PET image -guided radiotherapy will be determined, with acute RT toxicities graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (available at http://ctep.cancer.gov ), and late toxicities reported using RTOG/ EORTC late toxicity criteria. [39] 16.85 Reoperation Rates: determine the rate of reoperation for patients undergoing reirradiation for recurrent high -grade gliomas treated using 18F-DOPA -PET guided volumes. When available, pathologic information detailing the presence of necrosis and/or tumor progression will be record ed. 16.86 Quality of Life: estimate quality of life (QOL) after radiotherapy using 18F-DOPA -PET to establish treatment volumes. QOL will be evaluated using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor Module (MDASI -BT) and fatigue will be evaluated using the MD Anderson Brief Fatigue Inventory. These questionnaires will be administered at baseline and at each MRI evaluation up to 6 total evaluations to capture quality of life and correlate findings with clinical and radiographic progression. Analysis will include change percent from baseline using t -tests and generalized linear models to test for changes at each time point and non-zero slope. 16.9 Data Safety Monitoring Plan The Study Chairs and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might be developing. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for reviewing the accrual and safety for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by the MCCC Statistical Office. 16.91 Adverse Event Stopping Rule s: As no reactions to 18F-DOPA have been reported within the i nstitution, toxicity testing reported in the literature revealed no deleterious effects (section 0), and there have been no allergic reactions in all"
47,page_47,"48 MC167B patients accrued to date on multiple studies MC1078, MC1373, and MC1374, no reactions are anticipated. As such, if either of the two scenarios below occur, enrollment will be suspended so that details of each episode can be examined and a trial recommend ation will be formulated and presented to the MCCC DSMB: • At any point during the AE evaluation of the first 9 AE -evaluable patients, one or more patients is unable to complete PET scanning due to allergic reactions to the tracer . Or, after 10 or more patie nts are evaluable for AEs , more than 10% of these patients are unable to complete PET scanning due to allergic reactions to the tracer. There have been no reports in the literature of the occurrence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with normal renal function. Additionally, we will use the contrast agent gadobenate dimeglumine, which has been shown to have a high safety profile (lower incidence of NSF in patients with renal failure/insufficiency) compared with many other available Gd -base d contrast agents. Therefore no reactions are anticipated. As such, if at any time a patient develops NSF enrollment will be suspended so that details of the episode can be examined and a trial recommendation will be formulated and presented to the MCCC DSMB . Using the radiation treatment dosing, fractionation and normal tissue constraints outlined in Section 7 have been performed in several studies without significant adverse effects. While radiation -induced brain necrosis is rare, a cumulative normal brain dose of < 100 Gy in 2 Gy equivalents has been suggested as a constraint to minimize the risk of necrosis. [30] Two large studies reported no grade 3 or higher toxicity and no radionecrosis using the same dosing and fractionation as our protocol. [26, 27] In fact, studies using larger fraction sizes (5 Gy/fraction) reported very low rates of radionecrosis when keeping reirradiation doses under 40 Gy. [28, 29] However, tumor progression is expected in the majority of patients and commonly results in severe neurologic symptoms near the end of life. Both acute (available at http://ctep.cancer.gov ) and late [ 39] toxicity will be monitored continuously as eac h patient is accrued and follow -up data are accumulated. If at any time, 1) 3 or more of the first 9 AE-evaluable patients; or, 2) after 10 or more patients are AE-evaluable , more than 30% experience any of the following adverse effects considered to be at least possibly related to radiation treatment up to and including the three- month timepoint ; enrollment will be suspended so the details of each episode may be examined and a trial recommendation will be formulated and presented to the MCCC DSMB , adjustin g the dose, fraction size or volumes as needed. • Grade 3 or 4 irreversible CNS toxicity • Grade 4 non -hematologic, non -CNS toxicity • Any Grade 5 toxicity 16.10 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov"
48,page_48,"49 MC167B Initial estimated Primary Completion Date: At study activation, this study will have been registered within the www.ClinicTrials.gov (CT.gov) website. The Primary and Secondary endpoints along with other required information for this study will be reported on CT.gov. For purposes of timing of the CT.gov results reporting, the initial estimated completion date of the primary endpoint of this study is 27 months after the study opens to accrual. 16.101 Definition of Primary -Endpoint Completion Date (PCD): The PCD is the date at which the last progression free patient has been followed for 3 months. 16.11 Inclusion of Women and Minorities This study will be available to all eligible patients regardless of race, gender, or ethnic group. 16.111 There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of this regimen in subsets defined by gender, race or ethnicity, and there is no reason to expect such differences to exist. Theref ore, although the planned analyses will, as always, look for differences based on gender and racial groupings, the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power for such subset analyses. Based on prior studies involving similar disease, we expect about 7% of patients will be classified as minorities by race and about 40% of patients to be women. Expected sizes of racial by gender subsets are shown in the following table: Ethnic Category Sex/Gender Females Males Total Hispanic or Latino 1 1 2 Not Hispanic or Latino 8 12 20 Ethnic Category: Total of all subjects 9 13 22 Racial Category American Indian or Alaskan Native 0 0 0 Asian 0 0 0 Black or African American 1 1 2 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander 0 0 0 White 8 12 20 Racial Category: Total of all subjects 9 13 22 Ethnic Categories: Hispanic or Latino – a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term “Spanish origin” can also be used in addition to “Hispanic or Latino.” Not Hispanic or Latino"
49,page_49,"50 MC167B Racial Categories: American Indian or Alaskan Native – a person having origins in any of the original peoples of North, Central, or South America, and who maintains tribal affiliations or community attachment. Asian – a person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. (Note: Individuals from the Philippine Islands have been recorded as Pacific Islanders in previous dat a collection strategies.) Black or African American – a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as “Haitian” or “Negro” can be used in addition to “Black or African American.” Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander – a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. White – a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa."
