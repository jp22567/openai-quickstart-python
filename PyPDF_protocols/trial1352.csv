OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the long -term safety and durability of effect of TRC101 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis. POPULATION : Subjects with no n-dialysis dependent CKD and blood bicarbonate value of ≥ 12 m Eq/L who completed the 12-week Treatment P eriod in Study TRCA -301. STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION : This study is a 40-week, blind ed, placebo -controlled extension of Study TRCA -301 (a Phase 3, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TRC101 in subjects with CKD and metabolic acidosis) . Study sites, other than a designated unblinded staff member, as well as study subjects will be b linded . Tricida will be unblinded when the database for the parent study, TRCA -301, is locked. Eligible subjects who complete the 12 -week Treatment Period in Study TRCA -301 may have the option to participate in this extension study. Subjects who discontinue prematurely from Study TRCA -301 will n ot be eligible for entry in the extension study. Study periods are as follow s: • Week 12 Visit (1- day screening visit ). • Treatment Period ( starting with the Week 12 Visit and continuing for 40 weeks until the Week 52 Visit). • Follow -up Period (2 weeks after discontinuation of treatment ). After the subject provides informed consent, the subject ’s eligibility will be evaluated on the basis of laboratory values, vital signs, renal status and pregnancy test (if applicable). Eligible subjects will be treated with TRC101 or placebo once daily (QD) on an out -patient basis for the subsequent 40 weeks (Treatment Period) ; subjects will continue to receive the same blinded treatment (TRC101 or placebo) that they received in Study TRCA -301. Dosing of oral c oncomitant medications and study drug will be separated by at l east 4 hours. Study drug dose adjustment and use of oral alkali supplements (for those subjects who were taking them at the Week 12 Visit) is described in the titration algorithm ( Appendix 2). Subjects with a confirmed blood bicarbonate level > 30 mEq/L will undergo an interrupti on of the study drug dose in accordance with the titration algorithm. Subjects with a blood bicarbonate level below the normal range (< 22 mEq/L) may have a blinded adjustment of the study drug dose in accordance with the titration algorithm. At any time during the study, the Investigator will evaluate subjects with a confirmed blood bicarbonate level < 12 mEq/L for new acute acidotic processes and discuss them with the Medical Monitor. The Medical Monitor will determine whether the subject may continue in the study. No addition or dose changes of any other concomitant therapy to raise blood bicarbonate will be allowed. Subjects who enter the study at the Week 12 Visit on an oral alkali supplement will be taken off the supplement if their blood bicarbo nate is within the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L) or above it (> 29 mEq/L),"
6,page_6,"TRC101 Tricida, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 6 of 74 as described in Appendix 2 . If, after removal of alkali supplementation, blood bicarbonate falls below the normal range, the study drug dose will be increased in a step -wise fashion to the maximum daily dose (3 packets) . If blood bicarbonate is still below the normal range , the oral alkali therapy the subject was taking at the Week 12 Visit will be re -instated at the same dose the subject was taking at the Week 12 Visit. If the Investigator judges that re -starting alkali treatment poses a safety risk, the risk should be documented. In this situation, alkali will not be re -started. Subjects will return to the study center for study visits at Weeks 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 34, 40, 46, and 52 for assessments of safety and durability of effect . Additional unscheduled study visits may be necessary following study drug dose adjustments. Subjects who complete the Treatment Period will enter the 2- week Follow -up Period and return to the study site for two visits: Follow -up 1 (Week 53) and Follow -up 2 (Week 54), for adverse event (AE) collection, fasting blood draws and safety assessments as outlined in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1) . Subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely (i.e., prior to the Week 52 Visit) will undergo an Early Termination (ET) Visit, during which all Week 52 Visit assessments will be performed, and will be asked to attend Follow -up 1 and 2 Visits in 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. All subjects who disco ntinue study drug prior to the Week 52 Visit will be contacted by telephone 40 weeks after their Week 12 Visit to ascertain vital status and renal status ( i.e., receiving renal replacement therapy or not). Blood draws for bicarbonate measurements will be performed when subjects are in a fasted state (at least 4 hours) and at approximately the same time of day for each subject. The maximum study duration for a subject is anticipated to be 42 weeks , including the 40- week Treatment Period, and 2-week Follow -up Period . Including the 12 -week exposure to study drug in the parent study (TRCA -301), subjects randomized to TRC101 in Study TRCA -301, who complete the Treatment Period in Study TRCA -301E , will have a total of 1 -year of exposure to TRC101. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Have provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study. 2. Have completed the 12 -week treatment period and attended the Week 12 Visit in the parent study TRCA -301. 3. Have a blood bicarbonate value of ≥ 12 mEq/L at the Week 12 Visit in Study TRCA -301, based on onsite measurement using the i -STAT point -of-care device. 4. Have adequate peripheral venous access for blood draws. 5. Women who are of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test at the Week 12 Visit and be willing to use an acceptable method of birth control until 1 month after study completion. Acceptable methods include hormonal contraception (oral contraceptives, patch, implant, and injection), intrauterine devices, double barrie r methods (e.g., vaginal diaphragm, vaginal sponge, condom, spermicidal jelly), sexual abstinence or a vasectomized partner. Women who are surgically sterile with documentation of such, or who are at least 1 -year post - last menstrual period and > 55 years of age, are considered not to be of childbearing potential . EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Have any level of low blood bicarbonate at the Week 12 Visit that, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires emergency intervention or evaluation for an acute acidotic process. 2. Required dialysis for acute kidney injury or worsening CKD during the parent study TRCA -301. 3. Planned initiation of renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) within 6 months following study entry. 4.

CFB in the total score of the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life (KDQOL) Question 3 items (daily activities) at the end of treatment (Week 52 Visit) . 4. CFB in repeated chair stand test duration at the end of treatment (Week 52 Visit). STATISTICAL ANALYSES: This blind ed, placebo -controlled extension to Study TRCA -301 will evaluate the long -term safety and durability of effect of TRC101 in subjects with CKD and metabolic acidosis. This study will enroll e ligible subjects who completed the 12 -week Treatment Period in Study TRCA -301. The Safety Analysis Set is defined as all subjects who received any amount of TRC101 or placebo in this extension study. A Modified -Intent -to-Treat analysis set is defined as subjects who rolled over to this extension study and had at least one blood bicarbonate assessment after the Week 12 Visit. Time points will be derived based on the date of first dose of study drug in the parent s tudy, TRCA -301. Baseline values are defined as the B aseline values in the parent s tudy, TRCA -301, unless stated otherwise in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . Frequencies and percentages will be presented for categorical variables and standard descriptive statistics will be presented for continuous variables. Safety will be summarized as follows : Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as those occurring with onset at the Week 12 visit + 1 day.

Study drug d osing and dose titration will be summarized by time point . The i ncidence and frequency of subjects who meet the dose interruption criterion (confirmed blood bicarbonate value > 30 mEq/L) at any time during the Treatment Period will be summarized by 12- week interval with the denominator as the number of subjects at risk at the beginning of each interval. Durability of effect will be evaluated as follows: T he proportions of subjects who meet the responder definition at each protocol -specified time point will be summarized . Responders are defined as having a CFB in blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having blood bicarbonate in the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L) . The difference in proportion ( between T RC101 and placebo subjects ) and its exact (Clopper -Pearson) 95% confidence interval (CI), as well as the p -value from Fisher’s exact test comparing the TRC101 group and the placebo group will be reported by time point . The proportion of subjects in each group who are responders, along with their exact (Clopper -Pearson) 95% CIs, will be summarized by treatment group and time point. A comparison between the TRC101 group and placebo group with respect to the proportion of responders at Week 52 will be perfom ed using Fisher’s exact test . A longitudinal mixed -effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to assess the CFB in bicarbonate level between the TRC101 group and placebo group at each protocol specified time point . A test comparing the least square s (LS) means of CFB in bicarbonate between the TRC101 group and placebo group at Week 52 will be conducted. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to assess the CFB in total score of KDQOL Question 3 items and in the repeated chair st and test. Additional analyses for durability of effect will be specified in the SAP. If the residuals from the above mentioned models (i.e., MMRM, ANCOVA) are not normally distributed, alternative analyses to deal with non -normality will be used instead . The SAP will specify these analyses. Analyses will summarize d emographic and baseline characteristics , exposure to study drug, dosing compliance, and concomitant medications. The number and percentage of subjects who used prior and/or concomitant medic ations will be summarized by Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification levels. Alkali use will be summarized by visit."

Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 16 of 74 1 INTRODUCTION Disease Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) continue to generat e acid from metabolism but have a reduced ability to excrete acid via the kidney. As a result, metabolic acidosis, characterized by a reduced blood bicarbonate concentration (i.e., below 22 mEq/L), can develop in advanced stages of CKD. Chronic metabolic acidosis affects 13 to 39% of CKD Stage 3 – 5 patients ( Eustace 2004; Raphael 2014; Moranne 2009). Left untreated, chronic metabolic acidosis can lead to increased mortality, acceleration of kidney disease, acceleration of muscle breakdown, and the devel opment or exacerbation of bone disease (Dobre 2015 ). Clinical outcomes for CKD patients with bicarbonate levels that are below normal (i.e., < 22 mEq/L) are significantly worse compared to patients with normal bicarbonate (i.e., 22 to 29 mEq/L); this has been demonstrated in multiple large retrospective database analyses reported in the literature ( Shah 2009; Dobre 2013; Raphael 2011; Tangri 2011; Kovesdy 2009; Navaneethan 2011; Raphael 2016). The relationship between decreasing bicarbonate levels and cli nical outcomes is believed to be a continuum (i.e., as bicarbonate decreases from normal levels the risk of adverse outcomes, such as death, progression of CKD and hospitalization, progressively increases). Hazards for patients with bicarbonate levels in the range required for subjects in this study (i.e., 12 to 20 mEq/L) are significantly worse than for patients with bicarbonate levels indicative of more mild metabolic acidosis (i.e., > 20 to 22 mEq/L). Correction of low bicarbonate levels in patients with CKD (i.e., with oral alkali supplementation or consumption of a less acidic diet) has been shown to result in slowing of progression of renal disease ( de Brito -Ashurst 2009; Phisitkul 2010; Mahajan 2010; Goraya 2013; Goraya 2014; Garneata 2016), improve ments in muscle mass/function ( de Brito -Ashurst 2009; Abramowitz 2013) and improvement in bone hea lth (Domrongkitchaiporn 2002). Currently, no approved therapies are available in the United States for controlling bicarbonate in patients who have chronic metabolic acidosis. Use of unapproved oral alkali supplements (e.g., food additives such as oral sodium bicarbonate and off- label use of potassium citrate) is general clinical practice ; however, these agents have been studied only in patients with mild meta bolic acidosis. Most prospective trials have limited doses of oral sodium bicarbonate to < 2 g per day resulting in modest increases in blood bicarbonate of 2 to 3 mEq/L. The daily doses of sodium bicarbonate required to increase blood bicarbonate levels by 3 to 4 mEq/L in patients with metabolic acidosis are prohibitively high (6 to 8 g per day introducing 1.6 to 2.2 g of sodium; Abramowitz 2013). Combined with the sodium intake from diet, this would result in a total daily sodium load exceeding the gui deline - recommended limit of 2. 4 g/day for CKD patients ( KDOQI 2002 ) independent of underlying comorbidities. Furthermore, common conditions accompanying CKD (e.g., hypertension, heart failure, edema) may be aggravated by the sodium load that alkali therapies deliver and"

As such, there is a clear unmet medical need for new treatments with demonstrated efficacy and safety to treat chronic metabolic acidosis . Description of Investigational Product TRC101 is being developed as a first -in-class , orally administered, counterion- free, insoluble, non-absorbed hydrochloric acid (HCl) binder for the treatment of metabolic acidosis in pati ents with CKD . TRC101 is a free-flowing powder composed of low- swelling, spherical beads approxima tely 100 micrometers in diameter. The TRC101 bead size is car efully controlled in order to restrict absorption of particles from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, consistent with several literature reports that show particles larger than 0.5 micrometers are not systemically absorbed ( Jung, 2000) . Nonclinical studies with radiolabeled TRC101 conducted in rats and dogs confirmed the lack of systemic absorption of TRC101. TRC101 is insoluble in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents. TRC101 has both high proton (H+) and chloride ( Cl-) binding capacity and Cl- binding selectivity. The high amine content of the polymer is responsible for its high H+ and Cl- binding capacity, and the polymer’s extensive crosslinking provides size exclusion properties and selectivity for binding Cl- over other larger competing anions. The TRC101 mechanism of action involves binding of H+ and Cl-, resulting in a net reduction and removal of HC l from the GI tract , which results in an increase in serum bicarbonate levels. The TRC101 drug substance is packaged in individual-dose packets without addition of any excipients to create the clinical study material, a powder for oral suspension also called TRC101 (i.e., drug product). Relevant Nonclinical Background 1.3.1 Nonclinical Pharmacology Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated robust proton and chloride binding and removal by the TRC101 polyamine polymer. In vitro studies have demonstrated that TRC101 selectively binds and retain s HCl under conditions that mimic the pH, exposure times , and ionic content of various compartments of the GI tract. The marked binding capacity and selectivi ty for HCl observed with TRC101 in vitro translates into in vivo pharmacological effects. When TRC101 was packaged in nylon sachets, fed to a single pig, and then recovered from collected feces, analysis of the anions bound to the recovered polymer reveal ed an in vivo binding of 2.6 mEq of chloride per gram of TRC101. Furthermore, removal of HCl by TRC101 results in a dose-dependent increase in mean serum bicarbonate , as observed in rats with adenine-induced nephropathy and metabolic acidosis compared to untreated controls ."

Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 18 of 74 1.3.2 Safety Pharmacology The nonclinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) safety program for TRC101 includes three studies assessing safety pharmacology. These assessments of the central nervous system (CNS), respiratory, cardiovascular (CV), and GI systems did not identify any TRC101-related adverse effect s in rats up to 2 g/kg/day (GI) or up to 4 g/kg/day (CNS, respiratory) and in dogs up to 2 g/kg/day (CV). 1.3.3 Nonclinical ADME Lack of TRC101 absorption from the GI tract was demonstrated in both rats and dogs admin istered a single oral dose of [14C]-TRC101. The results of the radiolabeled TRC101 absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies demonstrating a lack of oral bioavailability are consistent with the physicochemical properties of TRC101 (insolubility in aqueous and organic solvents, particle size averaging 100 micrometers in diameter , and particle stability). The s tudies demonstrated no radioactivity in tissues or organs other than within the GI tract lumen , no radiolabel detectable in the plasma and blood samples indicating absorption, and ≤ 0.02% of radiolabel appearing in the urine or expired air of rats or in the urine of dogs . The level of radioactivity excreted in the urine and/or expired air was consistent with the level of unincorporated radiolabel measured in a water extraction of the radiolabeled polymer. G iven the variability of the retrieval method, nearly complete recovery of the radioactive dose from the feces was observed within the first 48 hours after dosing . It can be concluded that TRC101 is not systemically absorbed following oral administration to rats and dogs. 1.3.4 Non clinical Toxicology Nonclinical toxicology studies of TRC101 to date include non- GLP 7 -day repeat dose oral toxic ology studies in rats and dogs, a GLP 33 -day and 28- day repeat dose oral toxic ology study with a 2 -week recovery in rats and dogs, respectively, and a GLP 26- week and 39- week chronic repeat dose oral toxicology interim analys is in the rat and dog, respectively (4 - week recovery analysis pending); a screening non -GLP in vitro genotoxicity study (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames] assay) and two GLP in vitro genotoxicity studies (Ames assay and chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes); non-GLP pilot and GLP definitive embryofetal development (EFD) studies in the rat and the rabbit. No single dose studies were conducted. In the 26- week GLP study in male and female Wistar Han rats, the animals received oral doses (via dietary admixture) of TRC101 at total daily doses of 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 g/kg/day. The 26-week dosing period w as followed by a 4- week post -dose observation period. Assessment s were conducted in a cohort of the animals from each dose group after 13 weeks (interim) and 26 weeks (complete dosing period) of test article administration , as well as following the 4- week recovery period . The assessment s included all in -life data collected through Week 13 or 26 and postmortem evaluations associated with the necropsies ."
19,page_19,"TRC101 Tricida, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 19 of 74 No definitive TRC101- related changes were observed in mortality, clinical observations, body weight, or food consumption measurements; ophthalmologic evaluations ; clinical pathology parameters (including serum chemistry, hematology, and blood gas ); or organ weights, gross necropsy or histopathology at the end of the treatment . TRC101- related findings were limited to minimal, reversible increases in urine pH at all collection intervals in both sexes at 2 g/kg/day in the 33-day study, with a similar but less pronounced trend in males at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day. The urine pH observation lacked microscopic correlates, was not considered adverse, but was considered a normal homeostatic process to maintain acid base status in the normal rats. Th e study results indicate that the rats were capable of compensating for the effects of TRC101 on Cl - excretion and increased bicarbonate levels through increased excretion of excess bicarbonate in the urine. Since no adverse TRC101- related effects occurred in rats following doses up to 2 g/kg administered for 26 weeks, this dose was identified as t he no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL ) in male and female rats . This dose level provides a 13-fold safety margin for the highest proposed clinical dose (9 g/day TRC101), based on a 60- kg subject. In the 39- week oral toxicology study in dogs with a 4- week recovery period the animals were administered oral doses (via capsule) of TRC101 at total daily doses of 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 g/kg/day, divided BID. An inte rim assessment, including all in -life data and postmortem evaluations collected through the 39-week dosing period, was conducted in a cohort of the animals from each dose group. No TRC101- related changes were observed in mortality, clinical observations, body weight, or food consumption measurements; ECG and ophthalmologic evaluations; clinical pathology parameters (including serum chemistry, hematology, and blood gas); or organ weights, gross necropsy, or histopathology. TRC101- related findings were limited to a mild non-adverse increase in urine pH in both males and females at 2 g/kg. An increase in urine pH is consistent with the pharmacology of TRC101 when animals with normal acid- base balance are administered high doses of TRC101. The high dose of 2 g/kg/day ( 13-fold safety margin for a 9 g/day human dose) was identified as the NOAEL in male and female dogs in the 13-week interim evaluation. Reproductive toxicology studies demonstrated no effects of TRC101 on embryo- fetal development or maternal reproductive indices ; it was also non -teratogenic. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo -fetal development was the high dose of 2 g/day for both the rat and rabbit. Because TRC101 is not systemically absorbed, Tricida has received a waiver from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the conduct of the in vivo micronucleous assay, the male and female fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, and the peri - and post-natal developmental study in rats. No carcinogenicity studies of TRC101 have been conducted. In conclusion, the nonclinical toxicology studies demonstrate that TRC101 has a very low order of toxicity. The repeat dose toxicology studies in the rat and dog assessed local tolerance; histopathological evaluation of the GI tract indicated that TRC101 was generally well tolerated . The genotoxicity studies demonstrate that TRC101 is neither mutagenic nor clastogenic . The embryo -fetal development studies showed no adverse TRC101- related effects on maternal"

Relevant Clinical Background For a summary of the known and potential risks and benefits of TRC101 to human subjects, see the TRC101 Investigator’s Brochure. Study TRCA -101 has been completed, and results are summarized in this section. All subjects enrolled in this long- term safety extension study will have completed the 12- week Treatment Period of the do uble-blind, placebo- controlled , Phase 3 study TRCA -301. 1.4.1 Study TRCA-101 Study TRCA -101 was conducted in subjects with CKD Stage 3 – 4 ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] 20 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m2) and baseline serum bicarbonate levels of 12 to 20 mEq/L. It was a double-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel- design, 6 -arm, fixed dose study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of three doses of TRC101 (3, 6 and 9 g/day) and two dosing regimens (once daily [QD] and twice daily [BID]) versus placebo. Subjects enrolled in Study TRCA-101 were treated for 2 weeks while in residence at the clinical research units , after which they were discharged and followed for up to an additional 2 weeks (off treatment ). While in residence during the treatment perio d, subjects ate a standardized study diet controlled for protein and caloric content, as well as anions, cations and fiber, in accordance with dietary recommendations for CKD patients (KDOQI 2002 ). Care was taken to ensure the diet was neither acidic nor basic. The specific foods selected for the menus were chosen to closely approximated the regions’ typical diet. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of TRC101. The main efficacy endpoi nt was change from baseline (CFB) to end -of-treatment in serum bicarbonate level. The study population comprised 135 subjects (86 male and 49 female), with a mean age of 60.3 years (range of 30 to 79 years) , a mean baseline eGFR of 34.8 mL/min/1.73m 2 (range of 19 to 66 mL/min/1.73m2; 44.4% with CKD Stage 4) and a mean baseline serum bicarbonate level of 17.7 mEq/L (range of 14.1 to 20.4 mEq/L) . Subjects had baseline comorbidities common in CKD patients, including hypertension (93.3%), diabetes ( 69.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy (28.9%), and congestive heart failure (21.5%). As would be expected in a CKD Stage 3 – 4 population, nearly all study subjects had indications for sodium restriction: hypertension (93.3%), congestive heart failure ( 21.5%), peripheral edema ( 14.1%) and use of diuretics ( 42.2%). As discussed in Section 1.2, since TRC101 does not contain a counterion, TRC101 administration does not result in sodium load and therefore enrollment of such subjects was appropriate. 1.4.1.1 Safety A 14 -day treatment with TRC101, at doses of 1.5, 3 or 4.5 g BID, or 6 g QD, appeared to be safe and generally well tolerated. In the 135 subjects who participated (104 subjects in the"
21,page_21,"TRC101 Tricida, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 21 of 74 TRC101 combined group and 31 subjects in the placebo group), there were no deaths, adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation, or serious adverse events (SAEs). The overall incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was 53.8% in the TRC101 combined group (26.9% assessed as related to study drug) and 45.2% in the placebo group (12.9% assessed as related to study drug). The majority of reported TEAEs were mild in severity: 44.2% in the TRC101 combined group (26.0% assessed as related to study drug) and 35.5% in the placebo group (12.9% assessed as related to study drug). Fewer TEAEs were reported as moderate: 9.6% in the TRC101 combined group (1.0% assessed as related to study drug) and 9.7% in the placebo group (none asses sed as related). No severe AEs were reported in either treatment group . The most common adverse events (≥ 5% incidence) in the TRC101- treated subjects were diarrhoea (20.2%), headache (7.7%), constipation (6.7%), and hyperglycaemia (6.7%). The most common adverse events in the placeb o-treated subjects were diarrhoea (12.9%), glomerular filtration rate decreased (6.5%), blood glucose increased (6.5%), and hypoglycaemia (6.5%). No event appeared to be dose- related . GI adverse events were the most commonly reported in TRC101- treated su bjects, which is consistent with a non- absorbed drug acting primarily within the GI tract; all GI events were mild or moderate in severity. Diarrhoea was the most common adverse event; all events were mild, self -limited, of short duration, often resolving while study treatment was ongoing, and none required treatment or resulted in discontinuation of study drug or early withdrawal from the study. Diarrhoea events exhibited no apparent dose response, occurring in 36.0%, 12.0%, 23.1% of subjects in the 1.5, 3, and 4.5 g BID TRC101 dose groups, respectively, and in 10.7% of subjects in the 6 g QD TRC101 group. In the pooled placebo group diarrhoea occurred in 12.9% of subjects. Given the small numbers, there is likely no difference between the groups. No tr ends suggested an off-target effect of TRC101 on other electrolytes (i.e., sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium or phosphate). No treatment- related effect on serum chloride levels or any effect on urine electrolytes was observed. No subject experienced increases in serum bicarbonate that resulted in metabolic alkalosis (i.e., serum bicarbonate > 29 mEq/L). In addition, there were no trends suggesting an effect of TRC101 on renal function, liver function, lipids, vital signs or ECG intervals. For additional details regarding the safety data from Study TRCA -101, see the TRC101 Investigator’s Brochure. 1.4.1.2 Efficacy Over a 2 -week treatment period, TRC101 significantly increased serum bicarbonate levels in the study population of CKD patients with baseline serum bicarbonate levels ranging from 14.1 to 20.4 mEq/L. TRC101 had a rapid onset of action (i.e., statistically significant increase in mean within group CFB in serum bicarbonate; p < 0.0001) within the first 24 –"
22,page_22,"TRC101 Tricida, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 22 of 74 48 hours following the initiation of treatment for all TRC101 dose groups combined. The onset of action for between- group differences (active vs. placebo) appeared to occur between 48 – 72 hours after the initiation of treatment with TRC101. At Day 4 (72 h ours after the first dose of TRC101), the mean increase in serum bicarbonate from baseline for each TRC101 group was 1 – 2 mEq/L: 1.5 g BID (p = 0.0011); 3 g BID (p = 0.0001); 6 g QD (p = 0.0003); 4.5 g BID (p < 0.0001). At Day 15, all active doses/dosing regimens evaluated (1.5, 3 and 4.5 g TRC101 BID, and 6 g TRC101 QD) showed statistically significantly (p < 0.0001) increased mean serum bicarbonate levels from baseline by approximately 3 – 4 mEq/L and each TRC101 dose increased serum bicarbonate levels to a significantly (p < 0.0001) greater extent than placebo. The observed increase in serum bicarbonate in each TRC101 dose group did not appear to be dose- or dosing regimen-dependent, except for potentially earlier onset of action in the highest TRC101 group, 4.5 g BID. After 2 weeks of treatment, the TRC101 6 g QD dose group demonstrated a similar increase from baseline in serum bicarbonate compared to the TRC101 3 g BID dose group (3.51 mEq/L versus 2.98 mEq/L, respectively), and the difference between the QD and BID dosing regimens was not statistically significant (p = 0.3408 ). Figure 1 illustrates the steady increase in mean serum bicarbonate observed in all TRC101 dose groups during the 14-day treatment period with a mean increase at the end of tre atment of approximately 3 to 4 mEq/L across all active dose groups. The slope of serum bicarbonate increase remained constant in all TRC101 dose groups, with no evidence of serum bicarbonate reaching a plateau at the end of 2 -week treatment. Therefore, the maximal effect of each TRC101 dose tested in Study TRCA-101 has not yet been determined. Serum bicarbonate levels in the placebo group remained essentially unchanged throughout the study, suggesting that the diet with a controlled protein (0.66 g/kg/day on average) and cation/anion content administered in the clinical research unit matched well with what the subjects ate at home and, therefore, had no significant impact on their serum bicarbonate values. The 2 -week treatment period in study TRCA- 101 was followed by a 2-week follow-up period during which subjects were off treatment. Following discontinuation of TRC101, serum bicarbonate levels decreased within 2 days and were near their baseline values within 9 days (Figure 1). These results underscore the rapid reversibility of TRC101 effect. In addition, the data demonstrate that chronic nature of the underlying metabolic acidosis in these CKD patients and suggest that continued treatment with TRC101 would be needed to maintain elevated serum bicarbonate level ."

Description and Justification for Route of Administration, Dosage, Dosage Regimen and Treatment Period In this study, TRC101 will be administered orally, as a powder suspended in water, QD, with food, at approximately the same time each day . TRC101 is a high molecular weight, non- absorbed polymer with a site of action in the GI tract; thus, oral administration is the appropriate route. Since doses of 3, 6 and 9 g QD TRC101 will be used in the parent study, TRCA -301, these doses will also be used in this extension study. Placebo QD will be used as a comparator . At each study visit (see Schedule of Events, Appendix 1), blood bicarbonate will be evaluated, and dose(s) of study drug and/or oral alkali supplement (if applicable) will be adjusted as described in Appendix 2 to attempt to maintain bicarbonate in the normal range during the 40- week Treatment Period . A QD dosing regimen was chosen for this study for consistency with the parent study, TRCA -301. This dosing regimen is more convenient for study subjects than a BID dosing regimen and therefore may result in greater compliance during the 40- week T reatment Period. The duration of the Treatment Period in this study is 40 weeks so as to provide up to 1 year of continuous exposure data from those subjects who received 12 weeks of treatment with TRC101 in the parent study, TRCA-301."

Description of Population to be Studied This study is a long- term, blinded, placebo -controlled extension of Study TRCA-301 (the parent study). To have been enrolled in the parent study , subjects must have been non- dialysis dependent CKD patients (eGFR 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m2) with chronic metabolic acidosis (blood bicarbonate 12 to 20 mEq/L). At least 50% of subjects must have had a blood bicarbonate level of 12 to 18 mEq/L. Subjects who completed the 12- week Treatment Period in Study TRCA-301 and attended the Week 12 Visit in that study are eligible for enrollment in this extension study if their blood bicarbonate value at the Week 12 Visit is ≥ 12 mEq/L and they meet all other eligbility criteria . Subjects will continue blinded study drug ( TRC101 or placebo) treatment in the extension study at a dose based on their blood bicarbonate level as described in Appendix 2. To make the study generalizable to the intended target population of CKD patients, this study allows the use of common “background” medications taken by patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis (e.g ., oral alkali supplements, diuretics, renin angiotensin aldosterone system [RAAS] inhibitors). Restrictions regarding the use of oral alkali therapy are different from those in the parent study, TRCA-301. While both studies allow enrollment of subjects concurrently taking a stable dose of oral alkali, because the primary endpoint measure in Study TRCA -301 is blood bicarbonate level, no changes to concomitant oral alkali are allowed in that study. In contrast, to minimize the long-term sodium load and to allow for management of subjects with eGFR 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m 2, subjects in this extension study will discontinue background alkali supplementation if their blood bicarbonate is above the lower limit of the normal range ( ≥ 22 mEq/L; see Appendix 2). Neither Study TRCA -301 nor Study TRCA-301E allows increase in oral alkali supplement dose or initiation of new oral alkali therapy. Investigators will be advised to avoid changing RAAS inhibitor doses during this study, when possible; however, as in the parent study , dose changes necessary for the management of comorbidities or acute events (e.g., hyperkalemia, worsening hyperkalemia) are not prohibited. In addition, Investigators will be advised to avoid changing diuretic doses when possible; however, dose changes necessary for the management of comorbidities or acute events (e.g., heart failure, acute kidney injury) are not prohibited. The rationale for the above restriction on background concomitant medications that may affect eGFR in this study is to gain experience with this aspect of the study design which may be used in a future study of TRC101 evaluating the rate of eGFR decline. Th is study allows the concomitant u se of other binder drugs (e.g., lanthanum carbonate, colesevelam, cholestyramine or sodium or calcium polystyrene sulfona te, calcium acetate, sevelamer, patiromer, bixalomer, and other polymeric drugs) with a ≥ 4-hour separation from the study drug dose."

Enrollment in Study TRCA -301E is defined by completion of the enrollment procedure in the interactive response technology (IRT) system. The enrollment procedure in the IRT system will be performed once s ubjects have completed participation in Study TRCA -301, they have provided informed consent for the extension study, and the Investigator (or designee) has determined they have met all TRCA -301E eligibility criteria. The starting dose of blinded study drug, study drug dose titration, and use of oral alkali supplements (for those subjects who were taking them at the Week 12 Visit), are described in the titration algorithm ( Appendix 2). The starting dose of study drug in the 40- week Treatment Period will be the same as the ending dose of study drug in Study TRCA-301, unless the subject meets the criteria for a dose adjustment at the Week 12 visit as described in Appendix 2. Subjects will return to the study center for study visits at Weeks 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 34, 40, 46, and 52 for assessments. Additional unscheduled study visits may be necessary following study drug dose adjustments. Subjects with a confirmed blood bicarbonate lev el < 12 mEq/L at any time during the study will be evaluated by the Investigator for new acute acidotic processes and discussed with the Medical Monitor. The Medical Monitor will determine whether the subject may continue in the study. No addition or up- titration of any other concomitant therapy to raise blood bicarbonate will be allowed. Subjects who enter the study at the Week 12 Visit on an oral alkali supplement will be taken off the supplement if their blood bicarbonate is within or above the norma l range as described in Appendix 2. If, after removal of alkali supplementation, blood bicarbonate falls below the normal range, the study drug dose will be increased in a step -wise fashion to the maximum dose of 3 packets QD and, if blood bicarbonate is still below normal, the oral alkali therapy the subject was taking at the Week 12 Visit will be re -instated at the same dose the subject was taking at the Week 12 Visit. If the Investigator judges that re-starting alkali treatment poses a safety risk, th e risk should be documented. In this situation, alkali will not be re -started. Dosing of oral concomitant medications and study drug will be separated by at least 4 hours throughout the Treatment Period in this study. Subjects who complete the Treatment Period will enter the 2 -week Follow -up Period and return to the study site for two visits: Follow-up 1 (Week 53) and Follow-up 2 (Week 54), for adverse event (AE) collection, fasting blood draws and safety assessments as outlined in the Schedule of Events. Subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely (i.e., prior to the Week 52 Visit) will undergo an Early Termination (ET) Visit, during which all Week 52 Visit assessments will be performed, and will attend Follow-up 1 and 2 Visits in 1 and 2 weeks, respectively . Subjects who discontinue study drug prior to the Week 52 Visit will"

Blood draws for bicarbonate measurements will be performed when subjects are in a fasted state (at least 4 hours) and at approximately the same time of day for each subject. Assessments will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1). Safety assessments will include: AEs , vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and respiratory rate); physical examination (including body weight); clinical laboratory testing ( Table 2), and 12- lead ECG s. The main assessment to evaluate the durability of effect of TRC101 will be blood bicarbonate level. Rational e for Study Design and Control Group 3.2.1 Study Design The purpose of this study is to define the long-term safety profile of TRC101 and to evaluate the durability of its effect. The study is a 40 -week, blinded, placebo -controlled extension that will enroll su bjects who complete the randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, Phase 3 study, TRCA-301 (the parent study). After the last subject completes the parent study and the TRCA -301 clinical database is lock ed, Tricida personnel and the blinded statistical group ( i.e., not associated with the D ata Monitoring C ommittee [DMC] ) will become unblinded to treatment assignment. Importantly, all Investigators, subjects, site personnel and CRO personnel who were blinded in the parent study, TRCA-301, will remain blinded until the clinical database is locked for this extension study. Please see Section 1.5 for a discussion of the rationale for the starting study drug dose, stu dy drug dose titration regimen and algorithm for discontinuing concomitant oral alkali supplements in subjects who are taking them at the Week 12 Visit. Please see Section 1.6 for a discussion of the rationale for the blood bicarbonate inclusion criteria for this extension study. 3.2.2 Safety Monitoring The design and conduct of TRCA-301E includes appropriate monitoring for safety and risk mitigation. The Medical Monitor will review safety data on an ongo ing basis to identify potential adverse safety trends. Central laboratory reports will contain flags that will alert investigators and Tricida personnel to abnormal, critical, and exclusionary laboratory values, and the Medical Monitor will routinely review these results. A DMC, established for the parent study, TRCA -301, will continue to review safety during this study. The DMC will comprise, at a minimum, one biostatistician and two clinicians, at least one of whom is a nephrologist. The responsibilities of the DMC will be defined in a written charter, which will include the frequency , format and structure of DMC meetings ,"
28,page_28,"TRC101 Tricida, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 28 of 74 and the use of treatment codes. Study enrollment and study a ctivities will continue during DMC safety reviews. The Chairperson of the DMC will be a nephrologist. The DMC will be supported by an independent statistical group which will prepare unblinded analyses for the DMC and will have no role in preparing the St atistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) after the study has started enrolling subjects. A separate, blinded statistical group ( i.e., not associated with the DMC) will be responsible for producing and finalizing the SAP and executing final data analysis of the study (this group will become unblinded when the clinical database for parent study, TRCA-301, is locked). TRC101, which is a high molecular weight, counterion- free polymer , is not absorbed and does not circulate systemically. Experience in Study TRCA-101 has shown that the anticipated risks of treatment with TRC101 are non-serious, mild to moderate, short-lived diarrhea or constipation, that generally resolves while treatment is ongoing. A dverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Risks of TRC101 effects on non- target substances (e.g., serum potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, lipids) were not evident in the clinical data from Study TRCA -101; nevertheless, close attention will be paid to electrolyte levels , which will be assessed at every study visit. No cases of alkalosis (i.e., serum bicarbonate > 29 mEq/L ) were observed in Study TRCA -101. However, an exaggerated pharmacological effect of TRC101 is theoretically possible, given the longer duration of treatment in this study. While kidne ys are generally efficient at excreting excess bicarbonate, the rapidity with which this can happen is impaired at low levels of renal function. To avoid prolonged periods of blood bicarbonate above the normal range, blood bicarbonate levels will be measu red at every study visit and the study drug dose will be interrupted if blood bicarbonate is confirmed to be > 30 mEq/L. Study TRCA -101 has shown that the effects of TRC101 are rapidly reversible, with the majority of the effect lost within approximately 1 week of treatment discontinuation and with serum bicarbonate returning essentially back to baseline within approximately 2 weeks of treatment discontinuation. In addition, the parent study, TRCA-301, excludes patients with higher risk of inhibition of respiratory response to metabolic acidosis (i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is treated with chronic oral steroids, that requires the subject to be on oxygen, or that required hospitalization within the previous 6 months ). Investigator s are to evaluate subjects whose blood bicarbonate decreases to < 12 mEq/L for possible causes of acute-on-chronic acidosis and discuss these cases with the Medical Monitor regarding continuation of the subject in the study. Study Duration The maximum study duration is anticipated to be 42 weeks per subject, including the 40- week Treatment Period and 2- week Follow-up Period .

Stud y TRCA -301 was designed to enroll approximately 210 male and female adult subjects with CKD ( eGFR of 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73 m2) and low blood bicarbonate (12 to 20 mEq/L). At least half of the subjects enrolled in the parent study were required to have a blood bicarbonate level of 12 to 18 mEq/L. Inclusion Criteria Each subject must meet ALL of the following criteria to be enrolled in this safety extension study. 1. Have provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study. 2. Have completed the 12 -week treatment period and attended the Week 12 Visit in the parent s tudy TRCA -301. 3. Have a blood bicarbonate value of ≥ 12 mEq/L at the Week 12 Visit in Study TRCA - 301, based on onsite measurement using the i-STAT point-of- care device. 4. Have adequate peripheral venous access for blood draws. 5. Women who are of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test at the Week 12 Visit and be willing to use an acceptable method of birth control until 1 month after study completion. Acceptable methods include hormonal contraception (oral contraceptives, patch, implant, and injection), intrauterine devices, double barrier methods (e.g., vaginal diaphragm, vaginal sponge, condom, spermicidal jelly), sexual abstinence or a vasect omized partner. Women who are surgically sterile with documentation of such, or who are at least 1- year post -last menstrual period and > 55 years of age, are considered not to be of childbearing potential. Exclusion Criteria Subject s who meet ANY of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study. 1. Have any level of low blood bicarbonate at the Week 12 Visit that, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires emergency intervention or evaluation for an acute acidotic process."

Required dialysis for acute kidney injury or worsening CKD during the parent study TRCA -301. 3. Planned initiation of renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) within 6 months following study entry. 4. Have a history or current diagnosis of clinically significant diabetic gastroparesis (based on Investigator’s judgment) or a history of bariatric surgery. 5. Have a history or current diagnosis of bowel obstruction, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, major GI surgery, or active gastric/duodenal ulcers. 6. Have a serum calcium ≤ 8.0 mg/dL at the Week 10 Visit in the parent study, TRCA -301. 7. Have active cancer during the 1 year prior to the Week 12 Visit, other than non- melanoma skin cancer, or cancer that is currently being treated or will be treated during the study. Subjects with cancers that are being treated with hormonal therapy only may be permitted with approval of the Medical Monitor. 8. Inability to consum e the study drug, known allergy to the study drug or otherwise comply with the protocol. 9. Have, in the opinion of the Investigator, any medical condition, uncontrolled systemic disease or serious concurrent illness that would significantly decrease study compliance or jeopardize the safety of the subject or affect the validity of the study results. Subject Withdrawal Within the provisions of informed consent and good clinical judgment with respect to the subject’s safety, every attempt should be made to have subjects complete both the Treatment Period and Follow-up Period. All subjects will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. If a subject discontinues from the study prematurely the reason given must be fully evaluated , if possible, and recorded appropriately in source documents and the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). Subjects withdrawn from the study prematurely , for reasons other than withdrawn consent, will be followed for safety for 2 weeks after recei ving the last dose of study drug. All subjects who discontinue study drug dosing prior to the Week 52 Visit will be contacted by telephone 40 weeks after their Week 12 Visit to ascertain vital status and renal status (receiving renal replacement therapy o r not). If the subject is being withdrawn because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason for withdrawal. The Investigator and the Medical Monitor may exercise their medical judgment to discontinue a subject’s participation in the study at any time if medically necessary. Subjects who meet any of the following criteria at any time during the study must be withdrawn from the study and should be medically managed as per standard of care by the Investigator:"

Subjects who require a prohibited concomitant medication for the treatment of an AE or for a short duration may continue on study drug treatment if approved by the Medical Monitor (see Section 5.9 for details) . • Subject ’s noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the study schedule, study drug self- administration or procedures, that cannot be rectified through additional training or other means. • At the request of Tricida , IRB/IEC or regulatory authority. • Withdrawal of consent by subject to participate in the study. Subjects should be encouraged to complete an Early Termination Visit, even if they are withdrawing consent, to ensure adequate safety follow -up. • Subject is lost to follow -up (the subject did not return for visits and study personnel were unable to contact the subject after at least three documented attempts ). • Received dialysis for more than 1 week or underwent renal transplantation . • Pregnancy. These subjects will be followed until the outcome of pregnancy is known and if subject agrees (see Section 6.11). Subjects with a confirmed blood bicarbonate level < 12 mEq/L should be evaluated by the Investigator for new acute acidotic processes and discussed with the Medical Monitor. The Medical Monitor will determine whether the subject may continue in the study. S ubject s should be maintained on their study drug dose pending discussion with Medical Monitor. Subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely prior to the Week 52 visit will u ndergo an ET Visit and will be asked to attend two follow-up visits. It is important to collect information explaining why subjects withdrew from the study. This information, together with AEs occurring at those times, may be informative of the cause- specific reasons for why some subjects remain in the study or on the assigned treatment while others do not. Therefore, although subjects are not obliged to give their reason for withdrawing consent, the Investigator will make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while fully respecting the subjects’ rights. Reasons for withdrawal of consent, when provided by the subject, will be recorded in the eCRF. The procedures described for ET from the study will be performed (Section 7.7) if possible. Every reasonable effort will be made to contact a subject who fails to attend a Study Visit, or does not respond by telephone, to ensure that the subject is in satisfactory health. The Investigator will immediately inform the Medical Monitor of removal or early withdrawal of a subject from the study. Subjects withdrawn from the study for any reason will not be replaced."

Refer to the current version of the TRC101 Investigator’s Brochure for a more detailed description of the investigational drug. 5.1.2 Placebo Placebo , which consists of , National Formulary ( NF) Grade, is packaged in labeled packets. 5.1.3 Study Drug Dispensing , Packing and Labeling Study drug is shipped and dispensed in cartons (kits). Each invidual kit of study drug has a unique number and contains either 8 l abelled packets of TRC101 or placebo . Each study drug kit is labeled and secured with a tamper evident seal. TRC101 and placebo kits will be shipped to the study site where they will be stored at room temperature (15 to 25°C) in a secure location. Study drug will be dispensed by the unblinded Pharmacist or study staff member designated for this role by the Investigator (hereafter referred to as “the designated study staff member”) according to the subject’s treatment assignment in the parent study, TRCA-301. The exact dispensing instructions will be provided to the designated study staff member by the interactive respo nse technology (IRT) system . The designated study staff member will be responsible for maintaining complete study drug dispensing, returning, and dosing records for each study subject enrolled at the site Treatment (s) Administered All subjects will initially receive TRC101 or placebo at a dose determined by their ending dose in the parent study, TRCA-301, and the subject’s blood bicarbonate level at the Week 12 Visit (see Appendix 2). The doses of TRC101 to be administered in this study are: 0, 3, 6 and 9 g QD , corresponding to 0, 1, 2 and 3 packets of blinded study drug. Placebo will also be administered in doses of 0, 1, 2 and 3 packets. Either upon enrollent into the study or during the study, the blinded study drug may be interrupted per the titration algorithm. TRC101 or placebo will be self -administered orally as an aqueous suspension, QD, with food, at approximately the same time each day for 40 weeks . The Investigator will designate a study staff member to dispense and account for study drug. The first dose of study drug will be self -administered on the day of the Week 12 Visit."
33,page_33,"TRC101 Tricida, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 33 of 74 Subjects will be instructed to take any oral concomitant treatment at least 4 hours before or after study drug administration. The last dose of study drug will be taken the day before the Week 5 2 Visit. Dosing Regimen The study drug dose titration algorithm is described in Appendix 2. Dose titrations may only be performed during a clinic visit. If the dose of study drug is changed , the subject will start the new dose at the time of the next dose . Dose titrations should be performed on the basis of onsite i- STAT blood bicarbonate measurements only. Subjects who completed the 12- week Treatment P eriod in Study TRCA-301 and attended the Week 12 Visit may enroll in this extension study if their blood bicarbonate value at the Week 12 Visit is ≥ 12 mEq/L and they meet the other entry criteria for this study (see Sections 4.2 and 4.3). Eligible subjects will start the extension study on a study drug dose based on their ending dose in the paren t study, TRCA -301, and their blood bicarbonate level at the Week 12 Visit (see Appendix 2). Blood bicarbonate will be evaluated periodically (see Schedule of Events, Appendix 1), and dose(s) of study drug and/or oral alkali supplement (if applicable) adjusted as described in Appendix 2 to maintain blood bicarbonate in the normal range. In general, t he study drug dose will not be titrated if blood bicarbonate is in the normal range. If blood bicarbonate is confirmed to be > 30 m Eq/L at any time during the study , the study drug treatment will be interrupted, no study drug will be dispensed to the subject, and the subject will be invited for a visit in approximately 1 week to retest blood bicarbonate. If blood bicarbonate decreases and the subject is still within the Treatment Period, study drug will be re- started at a lower dose in accordance with the titration algorithm (see Appendix 2). The Medical Monitor must be notified wi thin 24 hours of confirmation of a bicarbonate value > 30 mEq/L. Dose interruptions due to blood bicarbonate elevations should be performed on the basis of i- STAT measurements , except in unusual situations when they may be based on confirmed non-i- STAT blo od bicarbonate values > 30 mEq/L, e.g., if i-STAT values cannot be obtained because the subject is hospitalized. No addition or up- titration of any concomitant therapy to raise blood bicarbonate will be allowed. Subjects who enter the study on an oral alkali supplement will be taken off the supplement if their blood bicarbonate is ≥ 22 mEq/L as described in Appendix 2 . If, after removal of alkali supplementation, blood bicarbonate falls below the normal range, the study drug dose will be increased in a step -wise fashion to the maximum dose of 3 packets QD and, if blood bicarbonate is still below normal, the same oral alkali therapy the subject was taking at the Week 12 Visit will be re -instated at the same dose the subject was taking at the Week 12 Vis it. If the Investigator judges that re- starting alkali treatment poses a safety risk, the risk should be documented. In this situation, alkali will not be re- started."

Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 34 of 74 Missed Doses Contact the Medical Monitor if a subject has missed more than seven consecutive doses of study drug for any reason. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject Subjects will continue to receive the study drug (TRC101 or placebo) to which they were randomized in the parent study, TRCA-301. The dose of study drug will be adjusted in a blinded fashion based on blood bicarbonate level as described in Appendix 2. St udy drug will be administered as an oral suspension in water with food, QD, at approximately the same time each day , from the Week 12 Visit through 1 day prior to the Week 52 Visit. If a dose of study drug is adjusted, the subject will start the new dose at the time of the next dose . Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups Subjects will remain in the same treatment group (TRC101 or placebo) to which they were assigned in Study TRCA-301. Blinding As in Study TRCA -301, in this study an unblinded study staff member for handling (dispensation and collection) of the study drug. These individuals will be responsible for dispensing study drug and collecting used and unused study drug containers. If the study drug dose needs to be adjusted or interrupted per the titration algorithm (see Appendix 2), such adjustments will be performed in a blinded manner in both TRC101 and placebo treatment groups. The unblinded study staff member will not have any other responsibilities for the study except for performing study drug dispensation and collection, assessing dosing compliance and performing drug accountability and entering related data in electronic case report forms (eCRF s). The subjects, Investigators, site personnel (including all those involved in collection of safety and efficacy information) and CRO staff (excep t for those responsible for monitoring of unblinded data) will be blinded to the subject’s treatment assignment. To avoid unblinding of blinded site personnel to treatment assignment, strict blinding procedures related to drug accountability will be adher ed to at the site level for this study, similar to those utilized for the parent study. Specifically, designated site staff, who have no other responsibilities for the study, will be responsible for study drug accountability and collection of used and unused study drug. The division of responsibilities between the unblinded staff and other study staff (who are blinded to treatment assignment in the parent study, TRCA -301) are detailed in the study Blinding Plan. After the last subject completes the parent s tudy and the TRCA- 301 clinical database is locked, Tricida personnel and the blinded statistical group ( i.e., not associated with the Data Monitoring Committee) will become unblinded to treatment assignments. Importantly, all"

Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 35 of 74 Investigators, subjects, site personnel and CRO personnel who were blinded in the parent study, TRCA-301, will remain blinded until the clinical database is locked for this extension study. In case of a medical emergency, the Investigator may obtain the treatment assignment for the subject from the IRT system if it is considered important to the management of the emergency. In such cases, the Investigator must submit a written report, including all pertinent details, to a Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the unblinding. The Investigator should make every reasonable attempt to contact a Medical Monitor before unblinding the subject. Concomitant Therapy Information on concomitant medications (including prescription, over-the-counter, herbal and naturopathic remedies, etc.) will be collected for this extension study beginning at the Week 12 Visit and continuing for the duration of the study (including ET ) through 2 weeks following Week 52 for subjects completing the study and through 2 weeks following the ET visit for subjects discontinuing study drug treatment prior to Week 52. A therapy will be considered a concomitant medication if it is administered at any time after the Week 12 Visit and before the completion of the final s tudy visit. Subjects will be instructed to take any oral concomitant treatment at least 4 hours before or after study drug administration . If a subject requires a medication, or a change in the dose of a current medication, for treatment of any condition or AE that occurs during the study (including the Treatment and Follow-up Periods), such medication(s), or the new doses, and the AE(s) will be recorded on the eCRF . Restricted Medications In general, subjects should continue on regular doses of their usual medications. Subjects who are receiving or who have recently received restricted drugs or drug classes prior to the Week 12 Visit should adhere to restrictions as described in Table 1. The rationale for the restrictions on concomitant medications is provided in Section 1.6. Subjects who require a prohibited concomitant medication for the treatment of an AE or for a short duration may continue on study drug treatment if approved by the Medical Monitor. If a change in antihypertensive drug is required, the Investigator should, if pos sible, avoid adding or changing the doses of medications that cause changes in serum electrolytes (e.g., diuretics an d RAAS inhibitors); however, dose changes of these types of medications necessary for the management of comorbidities or acute events (e.g., hyperkalemia or worsening hyperkalemia, heart failure, acute kidney injury ) are not prohibited."

If the Investigator judges that a subject requir es treatment for sustained, clinically -significant worsening of metabolic acidosis during the study, diet counseling (i.e., reduced protein intake, vegetarian/vegan protein sources) may be implemented as clinically appropriate and in agreement with the Medical Monitor. Subjects with confirmed blood bicarbonate decrease < 12 mEq/L should be investigated for possible causes of acute-on- chronic acidosis and the Investigator should discuss these cases with the Medical Monitor. The subject’s study drug dose should be maintained pending discussion with the Medical Monitor. Treatment Compliance The unblinded study staff member will assess subjects’ treatment compliance at every study visit during the 40- week Treatment Period to confirm that the subject is taking study drug according to the protocol instructions and to document compliance in the eCRF as detailed in the eCRF completion guidelines. Compliance will be assessed on the basis of the assigned study drug dose, the duration of treatment, and the quantity of dispensed and returned containers (used and unused). Subjects will be instructed to save their opened/empty (used) study drug containers and bring them to the next study visit for compliance assessment along with any unopened containers. The unblinded study staff member will not share any potentially unblinding information with the subject or any other party as described in Section 5.7. Storage and Accountabili ty All study drug suppl ies must be stored in a secure location under the proper storage conditions, with access restricted to the designated study staff only. Study drug must be stored at room temperature (15 to 25 °C). Site personnel will verify and ack nowledge receipt of study drug by signing and returning all required forms. All study drug dispensed to subjects must be accurately captured in the drug accountability records (forms and/or logs) maintained at the study site . A copy of these records must be returned to Tricida at study completion for drug reconciliation purposes. Study drug designated for this clinical study must not be administered to any subject other than those enrolled in this specific investigation, and may not be utilized for any laboratory or animal research.

Week 12 study procedures that are outlined in the parent study protocol, TRCA -301, will be performed under the parent study ICF. Concomitant Medications Information on concomitant medications (including prescription, over-the-counter, herbal and naturopathic remedies, etc.) will be collected at the Week 12 Visit (as part of the parent study, TRCA-301) and will continue to be collected for the duration of this study. The Investigator or qualified designee will r ecord all findings in source documents and on the concomitant medications eCRF . Vital Signs The I nvestigator or qualified designee will measure vital signs (systolic/diastolic blood pressure , respiratory rate, heart rate and temperature) at time p oints specified in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1). The vital sign measurements performed at the Week 12 V isit will be conducted as part of the parent study, TRCA-301. The same method for measurement of temperature (e.g, oral, tympanic, axillary) should be used throughout the study for an individual subject. Subjects must be in a supine, semi- fowler’s (semi -recumbent) or seated position in a rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes before blood pressure assessments are conducted. The same position must be used for blood pressure measurements for a given subject at each time point. Respiratory rate will be asse ssed by a full minute count. All measurements will be recorded on the vital signs eCRF. Abnormal measurements may be rep eated at the discretion of the Investigator and must be recorded on the vital signs eCRF. When collection of vital signs , ECG , and/or blood samples is required at the same visit, vital signs should be performed first, followed by ECG and collection of blood samples. Complete Physical Examination, Including Body Weight The I nvestigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical examination (including CV , lungs and chest, head and neck, abdomen, musculoskeletal, skin and neurological systems; genitourinary examination not required) and record body weight at the time p oints indicated in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1).

The procedure details are provided in the Study Reference Manual. 12-Lead Electrocardiograms During the study, 12- lead ECGs will be performed at the time points indicated in th e Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1). The ECG performed at the Week 12 Visit will be conducted as part of the parent study, TRCA-301. If a subject has serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mEq/L at any time, ECGs will be collected more often, as clinically needed, until serum potassium is < 6.0 mEq/L . The subject must be in supine position in a rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes before the ECG assessment is conducted. S ubject s who are unable to be in the supine position should be in the most recumbent position possible. All ECGs should be performed with a standardized method, in triplicate, and approximately 30 seconds apart, prior to blood draws or other invasive procedures. Each ECG reading must include the following measurements: heart rate and QRS, QT, RR, and PR intervals. A ll measurements will be recorded on the ECG eCRF . The Investigator or designated site physician will review all ECGs. Once signed, the original ECG tracing will be r etained with the subject’s source documents.

In addition, if a subject requires treatment for sustained, clinically -significant worsening of metabolic acidosis during the study in the judgment of the Investigator, diet counseling (i.e., reduced protein intake, vegetarian/vegan protein sources) may be implemented as clinically appropriate and in agreement with the Medical Monitor. Adverse Events 6.10.1 Definition of an Adverse Event An AE is defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment” ( ICH E2A Guideline: Clinical Safety Da ta Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, October 1994). An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. This includes: • Any new medical condition, sign or symptom or newly diagnosed event that occurs during the AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with an"
43,page_43,"TRC101 Tricida, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 43 of 74 underlying condition that were not present prior to the AE reporting period for Study TRCA -301 (see Section 6.10.4.1). • A previous condition that has worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character during the AE reporting period; • Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions; • Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug interaction; and • Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a concomitant medication. For the purposes of this protocol, events that are not considered AEs include: • Isolated decline in blood bicarbonate or blood pH, even if assessed as clinically significant by the Investigator ; • Anticipated fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s underlying condition; • Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE; • Placement of a dialysis access - If the access placement was prompted by clinically significant renal function decline during the study, then the latter should be reported as an AE and the access placement should be reported as an action taken for the AE. • Overdose in the absence of other signs/symptoms will not be reported as an AE in its own right; and • Pregnancy ; however, any pregnancy complication should be recorded as an AE. Out of range laboratory results and abnormal ECGs, vital signs and other safety assessments will be considered AEs if they meet at least one of the following criteria: • Associated with symptoms or lead to a diagnosis (in such case the symptom or diagnosis should be recorded as an AE) ; • Lead to discontinuation of study drug; or • The abnormality is deemed clinically significant in its own right (i.e., if some action or intervention or alteration of treatment is required or if the Investigator judges the change to be beyond the range of normal physiological fluctuation)."

Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 44 of 74 6.10.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE ) is an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death. • Is life -threatening. (This refers to a subject who, in the view of the Investigator or Tricida , was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe). • Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, with the exception of: – Visits to the emergency room or hospital department that do not result in a hospital admission lasting more than 24 hours – Elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened – Routine health assessments requiring admission not associated with any deterioration in condition – Social admission (lack of housing, family circumstances, etc.) • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. • Is a congenital anomaly or birth de fect. • Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above (e.g., blood dyscrasi as, convulsions). Either the Investigator or Tricida can determine that an AE meets the definition of serious. If either believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by Tricida for expedited reporting. 6.10.3 Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction A suspected adverse reaction is an AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug ( IND) safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. All AEs judged by either the Investigator or Tricida as having a reasonable causal relationship to a study drug will be designated as suspected adverse drug reactions. 6.10.4 Procedures for Eliciting, Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 6.10.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period AEs, including SAEs, will be collected throughout the study period, beginning from the time of enrollment until the completion of the last study visit assessments ( 2 weeks after the Week"
45,page_45,"TRC101 Tricida, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 45 of 74 52 visit for subjects who complete the study and until 2 weeks after the ET visit for subjects who discontinue study drug prematurely). For subjects who do not undergo an ET visit following early discontinuation of study drug, the AE reporting period will end 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug . Any AE or SAE that is assessed by either the Investigator or Tricida as related to the investigational drug and is ongoing at the last study visit will be followed, whenev er possible, until it resolves or becomes stable or the subject is lost to follow-up. All subjects who have been exposed to investigational product will be evaluated for AEs. Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as those that occur on or after the day after the Week 12 Visit . 6.10.4.2 Eliciting Adverse Events Information on AEs and SAEs will be elicited at each AE assessment time point specified in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1) by asking the subject an open -ended question such as: ""Since you were last asked, have you felt unwell or different from usual in any way?"" The subject may report AEs spontaneously at any time. 6.10.4.3 Assessing Adverse Events The Invest igator should follow the guidelines for rating severity of adverse events : Severity Definition Mild Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; no disruption of normal activities; symptoms are transient and would not require medication or medical evaluation Moderate Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activities and treatment may be required Severe Incapacitating with inability to do work or do usual activities; may require medical evaluation and/or treatment; the investigational product may have been discontinued It is important to note the distinctions between severe AEs and serious AEs. Severity is a classification of intensity of a specific event, whereas an SAE is an AE that meets any of the regulatory specified criteria required for designation as seriousness described in Section 6.10.2 (e. g., a headache may be severe [interferes significantly with subject's usual function] but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs). The Investigator will assess relationship of the AE to the investigational drug, TRC101, using the following definitions . A suspected relationship (related, probably, possibly) between the events and the study drug means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. If the relationship to the study drug is considered"
46,page_46,"TRC101 Tricida, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 46 of 74 to be unlikely or not related, an alternative suspected etiology should be provided if available (e.g., concomitant medications, intercurrent illness/events). Relationship Definition Example Related Causal relationship is certain The temporal relationship between drug exposure and the AE onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically compatible response to de- challenge, other causes have been eliminated; the event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary . Probable High degree of certainty for causal relationship The temporal relationship between drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable; there is a clinically compatible response to dechallenge (re-challenge is not required) ; unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs. Possible Not reasonably related although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out The temporal relationship between drug exposure and the AE onset/course is reasonable or unknown; de-challenge information is either unknown or equivocal; could also be explained by disease or other drugs. Unlikely Not reasonably related although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out Disease o r other drugs provide plausible explanation . Unrelated No possible relationship The tem poral relationship betw een drug exposure and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug is impossible . The Investigator will use the following categories to assess the outcome of each AE: • Recovered/resolved; • Not recovered/ not resolved; • Recovered/resolved with sequelae; • Fatal; or • Unknown. “Fatal ” should be recorded as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than one AE is possibly related to the subject's death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is the most plausible cause of death. All other ongoing AE/SAEs will be recorded as not recovered/not resolved at the time of death."
47,page_47,"TRC101 Tricida, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 47 of 74 Although “fatal” is usually an outcome of an event , events such as sudden death or unexplained death should be reported as SAEs. The action taken with regard to study drug in response to each AE will be assessed by the Investigator using the following categories: • No action taken; • Study drug interrupted; • Study drug discontinued; or • Not applicable (e.g., subject was not receiving study drug at the time of the AE) . 6.10.4.4 Independent Data Monitoring Committee An independent unblinded DMC will review the safety data during the study conduct. The DMC Charter will describe the data review proces s and its frequency. 6.10.4.5 Recording Adverse Events All AEs and SAEs, whether spontaneously reported by the subject or elicited or noted by study staff, will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the appropriate AE eCRF page. In addition, the SAE Report Form must record each SAE. All AEs should be recorded using the words of the subject (verbatim term) to describe the AE, with two exceptions: if the verbatim term is vague or ambiguous (e.g., cramps), the study staf f should try to obtain clarification by asking a follow-up question (e.g., What kind of cramps?) and record the words the subject used to clarify the event (e.g., menstrual cramps, calf muscle cramps). If the subject reports a group of symptoms and the Investigator is comfortable with a unifying diagnosis, the diagnosis should be recorded (e.g., rhinopharyngitis instead of runny nose, cough, sore throat and sneezing). If a diagnosis is recorded, signs and symptoms need not be recorded separately. If the Investigator is unable to report a diagnosis, symptoms should be recorded on the AE eCRF. The following information should be captured for each AE: date of onset and resolution, outcome, severity, seriousness, relationship to the study drug, action taken with the study drug and treatments administered. Any treatment administered as a result of an AE should be recorded on the concomitant medication e CRF . 6.10.5 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments Clinically significant new or clinically significantly worsening a bnormal laboratory findings (e.g., serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g., ECGs, vital signs) after enrollment into this study must be recorded as AEs or SAEs ."

Any supporting information provided should not reveal a subject’s identity beyond the agreed study identifier. The I nvestigator should ensure that information reported is accurate and consistent . Isolated decline in blood bicarbonate or blood pH, even if assessed as clinically s ignificant by the Investigator, will not be captured as an AE for the purpose of this protocol. All AEs will be evaluated on a regular basis by the Medical Monitor to monitor safety in the study population. 6.10.6.1 SAE Expedited Reporting For each AE assessed by either the Investigator or Tricida to be serious, Tricida will determine (1) if the event was unexpected ( i.e., the nature or severity is not expected from the information provided in the Investigator's Brochure) and (2) if the event wa s a suspected adverse reaction. If the event is determined to be a serious, unexpected suspected adverse reaction (SUSAR), Tricida will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority and Investigators. The Investigator is responsible for notifying his/her respective IRB/IEC. 6.10.6.2 Unblinding Treatment Allocation Generally, Tricida should only report SUSARs for which the treatment allocation of the subject is unblinded to the pertinent regulatory authorities. Investigators should only receive blinded information unless unblinded information is judged necessary for safety reasons. When an event may be a SUSAR, the blind should be broken only for that specific subject. Unblinded information should only be accessible to those who need to be involved in the safety reporting to pertinent regulatory authorities, IECs/IRBs, and the Medical Monitor (i.e., the individual performing ongoing safety evaluations during the study)."

This section presents an overview of the planned analyses . Final analyses are not limited to the summaries described herein. If circumstances arise during the stu dy th at make th ese analyse s inappropria te or if improved statistical methods become available, the S AP m ay be re vised. The SAP will describe in detail the plans for dealing with subjects who drop out of the study. If the methods of the SAP and those in this section do not agree, the SAP prevails. Any revisions (both a lternative and additiona l methods) to the SAP, and rea sons for su ch revisions, will be des cribed in the fina l study re port. All continuous study assessments will be summarized by time point, as applicable, using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median and appropriate percentiles , standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). All categorical study assessments will be summarized by time point, as appli cable, using frequency counts and percentages. Determination of Sample Size No sample size calculation was performed, since this is an extension to Study TRCA -301 into which eligible patients who choose to participate will be enrolled . Analysis Populations Two populations will be analyzed in this study . The SAP may define additional analysis set(s). Safety analysis set: All subjects who received any amount of study drug in this extension Study TRCA -301E. Modified intent- to- treat (MITT) analysis set Subjects who rolled over to this extension Study TRCA-301E and had at least one blood bicarbonate assessment after the Week 12 Visit .

Frequencies and percentages will be presented for the categorical variables and descriptive statistics will be presented for continuous variables. Statistical Analysis of Durability of Effe ct Primary durability of effect will be evaluated using the MITT analysis set based on the randomized treatment group assignment. Number and proportion (expressed in percentage ) of subjects, along with exact (Clopper- Pearson) 95% confidence intervals (CI ) of the percentage, will be provided for all scheduled time points when summarizing categorical efficacy variables. Descriptive statistics will be provided for all scheduled time points when summarizing continuous efficacy variables. Statistical significance will be declared at the two-sided significance level of 0.05. 8.6.1 Durability of Effect Variable The analysis for durability of effect will include blood bicarbonate results that will be collected at Week 12 Visit through the end of the 40- week treatment from the i- STAT device. The i -STAT blood bicarbonate data will be used to determine the CFB in bicarbonate over time . Baseline blood bicarbonate is defined as the mean of the bicarbonate values collected at Screening visits and on Day 1 pre-dose in Study TRCA -301 (the parent study) . CFB in blood bicarbonate will be calculated for each time point subsequent to the Week 12 Visit. Descriptive statistics will be provided for all scheduled time points. 8.6.2 Durability of Effect Endpoints Durability of Effect Endpoints are : 1. Having a CFB in blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having a blood bicarbonate in the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L) at the end of treatment (Week 52 Visit). 2. CFB in blood bicarbonate at the end of treatment (Week 52 Visit) . 3. CFB in the total score of the KDQOL Question 3 items (daily activities) at the end of treatment (Week 52 Visit) . 4. CFB in repeated chair stand test duration at the end of treatment (Week 52 Visit) . 8.6.3 Analysis of Durability of Effect The number and proportions (expressed as percentages) of subjects who are responders at each time point and at the end of treatment (Week 52) will be calculated. Responders are defined as having a CFB in blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having a blood bicarbonate in the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/ L). The difference in proportion of responders between TRC101 and placebo subjects and its exact (Clopper-Pearson) 95% CI, as well as the p- value from Fisher’s exact test comparing the TRC101 group and the placebo group will be reported"

Th e proportion of subjects who are responders and the exact 95% C Is of the proportion will also be presented by treatment group and time point. A comparison between the the TRC101 group and the placebo group with respect of the proportion of responders at Week 52 will be perfomed using Fisher’s exact test. A longitudinal mixed -effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to analyze the CFB in bicarbonate. The model will include the CFB in bicarbonate as the dependent variable, treatment, time point ( Weeks 12, 14,…, 52), and treatment by time point interaction as fixed effects, subject as a random effect, and the baseline bicarbonate and baseline eGFR as continuous covariates . An unstructured covariance structure will be used. The least squares (L S) mean of CFB in bicarbonate, standard error of the LS mean, and two -sided 95% CIs of the LS mean from the mixed model will be reported by time point and treatment group. The LS mean difference from placebo (i.e., TRC101 – placebo), standard error ( SE) of the LS mean difference, 95% CIs of the LS mean difference, and p- values of the LS mean difference from the mixed model will be reported by time point. A test comparing the LS means of CFB in blood bicarbonate between treatment groups will be conducted at the end of treatment (Week 52 Visit ). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to assess the CFB in total score of KDQOL and in the repeated chair stand test. The model will include the CFB value as the dependent variable, treatment as a f ixed effect, and the baseline value as a covariate. The least squares (LS) mean of CFB value, standard error of LS mean, and two -sided 95% CIs of the LS mean from the ANCOVA model will be reported by treatment group. The LS mean difference from placebo ( i.e., TRC101 – placebo), SE of the LS mean difference, 95% CIs of the LS mean difference, and p- values of the LS mean difference from the ANCOVA model will be reported . In order to evaluate the potential effect of missing data on the durability of effect , sensitivity analyses for responders will be performed using multiple imputation models under a MNAR assumption for the MITT analysis set. T he SAP will describe these additional analyses. If the residuals from the above mentioned models (i.e., MMRM, ANCOVA) are not normally distributed, alternative analyses to deal with non -normality will be used instead . The SAP will specify these analyses. Safety Analysis Safety will be summarized for subjects in the safety analysis set. The following will be summarized by 12-week interval with denominator as the number of subjects at risk at the beginning of each interval: number and percentage of subjects with treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) classified by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT); number (%) of subjects experiencing TEAEs by severity, causality, seriousness and action taken with regard to study drug.

The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, leg ibility, and timeliness of the data reported on subjects’ eCRFs. Data reported on the eCRF, which are derived from source documents, should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained. An explanation should be given f or all missing data. All eCRF data and query resolutions must be completed only by the clinical study personnel designated by the Investigator. All site staff will have proper training prior to accessing the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system. Any chang e or correction to an eCRF will be tracked via an audit trail within the EDC system. The audit trail will contain the original data value, new data value, date changed, the user who made the change, and the reason(s) for the change. CRFs should be comple ted in a timely manner to support the study timeline (i.e., the site should not wait for a monitoring visit before entering data into the eCRF). Data from the eCRFs and queries will be tracked and entered into a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant clinical database. The database system will be a secured, password -protected system with full audit trail utility. Subject data will be reviewed through programmed quality checks and manually through review of data listings by Tricida and its designee. Data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate will be queried for clarification be the site . Data corrections will be updated to the database and tracked in the audit trail. AEs and concomitant medications will be coded using industry standard di ctionaries (e.g., Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA ] and World Health Organization [WHO] Drug dictionary). The Investigator is responsible for reviewing, verifying, and approving all subject data (i.e., eCRFs and resolved queries). Data Handling The final data will be transferred to the SAS -system for data analyses in accordance with the SAP. The MedDRA dictionary will be used for coding of AEs and concomitant diseases. Concomitant medication will be coded using th e WHO Drug Dictionary ATC c ode.

Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 73 of 74 Notes: All blood draws for bicarbonate measur ements must be done with subjects in a fasted state (at least 4 hours, except water) . Allowed visit window s are: ± 4 days for Week 14, 16, 20, 24 Visits ; ± 7 days for Week 28, 34, 40, 46 and 52 Visits (Week 52 Visit must not occur earlier than the 1 -year anniversary of the Day 1 Visit in the parent study TRCA -301); and ± 2 days for Follow -up 1 and 2 Visits . Abbreviations: C = central laboratory assessment; ECG = electrocardiogram; L = local laboratory assessment; UNS = unscheduled . a The Week 52 visit will occur no earlier than the 1 year anniversary of the Day 1 visit in study TRCA -301. Subjects who discontinue the study prior to Week 52 are required to undergo an E arly Termination Visit with all We ek 52 Visit procedures to be performed. All subjects who discontinue study drug prior to Week 52 will be contacted by telephone at the Week 52 Visit timepoint to ascertain vital status and renal status (i.e., receiving renal replacement therapy or not ). b Data collected for the Week 12 Visit in Study TRCA -301 will serve as the Week 12 Visit data in this extension study . c Vital signs include: blood pressure and respiratory rate (both in triplicate, measurements taken approximately 2 minutes apart at Week 12 and Week 52 Visits ; once at all other time points), heart rate, and temperature. d Complete p hysical examination will include an examination of cardiovascular, lungs and chest, head and neck, abdomen, musculoskeletal, skin and neurological systems (genitourinary examination not required) . e ECG will be collected in triplicate, 30 seconds apart. The subject must be in a supine position, or in the most recumbent position possible, in a rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes before the ECG assessment is co nducted. All ECGs should be performed prior to blood draws whenever possible. f The i -STAT G3+ cartridge must be used and measurement taken from a whole blood sample within 10 min of the blood draw. g Either enzymatic or venous blood gas assay but consistent for each subject as soon as possible in accordance with local laboratory requirements . h For subjects receiving vitamin K antagonists or factor Xa inhibitors only. Vitamin K antagonists include warfarin and acenoco umaral. Factor Xa inhibitors include apix aban, rivaroxaban, betrixaban, edoxaban and enoxaparin. i For women of childbearing potential, blood samples will be collected for serum pregnancy tests at the visits indicated. At the Week 12 Visit, a urine sample will be collected for a urine dipstick pre gnancy test conducted at the study site . j Blood and urine biomarker samples will be collected and stored under frozen conditions as specified in the laboratory manual . k Instruct subjects on collecting 24 -hour urine samples and dispense necessary supplies. Subjects should collect urine samples at home in accordance with the Urine Collection Instructions and return the collected specimens at the Week 12 and Week 52 Visits . l Dispense study drug per IRT instructions . Instruct subject to take study drug with food at approximately the same time each day, at least 4 hours apart from all oral concomitant medications. m Oral alkali supplement ( for subjects taking one at the Week 12 Visit only), should be discontinued or re -started based on blood bicarbonate level and study drug dose as described in Appendix 2. n The last dose of study drug shall be administered 1 day before the Week 52 Visit. o Instruct subject to bring all used and unused study drug containers to each visit. Collect all study drug containers at the W eek 52 Visit or at ET Visit. p Adverse events with a start date during the parent study , TRCA -301, that are ongoing at the time of enrollment in TRCA -301E and adverse events with an onset following enrollment in TRCA -301E will be recorded. q Possible procedures during the unscheduled visit are listed. The actual procedures should be determined by the Investigator based on the reason for the unscheduled visit. In all cases, reason for the visit and recording of adverse events and concomitant medicati ons should be done."

Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301E October 1 7, 2018 Confidential Page 74 of 74 Appendix 2: Study Drug and Oral Alkali Supplement Titration Algorithm Blood Bicarbonate (mEq/L) Study Drug Oral Alkali Supplementa < 12b At Week 12 Visit : Do not enroll subject in Study TRCA -301E During Treatment Period: Evaluate for new acute acidotic process, contact Medical Monitor. Maintain dose(s) pending discussion with Medical Monitor. 12 to < 22 Increase the study drug dose by 1 packet/day (maximum dose is 3 packets/day). Only increase the dose if NO dose changes have been made during the previous 14 days. Retest blood bicarbonate at next scheduled vis it. Maintain dose until next scheduled visit. 22 to < 27 Maintain dose until next scheduled visit. Discontinue oral alkali supplement until the next scheduled visit. If bicarbonate remains ≥ 22 mEq/L, do not re -instate oral alkali. If bicarbonate is < 22 mEq/L at the next scheduled visit, increase study drug dose by one packet and retest bicarbonate at the next scheduled visit. If a subject who was taking oral alkali at the Week 12 Visit had their oral alkali discontinued, AND they are receiving the maximum dose of study drug (i.e., 3 packets ) AND their blood bicarbonate value is < 22 mEq/L, re -instate the same oral alkali supplement subject was taking at the Week 12 Visit at the same dose taken at the Week 12 Visitc. If the Investigator judges that re -starting alkali treatment poses a safety risk, the risk should be documented. In this situation, alk ali will not be re -started. 27 to 30 Maintain dose. Invite subject for a visit in approximately 1 to 2 week s to retest blood bicarbonate. > 30b Interrupt (hold) study drug. Invite subject for a visit in approximately 1 week to retest blood bicarbonate. If blood bicarbonate at that visit is: ≤ 30 mEq/L , restart study drug at a lower dose (1 packet/day less than before dose interruption ) except for subjects on 1 packet/da y prior to dose interruption, who will restart study drug at 1 packet/day dose . > 30 mEq/L , continue to hold the dose and retest again in approximately 1 week. Discontinue oral alkali supplement. a For subjects taking an oral alkali supplement at Week 12 only . b Blood bicarbonate values of < 12 mEq/L or > 30 mEq/L must be confirmed by a repeated measurement from a separate blood draw. c The Week 12 dose is defined as the average daily dose prescribed during Week 12 ."
