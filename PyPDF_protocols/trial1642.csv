INTRODUCTION Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regul ator (CFTR) protein, a cAMP -regul ated anion channel expressed primarily at the apical plasma membrane of secretory epithelia. Over 2,000 mutations in the CFTR gene (CFTR ) have been ident ified, which are grouped into 6classes (class I-VI). The F508del mutati on is by far the most commo n CFTR mutati on globally , especially in the Caucasian popul ation. Approximately 80to 90% of CF patients in the United States and Europe have at least one copy of this mutati on on one allele, wi th almost half of them being F508del hom ozygous ( i.e.the mutation is present on both alleles). The F508del mutation impairs CFTR folding, stabilit y at the endopl asmic reticulum and plasma membrane, and chloride gat ing. Thus, the F508del mutati on resul ts in very little to no CFTR protein in the apical membrane. CFTR dysfunct ion resul ts in viscid secret ions that are difficult to clear, affect ing most exocrine glands, notably the pancreas, intestine, liver, and bile duct. However, most morbidity and mortalit y resul ts from dehydrat ion of the airway surface liquid and impaired airway mucociliary clearance, which leads to cycles of bacterial infection, chronic inflammat ion, bronchiectasis and progressive decline in pulmo nary functi on. There is a high medical need for efficacious therapeuti c approaches to treat CF subjects with the F508del mutation. CFTR modulators are com pounds designed to repai r the consequences of CFTR mutations on protein expressio n and/or function. Overall, 2types of small-molecule CFTR modulators are being devel oped: corrector mole cules that are designed to restore proper prote in folding and allowing for increased surface expressio n, and potenti ator molecules targeted at improving chloride -channel gating function. In order to bring optimal clinical benefit to the F508del CF popul ation, a combinat ion of a potenti ator and correcto r(s) is needed. GLPG2222 is a CFTR corrector i n devel opment f or the oral treatm ent of CF and represents the second com ponent of a future potentiator/corrector (s)combinat ion therapy targe ting the F508del CF populat ion. 2.1. PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL PROPERTIES AND FORMULATIONS The chemical name of GLPG2222 is4-[(2R,4R)-4-[[[1-(2,2-difluoro -1,3-benzodioxo l-5- yl)cyclopropyl]carbonyl]amino] -7-(difluorom ethoxy) -3,4-dihydro -2H-chromen -2-yl]benzo ic acid. Two formulat ions are currently available for oral use: an oral suspensio n and a tablet. 2.2. NONCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 2.2.1. Primary and Secondary Pharmacology GLPG2222 is a CFTR corrector that exhibits potent in vitro activit y in primary patient cells harboring F508del/F508del CFTR with an effective conc entrati on provi ding 50% of the maximal response Activi ty of corrected F508del CFTR channel is measured in the presence of a potentiator such as GLPG1837 or GLPG2451 ,which is needed to obtain maximal channel opening."

If not one of the above 2categori es, a female subject is considered a wom an of childbearing potent ialand must use one of the following highly effect ive methods of birth control starting on the day of signing the ICF, during the study ,and for at least3 months after the last dose of study drug: Combined (estrogen and progesterone containing) horm onal contracepti on (oral , intravaginal, transdermal) associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation . Progesteron e-only hormonal contracepti on (oral , injectable, implantable) associ ated with inhibit ion of ovulation. Intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone -releasing system . Bilateral tubal occlusio n. Have a vasectomized partner, provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the study parti cipant (woman of childbearing potential) and that the vasectomi zed partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success . Sexual abstinence ,defined asrefraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliabilit y of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relat ion to the durati on of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifest yle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaratio n of abstinence for the durati on of a study, and wi thdrawal are not acceptabl e methods of contraception. Within these limits, the specific forms of contraception employed are left to the discretion of the subject, the invest igator , and/or the subject’s physician. The safet y of GLPG2222 during breastfeeding is unknown. Women who are nursing are not allowed to take part in this study . 5.2.6.2.2. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential Vasectomized male subjects or subjects with bilateral absence of vas deferens with female partners of childbearing potential are not required to use an additional form of contracepti on, provi dedthat azoospermia has been confirmed and documented . Non-vasectomized male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use a condom starting on the day of signing the ICF, during the study, and for at"

Subjects who take inhaled antibiot ics for suppressio n of chronic ai rway infect ion must be on a stable regimen for at l east 8 w eeks pri or to the first study drug administration. Influenza vaccination cannot be administered within 4weeks prior to the first study drug administration and for the ent ire study durati on. Examples of stable medication regimen for pulmonary health are: antibiotics, corticosteroi ds (inhaled or oral), inhaled bronchodilators, hypertonic saline, mannito l or dornase alfa; ibuprofen and airway clearance techniques. Subjects can be on stable treatm ent with chroni c use of oral corticosteroi ds provi ded that the daily dose of prednisone (or equivalent) is ≤10 m g. Subjects who are using chronically inhaled antibiotics must remain on the same regimen for the durati on of the study . Subjects who are on cycling inhaled antibiot ics (including ‘on/o ff’ cycling), must continue on the same schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug m ust be as cl ose as possible to the first day of the inhaled cycling antibiotic in the cycle. This also applies to subjects who are cy cling 2 different al ternate inhaled ant ibiotics each m onth. If the subject shows a worsening of his/her CF disease condi tion, which in the invest igator’s opinio n needs an alternative treatm ent approach, treatm ent with study drug will be discontinued and the subject will be withdrawn from the study . 5.3.9. Blinding and Unb linding This is a rando mized, double -blind study . The subject, the invest igator, the study coordinator, the sponsor and the entire study processing team will remain blinded to treatm ent assignment. The blind can be broken only if the investigator deems it is necessary for the safe treatm ent of a subject .The invest igator is encouraged to discuss consi derati ons to break the blind with the medical monitor whenever possible and where the situation allows, and to inform the sponsor. Howeve r, the investigator is responsible for the medical care of the individual trial subject and the responsibilit y to break the treatm ent code in emergency situations resides solely with the invest igator. The investigator is not required to discuss unblinding if he or she feels rapid emergency unblinding is necessary . If the blind is broken for any reason during the course of the study , the moment at which the subject’s data were unblinded and all other relevant informat ion will be docum ented by the clinical study center , CRO, and other sponsor designees, as appropri ate. The reason for breaking the blind will be indicated and justified in the source docum entati on and in the eCRF. The blind can be broken by the investigator via the IWRS.

Sweat Chloride Concentration Sweat chloride concentration is a biomarker of CFTR ion channel function. It is a sensit ive, standardized and non-invasive measure to assess systemic CFTR modulator effects. Chloride concentration will be measured in sweat collected by an approved collect ion device (Wescor Macroduct®system) according to the 2009 guidelines issued by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Inst itute. To ensure consistency and reproducibilit y in this multi-center study , ‘trained’ clinical study center swill collect sweat according to standardized operati ng procedures. Two sweat collect ions, one fro m each arm , will be obtained from each subject at thetime point sindicated in the flowchart. Sweat sam ples will immediately be frozen and sent to the central laboratory for testing and interpretation of resul ts. The clinical study center shoul d be encouraged to select subjects for the study for which it is known that adequate quantit ies of sweat can be collected. Clinical study centers and subjects shoul d not be informed of their sweat chloride resul ts during the entire study durati on,regardl ess of whether the subject prematurely discont inues treatm ent. 6.3.2. Spirometry Spirometry will be performed to assess pulmo nary function at the time points specified in the flow chart. Spiro metry must be performed pre-dose at all visits, and additionally between 1and 2 hours post -dose on Day1 and Day 29. The spirometry test m ust meet the criteria for acceptabilit y and repeatabilit y as defined in the 2005 ATS/ERS guidelines on standardizat ion of lung funct ion testing [7]. If screening spirometry measurements fail to meet acceptabilit y and repeatabilit y criteria in the first 3 efforts, up to 8 repeat spiro metry efforts may be performed. If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) satisfythe eligibilit y criteria and are completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study . Clinical study centers will be provi ded with spirometers to be used for all study spirometry assessments. Pulmo nary function will be measur ed in a standardized manner. Spi rometry data will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for qualit y review. Subjects shoul d not be informed of their study -related spirometry results during the entire study durat ion, regardl ess of whether the s ubject prem aturely discontinues treatm ent. At screening, spirometry to determine subject’s eligibilit y shoul d preferably be perform ed pre-bronchodilator. If the subject used his/her bronchodilator before the screening visit, screening spi rometry is allowedto be perform ed post -bronchodilator. At all other study visits, spirometry shoul dbe performed pre-bronchodilator. If on Day 1, the subject forgets to withhol d his/her bronchodilator ,all subsequent spirometry testing shoul d be performed post- bronchodilat or, to be consistent with the conditio ns for the baseline measurement. If on Day 1,spirometry is collected pre-bronchodilator, but the subject forgets to withhold his/her"

DEFINITIONS Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (invest igational or non -invest igational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relati onship with the treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorabl e and unintended sign (including an abnorm al finding), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (invest igational or non-invest igational) product, whethe r or not related to that medicinal (invest igational or non -investigational) product. Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets any of the following condi tions: resul ts in death; is life-threatening: the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hy potheti cally might cause death if it were more severe; requi res inpatient hospitalizat ion or prol ongati on of exist ing hospi talizati on; resul ts in persistent or significant d isabilit y/incapaci ty; is a congenital ano maly/birth defect. is a medically significant event that may not be immediately life-threatening or resul t in death or hospitalization but may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definit ions above. Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or intensit y is not consistent with the applicable product reference safety information.For a study drug, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the Invest igator’s Brochure [6]. Associated With the Use of the Drug An AE is considered associ ated with the use of the drug if the causali ty is possible, probable, or certain by the defini tions listed in Section9.3. 9.2. INTENSITY OF ADVERSE EVENT Each AE must be rated on a 3 -point scale o f increasing intensit y: Mild : Transient or mild disco mfort; no limitat ion in activi ty; no medical intervent ion/therapy requi red."
41,page_41,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG2222 -CL-202 Page 42/58 Version 3.0, Final , 6-Dec-2016 Confidential InformationModerate : Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or minima l medical intervention/the rapy requi red. Severe : Marked limitation in activi ty; some assistance usually required; medical intervent ion/therapy requi red, hospi talizati on possible . If there is a change in intensit y of an AE, i t must be recorded as a separate event. 9.3. CAUSALITY ASSESSME NT The following decisio n choice will be used by the investigator to describe the causalit y assessment between the reported event and the investigational medicinal product. Unrelated: No relationship between the AE and the administration of study drug; related to other etiologies such as concomitant medicat ions or subject's clinical state. Unlikely: Event or laboratory test abnorm ality, with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible). Disease or other drugs provide plau sible explanat ions. Possible: Event or laboratory test abnormalit y, with reasonable time relati onship to drug intake which coul d also be explained by disease or other drugs. Inform ation on drug wi thdrawal may be lacking or unclear. Probable: Event or labor atory test abnormalit y, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake. Event unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs. Response to withdrawal is clinically reasonable and rechallenge not required. Certain: Event or laboratory test abnormalit y, with plausible time relationship to drug intake which cannot be explained by disease or other drugs. Response to wi thdrawal is plausible (pharmaco logically , patho logically ). Event definit ive pharmaco logically o r pheno menologically (i.e.an objective and specific medical disorder or a recogni zed pharmaco logical phenom enon). Rechallenge satisfactory , if necessary . 9.4. ACTION TAKEN REGA RDING INVESTIGATIONA L PRODUCT (IF APPLICABLE) The action taken must be described by choosing amo ng: Dose not changed: In case no action is taken regarding the study drug. Dose reduced: Not allowed in this study Drug permanently withdrawn: In case a subject is permanent ly wit hdrawn fro m the study . Drug temporarily withdrawn: In case the study drug is tem porarily wit hdrawn. Not appli cable: Other si tuations (e .g.in case an AE started after the last study drug administration)"

OUTCOME Each AE outcom e must be rated using one of the following terms : Recovered/Resolved; Recovered/Resolved with sequelae; Not recovered/Not resolved; Fatal; Recovering/Reso lving; Unknown. 9.6. RECORDING ADVERSE EV ENTS Adverse events will be recorded from the signature of the ICF until the final follow-up v isit. In case an AE is ongoing at that time, it will be followed up as much as possible by the investigator until reso lution or until stabilizat ion. It is the responsibilit y of the invest igator to collect all AEs (both serious and non-serious) derived by spontaneous, unso licited reports of subjects, by observat ion and by routi ne open questioning (such as “How do y oufeel?”). Any adverse or unusual event occurring during or after the clinical study (until the follow-up visit), whether observed by the invest igator or investigational staff, or spontaneously reported by the subjects, will be recorded in the eCRF and medi cal file . 9.7. MANAGING SERIOUS ADV ERSE EVENTS Subjects experiencing an SAE or an emergency situati on will be examined by a physician as soon as possible. The physician in attendance will do whatever is medically needed for the safet y and well-being of the subject. The subject will remain under observation as long as medically indicated. Appropriate laboratory tests will be perf ormed unt il all parameters return to norm al or are otherwi se explained or stable. The subject will be followed until the SAE resolve s or until the subject is medically stabilized. 9.8. REPORTING SERIOUS AD VERSE EVENTS / PREGNANCIES 9.8.1. Serious Adverse Events All SAEs, whether or not deem ed drug-related, must be recorded in the eCRF and SAE form and reported by the invest igator to Medical Affairs ( MA) within 24 hours by facsimile. Other means of transmissi on can be decided where facsimile is not possible. The SAE must include a clearly written narrative describing signs, symptom s, and treatm ent of the event, diagnost ic procedures, as well as any relevant laboratory data and any sequelae. Follow-up and outcom es must be reported for all subjects that experience an SAE. It is crit ical that the information provi ded on the SAE form matches the informat ion recorded on the eCRF for the same event. In addit ion, the same informat ion is to be recorded in the source documents."

Pregnancy All initial reports of pregnancies in female subjects and partners of male subjects included in the study must be reported to MA by the invest igator within 24 hours of knowl edge of the event, using a pregnancy form. The invest igator will contact the subject at the expected time of delivery for follow-up. Abnorm al pregnancy outcom es are considered SAEs and must be reported using the SAE form. If a subject is found to be pregnant, she must be immediately withdrawn fro m the study . 9.9. REPORTING SERIOUS AD VERSE EVENTS T O COMPETENT AUTHORITIES /ETHICS COMMITTEES / INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS MA assumes responsibilit y for appropri ate reporting of AEs to the Regulatory Authori ties. MA will also report to the invest igator(s) all SAEs that are unlisted (unexp ected) and associ ated with the use of the drug. The invest igator(s) (or MA where requi red) must report these events to the appropriate IEC/IRB that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by the IEC/IRB. Adverse events report ing, including suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulat ions. After termination of the clinical study (last subject last contact in the study ), any unexpected safet y issue that changes the risks benefit analysis and is likely to have an impact on the subjects who have participated in it, will be reported by the sponsor/ MA as soon as possible to the Competent Authorit y(ies) concerned together with proposed actions. 10. STUDY CLOSURE C ONSIDERATIONS The sponsor reserves the right to close the clinical study center or terminate the study at any time for any reason. In case of an early terminatio n of the study or temporary halt by the sponsor, the IEC/IRB should be notified within 15 calen dar days, including a detailed written explanat ion of the reasons for the terminat ion/halt. When the study ends, the sponsor will submi t an “end of trial notificati on” to both the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authori ties, according to local regulations, by using the “Declarat ion of the End of Trial Form”.

STUDY MATERIALS 11.1. INVESTIGATIONAL MEDI CAL PRODUCTS The invest igator acknowledges that the study drugs are investigational and as such must be handled strictly in accordance with the clinical study protocol and the container label. Supplies must be retained in a limited access area and under the appropriate environmental condi tions as specified on delivery . Upon receipt of the study drugs, the invest igator or delegate will verify whether the correct amount of study drugs are delivered and whether those are i ntact. Supplies shoul d be dispensed under the supervision of the investigator or sub-invest igator, or by a hospi tal pharm acist. Local regulati ons should be adhered to. It is the invest igator's or delegate’s responsibilit y to ensure that subjects return their study drugs (including empt y packages, e.g. empty bottles). Returned study drugs must not be dispensed again, even not to the same subject. Each time study drugs is dispensed to or returned by the subject, this must be docum ented on the Drug Accountabilit y Form . Whenever a subject brings his/her study drug to the clinical study center for drug accountabilit ythis is not seen as a return of supplies. Unused study drug (not dispensed) and study drug returned by the subject must be available for verificat ion by the mo nitor. All used and unused study drug will be returned to the drug supplier/CRO depot or will be passed over for destructi on on -site (conf orm local regul ations) or by an authori zed destructi on unit after authorization by the sponsor. This will be docum ented on the Drug Return Form and a destru ction certificate, if applicable. 11.2. STUDY DOCUMENTS The following docum ents must be provided to the sponsor or representatives before shipment of study drugs to the clinical study center : A signed and dated protocol and amendment(s), if any. A copy of the si gned and dated wri tten IEC/IRB approval specifying the documents being approved: the protocol , amendments, ICF, any other written information provided to th e subject and subject recruit ment materials.

Following ICH GCP Guidelines, direct access to source documents must be granted for the purpose of verifying that the data recorded on the eCRF are consistent with the o riginal source data. 11.5. ELECTRONIC DATA CAPT URE Electronic Data Capture (EDC) will be used for this study , meaning that all CRF data will be entered in eCRFs at the clinical study center . All data rel ated to the study must be recorded in the EDC sy stem in Eng lish. The eCRFs shoul d always reflect the latest observat ions on the subjects participat ing in the study . Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon as possible during or after the subject’s visit. To avoid inter -observer vari ability, every effort mustbe made to ensure that all efficacy evaluations are completed by the same individual who made the initial baseline determinat ions. The invest igator must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. If certain information is not do ne, not available or not applicable or unknown, the investigator must indicate thi s in the eCRF. The investigator will be requi red to el ectroni cally sign off on the clinical data. During monitoring visits, the monitor will review the eCRFs, evaluate them for completeness and consistency . The eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies between critical data. All entries, corrections and alterati ons are to be made by the responsible investigator or hi s/her designe e. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections to the data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name of the person who perform ed the chan ge, together with time and date will be logged. Roles and rights of the site personnel responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be determined in advance. If additional correcti ons are needed, the responsible monitor or data manager will raise a query in the EDC applicat ion. The appropri ate investi gational staff will answer queri es sent to the investigator. This will be audit trailed by the EDC system meaning that the name of investigat ional staff, time and date stamp are captured. 12.
