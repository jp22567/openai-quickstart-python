Primary Endpoint: The FACT- P questionnaire will be administered at baseline and month 12. Total Scores will be quantified and compared between treatment arms. 1.2 Secondary Objectives 1. To assess PSA response rates across the entire population and compared between groups. Secondary Endpoint : PSA evaluations will occur every 3 months while on study. The Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria (PCWG3) will be used to define PSA response rates of 50% and 90% reductions. 2. To assess impact of abiraterone and docetaxel on additional quality of life measurements and quality of life trends throughout the duration of the study. Secondary Endpoint: Patient reported questionnaires —including FACT -P, FACT/GOG- NTX, and PROMIS Fatigue—will be administered at baseline and months 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18. Total scores, subscale scores, and trends will be analyzed. 3. To assess the potential clinical efficacy between treatment groups. Secondary Endpoint: To assess the PSA progression free survival (PSA -PFS) between treatment arms. PSA -PFS is defined based on PCWG3 criteria. 1.3 Exploratory Objectives 1. To assess biomarkers that may predict treatment response to hormonal therapy versus chemotherapy. Changes to tumor suppressors and the androgen receptor as well as other mechanisms will be analyzed from urine, blood and tumor tissue molecular analysis. Exploratory Endpoint : Patients will have tissue collected during this study for correlative analysis. B lood will be collected at baseline, and months 3, 6, and 18. Also, archival tissue will be collected (if available) as well as an optional soft -tissue biopsy at the time of disease progression. 2. To assess additional measures of overall quality of life between groups. Exploratory Endpoint : The Overall Treatment Utility ( OTU) form, Was It Worth It (WIWI) questionnaire, and End of Study Evaluation Form will be administered to patients for exploratory purposes. The OTU form should be completed by the treating physician at the patient’s 3 month visit and the WIWI questionnair e and End of Study Evaluation Form administered to the patient at the end of treatment (month 18 or progression visit, whichever comes first)."
11,page_11,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 12 of 52 2 BACKGROUND 2.1 Hypothesis Currently there are two competing standards of care for first -line treatment of patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), with docetaxel plus ADT and abiraterone plus ADT both demonstrating improved disease control over ADT alone. No direct comparisons have been done between these therapies , so the optimal treatment for these patients is currently not clear. The first studies published to demonstrate improved overall survival over monotherapy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone were the CHAARTED 1 and STAMPEDE2 (arms A, B, C and E) prospective clinical trials. In the CHAARTED study, 790 patients were randomized to ADT alone versus ADT plus 6 cycles of docetaxel. The median overall survival (OS) with the addition of docetaxel was significantly longer 57.6 months vs. 44.0 months (hazard ratio {HR} 0.61; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.47—0.80; P<0.001). These finding were verified in the STAMPEDE trial where six cycles of docetaxel plus ADT also improved clinical outcomes over ADT alone. The two docetaxel arms resulted in significant improvement to OS compared to the two ADT alone arms with hazard ratios of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.66—093; p=0.006) and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69—0.97; p=0.022) respectively. Two studies have shown superior outcomes with the addition of abiraterone to ADT in mHSPC, the LATITUDE 3 and STAMPEDE4 (arms A and G) clinical trials. The LATITUDE trial randomized 1199 patients and the STAMPEDE randomized 1917 patients to ADT versus ADT plus abiraterone. The combination improved the median OS in the LATITUDE trial (not reached vs. 34.7 months; HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51—0.76; P<0.001) and improved 3 year survival in the STAMPEDE trial at 83% vs 76% (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.52—0.76; P<0.001). These two approaches of combination therapy have not been directly compared so no high - level evidence is available to make optimal treatment choices based on clinical outcomes. Treatment decision is instead based on other clinical factors such as drug availability, fitness for chemotherapy, toxicity or cost. 5 There is likely a difference in these treatments regarding toxicities and cost. For instance, docetaxel is known to cause alopecia, febrile neutropenia fatigue and neuropathy. Abiraterone is known to cause fatigue, drug induced hepatitis and hypertension. There are differences in the treatment duration as well with docetaxel given for 6 cycles (approximately 4 months) whereas abiraterone is given until disease progression which may result in differences in quality of life and does result in difference in financial expense. 6 The patient reported outcomes in the LATITUDE study favored the combination group7. The reported quality of life was initially worse with docetaxel than ADT alone at three months, but better than ADT alone at 12 months in the CHAARTED study. 8 Finally, there might be molecularly identified subgroups that will preferentially respond to a hormonal based treatment (i.e. ADT + abiraterone) or a chemotherapy based treatment (i.e. ADT + docetaxel). For instance, previous studies have demonstrated some subgroups of patients in the castration -resistant setting that are more sensitive to docetaxel over abiraterone. 9-11 We hypothesize that treatment efficacy will be similar across the entire population studied in this clinical trial between ADT + docetaxel versus ADT + abiraterone. However, we"
12,page_12,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 13 of 52 hypothesize that quality of life will be superior throughout the study for the abiraterone treated patients. Doing this clinical trial directly comparing these two treatment options will also allow for exploratory analysis of bi omarkers of treatment response between hormonal versus chemotherapy treatment in this population of patients which may identify additional factors that may be important in the treatment selection between docetaxel and abiraterone for this patient populatio n. 3 DRUG INFORMATION 3.1 Androgen Deprivation Therap y All subjects must receive ADT of Investigator’s choice (LHRH agonist or antagonist, or orchiectomy) per FDA approved dosing regulations as standard therapy for the duration of the clinical trial. Patients s hould maintain a castrate level testosterone concentration (i.e. total testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL) as validation of therapeutic efficacy for the chosen ADT therapy. 3.2 Docetaxel (Taxotere) Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Refer to Sanofi Package Insert for detail regarding clinical administration of TAXOTERE. The following information is taken from the Package Insert 3.2.1 Pharmacology Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20 mg/m2 to 115 mg/m2 in phase 1 studies. The area under the curve (AUC) was dose proportiona l following doses of 70 mg/m2 to 115 mg/m2 with infusion times of 1 to 2 hours. Docetaxel’s pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with a three- compartment pharmacokinetic model, with half -lives for the α, β, and γ phases of 4 min, 36 min, and 11.1 hr, respectively. Mean total body clearance was 21 L/h/m2. Distribution: The initial rapid decline represents distribution to the peripheral compartments and the late (terminal) phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral c ompartment. Mean steady state volume of distribution was 113 L. In vitro studies showed that docetaxel is about 94% protein bound, mainly to α1 -acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins. In three cancer patients, the in vitro binding to plasma proteins was found to be approximately 97%. Dexamethasone does not affect the protein binding of docetaxel. Metabolism: In vitro drug interaction studies revealed that docetaxel is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and its metabolism may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Elimination: A study of 14C- docetaxel was conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in both the urine and feces following oxidative metabolism of the tert -butyl ester"
13,page_13,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 14 of 52 group, but fecal excretion was the main elimination route. Within 7 days, urinary and fecal excretion accounted for approximately 6% and 75% of the administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in feces is excreted during the first 48 hours as 1 major and 3 minor metabolites with very small amounts (less than 8%) of unchanged drug 3.2.2 Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent belonging to the taxoid family . It is prepared by semisynthesis beginning with a precursor extracted from the renewable needle biomass of yew plants. The chemical name for docetaxel is (2R,3S) -N-carboxy-3- phenylisoserine,N -tert-butyl ester, 13- ester with 5β -20-epoxy-1,2α,4,7β,10β,13α -hexahydroxytax-11- en-9-one 4- acetate 2 - benzoate, trihydrate. Docetaxel is a white to almost -white powder with an empirical formula of C43H53NO14• 3H2O, and a molecular weight of 861.9. It is highly lipophilic and practically insoluble in water 3.2.3 Clinical Safe ty The following data are based on the experience of 332 prostate cancer patients, who were treated with TAXOTERE 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily :"
14,page_14,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 15 of 52 3.3 Abiraterone Acetate (Abiraterone) Abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP17 (17α -hydroxylase/C17,20- lyase). Abiraterone for this trial will be dispensed as part of the patient’s standard of care therapy. Depending on insurance and/or physician preference, Zytiga, Yonsa, or a generic abiraterone acetate will be allowed. Dosing for each regimen should be consistent with FDA prescribing information. Refer to Package Insert for detail regarding clinical administration of Zytiga, Yonsa, or generic abiraterone acetate. The following information is taken from these documents: 3.3.1 Pharmacology Abiraterone acetate ( abiraterone ) is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 α -hydroxylase/C17,20- lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: 1) the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α -hydroxy derivatives by 17α -hydroxylase activity and 2) the subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone."
15,page_15,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 16 of 52 Inhibition of CYP17 by abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor. Abiraterone decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo -controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone on serum testosterone levels. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients. 3.3.2 Physical and Chemical Properties Abiraterone acetate is a white to off -white, non- hygroscopic, crystalline powder. Its m olecular formula is C26H33NO2 and it has a molecular weight of 391.55. Abiraterone acetate is a lipophilic compound with an octanol -water partition coefficient of 5.12 (Log P) and is practically insoluble in water. The pKa of the aromatic nitrogen is 5.19. 3.3.3 Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation Zytiga Each Zytiga tablet contains either 250 mg or 500 mg of abiraterone acetate. Abiraterone acetate is designated chemically as (3β) -17-(3-pyridinyl) androsta5,16- dien-3-yl acetate. Zytiga tablets are availab le in 500 mg film -coated tablets, 250 mg film -coated tablets and 250 mg uncoated tablets with the following inactive ingredients: • 500 mg film- coated tablets: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesiu m stearate, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium lauryl sulfate.

16,page_16,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 17 of 52 791). Placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily was given to control patients (N = 394). The median duration of treatment with Abiraterone was 8 months. The most common adverse drug reactions (≥5%) reported in clinical studies were joint swelling or discomfort, hypokalemia, edema, muscle discomfort, hot flush, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, cough, hypertension, arrhythmia, urinary frequency, nocturia, dyspepsia, and upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse drug reactions that resulted in drug discontinuation were aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, urosepsis and cardiac failure (each in <1% of patients taking abiraterone). Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities related to mineralocorticoid effects were reported m ore commonly in patients treated with abiraterone than in patients treated with placebo: hypokalemia 28% versus 20%, hypertension 9% versus 7% and fluid retention (edema) 27% versus 18%, respectively. In patients treated with abiraterone, grades 3 to 4 hypokalemia occurred in 5% of patients and grades 3 to 4 hypertension was reported in 1% of patients. Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions: The majority of arrhythmias were grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 -4 arrhythmias occurred at similar rates in the two arms. There was one death associated with arrhythmia and one patient with sudden death in the abiraterone arm. No patients had sudden death or arrhythmia associated with death in the placebo arm. Cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction led to death in 2 patients in the placebo arm and 1 death in the abiraterone arm. Cardiac failure resulting in death occurred in 1 patient on both arms. Hepatotoxicity : Drug- associated hepatotoxicity with elevated A LT, AST, and total bilirubin has been reported in patients treated with abiraterone. Across all clinical trials, liver function test elevations (ALT or AST increases of > 5X ULN) were reported in 2.3% of patients who received abiraterone, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. In the phase 3 trial, patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver function test elevations than those beginning with normal values. When elevations of either ALT or AST > 5X ULN, or elevations in bilirubin > 3X ULN were observed, abiraterone was withheld or discontinued. In two instances marked increases in liver function tests occurred. These two patients with normal baseline hepatic function, experienced ALT or AST elev ations 15 to 40X ULN and bilirubin elevations 2 to 6 X ULN. Upon discontinuation of abiraterone , both patients had normalization of their liver function tests and one patient was re- treated with ABIRATERONE without recurrence of the elevations. In clinical trials, the following patients were excluded: patients with active hepatitis, patients with baseline ALT and/or AST ≥ 2.5X ULN in the absence of liver metastases, and patients with ALT and/or AST > 5X ULN in the presence of liver metastases. Abnormal liver function tests developing in patients participating in clinical trials were managed by treatment interruption, dose modification and/or discontinuation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients with elevations of ALT or AST > 20X ULN were not re- treated."

Monitor patients for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention at least once a month. Control hypertension and correct hypokalem ia before and during treatment with Yonsa. In the two randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 hypertension occurred in 2% of patients, grade 3 to 4 hypokalemia in 4% of patients, and grade 3 to 4 edema in 1% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate. Co-administration of a corticosteroid suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drive, resulting in a reduction in the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure, hypokalemia or fluid retention, such as those with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, cardiovascular disease, or ventricular arrhythmia. The safety of Yonsa in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 50 % or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (in Study 1) or NYHA Class II to IV heart failure (in Study 2) was not established because these patients were excluded from these randomized clinical trials. Adrenocortical Insufficiency : Adrenal insufficiency occurred in the two randomized clinical studies in 0.5% of patients taking abiraterone acetate and in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. Adrenocortical insufficiency was reported in patients receiving abiraterone acetate in combinati on with corticosteroid, following interruption of daily steroids and/or with concurrent infection or stress. Monitor patients for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly if patients are withdrawn from corticosteroids, have cortico steroid dose reductions, or experience unusual stress. Symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be masked by adverse reactions associated with mineralocorticoid excess seen in patients treated with Yonsa. If clinically indicated, perform appropriate tests to confirm the diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency. Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated before, during and after stressful situations. Hepatotoxicity: In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate- associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths. In the two randomized clinical trials, grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5X ULN) were reported in 4% of patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to liver enzyme increases occurred in 1% of patients taking abiraterone acetate. No deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events. Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with Yonsa, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In"

Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt Yonsa treatment and closely monitor liver function. Re-treatment with Yonsa at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient’s baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5X ULN. Permanently discontinue treatment with abiraterone acetate for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and t otal bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation. The safety of YONSA re -treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20X ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10X ULN is unknown. 4 STUDY DESIGN 4.1 Description This is an open label, randomized prospective clinical trial.

The package insert recommends 1,000 mg administered orally once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered orally twice daily. No food should be consumed for at least two hours before the dose of Zytiga is taken and for at least one hour after the dose of Zytiga is taken. Yonsa The Yonsa should be dosed and administered per institutional standards and in accordance with FDA approved use . The recommended dose of YONSA is 500 mg (four 125 mg tablets) administered orally once daily in combination with methylprednisolone 4 mg administered orally twice daily with or without food. 7.3.3 Accountability and Compliance Abiraterone tablets will be supplied per standard practice of the treating physician and pharmacy . 7.4 Concomitant Medications and Therapies 7.4.1 Prohibited Therapy 7.4.1.1 Docetaxel Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed"
24,page_24,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 25 of 52 that the exposure of docetaxel increas ed 2.2- fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of docetaxel and drug s that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with docetaxel , close monitoring for toxicity and a docetaxel dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided 7.4.1.2 Abir aterone Abiraterone is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug- metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6. In a CYP2D6 drug- drug interaction trial, the Cmax and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9- fold, respectively, when dextromethorphan was given with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid coadministration of abiraterone acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., thioridazine). If alternative treat ments cannot be used, exercise caution and consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug. Abiraterone is also a substrate of CYP3A4. The effects of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, voriconazole) or inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone have not been evaluated, in vivo. Avoid or use with caution, strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 during abiraterone treatment . 7.5 Duration of Therapy Arm A: Patients will receive 6 cycles of docetaxel, given approximately every 3 weeks, in addition to physician’s choice ADT. Arm B: Patien ts will receive abiraterone continuously , in addition to physician’s choice ADT, until disease progression. 7.5.1 Criteria for discontinuation of treatment (“off treatment”) The following will result in treatment discontinuation: • Subject withdraws consent from the study treatment and/or study procedures. • Diagnosis of progression, per the discretion of the treating physician. The protocol suggests defining progression based on radiographic or clinical progression and not PSA only progression. • AEs or intercurrent illness that in the opinion of the investigator warrants the subject’s withdrawal from study treatment. • Significant noncompliance with the protocol schedule or treatment administration in the opinion of the investigator. 7.5.2 Criteria for discontinuation of study (“off study”) Subjects will be taken off study for the following:"

The Functional Assessm ent of Cancer Therapy -Prostate (FACT - P) questionnaire will be administered at baseline and month 12. The FACT -P is a 39 item questionnaire that measures health -related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.14 The FACT -P Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is the sum of the Physical Well -Being (PWB), Functional Well -Being (FWB), and Prostate Cancer Subscales (PCS). TOI Scores will be quantified and compared between treatment arms. 12.2 Statistical H ypothesis We hypothesize that abiraterone will have improved quality of life measurements at month 12 compared to docetaxel based on comparison of data from CHAARTED8 and LATITUDE.7 12.3 Secondary Objective and Endpoint - FACT/GOG- NTX: The FACT/GOG -NTX is a 38 item questionnaire that assesses patient self-report of neuropathy.15 It is a combination of the 27 -item FACT -G (which is also part of the FACT -P) plus 11 additional questions that specifically address sensory and motor neuropathy symptoms. - PROMIS Fatigue: The PROMIS Fatigue scale is a 7-item self -report measure designed to assess severity, frequency, and daily pattern of fatigue (www.nihpromis.com ). It has been validated in cancer populations.16 12.4 Sample S ize D etermination We hypothesize that patients on the ADT + Abiraterone arm will experience a superior overall QOL at month 12 after enrollment in the study. Cella (2008) reports that a minimally important difference in FACT -P TOI is a (standardized) effect size of 0.42 – 0.57. Power was calculated via simulations in R using a Gaussian approximation for FACT -TOI analyzed using a mixed effects model with fixed effects for treatment arm and categorical assessment time and a random intercept for each subject. We assumed correlation = 0.5 between baseline and follow up FACT -P TOI. We computed power for a comparison of the standardized change in FACT - P TOI from baseline to 12 months. With the above assumption 40 subjects with complete data per group will provide 80% power to detect a standardized effect size difference of 0.56 between the randomized groups at two sided alpha = 0.05. The sample size of 80 patients is calculated based on the number of patients with complete data. If there are patients with incomplete follow up data, they will contribute to the intent to treat population. We assume 10% of patients will have incomplete data. To account for this increased uncertainty the sample size will be increased to 89. 12.5 Statistical Methods Quality Of Life Endpoints The primary and secondary outcome variables are patient reported quality of life, including the FACT -P TOI (the primary outcome variable), and FACT/GOG NTX and PROMIS Fatigue"

Each of these outcomes will be analyzed using Gaussian repeated measures mixed -effects models. The models will contain random intercepts, fixed effects for each follow up assessment time and interaction terms for treatment arm and follow up assessment time. The primary analysis will be use a modified intent- to-treat strategy. Multiple imputation methods will be used to impute missing questionnaire data for each subject who completes a baseline questionnaire. The mixed effects models will also be us ed to report the mean and standard error of the change from baseline at each of the follow up time points at which the questionnaires are administered (3, 6, 9, 12, 18 months). The area under the curve from 0 to 12 months will also be reported. Joint mode ling of longitudinal FACT -P TOI and survival may be used as an additional sensitivity analysis to explore changes in QOL over time. The primary hypothesis is that patients on the ADT + Abiraterone arm will experience a superior overall QOL at month 12 afte r enrollment in the study. This single primary hypothesis will be tested at the two sided 0.05 significance level (unadjusted) using the interaction term between treatment arm and the 12 month follow up time from the mixed effects model for FACT -P TOI desc ribed above . Tests of interaction between treatment arm and the 12 month follow up time will also be performed for the models for FACT/GOG NTX and PROMIS Fatigue at the two sided 0.05 significance level (unadjusted). PSA Response and PSA Progression Free S urvival PSA will be measured every three months while on study. The proportion of subjects experiencing a 50% and 90% reduction in PSA as defined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 will be reported for each study arm, along with exact 95% confidence intervals (Clopper-Pearson). The proportion of PSA responders as defined by each of the above criteria will be compared between treatment arms using Fisher’s Exact test at the two sided 0.05 significance level (unadjusted). PSA Progression free survival (PSA-PSF) w ill be plotted using Kaplan -Meier methods. PSA - PFS will be compared between the treatment arms using a log -rank test at the two sided 0.05 significance level (unadjusted). Subjects that have not experience PSA progression at the end of study will be censor ed for PSA progression at the time of last on- study PSA evaluation. 13 REGISTRATION GUIDELINES Study related screening procedures can only begin once the patient has signed a consent form. Patients must meet all of the eligibility requirements listed above prior to registration. Patients must be registered before receiving any study treatment and must begin treatment within 42 days after randomization. To register eligible patients on study, complete a Clinical Trials Office Patient Registration Form and submit to CTORegistrations@hci.utah.edu. 14 DATA SUBMISSION SCHEDULE The Case Report Forms (CRFs) are a set of (electronic or paper) forms for each patient that provides a record of the data generated according to the protocol. CRF’s should be created prior"
33,page_33,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 34 of 52 to the study being initiated and updated (if applicable) when amendments to the protocol are IRB approved. These forms will be completed on an on- going basis during the study. The medical records will be source of verification of the data. During the study, the CRFs will be monitored for completeness, accuracy, legibility and attention to detail by a member of the Research Compliance Office. The CRFs will be completed by the Investigator or a member of the study team as listed on the Delegation of Duties Log. The data will be reviewed no less than annually by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. The Investigator will allow the Data and Safety Monitori ng Committee or Research Compliance Office personnel access to the patient source documents, clinical supplies dispensing and storage area, and study documentation for the above -mentioned purpose. The Investigator further agrees to assist the site visitors in their activities. Data capture should be restricted to endpoints and relevant patient information required for planned manuscripts. 15 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS 15.1 Correlative Studies 15.1.1 Correlative Tissue Samples Available archival tissue will be sent to Foundation Medicine to test for biomarkers of disease response and prediction of treatment effect , such as , but not limited to: next generation sequencing of tumor DNA and whole transcriptome analysis. NGS may be performed to assess for changes to tumor suppressors and the androgen receptor, as these have been demonstrated to be mechanisms of resistance to therapy. If the patient consents to the optional tissue, up to 4 research cores will be collected any time the patient has a standard of care biopsy while on study . Testing may include, but is not limited to: • Multiomics platform s • Immunohistochemistry • Flow cytometry Specimen collection and processing instructions can be found in the lab manual. 15.1.2 Correlative Blood Samples If the patient consents to provide optional blood samples , up to 54mL of peripheral blood will be collected at the timepoints listed in the study calendar. Testing may include, but is not limited to: • Circulating tumor cells (CTC) detection, enumeration , and characterization • Cytokine/c hemokine/interferon assays • Genomic analysis • Proteomic analyses • Flow Cytometry • Detection of somatic and germline DNA alterations by targeted sequencing of cell- free DNA."

Specimen collection and processing instructions can be found in the lab manual. 16 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 16.1 Informed consent Informed consent will be obtained from all research participants prior to p erforming any study procedures using the most recent IRB- approved version. 16.1.1 Participation of Children Patients must be at least 18 years of age to participate. 16.2 Institutional Review Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment materials (eg, advertisements) and any other applicable patient- facing documents. The investigator should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigator Brochure or product labeling information. The investigator or designee should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other information (eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and ad ministrative letters) according to regulatory requirements or institution procedures. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is established at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) to ensure the well -being of patients enrolled on Investigator Initiated Trials that do not have an outside monitoring review. The roles and responsibilities of the DSMC are set forth in the NCI-approved Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) plan. The activities of th e committee include review ing adve rse events (including SAEs ), deviations, important medical events, significant revisions or amendments to the protocol, and approving cohort/dose escalations. If the DSMC and/or the PI have concerns about unexpected safety issues, the study will be stopped and will not be resumed until the issues are resolved. The DSMC also reviews and approves audit reports generated by the Research Compliance Office. This is a multicenter treatment study classified as high risk per the NCI -approved DSM plan. Each high -risk study will be assigned a physician member of the DSMC as medical monitor, or in rare cases, an external medical monitor. The medical monitor will be notified of all serious adverse events (SAEs). Specific notifications will also be issued when a dose- limiting toxicity is encountered and when the MTD dose is defined. Approval of the medical monitor is required for all dose escalations. All serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring in patients treated at HCI or its affiliates will also be reviewed by the full DSMC monthly. The full committee will also review all toxicities for patients on treatment and within 30 days of their last treatment on a quarterly basis ."
35,page_35,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 36 of 52 Each high -risk study will also be assigned a dedicated research compliance officer who will monitor the trial. High -risk studies will be monitored by RCO personnel after the first patient is enrolled and every three months thereafter during active enrollment. The RCO monitor will review the study status and summarize enrollment, toxicities, SAEs, dose escalation, statistical endpoints (e.g., stopping rules), deviations, etc. for the full DSMC membership at the regularly scheduled meetings. Amendments which increase risk, change dosing, or impact study objectives will be reviewed by the DSMC and approved by the PRMC and IRB. High -risk trials will be formally reviewed by the DSMC after the first patient is enrolled and then quarterly thereafter. An initial audit of high -risk studies will be conducted by the RCO approximately one year after enrollment begins and annually thereafter. Audits of high -risk studies may be conducted more frequently as requested by the DSMC, IRB, PRMC, RCO management, or the PI. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events This study will utilize the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 5.0 for AE and SAE reporting. 16.2.1 Adverse Events (AEs) An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. For the purposes of this study, the terms toxicity and adverse event are used interchangeably. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they are considered clinically significant by the treating investigator , or require therapy to treat . Collection of adverse events will begin after the first dose of study drug and end at the Month 18 visit or 30 days after the last dose of study drug if the patient is removed for progression prior to this time point. The safety profile for the drugs involved in this study have been characterized extensively in previous clinical trials and standard clinical contexts. As such, safety data collection for this study will be limited to ≥ Grade 3 adverse events as defined by CTCAE v5.0. Information about adverse events, whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by inves tigator questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means , will be abstracted from standard investigator clinic notes and recorded in the patient’s study chart, at the interval noted in the study calendar . Adverse events meet ing the aforementioned recording criteria should be further evaluated , either through abstraction of standard investigator clinic notes or through direct correspondence with the treating investigator to determine: 1. The severity grade based on CTCAE v5.0 (grade 1-5) 2. Its relationship to the study drug s (definite, probable, possible, unlikely, not related) 3. Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)"
36,page_36,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 37 of 52 4. Action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication taken; non -drug therapy given; hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization) 5. Whether it constitutes an SAE All adverse events will be treated as medically appropriate. All CTCAE v5.0 Grade 3 and above adverse events should be followed until its resolution or the patient disc ontinues study , and assessment should be made at the interval noted in the study calendar (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, suspected relationship to the study intervention , interventions employed to treat it, and outcome. 16.2.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Information about all serious adverse events , as defined below, will be collected and recorded. A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which: • Is fatal or life- threatening • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above • Causes congenital anomaly or birth defect • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospi talization is for: o Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition (procedures such as central line placements, paracentesis, pain control) o Elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug o Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission o Social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s general condition Collection of se rious adverse events will begin at enrollment and end 30 after the last dose of study treatment or until a new cancer treatment is initiated, whichever happens the soonest. Any death from any cause while a patient is receiving treatment on this protocol or up to 30 days after the last dose of protocol treatment, or any death which occurs more than 30 days after protocol treatment has ended but which is felt to be treatment related, must be reported. Toxicities which fall within the definitions listed above must be reported as an SAE regardless if they are felt to be treatment related or not."
37,page_37,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 38 of 52 16.3 SAE Reporting Requirements A MedWatch 3500A form must be completed to document each observed SAE and submitted to compliance@hci.utah.edu as soon as possible, but no later than 1 working day of first knowledge or notification of event. The Research Compliance Office will appropriately report these SAEs to the DSMC and/or the IRB of record according to the requirements described below: DSMC Notifications: • Fatal or life- threatening events meeting the definition of an SAE will be reported within 7 calendar days after first knowledge of the event by the investigator. • All other events meet ing the SAE criteria above will be reported within 15 calendar days after first knowledge of the event by the inv estigator. • Events that meet expedited reporting (serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions) will be reported to the FDA and IRB, as applicable. IRB Notification: 1. Events will be submitted to the IRB of record per local guidelines. 16.4 Reporting of Pregnancy Although pregnancy is not considered an adverse event, it is the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report the pregnancy of a male subjects’ female partner as an unanticipated proble m involving risk as noted above. Pregnancies or lactation that occurs during the course of the trial or with in 30 days of completing the trial must be reported to the DSMC, IRB, and FDA as applicable. All female partners of subjects who become pregnant must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events. 16.5 Protocol Amen dments Any amendments or administrative changes to an IRB approved protocol will not be initiated without submission of an amendment for IRB review and approval. These requirements for approval will in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the investigator in the interests of preserving the safety of all subjects included in the trial. Any amendments to the protocol that significantly affect t he safety of subjects, scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study are required to submit the amendment for FDA review. 16.6 Protocol Deviations A protocol deviation (or violation) is any departure from the defined procedures and treatmen t plans as outlined in the protocol version submitted and previously approved by the IRB. Protocol deviations have the potential to place participants at risk and can also undermine the scientific integrity of the study thus jeopardizing the justification for the research. Protocol deviations are unplanned and unintentional events."
38,page_38,"Short Title: ACADEMIC: ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone Version Date: 13MAR2019 Page 39 of 52 Because some protocol deviations pose no conceivable threat to participant safety or scientific integrity, reporting is left to the discretion of the PI within the context of the guidelines below. The sponsor requires the prompt reporting to HCI RCO of protocol deviations which are: • Exceptions to eligibility criteria. • Intended to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant or • Harmful (caused harm to participants or others, or place them at increased risk of harm - including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm), or • Possible serious or continued noncompliance 16.7 FDA Annual Reporting This study is IND exempt therefore there are no annual reporting requirements to the FDA. 16.8 Clinical Trials Data Bank The study will be registered on http://clinicaltrials.gov and the NCI CTRP (Clinical Trials Reporting Program) by the Clinical Trials Office. 16.9 Record Keeping Per 21 CFR 312.57, the Investigator records shall be maintained for a period of 2 years following the date a marketing application is approved; or, if no application is filed or the application is not approved, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and the FDA is notified."
