Subsequent dosing will be performed once daily by the patient at approximately the same time each day. Patients will be instructed to take vericiguat with food. The titration will be based on systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurement prior to intake and safety considerations, at the discretion of the investigator as follows: Increase dose: if SBP ≥100 mmHg and ≤20 mmHg decreases from previous visit, and not yet on highest dose (sham titration will occur if dose increase is chosen from 10 mg in the 10 mg arm) Maintain dose: if SB P betw een ≥90 and <100 mmHg or SBP ≥100 mmH g and >20 mmHg decreases from previous visit, or if already on highest dose step (after 3 uptitrations) Decrease the dose: if SBP <90 mmHg without symptoms of hypotension if on vericiguat at a blinded dose step >2.5 mg, or temporarily interrupt if on 2.5 mg (starting dose or after down titration from a higher dose) Interrupt the dose: if SBP <9 0 mmHg with symptoms of hypotension . Down -titration is possible at any time during the study. In case of temporary discontinuation or dose reduction after the titration period, up -titration is also possible at scheduled visits. If the period betw een the sc heduled visit sis more than 17 and less than 11 days, the patient should attend an unscheduled visit. Type of control Placebo Data Monitoring Committee Yes Number of patients Approximately 735 patients are planned to be randomized, 245 patients per arm. Prim ary variable Change in KCCQ PLS from baseline to week 24 Time point/fram e of measurement for prim ary variableKCCQ PLS will be assessed at baseline, at weeks 2, 6, 12, and 24 Plan for statistical analysis The primary endpoint will be change from baseline to week 24 in physical limitations as measured by the KCCQ PLS. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using a repeated -measures mixedmodel (MMRM) , including all assessments post baseline, with baseline values, region, heart rhythm , treatment group, study visit, and the interaction betw een study visit and treatment group as covariates. The analysis will be performed in the Full Analysis Set. The study is powered at 80% for rejecting either of the primary hypotheses (vericiguat 15 mg arm vs. placebo arm and vericiguat 10 mg arm vs. placebo arm), with the assumption of a mean difference from placebo in KCCQ PLS of 5 points for both dose groups and a common SD of 21 points, und er two sided alpha level of 0.05. A planned futility analysis will be performed by data monitoring committee (DMC )when 50% of patients complete Visit 7 (week 12) and their KCCQ data become available. An observed treatment effect of 0 .6point will serve a s"

An observed difference <0.6in both comparisons would therefore signal to the DMC that the trial should be terminated early. At this futility boundary the trial has a joint probability of 9% to observe a >5 point improvement in either of the dose groups . In addition, a blinded anchor -based interim analysis will be conducted upon the completion of the 3 -month assessments by all trial participants. A non - parametric discriminant analysis will be used to determine the discrimination point betw een “no change” and “a little better” categories, which is considered to be Minimal clinically important difference ( MCID) . Based on the blin ded anchor -based interim analysis, the percentages of responders w ith MCID, moderate, and large differences at each visit will be summarized ,and nominal p -values will be also provided. The study uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz (2013) to prov ide strong multiplicity control across the primary KCCQ PLS hypotheses and the secondary 6 MWT hypotheses. The overall tw o sided alpha level will be controlled at 0.05. The tw o primary hypotheses will be tested using Bonferroni procedure, each at a splitte d alpha of 0.025. The tw o secondary hypotheses will be tested based on parallel gatekeeping principle. If both primary hypotheses can be rejected, the secondary family will be tested at a full alpha level 0.05 (tw o sided). If only one primary hypothesis has shown to be statistically significant, then only the secondary hypothesis based on the same dose group can be tested at an alpha level carried forward from the primary family testing, i.e., 0.025 (two sided). In this case, if the secondary hypothesis is rejected, the alpha spending associated w ith this dose group (0.025) w ill be re-utilized to test the other failed primary hypothesis again. Overall, the primary analysis will be claimed to have a positive outcome if the null hypothesis for at least one of the two primary hypotheses can be rejected."

Introduction 3.1 Background Heart failure is a leading cause of CV morbidit y and mortality, and constitutes a major public health problem worldwide. Patients suffering from HFpEF are a large and growing population; the relative proportion of HFpEF has increased to more than 50% of al l HF hospitalizations ( 1).Predisposing conditions for HFpEF are advanced age, female gender, diabetes, obesit y, arterial hypertension, and LV h ypertroph y. While mortality in outpatient cohorts appears to be lower for HFpEF than HFrEF, hospitalizations for HFpEF have increased over time. HFpEF patient s also have substantially reduced functional capacity and quality of life (2), and they need a therap y that addresses these limitations .However, no specific therap y has been approved to reduce cardiovascular risk or to improve functional status in patients with HFpEF, and recommendations have thus far been limited to symptomatic treatment of congestive s ymptoms by diuretics, and to treating causes a nd comorbidities including hy pertension, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation (3). US guidelines were recently updated with a new class IIb recommendati on stating that aldosterone receptor antagonists might be considered to decrease hospitalizations in appropriatel y selected patients with HFpEF (with EF ≥45%, elevated BNP levels or HF admission within 1 y ear, estimated glomerular filtration rate >30 mL/min, creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL, potassium <5.0 mEq/L ) (4). ESC guidelines on HF also provide no evidence level A recommendations for the treatment of patients with HFpEF and reiterate that no treatment has yet been shown, convincingl y, to reduce morbidity or mortalit y in patients with HFpEF (5). Trials that est ablished the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor an tagonists and ß- blockers bey ond their use in arterial hypertension, CAD or for rate control have all selected patients o n the basis of their reduced EF. S ubsequent trials in patients with HFpEF did not confirm equal effectiveness in this patient group (6). S ince patients with HFpEF are highl y symptomatic with a poor quality of life, it is important to find new therap ies that can alleviate s ymptoms and improve patient well -being ( 5). Therefore, there is need for new drug targets such as cGMP. The nitric oxide -soluble guany late cy clase -cGMP signaling pathway is a relevant mechanism in HF that remains unaffected by neurohumoral antagonists. cGMP deficiency causes two important pathophy siologies in HF: 1. Myocardial dy sfunction including impaired relaxation, diastolic stiffening and myocardial energy wastage. cGMP is a powerful antihy pertrophic mediator in the heart (7).Itis specifically reduced in m yocardial biopsies of patients with HFpEF, and bypassing the cGMP deficiency by in vitro protein kinase G administration corrects inappropriate lyhigh resting tension forces of human cardiomy ocytes(8). In a genetic sGC knockout model sGC α1-/-mice ( deficiency in the α 1 subunit results in decreased enz ymatic sGC activity , whereas the total sGC knockout is not viable) increased cardiac contractility ,arterial elastance andimpaired ventricular relaxation were observed ( 9). 2. Endothelial dy sfunction, i.e. disturbed endothelium -dependent vasotone regulation due to a reduced NO bioavailability , including the my ocardial microcirculation. Endothelial dy sfunction contributes to the pathophy siology of HFpEF (10). Previous attempts to increase cGMP remain limited. The long -term effects of nitrates and exogenous NO donors are limited by tolerance (11), and they also cause endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and release of endothelin-1 ( 12). The venoselectivity of these"
17,page_17,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 17of 81 drugs may restrict the irhemody namic tolerability (13), as the dependency of nitrates and exogenous NO donors on biotransformation to the active, NO -containing compound causes different regional responses in the venous vs. arterial system ( 14, 15 ).A novel class of sGC compounds directl y stimulate the NO receptor sGC with a dual mode of action ; they sensitize sGC to endogenous NO by stabilizing the NO- sGC binding ,and also directly stimulate sGC via a different binding site, indepen dentl y of NO. Their regional vasoactivity and potential direct my ocardial effects are independent of biotransformation and, therefore, might differ from nitrates. Due to this unique mode of action direct oral sGC stimulators could provide a novel , tolerable option to restore cGMP signaling in HFpEF (16). The sGC stimulator riociguat has previousl y been studied i n patients with HFpEF and secondary pulmonary hypertension. A lthough the study missed its primary endpoint of pulmonary artery pressure reduction, single doses of riociguat increased stroke volume and decreased SVR at the highest dose step of 2 mg without changing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, indicating that increases in stroke volume upon afterload redu ction could be achieved without increasing LV filling pressures (17). These results point at different hemody namic effects of the direct sGC stimulator riociguat compared to the PDE5 inhibitor inhibitor sildenafil .Patients with HFpEF in the REL AX-DHF study treated with sildenafil remained without an y effects on SVR at 6 months (17),and in another study 12 weeks of sildenafil treatment did not improve invasive haemody namic or clinical parameters in patients with HFpEF and PH (18).The hemod ynami c effects of single doses of riociguat in the DILATE-1 study in patients with PH and diastolic heart failure also differ edfrom sodium nitroprusside, which frequently decreased stroke volume upon acute administration in patients with HFpEF, potentially owing to excessive preload reduction in line with venodilation ( 19). In contrast, a decrease in heart rate upon treatment with the sGC stimulator vericiguat was associated with unchanged cardiac output in non- invasive echocardiographic hemody namic measurements in the 10 mg arm of the SOCRATES -PRESERVED study (Study 15829) at 12 weeks (20). The NEAT stud y showed that patients with HFpEF receiv ingisosorbide mononitrate were less active and did not show improvement in QoL or submaximal exercise capacit y (21). Based on these data , the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA guideline update stated that the routine use of nitrates or phosphodiesterase -5 inhibitors to increase activity or QoL in patients with HFpEF is ineffective (a class III, or “no benefit” recommendation). Limitations specific to the mode of action of NO substitution with nitrate s and tothe dependency on PDE5 overexpression for PDE5 inhibitor treatment are hypothesized to be the reason for failed clinical efficacy . These limitations may be overcome by the different mode of action of direct sGC stimulators , and exploratory clinical data s uggest potential benefit of oral sGC stimulator treatment in heart failure. Therefore, vericiguat , a novel oral sGC stimulator half-life long enough for once dail y dosing, is currently being developed for the treatment of heart failure. Further details can be found in the latest available version of the investigator's brochure, which contains comprehensive information on the study drug. 3.2 Previous experience in humans Vericiguat has been evaluated in approximately 65 preclinical studies and has be en administered to over 500 healthy patients in 19 completed Phase I studies with single -and multiple -dose administration, and in approximately 740 heart failure patients in two Phase IIb studies that studied vericiguat in worsening chronic heart failure patients with HFrEF and"
18,page_18,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 18of 81 with HFpEF. In the ongoing phase III event- driven outcome trial VICTORIA (NCT02861534) ,as of Dec 1 2017 , 2279 patients with HFrEF out of a planned total sample size of 4872 have been randomized to vericiguat 10 mg target dose or pl acebo with a median study drug treatment duration at that time of 5 months .The study treatment duration is planned to continue until 2020 for a median follow-up duration of 18 months. A detailed description of the properties of vericiguat and the results of the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology studies conducted so far are given in the IB. 3.2.1 Dose selection The starting dose ,as well as the dose range in this study ,are based on data from the Phase IIb study SOCRATES, as well as on the Phase I program in health y volunteers. In SOCRATES -PRESERVED 4 different dose regimens of vericiguat were studied in patients with chronic HFpEF enrolled within 1 month after a qualifying heart failure decompensation event ( 20). Data from SOCRATES -PRESERVED established 2.5 mg vericiguat as thesafe and well tolera tedstarting dose. Uptitration by two dose doublings with 14 day intervals each to a target dose of 10 mg was tolerated in patients with HFpEF without an increase in adverse events compared to placebo, with low discontinuation rates in all groups, and no changes in blood pressure at 10 mg compared to placebo .Although anal yses of the primary efficacy variables in SOCRATES -PRESERVED did not demonstrate changes in NT -proBNP and LAV at 12 weeks in the vericiguat dose groups compared to placebo, patients receiving vericiguat in the 10 mg target dose arm experienced a more pronounced improvement in health related QoL, phy sical limitations ,NYHA class , signs and s ymptoms of congestion and trends towards improved diastolic function at 12 weeks (20, 22) . These data generat ethe hypothesis that vericiguat improves phy sical functioning and clinically relevant patient - reported outcomes in patients with HFpEF . In the parallel SOCRATES -REDUCED study (Study 15371) vericiguat treatment of patients with HFrEF in the 10 mg target dose arm was safe and well tolerated ,and resulted in a large biological effect on the primary endpoint NT - proBNP when added to standard of care. Based on these data, the currently ongoing VICTORIA trial evaluates the efficacy of vericiguat in c omparison to placebo on a background of standard of care in increasing the time to first occurrence of the composite of CV death or HF hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Ad hoc application without prior titration of the 15 mg dose step as an oral polyethylene glycol solution was not well tolerated, and led to orthostatic reactions and sy ncope in the single dose escalation phase I study 15355 in 3 out of 4 healthy volunteers. Therefore 10 mg was chosen as the highest dose in SOCRATES -PRESERVED. In parallel with SOCRATES studies another phase I study, 15838, was conducted. In this study administration of single doses of 15 mg to 14healthy volunteers in fasted state as three 5 mg IR tablets in the formulation used for the clinical development program was generall y well tolerated even without prior uptitration. Therefore, since no dose limiting intolerabilities were observed within the dose range of up to 10 mg studied in SOCRATES- PRESERVED, in this study (19334) a higher dose arm with a third uptitrati on step to 15 mg will be studied in addition to the 10 mg arm. The o bjective of this additional dose arm is to test whether titration to the higher target dose of 15 mg is tolerable and safe over 24 weeks, and associated with an even greater improvement in physical functioning . As with uptitration to 10 mg, the titration will start from 2.5 mg ,not in a forced manner but adapted to individual tolerability as objectivel y defined b y lack of an ydecrease in blood pressure below limits established for titration in SOCRATES ,and in addition to the subjective well- being of patient s."
19,page_19,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 19of 81 There is limited ability to add blood pressure lowering doses of vericiguat to the guideline- recommended regimen for HFrEF patients, given the baseline blood pressures in these patients and the fact that these latter agents lower blood pressure (23). In contrast, the higher baseline blood pressure in HFpEF and the flexibility of adjusting concomitant risk factor controlling therap y that has not been established as life-saving,allow studying doses with potential blood pressure reducing potential in this study 19334. Based on the exploratory improvement of physical functioning measured by the KCCQ PLS at the 10 mg target dose in SOCRATES -PRESERVED , this dose regimen will als o be studied in a parallel arm next to the higher 15 mg target dose. This design will allow testingof the primary hypothesis that vericiguat will improve KCCQ PLS over the treatment duration of 24 weeks compared to placebo individually in the 10 mg and in the 15 mg dose titration arms and to establish the benefit/risk ratio of the 1 0 mg and of the 15 mg dose titration of vericiguat in separate arms. 3.3 Rationale of the study Vericiguat, a nsGC stimulator, was studied in a Phase IIb dose -finding study (SOCRAT ES- PRESERVED) in patient s with HFpEF. Even though a 10 mg dose of vericiguat over a 12 week treatment period did not change NT -proBNP or L AV as pre-specified primary endpoints in this trial ,exploratory post-hoc anal yses showed an improvement in the patient- relevant domains of KCCQ and related patient reported ( EQ-5D- 5L) and phy sician assessed (NYHA class , clinical congestions score ) endpoints ( 20, 22) in the highest target dose group. KCCQ is widely used in HF trials. In SOCRATES -PRESERVED, an improvement in the KCCQ OSS as well as the CSS was observed. Consistent changes in other domains of the KCC Q were also noted. However, the improvement appeared to be driven primarily b y improvements in the PL S. KCCQ PL S has previously been validated against the distance covered in a 6MWT , NYHA class , and ph ysical limitation domains within other QoL instruments including the 36- Item Short Form Survey in patients with HF(24).Improvements in phy sical functioning and reduction in sy mptom frequency are considered to be direct measures of treatment benefit in patients with HFpEF ( 2). This observation led to the hypothesis that vericiguat improves phy sical functioning in patients with HFpEF. Benefit -risk assessment Although in the phase IIbSOCRATES -PRESERVED study vericiguat did not reveal change s in the two primary efficacy variables ( NT-proBNP and L AV at 12 weeks ), the exploratory finding of clinically meaningful increases (i.e. improvements compared to placebo of equal to or larger than 5 points) in KCCQ PLS, CSSand OS Ssuggest thatvericiguat can improve physical limitations in patients with HFpEF. Daily activities of patients with HFpEF are limited due to common HF s ymptoms. Patients are especiall y affected b y breathlessness and fatigue, which have a major imp act on daily activities and are central to the patient experience ( 25). These, in turn, have an impact on wider concepts of patient health-related quality oflife which are not addressed due to a lack of approved medications for the treatment of HFpEF patients. T he changes in KCCQ PL S and consistent improvements in EQ -5D- 5Lobserved in SOCRATES -PRESERVED together with trends in NYHA class and phy sician -assessed congestion indicate vericiguat’s potential to improve functioning in patients with HFpEF."
20,page_20,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 20of 81 The main risk of vericiguat is hy potension. There was only a small increase in the rate of hypotension AEs at the starting dose of 2.5 mg (4.4% of patients in the first 2 weeks compared to 3.3% with placebo) in SOCRATES -REDUCED , and these occurred onl y transiently upon initiation of vericiguat treatment in the majority of cases (26).In SOCRATES -PRESERVED ,treatment -emergent hy potension adverse events were simi lar in all arms including placebo. Therefore ,byusing the titration rules from SOCRATES - PRESERVED , asafe uptitration to the target dose of 10 mg is expected in patients with HFpEF . In the absence of existing data with 15 mg vericiguat in patients with heart failure, the risks of hy potension and sy ncope with 15 mg vericiguat require further characterization. Based on previous experience from SOCRATES- PRESERVED with doses up to 10 mg vericiguat, the risk of h ypotension, sy ncope or any other intolerability is expected to be manageable and minimized through a non -forced titration also for the 15 mg dose. Given the absence of life-saving drugs and the particular relevance of ph ysical limitations in daily activities for patients with HFpEF, the potential for vericiguat to improve phy sical functioning based on exploratory data from SOCRATES -PRESERVED appears to outweigh the manageable risks of hy potension and s yncope observed with the 10 mg target dose. Therefore, before data for the 15 mg dose in patients with HFpEF will become available, there is equipoise with respect to the benefit- risk assessment for vericiguat 15 mg for the treatment of sy mptomatic HF in patients with chronic HFpEF , and we expect potential benefit in this indication . 4.

Study design Design overview This is a randomized parallel- group, placebo- controlled, double -blind, multi -center trial of vericiguat in patients with HFpEF to be conducted in conformance with GCP. Approximately 735 patients will be randomized as described in Figure 5–1 to evaluate the efficacy of vericiguat 10 mg and 15 mg in comparison to placebo on improving ph ysical functioning from baseline to week 24. To reduce heterogeneit y in the studied population patients y ounger than 45 y ears of age are not eligible. P atients are expected to be on a background treatment for co -morbidities likehyperte nsion (see Section 8.1), and diuretics in the presence of symptom s due to volume overload . Screening may be initiated any time after admission of a patient to the hospital for HF , before or after discharge, and up to 6 months after hospitalization for HF .Use of IV diuretic treatment for HF, even without hospitalization, is indicative of HF decompensation and accepted as a qualify ing HF event equivalent to hospitali zation . The most recent decompensation should be considered for qualify ing the patient for the study . In either scenario, HF must be the primary reason for hospitalization or I V diuretic treatment. Patients will be randomized within up to 4 weeks after thescreen ing visit (see Section 7.3) and within up to 6 months after the onset of the qualify ing event of hospitalization for HF or treatment with I V diuretic for HF (see Figure 5–1), and treated as given in S ections 7.1and 7.3. Primary endpoint assessment is at week 24. All patients will be followed u ntil study completion to assess for vital status and all study endpoints.

Justification of the designThe study is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy of the 10 mg and of the 15 mg dose regimens of vericiguat at 24 weeks in separate parallel arms. Placebo control is used in a parallel comparator arm to control for observer and patient bias, and randomization to control for assignment bias. Rationale of study endpoints To demonstrate durability of efficacy in improving ph ysical functioning and to study safety beyond the previousl y studied time period of 12 weeks in SOCRATES- PRESERVED, longer treatment duration of 24 weeks has been chosen for this study . This endpoint gives a valid and appropriate measure of the limitations in activities of daily living that are impacted b y HF symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue ,andrepresent the key burden of patients suffering from HFpEF. In SOCRATES -PRESERVED in the 10 mg arm a constant rise in KCCQ PL S that did not y et reach a maximu m by week 12 was observed. This was opposed to a smaller improvement in placebo that reached its peak at 8 weeks and subsequentl y decreased. Base d onthe exploratory finding of a clinicall y meaningful improvement in KCCQ PLS (i.e. an improvement compared to placebo larger than 5 points upon 12 weeks treatment with a 10 mg target dose regimen) consistent with parallel improvements in EQ -5D- 5L in SOCRATES - PRESERVED, the change in KCCQ PL S from baseline to week 24 is defined as the primary endpoint in the pres ent study . This endpoint will serve for confirmatory testing of the hypothesis that vericiguat improves KCCQ PL S compared to placebo on top of background standard of care in a durable manner upon 24 weeks of treatment. Notabl y, the parallel ongoing event -driven HFrEF outcome trial VICTORI A plans median treatment duration of 18 months to add long -term safet y and tolerability data of the 10 mg target dose in HFrEF. End of study The end of the stud y as a whole will be reached as soon as the last visit of the l ast patient has been reached in all centers in all participating countries (EU and non -EU).

The investigator should explore all possible options to reach a patient who fails to return to a visit or to respond to t he site contact attempts . The site must document all attempts to try to contact the patient in the medical records / source documents. In order to avoid loss -to-follow - up, the investigator should ask the patient at the study start for the contact details of a relative or friend who can be contacted in case the patient cannot be reached. Patients should not be withdrawn from follow -up unless the patient explicitly withdraws consent to be contacted. All efforts should therefore be made to discuss solutions wi th the patient that would enable the patient to continue with follow- up in order to minimize the number of patients who withdraw such consent. The vital status will be collected for all randomized patients who have not specificall y withdrawn consent for fu rther study follow -up by any method (telephone call, email etc .), irrespective of completion of study procedures. Withdrawal from study drug treatment Withdrawal from study drug treatment does not represent withdrawal from the study . As certain data on clinical events bey ond study treatment discontinuation may be important to the study , they must be collected through the participant’s last scheduled follow-up, even if the participant has discontinued study treatment. Therefore, all participants who discontinue study treatment prior to completion of the protocol -specified treatment period will still continue to participate in the stud y. Before permanentl y discontinuing study drug treatment (either initiated by the patient or the investigator) a temporary interruption should be considered. Patients who have temporarily discontinued from study drug treatment should resume in line with the temporary interruption rules as soon as medically justified in the opinion of the investigator (see Section 7.4). In addition, patients should not be discontinued from the study drug or withdrawn from the study solely for reaching a potential cardiovascular event. If per manent discontinuation of study drug treatment becomes necessary due to intolerance even at the lowest dose step or an y other reason, this does not mean that the patient has withdrawn from the study follow -up.Participants may be allowed to begin study treatment again if deemed medically appropriate, unless the participant’s treatment assignment has been unblinded by the investigator/delegate and/or non -study treating ph ysician. For participants who are discontinued from study treatment but continue to be m onitored in the study , all visits and procedures, as outlined in the schedule of assessments, should be completed. If the patient is unable to attend scheduled study visits, follow -up of clinical events specified as exploratory endpoints may continue by phone, unless the patient explicitly withdraws his/her consent to any type of follow -up."

Patients may be withdrawn from the study drug if any of the following occurs: If a significant violation of the protocol occurs, as defined b y the sponsor and the coordinating investigator. If the randomization code is broken via IxRS. Patients must be withdra wn from the study if any of the following occurs: At their own request; at any time during the study and without giving reasons, a patient may decline to participate further. The patient will not suffer an y disadvantage as a result . Patients may be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occurs: If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation of the study would be harmful to the patient’s well -being. At the specific request of the sponsor and in liaison with the investigator ( e.g., obvious non-compliance, safet y concerns). Depending on the time point of withdrawal, a withdrawn patient is referred to as either “screening failure” or “dropout” as specified below: Screening failure A patient who, for any reason (e.g. failure to satisfy the selection criteria), terminates the study before the time point used for the definition of “dropout” (see below) is regarded a “screening failure”. Re-starting the defined set of screening procedures to ena ble the “screening failure” patient’s participation at a later time point is not allowed – with the following exceptions: The patient had successfully passed the screening procedures, but could not be randomized to start subsequent treatment on schedule. Initial screening occurred too earl y to complete the required washout period after prior therap y. The in- / exclusion criteria preventing the patient’s initial attempt to participate have been changed (via protocol amendment). In an y case, the investigator has to ensure that the repeated screening procedures do not expose the patient to an unjustifiable health risk. Also, for re- screening, the patient has to re - sign the informed consent form, even if it was not changed after the patient ’s previous screening."

General proceduresIn all cases, the reason for discontinuation from the study drug and / or withdrawal from the study must be recorded in the CRF and in the patient's medical records. The patient may object to the generation and processing of post- withdrawal data as specified in Section 13.4. Any patient removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or transfer is medically acceptable . Details for the premature termination of the study as a whole (o r components thereof) are provided in Section 12.

29,page_29,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 29of 81 Dose modification will depend on mean sitting SBP and the absence of s ymptoms indicative of hy potension before intake of the dose as described in Section 7.4. The intention of the protocol is to reach and maintain the target study drug dose upon uptitration. If the patient does not reach the 15 mg dose step by the time of the week 6 visit (42±3 da ys after randomization), or the dose is temporaril y interrupted and when the investigator feels it is medically appropriate to resume it afterwards, uptitration should be considered at any subsequent visit at the discretion of the investigator according to the SBP criteria in Section 7.4. If in the opinion of the investigator the patient does not tolerate the target dose of the study drug and presents symptoms of orthostatic hy potension ,in addition to considering the reduction of the stud y drug the investigator should also consider the volume status ,and whether there is a necessity to change the dose of diuretics. If such adjustment or discontinuation of concomitant diuretic or other medications (such as anti- hypertensive therap y, in the case of excessive blood pressure lowering) is not possible or does not resolve signs and s ymptoms of intolerability, the investigator may at any time during the cours e of the trial reduce the dose or interrupt study treatment in patients who no longer tolerate the current study drug dose. Dow n-titration is possible at any time during the study if the investigator feels this is justified for safety reasons. Reasons for dose modifications (maintenance, increase, decrease, or interruption) will be collected at all planned or unscheduled visits . In case of temporary discontinuation or dose reduction after the titration period, up -titration is also possible at scheduled visi ts. 7.2 Identity of study treatment Table 7–1: Identity of test drug INN vericiguat Substance code number BAY 1021189 Formulation IRtablets Strength 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg BAY 1021189 Table 7–2: Identity of matching placebos INN N/A Substance code number N/A Formulation Tablets Strength N/A All study drugs will be labeled according to the requirements of local law and legislation.

Lists linking all numbering levels will be maintained by the sponsor’s clinical supplies quality assurance group. Acomplete record of batch numbers and expiry dates of all study treatment as well as the labels will be maintained in the sponsor’s study file. 7.3 Treatment assignment Following a screening visit, eligible patient s stabilized after a HF decompensation will be randomly allocated 1:1:1 via block ra ndomization to one of the 3 equall y sized groups (2 vericiguat groups, 1 placebo group) using I xRS and will receive treatment with study drug or placebo for 24 weeks.

The first dose of trial treatment will be administered at the trial si te at the randomization visit. Subsequent dosing will be performed once dail y preferabl y in the morning by the patient at approximately the same time each day . Patients will be instructed to take vericiguat with food. Resumption of study drug after temporary interruption Upon temporary interruption of the study drug due to intolerability ,intake should be resumed as soon as medicall y justified at the discretion of the investigator. There is no defined maximum time limit for temporary treatment interruption. I n all cases, the reason for study drug interruption or permanent study drug discontinuation must be recorded in the eCRF and in the patient's medical records. Titration rules following restart of study drug afte r temporary interruption of study drug are as follows: If restart before visit 5 (week 6): Restart at a scheduled visit and titrate according to the intervals in Table 7–4 . If restart after visit 5 (week 6) restart as soon as possible (with an unscheduled visit if required) and up-titrate according to Table 7–4. Patient will then resume the planned visit schedule . Unscheduled clinic and/or phone contacts can be conducted at the discretion of the investigator . The titration steps must be at least 11 days apart, and if the period between resumption and the next scheduled visit is more than 17 (14+3) days, the patient can attend an unscheduled visit."

The packaging and labeling are designed to maintain the blinding of the investigator’s team and to the patient s. The study data will remain blinded for each treatment group, until database lock and authorization of data release. Unblinding In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a SUSAR (see Section 9.6.1.5) related to the b linded treatment, the patient’s treatment code will usually be unblinded before reporting to the health authorities. Notifications of ethic committees and investigators will be done according to all applicable regulations (see Section 9.6.1.4). In this stud y, the following events are outcome events and will be considered as disease related in the defined study population. For the purposes of this trial, these events will not be subject to sy stematic unblinding and expedited reporting process, if reported as serious adverse drug reactions. Acute heart failure Chronic heart failure Worsening chronic heart failure Cardiac arrest Myocardial Infarction Stroke CV death"
33,page_33,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 33of 81 These events will be captured in the eCRF, and will undergo regular central adjudication by central CEC, and unblinded DMC review. If an event submitted for adjudication is determined b y the CEC not to meet the endpoint criteria in the CE C charter and meets seriousness criteria, it will then be subject to expedited reporting (as appropriate, based upon both investigator and Bayer compan y causalit y assessment of drug relationship, as required by local legislation). Emergency unblinding by t he investigator In case of emergency or any finding that requires unblinding, the investigator will be able to break the blind for an individual patient via IxRS according to the unblinding procedure implemented. This will allow breaking the blind for an i ndividual patient without impairing the study as a whole unless safet y findings required unblinding. The code can be broken by the investigator, or other responsible person, when knowledge of the patient 's treatment is required for the clini cal management of the patient . Whenever possible, the sponsor is to be contacted to discuss the case before the code is broken. If it becomes necessary to know the individual treatment during the stud y and thus to break the code for that patient , the date, time, and reason are to be recorded in the patient’s medical notes and relevant eCRF page. The investigator is required to promptl y document and explain to the sponsor an y premature unblinding (e.g. unblinding due to a serious adverse event) of the study treatment. Unblinding for ongoing safety monitoring To allow ongoing safet y monitoring during the conduct of the study by an external DMC, members of the Committee will receive unblinded safet y data. The involvement of an external Statistical Analy sis Center in this process will ensure that unblinded information is no t available for third parties. Details of the process are described in the DMC charter. 7.6 Drug logistics and accountability All study drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with GCP and GMP requirements and the instructions given b y the clinical supplies department of the sponsor (or its affiliate/contract research organization ), and will be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel. Special storage conditions and a complete record of ba tch numbers and expiry dates can be found in the sponsor’s study file; the site -relevant elements of this information will be available in the investigator site file. On the day of receipt, the responsible site personnel will confirm receipt of study drug via IxRS. The personnel will use the study drug only within the framework of this clinical study and in accordance with this protocol. Receipt, distribution, return and destruction (if an y) of the study drug must be properly documented according to the sponsor’s agreed and specified procedures. Written instructions on medication destruction will be made available to affected parties as applicable. If performing drug accountability implies a potential risk of contamination, a safet y process/ guidance for han dling returned study drug will be provided."

Overall compliance with study drug intake should be between 80% and 120% of the scheduled study drug intake at the end of study drug treatment. The date of dispensing the study drug to the patient will be documented. Study drug will be dispensed at Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7 and Visit 8. Patient s should return all remaining unus ed study drug at each visit. Accountability willbe determined by tablet count at each visit. To facilitate this, patient s must be instructed to return all of the study drug packaging including unused study drug and empt y packaging. Any discrepancies betwe en actual and expected amount of returned stud y medication must be discussed with the patient at the time of the visit, and any explanation must be documented in the source records as well as in the eCRF . 8. Non-study therapy 8.1 Prior and concomitant therapy Permitted background treatment Diuretic s are recommended in congest edpatients in order to alleviate symptoms and signs (5). Treatment of comorbidities like hy pertension, coronary and vascular dise ases, hyperlipid emia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation and other arrh ythmias should follow the local/regional Guidelines. Any dose adaptations, addition, changed or added route of administration, omission or cessation of concomitant therap y including diuretics, anti - hypertensives such as ACE inhibitors, ARB, or rate control such as ß blockers and digoxin are possible whenever deemed necessary by the investigator irrespective of blinded titration of the study drug. Prohibited prior and concomitant medications: Nitrates or NO donors including isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide 5- mononitrate, pentaery thritol tetranitrate, nicorandil, NTG and molsidomine : all routes a re not allowed during study drug treatment; IV therapy with nitrates or NO donors is only allowed until 24 h prior to randomization. It is recommended that nitrates should not be administered to an y patient previously on study drug earlier than 3 day s after the last dose of study drug. Should there be an urgent need for nitrate administration, they should be administered in a monitored inpatient setting. PDE5 inhibitors: Sildenafi land Vardenafil are allowe d only until 24 h prior to randomization, Tadalafil until 48 h prior to randomization. sGC stimulators other than the study drug are not allowed during study drug treatment"

It is a self -administered PRO instrument and requires, on average, 4 –6 minutes to complete. Patients are asked to recall how their heart failure impacted their life over a 2-week recall period. Response options are on a 5 -to 7-point L ikert- type scale with vary ing response options depending on the question . The KCCQ measures the impact of patient s’ heart failure, or its treatment, on 6domains; Physical Limitation, Sy mptom (with subscores for f requency and burden ), Quality of Life, Social Limitations, Symptom Stability and Self -Efficacy . Scores are calculated by summing domain responses and then t ransforming scores to a 0-100 unit scale with higher scores indicating better health status. In addition, the KCCQ includes 2 summary scores, CSS an equally weighted composite of Physical limitation and Total Symptom domain scores, and OSS which additional ly combines the social limitation and quality of life domain scores to the CSS (Table 9–2)."

Activities are common, gender -neutral, and generalizable across cultures, while also capturing a range of exertional requirements. SymptomcThe frequency and burden of clinical sy mptoms in heart failure, including fatigue, shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and patients’ edema/swell ing. An overall sy mptom score is generally used in analyses; subscale scores for both frequency and severity are also available. Quality of LifeDesigned to reflect patients’ assessment of their quality of life, given the current status of their heart fai lure. Social LimitationThe extent to which heart failure sy mptoms i mpair patients’ ability to interact in a number of gender- neutral social activities. Non-Efficacy Domains Symptom StabilityMeasures recent changes in patients’ sy mptoms; their shortness of breath, fatigue or swelling. It is compares patients frequency of heart failure sy mptoms at the time of completing the KCCQ with their frequency 2 weeks ago. This domain is not included in the summary scores. Self-efficacy Patient perceptions of how to prevent heart failure exacerbations and manage complications when they arise. This scale is not included in the summary scores. Summary Scores Clinical SummaryIncludes total s ymptom and phy sical function scores to corresp ond with NYHA Classification. Overall SummaryIncludes the total s ymptom, phy sical function, social limitations and quality of life scores aDescriptions of KCCQ Domain and summary scores are taken from the FDA document Medical Device Development Tool (MDDT) Qualification Decision Summary for Kansas City Cardiom yopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) (27)with minor editing for brevity. b‘Physical Function’ also used as domain name. cOften reported as ‘Total Symptom Score’. KCCQ Phy sical Limitation Score ( PLS)has been selected as the primary endpoint in the trial as it is a direct measure of the hy pothesized treatment effect; improvement in functional capacity in activities of daily life limited by the s ymptoms of heart failure. PLS measures the limitations pa tients’ experience, due to their heart failure s ymptoms (shortness of breath or fatigue), in performing routine activities of daily life(Table 9–3). T he PLS is calculated through an algorithm applying equal weighting to each of the items and a transformation to a 0 - 100 scale. Other KCCQ domains including Symptom (frequency , burden and overall), Quality of life and Social limitation together with the Clinical and Overall summary scores will be reported as exploratory endpoints. The KCCQ domains of Sy mptom Stability and Self - efficacy will be reported but will not be considered measures of treatment efficacy ."

Patients provide a rating for each question on a five -level L ikert scale: having no problems, having slight problems, having moderate problems, having severe problems and being unable to do/having extreme problems. In addition, patients are asked to self-rate their own health today on a vertical 0 -100 unit visual analogue scale (V AS), with 0 corresponding to ""the worst health y ou can imagine"", and 100 corresponding to ""the best health y ou can imagine"". 9.4.3 Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and Severity (PGIS) PGIC contains one question (1a) asking the patient to assess the degree of change in phy sical limitation due to heart failure compared to the start of the treatment using the following response options: “much better”, “better”, “a little better”, “the same”, “a little worse”, “worse”, or “much worse”. A subsequent quest ion (1b) then asks the patient to indicate whether he/she feels the degree of change reported is important or not (y es/no). PGIS contains one question asking the patient to assess the current severit y of their ph ysical limitations due to heart failure using the following response options: “No limitations”, “Mild”, “Moderate”, “Severe”, or “Very severe” It is anticipated to take approximately 2-3minutes to complete both the PG IC and PGI S questions. Data from these questions will be used to provide anchors for estimating minimally important differences in phy sical limitations in heart failure. 9.4.4 Fried frailty score The Fried frailty phenot ype defines 5 key domains for frailty (28)weakness, low energy , slowed walking speed, decreased ph ysical activity , and weight loss. I t quickly garnered attention in the CV community (29). Fried’s frailty score is on the basis of an integrated biological perspective, without focus on a single aspect of decline but the overall context of homeostasis. The Fried score differentiates frailty from multimorbidity and disability ,"

The questions patterned from the Fried Frailty score domains are assessed at baseline and at 24 weeks ( 31). The questions address five domains of the frailty phenotype: (a) shrinking (weight loss of ⩾10 pounds in the prior year); (b) weakness (decreased or weakened grip strength); (c) exhaustion (fatigue or declining endurance); (d) slowness (slower walking pace); and (e) low activity (decline in physical activity). The5questions are as follows: Questions at baseline: Within the last 12 months has the patient experienced any of the following? ∀Unintentional weight loss ( 5 kg/10 lbs). ∀Developed decreased grip strength. ∀Developed increasing fatigue/lethargy or declining endurance. ∀Walks a distance of 5 m/15 feet at a slower pace. ∀Decline in typical activity level. Questions at 24 weeks: Within the last 6 months has the patient experienced any of the following? ∀Unintentional weight loss ( 5 kg/10 lbs). ∀Developed decreased grip strength. ∀Developed increasing fatigue/lethargy or declining endurance. ∀Walks a distance of 5 m/15 feet at a slower pace. ∀Decline in typical activity level. 9.4.5 Assessment of NYHA class NYHA classwill be assessedaccording to the classification below: ∀ClassI: No limitation of physical activity ∀ClassII: Slight limitation of physical activity in which ordinary physical activity leads to fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain; theperson is comfortable at rest ∀ClassIII: Marked limitation of physical activity in which less-than-ordinary activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain; theperson is comfortable at rest ∀ClassIV: Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort but also symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome even at rest, with increased discomfort if any physical activity is undertaken 9.4.6 NT-proBNP NT-proBNP measurements will be assessed by the central lab.NT-proBNP or BNP measurements for screening will be assessed locally."

During this study , a 6MW Tincluding Borg CR 10 Scale will be conducted at differ ent time points as specified in Section 9.2, for further details on assessment refer to Section 16.1. A familiarization 6MW T will be performed during the run -in phase. To avoid an y interactions, it is not permitted to perform the familiarization test on the same day as the baseline 6MW T. 9.5 Pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics For the investigation of systemic exposure to vericiguat and its relationship with efficacy , the plasma concentrations of vericiguat will be determined at different time points using a sparse sampling approach mainly in patient s eligible for PK/QTassessme nt.EoT PK predose sample should be collected for all patients. Blood samples will be collected at the time points indicated in Study Flow Chart in Section 9.1and described in the visit description in Section 9.2. PK samples obtained at additional time points based on the investigator’s discretion and/or from patients not eligible for PK/QT assessment will not qualify as a protocol deviation and will be anal yzed. Deviations from the specified time points will be documented and taken into accou nt. Date and time of the PK sample collection and date and time of last study drug intake (either at home on the day before the sample or at site) must be documented. Details about the collection, processing, storage and shipment of samples will be provid ed separately (e.g. sample handling sheets or lab manual ). Plasma concentrations of vericiguat will be measured using validated methods. QC and calibration samples will be anal yzed concurrently with study samples. Concentrations are calculated from the chr omatographic raw data in accordance with current Bay er guidelines. The results of calibration samples and QC samples will be reported in the Bioanal ytical"

The bioanal yst will be unblinded for anal ysis of study samples. The PK calculations will be based on the actual sampling and dosing times. Therefore, it is of importance to have this data thoroughly documented in the eCRF. Deviations from the specified time points will be documented and taken into account when calculating the PK parameters. Those deviations do not qualify as protocol violations. Pharmacokinetics and, if applicable, pharmacokinetics/pharmacod ynamics (PK/PD) modeling using population approaches to describe vericiguat PK including potential influence of relevant patient co-variables (e.g., age, gender, body weight, etc.) or potentially to relate parameters of clinical safety and efficacy response (e.g. primary, secondary and/or exploratory variables) with vericiguat plasma concentrations will be investigated under a separate detailed PK/PD evaluation and anal ysis plan. 9.6 Safety Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including : Primary safet y variable: The incidence of tre atment- emergent AEs Exploratory safety variable s: Vital signs Laboratory data 12-lead ECG data 9.6.1 Adverse events 9.6.1.1 Definitions Definition of adverse event (AE) In a clinical stud y, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e. any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], sy mptom or disease) in a patient or clinical investigation patient after providing written informed consent f or participation in the study . Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by any physician treating the patient should not be recorded as an AE (however, the condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE). In the following differentiation between medical history and AEs, the term “condition” may include abnormal e.g. physical examination findings, s ymptoms, diseases, laboratory , ECG."
54,page_54,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 54of 81 Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no sy mptoms or treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical history (e.g. seasonal allergy without acute complaints). Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are recorded as medical history (e.g. allergic pollinosis) . Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be documented as adverse events. This includes intercurrent illnesses. Definition of serious adverse event (SAE) An SAE is class ified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at an y dose, meets an y of the following cr iteria (a –f): a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will not be regarded as an SAE if at least one of the following exceptions is met: -The admissi on results in a hospital stay of less than 12 hours - The admission is pre- planned (e.g. elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study ; admission is part of the study procedures as described in Section 9.2) -The admission is not associated with an AE (e.g. social hospitalization for purposes of respite care). However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during an y hospita lization may fulfill the criterion of ‘medicall y important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment . In addition, where local regulatory authorities specificall y require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence. d.Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s functions. e.Is a congenital anomal y / birth defect f.Is another serious or important medical event as judged by the investigator 9.6.1.2 Classifications for adverse event assessment All AEs will be assessed and documented b y the investigator according to the categories detailed below. 9.6.1.2.1 Seriousness For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in Section 9.6.1.1."
55,page_55,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 55of 81 9.6.1.2.2 Intensity The intensity of an AE is class ified according to the following categories: -Mild -Moderate -Severe 9.6.1.2.3 Causal relationship The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment is a decision to be made by the investigator, who is a qualified phy sician, based on all information available at the time of the completion o f the eCRF. Causality should be assessed separatel y for each study treatment as detailed in the eCRF. If the investigator feels that the event cannot be firmly attributed to one of the study treatments (e.g. owing to a suspected underly ing interaction), the same assessment will be documented for each study treatment. The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to the study treatment in question. Possible answers are “y es” or “no” An assessment of “no” would include: 1.The existence of a highl y likely alternative explanation, e.g. mechanical bleeding at surgical site. or 2.Non-plausibility , e.g. the patient is struck by an automobile when there is no indication that the drug caused disorientation that may have caused the event; cancer developing a few day s after the first drug administration. An assessment of “y es” indicates that that the AE is reasonabl y associated with the use of the study treatment. Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment include: -The temporal sequ ence from drug administration: The event should occur after the drug is given. The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event. -Recovery on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug r e-introduction (re-challenge): Patient ’s response after de -challenge or re -challenge should b e considered in view of the usual clinical course of the event in question. -Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the patient may have. -Concomitant medication or treatment: The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be examined to determine whether any of them might have caused the event in question. -Known response pattern for this class of drug: Clinical/preclinical"

Possible answers are “y es” or “no” 9.6.1.2.4 Action taken with study treatment Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories listed below. -Drug withdrawn -Drug interrupted -Dose reduced -Dose not changed -Dose increased -Not applicable -Unknown 9.6.1.2.5 Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events -None 9.6.1.2.6 Outcome The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows: -Recovered/resolved - Recovering/resolving -Recovered/resolved with sequelae -Not recovered/not resolved -Fatal -Unknown 9.6.1.3 Assessments and docu mentation of adverse events The investigator has to record on the respective eCRF pages all adverse events occurring in the period between the signing of the informed consent and the end of the follow -up phase; after the end of the follow- up phase there is no requirement to activel ycollect AEs including deaths. The t ype of information that should be assessed and recorded b y the investigator for each AE is listed in Section 9.6.1.2."

Instead, “death” is the outcome of underly ing AE(s). For all serious adverse events (SAEs) the sponsor has to carry out a separate assessment for expectedness, seriousness and causal relationship to study drug. 9.6.1.4 Reporting of serious adverse events The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in Section 9.6.1.1. Each SAE must be followed up until resolution or stabilization by submission of updated reports to the designated recipient. Investigator’s notification of the sponsor All investigators will be thoroughl y instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the investigator’s r eporting obligations for SAEs. This information, including all relevant contact details, is summarized in the investigator site file. This information will be updated as needed. The investigator must report immediate ly (within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness) all SAEs occurring during the observation period defined in Section 9.6.1.3 to the recipient detailed in the instructions for SAE reporting included in the Investigator File. For this, an AE page in the CRF as well as the complementary SAE pages provided in the CRF m ust be completed for each SAE. SAEs occurring after the protocol- defined observatio n period will be processed by the sponsor according to all applicable regulations. Notification of the IECs / IRBs Notification of the IECs / I RBs about all relevant events (e.g. SAEs, suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions [SUSARs]) will be perf ormed by the sponsor and/or by the investigator according to all applicable regulations. In addition, adverse events related to study endpoints or underlined diseases may not be considered as SUSAR in this study (see S ection 7.5). Notification of the authorities The processing and reporting of all relevant events (e.g. SAEs, SUSARs) to the authorities will be done by the sponsor according to all appli cable regulations. Sponsor’s notification of the investigational site The sponsor will inform all investigational sites about reported relevant events (e.g. SUSARs) according to all applicable regulations. 9.6.1.5 Expected adverse events For this study, the applic able reference document is the most current version of the IB. Overview listings of frequent events that have occurred so far in the clinical developmen t are shown in the current IB.

Any of these events have to be reported as an “important medial event” (see Section 9.6.1.6) and therefore as a SAE to the sponsor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the events. In an y case, adverse events of special interest fulfilling any seriousness criterion should be reported as SAE (see also Section 9.6.1.1). 9.6.2 Pregnancies The investigator must report to the sponsor an y pregnancy occurring in a female study patient during he r participation in this study . The outcome of the pregnancy shoul d be followed up carefully , and any outcome of the mother and the child at delivery should be reported. The child’s health should be followed up until up to 4 weeks after discharge . For a pregnancy in the partner of a male study patient, all efforts will b e made to obtain similar information on course and outcome, patient to the partner’s consent. For all reports, the forms provided are to be used. The investigator should submit them within the same timelines as an SAE. 9.6.3 Further safety Safety assessments wi ll include adverse events (AEs), phy sical examination findings, and vital signs including pulse rate and blood pressure assessment. Laboratory safet y studies will include blood chemistry , hematology , and urine pregnancy testing (performed in women of child bearing potential) (see Section 9.7). Adverse events may occur during clinical trials from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal. In this trial, any dose higher than the maximal target dose prescribed in the study protocol will be considered an overdose. If an adverse event(s) is resulted from the overdose, the adverse event(s) is reported as a non- serious adverse event, unless other serious criteria are met.In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating ph ysician should c ontact the Medical Monitor immediately and c losely monitor the participant for an y AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities for at least 4days.Spon sor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. Medical devices: The following is Japan specific guidance for reporting medical device failures:"
59,page_59,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 59of 81 The investigator must report immediately all non- approved medical device failures which could cause health damage, as well as any health damage that may be causally associated with a non-approved medical device failure. For this reporting, the forms provided are to be used and sent to the designated recipient. 9.7 Other procedures and variables 9.7.1 Laboratory a ssessments 9.7.1.1 Local laboratory At the screening visit, local laboratory results from routine clinical examinations will be assessed to check the eligibility of the patient. At least the following parameters must be measured at the screening visit and entered in the eCRF to check the patient’s eligibility for the study : NT-proBNP or BNP for screening (see Section 9.7.7 for further details) Serum creatinine for screening (eGFR will be calculated automaticall y in the eCRF using the MDRD formula) urine pregnancy test, and Serum β -human chorionic gonadotropin ( unless requested b y local authorities, serum β -human chorionic gonadotropin will only be conducted if urine pregnancy test is positive) Urine or serum pregnancy test will also be conducted on visits 2 and 7 for women of childbearing potential, according to the local regulations. If required b y national / institutional regulations, a serum or urine pregnancy test in patients of childbearing potential should be performed more often (e.g. at every visit). 9.7.1.2 Central Laboratory Only centrall y analyzed blood samples will be considered for anal ysis. The name and address for the central lab service provider can be found in the documentation supplied by the vendor. The following laboratory tests will be performed centrally : Hematology: Hct, Hb, MCV, MCH, MCHC, Platele t count, RBC, RDW, Reticulocy tes, and WBC. Chemistry: ALT, AST, LDH, Bilirubin (Total), Blood glucose, cholesterol (HDL, LDL, total), trigl ycerides, BUN, creatinine , GGT, K, Na, and Uric acid , high -sensitivity troponin t, HbA1c . Biomarker :NT-proBNP . Coagu lation: aPTT, I NR In the event of implausible results, the laboratory may measure additional parameters to assess the quality of the sample (e.g. clotted or hemoly zed) and to verify the results. The results from such additional anal yses may neither be included in the clinical database of this study nor evaluated further. If the results are relevant, the investigator will be informed to determine follow -up activities outside of this protocol."

Phy sical exams focused on CV assessment will be performed at the other visits. Abnormal phy sical examination findings are recorded either as medical history or as adverse events (see Section 9.6.1.1). 9.7.3 Echocardiography parameters Echocardiograph y data from routine clinical exam will be assessed at screening to determine eligibility , according to the following criteria: LVEF ≥45% and Structural changes indicated by at least one of the following parameters: oLV h ypertroph y (an y of the following: intraventricular septal or posterior wall thickness ≥1.1 cm) and/or LV mass index ≥115 g/m2in male and ≥95 g/m2in female ) oLA enlargement (an y of the following: LAV index ≥29 ml/m2, or L AV >58mL in male and >52 mL in female patients, or L A area >20 cm2, or L A diameter >40 mm in male and >38 mm in female patients) 9.7.4 12-lead ECG ECGs will be transferred and anal yzed centrally. The reading will be done in a standard way. Standard e lectrocardiogram (12- lead ECG) in supine position will be recorded after resting for at least 10 min as follow s: 1. ECG at baseline in all patients to evalu ate the eligibility of the patient for PK/QT assessment. The eligibility for PK/QT will be defined by the investigator in the baseline ECG. The ECG is invalid for QT assessment if at least one of the following is fulfilled: QRS -Prolongation >120 ms, e.g. i n the presence of complete bundle branch block Pacemaker stimulation Arrh ythmia and conduction abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, 2nd- 3rddegree AV block with ventricular escape rhy thm etc. Marked sinus arrh ythmia 2. ECG matched with PK The ECG will only be performed for patients who are eligible for PK/QT assessment. It will be recorded at visits 2,5 and 9 just before collection of the blood sample for PK analysis. Non -concordance with subsequent assignment as evaluable or non -evaluabl e upon central processing by the ECG core lab using different methods for QT assessment will be descriptively summarized and not be considered as deviation. 3.ECG at the end of treatment and in case of premature discontinuation as a safet y measure in all pat ients (for patients who are eligible for PK/QT ,assessment as part of PK/QT collection)."

The following ECG parameters will be anal yzed: HR, PR, QRS duration (QRSD), QT , and QTc (QTcB and QTcF). The ECGs must be recorded with a paper velocit y of 25 mm per second. The ECG print -outs will be identified with the PID as well as date and time of recording and will be attached to the patient’s file. All ECG swill be examined by the investigator , and a ny new clinically relevant abnormality will be documented as an AE. 9.7.5 Vital signs BP and pulse rate measurements will be performed at specific visits. For details see S ection 9.2. Accurate measurement of blood pressure is essential to guide dose titration management and to detect potential safet y signals during the trial. A number of factors related to the patient can cause significant deviations in measured blood pressure. These include room temperature, exercise, alcohol or nicotine consumption, positioning of the arm, muscle tension, bladder distension, talking, and background noise. Blood pressure and pulse rate sho uld be measured under the following conditions: Measurement of pulse rate and blood pressure must be conducted after 10 minute resting period with patient comfortabl y seated in a chair with the legs uncrossed and the back and arm supported. Measurements should not be made while the patient is on an examining table. The patient should be instructed to relax as much as possible and to not talk during the measu rement procedure The examiner should ensure that the middle of the cuff on the upper arm is at the level of the right atrium (the mid -point of the sternum). The patient should be asked to remove all clothing that covers the location of cuff placement. The same examiner should assess the patient at all subsequent visits and use the same device under same external conditions. The protocol requires 3 measurements –approximately 2 min apart (means will be calculated in the eCRF). Please record the time, positi oning and arm used for each measurement 9.7.6 Biomarkers NT-proBNP will be determined at the time points indicated in Section 9.1. Details on the collect ion, processing, storage and shipment of biomarker samples will be provided in separate documents (e.g. sample handling sheets or lab manual) Other biomarkers deemed relevant to gain further knowledge about the mecha nism sof the disease or about the drug ( i.e. mode of action related effect or safet y of the drug) may be measured, based on newly emerging data from other ongoing studies and / or literature data but only in countries where it is not excluded by local guidelines."

This research will evaluate whether genetic variation within the studied clinical trial population correlates with baseline clinical characteristics and the course of disease for the studied outcomes and/or ii) response to the study drug treatment. If genetic variation is found to correlate with clinical characteristics and out comes, the data might point to novel pathway s involved in the disease and thereb y inform development of novel medicines. If genetic variation is found to predict efficacy or adverse events, the data might inform optimal use of therapies in the patient population. This research contributes to understanding genetic determinants of the disease in general, as well as efficacy and safet y associated with the treatments in this study . A whole blood sample will be obtained from those patients, who have signed a separate informed consent form for pharmacogenetic research , but only in countries where it is not excluded by local guidelines. The participation in this part of the study is voluntary and has no influence on the participation in this study . Results will be reported under separate cover, if the evaluations are performed. 9.7.8 Accelerometry At sites participating in the accelerometry substudy , it is planned that up to approximately 150 patients may consent to undergo activit y tracking before randomization , before visit 7, and before visit 9 (end of treatment at 24 weeks). Subjects are not required to participate in the accelerometry substudy in order to participate in the main trial. In addition, subjects must provide separate informed consent in order to participa te in this substudy . Additional details will be specified in separate site accelerometry procedure manuals and accelerometry substudy analy sis plans. 9.8 Appropriateness of procedures / measurements All parameters, as well as the methods to measure them, are standard variables / methods in clinical studies and / or clinical practice. They are widely used and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant. 10.

The primary anal ysis for all efficacy endpoints will be based on FAS. SAF: All patient s that received at least one dose of study treatment (vericiguat or placebo). Analy ses will be based on actual treatment received, and patient s who did not reach maximum titration or received both vericiguat and placebo by mistake will be assigned to the p lanned treatment. All safet y analy ses will be based on the SAF. PPS: All patient s who meet the major inclusion and exclusion criteria at randomization that may affect efficacy , who are not taking excluded concomitant medications during the stud y that could have an effect on efficacy , have the KCCQ assessed at baseline and at least once during the main treatment phase and who are at least 80% compliant with study medication and show no major protocol deviations. The detailed criteria will be described in the SAP. The PPS will only be used in the supportive analysis. PKS: All subjects with at least one valid pharmacokinetic concentration will be included in the statistical evaluation of pharmacokinetics. 10.3 Variables and planned statistical analyses 10.3.1 Efficacy variables Primary efficacy variable: The primary endpoint will be change in KCCQ PL S from baseline to week 24 . The estimand of interest is the de facto or treatment policy estimand. Population: Defined through appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Section 6.1and 6.2) to reflect the targe ted patient population. Variable: Change from baseline in KCCQ PL S from baseline to Week 24. Measurement of intervention effect: Regardless of stopping study treatment or adherence to study treatment. Summary measure: Difference of L Smeans at Week 24. Theanalysis will include all assessments post -baseline. Graphical method of Maurer and Bretz (33)will be applied for multiplicity control. T he two primary hypotheses will be tested with an equall y splitted two sided alpha level of0.025. The primary anal ysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using a MMRM, including treatment group (vericiguat versus placebo), stud y visit as fixed effects, patient as a random effect, interaction between study visit and treatment group, and adjustment for the baseline PLS values as covariates. The model willassume an unstructured covariance matrix for within -patient variability . The anal ysis will be performed in the Full Anal ysis Set. For patients who drop out of the study , a pattern- mixture model with control -based pattern imputation will be implemented.

In addition, cumulative distribution function of change from ba seline at 24 weeks for the KCCQ PLS domain will be plotted to compare the proportion of patients who are meeting certain threshold f rom vericiguat and placebo arms (see Section 10.5). As a supportive analy sis, the MMRM using the above model will be applied to all assessments post -baseline prior to study drug termination . Additional sensitivity analy ses will be performed . Anal ysis using data imputation approaches based on different missing data mechanisms will be investigated , including tipping point analysis.Details of such methods will be described in the SAP. Secondary efficacy variable: The secondary endpoint is change from baseline in the 6 MWT at 24 weeks . The estimand of interest is the de facto or treatment policy estimand. Population: Defined through appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Section 6.1and Section 6.2) to reflect the targeted patient population and restricted to those who are able to perform the 6 MWT at baseline. Variable: Change from baseline in 6 MWT from baseline to Week 24.Measurement of intervention effect: Regardless of stopping study treatment or adherence to study treatment. Summary measure: Difference of LS means at Week 24. The secondary endpoint will be anal yzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint . For those patient s who are too sick to perform the test at an y post baseline visit, a score of 0 will be assumed. fur thersensitivity anal yses will be specified in SAP. Other efficacy variables: Other continuous variables including change from baseline to week 24 in other KCCQ domains, EQ -5D- 5L, fried frailty score and NT-proBNP , will be anal yzed using the MMRM"

Incidences of cardiovascular death and total heart failure hospitalizations, as well as all -cause mortality and CV hospitalizations, MI and stroke will be summarized. Kaplan Meier curves of the composite endpoints ( seeSection 9.4) will be presented. Details on an y descriptive subgroup anal yses will be specified in the SAP. These will include region, gender, atrial fibrillation status ,patient randomization time (befor e or after discharge from HF hospitalization, or post IV diuretic treatment without hospitalization) , and the time from HF hospitalization or IV diuretic treatment to randomization (<3 month vs. ≥3 month ). Multiplicity adjustment : The study uses the graph ical method of Maurer and Bret z (33) to provide strong multiplicity control across the primary KCCQ PL S hypotheses and the secondary 6 MWT hy potheses. The overall two sided alpha level will be controlled at 0.05. The two primary hypotheses will be tested using Bonferroni procedure , each at a splitted level of alpha 0.025. The two secondary hypotheses will be tested based on pa rallel gatekeeping pr inciple . If both primary hypotheses can be rejected, the secondary famil y will be tested at a full alpha level 0.05 (two sided). If onl y one primary h ypothesis is shown to be statistically significant, then only the secondary hypothesis based on the same dose group can be tested at an alpha level carried forward from the primary family testing , i.e., 0.025 ( two sided). Inthis case, if the secondary hypothesis is rejected, the alpha spending associated with this dose group (0.025) will be re - utilized to test the other failed primary hypothesis again. Figure 10–1 shows the α -allocation for each h ypothesis in the ellipse representing the hypothesis. Figure 10–1 α- allocation for each hypothesis in the ell ipse representing the hypothesis Overall, the primary analy sis will be claimed to have a positive outcome if the null hy pothesis for at least one of the two primary hypotheses can be rejected. 10.4 Determination of sample size The sample size estimation for this study will be based on the analy sis of the primary endpoint of KCCQ PLS at 24 weeks comparing vericiguat 15 mg versus placebo and 10 mg versus placebo, to achieve 80% power with two -sided alpha level of 0.05 to detect a treatment difference from placebo in one or both of the dose groups. A mean difference from placebo in KCCQ PL S of 5 points for both dose groups and a common SD of 21 points are assumed. Under the same assumption of treatment effect and standard deviation, the power to detect"
66,page_66,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 66of 81 difference for an y single comparison will be 65%. The 80% power was based on an “either or” success criterion, i.e., if at least one of the primary null hy potheses is rejected. The marginal power to reject any single comparison is 65% . The given sample size provides 97% power to detect +30 m placebo -corrected increas e in the secondary endpoint 6MWT (assumed SD 80 m) for any one dose group, and 80% power to detect an increase b y +22.3 m , which is below the 35 m increase associated with a 6.2 point improvement in KCCQ PLS at 24 weeks in FAI R-HF and greater than the 15 m increase at 3 - months that was associated with a 2.3 point improvement in KCCQ PLS inACTION -HF (34). A 5 point imp rovement in KCCQ OSS in patients with HFrEF is considered to represent a clinically significant change in heart failure status ( 35). Similarly , a change of +6.4 and -5.1 points in KCCQ PL S were associated with either small improvements or small deteriorations in clinical status, as determined by a cardiologist , in the Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium study cohort in patients with HFrEF ( 35, 36). In addition, baseline KCCQ PL S score has also been associated with peak VO 2and distance traveled on the 6 minute walk test (6 MWT ), with 6.4 and 7.5 point differences in PLS being associated with 1SD changes for peak VO 2and 6 MWT respectively (37). Furthermore, both anchor -based and distribution - based anal yses of the SOCRATES -PRESERVED data support an improvement of 5 points in KCCQ PL S as MCID. This effect size has been propos ed to the US FDA during a Ty pe C meeting and was considered preliminaril y acceptable pending additional data anal yses(see Section 10.5) per Agency correspondence following the meeting . As such, this study will be powered to detect a placebo- corrected change of at least 5 point improvement in KCCQ PL S from baseline to 24 week s. An SD of 21 points was assumed based on studies in which KCCQ PL S has been reported in the literature (38-43). The patients will also be followed until the end of the study regardless of stopping study treatment or not, hence the drop -out rate is considered negligible . Based on these considerations, the total sample size will be N=735 with N=245 each in the placebo, 10 mg vericiguat arm and 15 mg vericiguat arm in a 1:1:1 randomization. 10.5 Planned interim analyses Futility interim analysis A single interim assessment by the DMC to evaluate futility is planned for when 50% of the patients complete Visit 7 (week 12) and their KCCQ data become available. Although the effects of 24 weeks of treatment with vericiguat have not been evaluated in patients with HFpEF, prior data in this population suggest that the 12 week timepoint will be sufficientl y predictive of the 24 week data to allow for an adequate interim assessment of efficacy . Furthermore, in view of the expected timeline for trial conduct, a sufficiently large proportion of data at the 24 week timepoint will only become available shortly before completion of the trial. Based on a careful analy sis of the operating characteristics of a range of futility criteria, an observed treatment effect of 0 .6 point difference in KCCQ PLS (vericiguat vs placebo) was chosen to serve as the boundary for futility for both dose groups; this is approximately equivalent to a joint conditional power (CP) of 23% (under the assumption of a true difference of 5 points) . An observed treatment eff ect <0 .6in both comparisons would therefore signal to the DMC to consider their potential recommendation that the trial should be terminated early. The ty pe II error rate spent with this futility rule will be <0.01. Assuming the true treatment"
67,page_67,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 67of 81 effect is a5 point difference as expected, the probability ofstopping at the interim is approximately 1.3%. U nder the null hy pothesis, i.e., assuming 0 treatment effect for both vericiguat vs. placebo comparisons , the probability of stopping at the interim for futility for both doses is a pproximately 43%. Stopping for futility will onl y be done if both arms are futile. If only one arm is futile then it will not be dropped as enrollment is expected to be completed at the time of the futility analysis. At this futility boundary the trial has a probability of 9% to observe a >5 point improvement in either of the comparison in KCCQ PLS.Details of the futility anal ysis will be specified in the SAP and in the DMC charter. No formal interim report w ill be written. Anchor -based interim analysis The PGI C will be used to support an anchor -based approach to estimate KCCQ PLS MC ID values. These anal yses will be performed upon completion of the 3 -month assessment by all trial participants and therefore at the time point at which approximately 70% of patients have completed the week 24 visit assessment. The analy sis will take place before unblinding and without knowledge of the treatment received b y the participants, Participants will be categorized accordi ng to their responses to the PGIC as follows: Participant who report “A little better” to PGI C Question #1 as well as “Yes” to Question #1b (Was this improvement in y our physical limitations an important change for you? ). Participants who report “A little worse” to PGIC Question #1 as well as “Yes” to Question #1b (Was this worsening in y our phy sical limitations an important change for you (b y important we mean did it bother you?); Mean KCCQ PL S change scores from baseline will be calculated for each group above to define an anchor -based MI D. In addition, further anal ysis including non -parametric discriminant anal ysis will be conducted to explore the MCI D using all patient response data available (44). Patients who respond “much better” and “better” will be aggregated to the new category “Much i mproved”. Patients who respond “the same”, “a little worse”, “worse”, or “much worse” will be combined into the new category “No timproved”. Given sufficient sample size for category responses (at least 20 patients in each of the categories), t he KCCQ PL S score densities for each category will be estimated and the intersection point of these density curves will be considered as the discrimination points. The discrimination point between the two categories “a little better” and “Not improved” is considered to be MCID. Similarly , the discrimination point for PGI S categories will be used to inform anchor -based approaches for MID estimates for the KCCQ PLS mean change from baseline. The blinded information obtained from the above described anchor -based approa ches, will have no impact on the trial conduct. These anal yses serve to support r esponder definitions that will be further detailed in the statistical analysis plan prior to unblinding the trial. Therefore, no correction of the family wise error rate of the trial is necessary .No formal interim report will be written."

Vericiguat peak and trough plasma concentrations will be summarized per visit andseparated acco rding to assigned dose. The following statistics will be calculated for each of the sampling points: arithmetic mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation, geometric mean, geometric standard deviation (re-transformed standard deviation of the lo garithms) and geometric coefficient of variation, minimum, median, and maximum value and the number of measurements. Means at an y time will only be calculated if at least 2/3 of the individual data were measured and were above the LLOQ. For the calculation of the mean value a data point below LLOQ will be substituted by one half of this limit. I n tables showing mean values, where values below LLOQ are included in the calculation of mean values, these means will be marked. PK/QT analyses Thetime-matched placebo -corrected change from baseline of the QT interval corrected according to QTcF after 10 mg vericiguat and after 15 mg vericiguat at steady state will be analyzed. The individual change from baseline of QTcF after 24 weeks will be anal yzed by ANCOVA , including treatment as fixed effects, the subject as random effect and the baseline value as covariate. Based on these anal yses, point estimates (L S-Means) and confirmatory two- sided 90% confidence intervals of the true mean difference will be calculated for each time point on week 24 . Further anal yses to explore the relationship between PK concentration and QTc will be specified in the SAP. For further details of other standard PK/PD anal yses, see Section 9.5. 11. Data handling and quality assurance 11.1 Data recording The data collection tool for this study will be a validated electronic data capture sy stem called RAVE. Patient data necessary for anal ysisand reporting will be entered/transmitted into a validated database or data sy stem ( LSH). Data required according to this protocol will be recorded b y investigational site personnel via data entry into the internet based EDC software sy stem RAVE, which Ba yer has licensed from Medidata Solutions Worldwide. RAVE has been validated b y Medidata Solutions Worldwide and Bay er for use in its clinical studies. RAVE allows for the application of software logic to set -up data entry screens and data checks to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the data entered b y the site personnel. Bayer extensively applies the logic to ensure data are complete and reflect the clinical d ata requirements of the study . Data queries resulting from the application of the software lo gic are r esolved b y the site personnel. The data are stored at a secure host facility maintained by Medidata Solutions Worldwide and transferred on a periodic basis to Bay er's internal computer sy stem via a secure Virtual Private Network.All access to the RAVE sy stem is through a password- protected security system that is part of the RAVE software. All internal Bay er and external investigator site personnel seeking access"

Training records are maintained. All personnel with access to the RAVE sy stem are supported by a Service Desk staffed with trained personnel to answer questions and ensure access is maintained such that data entry can proceed in a timely manner. The RAVE Sy stem contains a sy stem -generated audit trail that captures any changes made to a data field, including who made the change, wh y the change was made and the date and time it was made. This information is available both at the inv estigator’s site and at Bay er. Data entries made in the RAVE EDC screens are supported by source documents maintained for all patient s enrolled in this study . Source documentation The site must implement processes to ensure availability of all required source documentation (e.g. patient file, local laboratory report, etc.). A source document checklist (not part of this protocol) will be used at the site to identify the source data for key data points collected and the monitor will work with the site to complete this. It is the expectation of the sponsor that all data entered into the CRF has source documentation available at the site. Race ,ethnic group , age and gender may be entered directly into the CRF, without availability of corresponding source documentation. Thus, these CRF data will be the source and no additional source documentation need sto be available. For all other data, source documentation must be available at the site. Data recorded from screening failuresAt minimum, the follow ing data should be recorded in the CRF: Demographic information ( patient number; year of birth /age; sex; if applicable race / ethnicity ) Date of informed consent Relevant inclusion/exclusion criteria Reason for premature discontinuation Date of l ast visit These data will be transferred to the respective database. For screening failures with an SAE, the following data should be collected in the CRF in addition to the data specified above: All information related to the SAE such as: - The SAE itself -Conc omitant medication -Medical history -Other information needed for SAE complementary page 11.2 Monitoring In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor’s/CRO’s procedures, monitors will contact the site prior to the start of the study to review with the site staff the protocol,"

The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents. 11.3 Data processing Data will be collected as described in Section 11.1. Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with applicable sponsor’s/CRO’s standards and data cleaning procedures. This is applicable for data recorded on CRF as well as for data f rom other sources (e.g. IxRS, laboratory , adjudication committees). For data coding (e.g. AEs, medication), internationally recognized and accepted dictionaries will be used. After its initial release for biometrical anal ysis, the clinical database is planned to be re - opened for the inclusion of the following additional data: pharmacokinetic data. 11.4 Missing data We expect a low number of missing data since investigators and patients are encouraged to complete the visit schedule with all assessments irrespective of whether study drug treatment is completed per protocol or after premature permanent study drug discontinuation. All missing or partial data will be presented in the da ta listing as they are recorded on the CRF . 11.5 Audit and inspection To ensure compliance with GCP and regulatory requirements, a member of the sponsor’s (or a designated CRO’s) quality assurance unit may arrange to conduct an audit to assess the performance of the study at the study site and of the stud y documents originating there. The investigator/institution will be informed of the audit outcome.In addition, inspections by regulatory health authority representatives a nd IEC(s)/I RB(s) are possible. The investigator should notify the sponsor immediately of any such inspection. The investigator/institution agrees to allow the auditor or inspector direct access to all relevant documents and allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/ins pector to discuss findings and an y issues. Audits and inspections may occur at an y time during or after completion of the study ."

Patient (hospital) files will be archived according to local regulations and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, in stitution or private practice. Where the archiving procedures do not meet the minimum timelines required b y the sponsor, alternative arrangements must be made to ensure the availability of the source documents for the required period. The investigator/institution notifies the sponsor if the archival arrangements change (e.g. relocation or transfer of ownership). The investigator site file is not to be destroyed without the sponsor’s approval. The contract with the investigator/institution will contain all regulations relevant for the stud y center. 12. Premature termination of the study The sponsor has the right to close this study (or, if applicable, individual segments thereof [e.g. treatment arms; dose steps; centers]) at an y time, which may be due but not limited to the following reasons: If risk -benefit ratio becomes unacceptable ow ing to, for example, -Safety findings from this study (e.g. SAEs) -Results of any interim analy sis - Results of parallel clinical studies -Results of parallel animal studies (on e.g. toxicity , teratogenicity , carcinogenicity or reproduction toxicity ). If the study conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop-out rate; data qualit y; protocol compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable time frame. The investigator has the right to close his/her center at an y time. For an y of the abo ve closures, the following applies: Closures should occur only after consulta tion between involved parties. Final decision on the closure must be in writing. All affected institutions (e.g. IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority(ies); study center; head of study center) must be informed as applicable according to local law. All study materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) mu st be returned to the sponsor. The investigator will retain all other documents until notification is given b y the sponsor for destruction. In the event of a partial study closure, ongoing patients, including those in post study follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.

Protocol amendments Not applicable 16. Appendices 16.1 Appendix 1: 6 Minute walk test The 6 MWT test must be performed in accordance with the American Thoracic Societ y Guideline (81). In case of absolute contraindication (i.e. unstable angina and my ocardial infarction during the previous month) , the 6MWT test must not be performed. According to the guideline, the 6 MWT test should be carried out indoors, along a long, flat, straight, enclosed corridor with hard surface that is seldom traveled. The walking course should be preferabl y 30 m in length, but not less than 25 m (longer walking courses should be shortened to 30 m). The length of the corridor and turnaround points should be marked. Patients will be instructed to walk alone, not run, from one end to the other end of the walking course, at their own pace, while attempting to cover as much ground as possible in 6 minutes. During the walk, patients are allowed to stop, lean against the wall and rest, bu t should resume walking as soon as they feel able to do so. The resting time will be included in the 6minutes. A “warm -up” period before the test should not be performed. The patients should sit at rest in a chair, located near the starting position, for at least 10 minutes before the test starts. Investigators should not walk with the patients. Moreover, only standardized phrases for encouragement must be used during the test. To allow reproducibility , standardized phrases should be used every minute acco rding to the following pattern: After the first minute, tell the patient the following (in even tones): “You are doing well. You have 5 minutes to go.” When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “Keep up the good work. You have 4 minutes to go.” When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “You are doing well. You are halfway done.”"
80,page_80,"Clinical Study Protocol No. BAY 1021189 / 19334 22FEB 2018 Version no.1.0 Page: 80of 81 When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “Keep up the good work. You have only 2 minutes left.” When the timer shows only 1 minute remaining, tell the patient: “You are doing well. You have onl y 1 minute to go.” To reduce the variability of the 6MWT tests, it is of utmost importance that familiarization - 6MWT test, baseline -test and all following tests are performed under the same conditions. Wheelchair or scooter dependent / supplemental oxy gen patients or those on continuous oxy gen for severe pulmonary disease are excluded from the study . The use of a cane is allowed in cane dependent patients, but then these patients need to use the same cane at every 6 MWT test throughout the study . If the need for walking aids should arise at the baseline visit, the same walking aids should also be used at every subsequent test. If a supplemental ox ygen therapy should be implemented already at baseline, all subsequent 6MWT tests have to be performed under the same “baseline” conditions (same flow of ox ygen, same application route, and same way of carry ing the oxy gen bottle). Even if a supplemental ox ygen therap y is implemented or modified during the trial (e.g. increase of oxygen flow), it is not permitted to perform the subsequent 6 MWT tests under conditions other than the baseline conditions. However, a change of test conditions should be avoided, if reasonably possible at least after baseline, to have the same conditions in all 6MWT tests. For quality reasons, the inhalation of supplemental ox ygen and the use of walking aids during the 6MW Ttests must be documented in the eCRF. 16.2 Appendix 2: Borg CR 10 scale and test instructions Use this rating scale to report how strong your perception of exertion is. First look at the verbal expressions. Start with them and then the numbers. Of these ten (10) or “Extremely strong –Maximal” is a very important intensity level. This is the most intense perception or feeling you have ever had. If your experience or feeling is “Very weak”, you should say “1”, if it is “Moderate”, say “3”. Note that “Moderate” is “3” and thus weaker than “Medium”, “Mean” or “Middle”. If t he experience is “Strong” or “Heav y” (it feels “Difficult”) say “5”. Note that “Strong” is about half of “Maximal”. Is your feeling “Very strong”, choose a number from 6 to 8. I f your perception or feeling is stronger than “10”, “Extremely strong – Maximal ” you can use a larger number, e.g. 12 (that’s why “Absolute maximum” is marked with a dot “ ●”). I t is very important that y ou report what y ou actuall y experience or feel, not what you think y ou should report. Be as spontaneous and honest as possible and try to avoid under -or overestimating. Look at the verbal descriptors and then choose a number. When rating your exertion give a number (in principle any kind of decimal number is allowed) that corresponds to how hard and strenuous y ou perceive the work to be. The perception of exertion is mainly felt as strain and fatigue in your muscles and as breathlessness or an y aches."
