Upon binding of the cy tokine to its receptor, the associated JAKs are activated, and pho sphory late each other and the receptor. The phosphory lated receptors serve as docking sites for the signal transducers and activators of transc ription ( STAT )family (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4 , STAT5a, STAT5b, and STA T6) of transcription factors. The STA Ts are then phosphory lated by the co -localized JAKs, which stabilize homo -or heterodimeric STAT complexes that translocate the nucleus where th ey bind to specific gene promoters and activate t ranscription of a range o ftarget genes. PF-06651600 (ritleciti nib) is an orall y bioavailable small molecule that selectively inhibit s JAK3 by irreversibly blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding s ite without significant lyinhibiti ngthe other th ree JAK isoforms (JAK1, J AK2, and TYK2). PF-06651600 also inhi bits irreversibl y the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma ( TEC kinase )family (BTK, bone marrow ty rosine kinase on chromosome X(BMX), (interleukin -2-inducible T -cellkinase) ITK,TEC, and t yrosine ki nase expressed in Tcells (TXK)) , with high selectivity over the broader kinome . The selective inhibition of JAK3 will lead t o modulation of -common chain cy tokine pathway s, such as IL -7, IL -9, IL-15and IL -21, which have been im plicated in the pathoph ysiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). Furthermore, invivo PF-06651600 will spare signaling of key immunoregulatory cytokines, s uch as IL -10, IL -27and IL -35,which have been shown to be critical to maintain immune homeostasis in the digestive tract. Finall y, TEC kinase inhibition will impact cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8 )+ T and natural killer ( NK)cells cy totoxic functions, which play a role in the pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD). Taken together, it is hypothe sized that PF-06651600 could be efficacious in the treatment of UC. PF-06700841 (brepocitinib) is an oral ly bioavailable , small molecule, potent dual inhibitor of human t yrosine -protein kinase 2(TYK2) andJAK1. JAK1 inhibition will impact the signaling o f pro -inflammatory cytokines such as interferon ( IFN)-gamma and cytokines signaling through the -common chain receptor such as IL -7, IL -9, IL -15and IL -21, while the inhibition of TYK2 will block the production of pro -inflammatory cytokines interferon -gamma and IL-17through upst ream inhibition of the IL -12/Th1 and IL-23/Th17 pathway s. Taken together, it is hy pothesized tha t dual inhibition of both TYK2 and JAK1 could be efficacious in the treatment of UC . Both PF -06651600 and PF -06700841 are under devel opment as induction and c hronic therap y for the treatment of in flammatory bowel disease (IBD)."

IBD presents as one of two major forms, UC or Crohn’s disease (CD). UC is characterized b y continuous inflammation that is localized to the colon. CD is characterized b y discontinuous inflammation that can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract from mo uth to anus and may be asso ciated with long-term debilitating sequelae, such as fistulae and intestinal strictures. The incidence of UC reported in the past 20 years varies b y location. Reported rates in North America range from about 8-19, in South Ameri ca from 1.5 -2.6, in Asia an d the Middle East from 0.6 -4.4, in Western Europe from 2.3 -17.5, in Eastern Europe from 0.8 -5.9, and in Australia /New Zealand ,from 7.6 -17.4 per 100,000 person -years. The prevalence of UC in the same time period, b y geographic r egion, ranged f rom 155.8 -248.6in North America, was 76.1 in a single report from South America, from 4.9 -168.3 in Asia and the Middle East, from 4.9 -294in Northern and Western Europe, from 2.42 -101in Eastern Europe and 145 in Australia and New Zealand per 1,000,000 persons . Glob ally there does not appear to be a gender difference in incidence of UC.1 Although UC can occur at any age, the incidence peaks between 15 to 25 years with a second peak between 55 to 65 years.2UC is a lifelong condition with a serious effect on the qualit y of life. Current IBD treatments include aminosalicy lates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis facto r (TNF) -or47integrin. Despite multiple therapies being available , limitations remain in the treatment of IBD, and patients continue to have s ymptoms or develop intolerance to or side effects from their treatment regimens. Because of the significant lyreduced r isk for immunogenicit y and the potential for oral administration, small molecule inhibitors have emerged as an attractive therapeutic modality . Tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor with broad specificit y, mainl y targeting JAK1 and JAK3, with lesser effects on J AK2, and therefore affects multiple cy tokine signaling pathway s. Tofacitinib has been approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and has demonstrated significant differences in clinical response and remission in comparison to placebo in subjects with UC .3Pfizer’s plan is to test multiple selective kinase inhibitor assets simultaneously in the UC disease setting, which in this trial will include a JAK3 -specific inhibitor and a TYK2/JAK1 -specific inhib itor in the context of a single clinical study . Each arm of the study will address a biologicall y distinct question. The JAK3 -specific arm will address the involvement of cy tokines that signal through JAK3 in UC, and the TYK2/JAK1 -specific arm will addre ss the invol vement of cy tokines that signal through TYK2 and JAK1 in UC. Both PF -06651600 and PF -06700841 avoid specific targeting of JAK 2, thus reducing the risks of undesired side effects, such as anemia."

Upon binding of the cy tokine to its receptor, the associated JAKs are activated, and phosphorylate each other and the receptor. The phosphory lated receptors serve as docking site s for the STAT family (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6) of transcription factors. The STAT s are then phosphory lated by the co-localized JAKs, which stabilize homo -or heterodimeric STAT complexes that translocate the nucleus where th ey bind to specific gene promoters and activate transcription of a range of target genes. PF-06651600 ( ritlecitin ib)is a potent, JAK 3 selective, covalent inhibitor. It is an orally bioavailable small molecule that selectivel y inhibit sJAK3 by irreversib ly blocking the ATP binding site without significantly inhibiti ngthe other three JAK isoforms (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2). PF-06651600 also inhibits irreversibly the TEC kinase fa mily (BTK , bone marrow tyrosine kinas eon chromosome X (BMX), ITK , TEC, and tyrosine kinase expressed in T cells (TXK)) , with high selectivity over the broader kinome . The selective inhibition of JAK3 will lead to modulation of -common chain cy tokine pathway s, such as IL -7, IL-9, IL-15and IL -21, which have been implicated in the pa thophy siology of UC. Furthermore, invivo PF -06651600 will spare signaling of key immunoregulatory cytokines, such as IL -10, IL-27and IL -35,which have been shown to be critical to maintain immune homeo stasis in the digestive tract. Finally, TEC kinase inhibition will impact CD8+T and NK cells cytotoxic functions, whi ch play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Taken together, it is hypothesized that PF-06651600 could be efficacious in treatment of UC. PF-06700841 (brepocitinib) is an oral ly bioavailable ,small molecule, potent dual inhibitor of human TYK2 and JAK 1. JAK1 inhibition wi ll impact the signaling of pro- inflammatory cytokines such as IFN -gamma and cy tokines signaling through the -common chain receptor such as IL -7, IL -9, IL -15and IL -21, whil e the inhibition of TYK2 will block the production of pro -inflamma tory cytokines interferon-gamma and IL-17 through upstream inhibition of the IL -12/Th1 and IL -23/Th17 pathway s. Taken together, it is hy pothesized that dual inhibition of both TYK2 and JAK1 could be efficacious in the treatment of UC. Both PF -06651600 and PF-06700841 are under development as induction and chronic therap y for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 1.2.Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism CCI CCI"

Study Rati onale This multicenter, mult iple-arm, dose ranging, placebo- controlled stud y (in the induction period andnot the chronic dosing period ) will be the first determination of safet y and efficacy of PF -06651600 and PF-06700841 in subjects with moderate to seve re UC. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy (based on total May o score), safet y, tolerability , and PD of20, 70, and 200 mg of PF -06651600 and 10, 30, and 60mg of PF-06700841 dosed once daily during an induction period of 8 weeks, followed by a chronic dosing period at doses of 50 mg and 30 mg of PF -06651600 and PF- 06700841, respectivel y for 24 weeks ( Section 2). The current non -clinical toxicology packages support tr eatment duration ≥6months. Dermatologic rashes have been observed in the Phase 1 PF-06651600 studies. As the more severe rashes wer e associated with twice a day administration, dosing has been limited to once a day in this study . The availability of der matology consultation in this study is purel y a precautionary measure. CCI"

The availability ofaudiology consultation in this study is purel y a precautionary measure. Changes in lipid profile linked to Interleukin -6 (IL-6)inhibition have been observed with JAK inhibitors. Therefore, lipid profiles will be assessed in this study . Simvastatin is hi ghly metabolized in the gut and modeling based on in vitro data suggests that PF -06651600 may exhibit time dependent inhibition of CYP3A which could result in a clinically relevant increase in simvastatin plasma levels. Thus, simvastatin use with PF-06651 600is currently prohibited. Since PF -06651600 is metabolized by CYP3A , moderate to potent inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A are pr ohibited. Increases in serum creatinine have been observed in the Phase 1PF-06700841 studies. However, nonclinical data sug gest that this could be due to inhibition of creatinine transport in the proximal tubule of the nephron rather than being an indica tion of renal toxicity . Parallel cy statin C assessments in the Phase 1studies were consistent with this hy pothesis. The av ailability of nephrology consultation in this study is purel y a precautionary measure. By including two investigational drugs in a single study , therespective placebo group scan be combined , resulting in fewer subjects being exposed to placebo and smaller overall study size. The inclusion of these two investigational drugs is appropriate as the target population for both is identica l,as are the efficacy outcome measures. Though clinical remission based on total May o score has traditionall y been used as a primary endpoint in the UC population, total May o score at Week 8 is used in this study to maximize the value of the information from the statistical inference perspective . The two scores are highl y correlated, with total Mayo score being a good pred ictor of the remission rates, but utilization of the total Mayo score in an appropriate model setting allows for a sample size reducti on,while not compromising the statistical power. All endoscopies will be read by a Central Reader who will be blinded to study treatment. CCI CCI"

Dose Rationale The dose selection strategy was designed to balance pharmacology and safety for this study with an 8 week induction period followed b y a 24 week chronic dosing period in subjects with moderate to severe UC. A population PK model was developed using the data from the FIHstudy for PF -06651600 (Study B7981001) and similarly forPF-06700841 (Study B7931001). PK was assumed to be similar between healthy subje cts and subjects with moderate to severe UC. The activity of the JAK inhibitors was assessed by measurement of various PD markers and markers of safety that were collected in the FIH studies and analyzed using indirect response modeling. The magnitude of change in these markers required for efficacy and/or safet y is poorl y understood. 1.5.3.

Efficacy was measured by placebo adjus ted psoriasis area and severit y index ( PASI )change from baseline. Significant psoriasis disease modification (change > -9) at 30 mg and 100 mg was observed in the patients . Overall, t he doses selected for this study are expected to demonstrate clinically relevant efficacy in subjects with moderate to severe UC. 1.5.5. Summary of Benefits and Risks IBD is a serious and potentially life threatening disease. The completed Phase 1study B7981001 wasa randomized, double blind, third part y open, placebo controlled, single and multiple dose escalation, parallel group study in healthy adult subjects. Based on this study , PF-06651600 appeared to be generally safe and well -tolerated. No clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram or laboratory data were observed. No dose limiting adverse events (AEs) were reported and no subjects met the protocol prescribed individual stopping rules. There were no deaths in the study. The comp leted RA Phase 2a study was a randomized double -blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, multi -center study to assess the efficacy and safet y profile of 200 mg QD dose of PF-06651600 compared to placebo after 8 week treatment in seropositive subjects with moderate to severe active RA and an inadequate response to methotrexate. PF-06651600 appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated in this study . No deaths or SAEs were reported. TEAEs were numerically higher in the active group compared to placebo and were generally mild in severit y. The most common TEAEs by SOC were Infections and Infestations, Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders and Gastrointestinal Disorders. There was one mild case of herpes simple x inthe PF -06651600 group that was considered to be treatment related with no cases in the placebo group. The Phase 2a stud y in subjects with AA is ongoing. However, draft data from an interim analysis at 24 weeks has been reported in this IB. The study is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center study with an extension period to evaluate the efficacy and safet y profile of PF -06651600 and PF -06700841 in subjects with moderate to severe active AA. PF-06651600 appeared genera lly safe and well tolerated . There were no deaths in the study . There were no subjects with SAEs in the PF -06651600 group. The number of AEs was higher in the placebo group relative to the PF -06651600 group. The most common AEs were in the Infections and Infestations, Gastrointestinal Disorders, and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders categories, and the majority of events were mild. No serious infections or cases of herpes zoster were reported in the study .Hematological changes were o bserved in both active groups during the induction and maintenance periods, but were not associated with clinically relevant adverse events."
81,page_81,"PF-06651600, PF -06700841 B7981005 Final Protocol Amendment 7, 18November 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 82The safet y profile observed during the Phase 1 program for PF-06700841 appears to be acceptable at dosages up to 17 5mg administere d orally as multiple doses over 10 days. A longer dosing duration was explored in psoriasis patients, who received the maximum PF-06700841 dose level of 100 mg daily for 28 days. No serious or severe AEs were reported in the Phase 1study . However, ther e was one AE of herpes zoster infection in a psoriasis subject treated with 100 mg PF -06700841 for 4 weeks. As with other immunomodulators, t he risk of infection is potential concern due to the immunosuppressive effects of PF -06700841. To limit this risk , a maximum daily dose below 100 mg (the dose associated with infection in the Phase 1 study B7931001) will be used in this Phase 2trial. A chronic therap y dose of 30 mg was selected since this dose has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity resulting in clinical efficacy in patients with psoriasis. Additional information for these compounds may be found in the s ingle reference safety document (SRSD) , which for this study is the individual IBfor each compound. 2.

Screening laboratory tests with abnor mal results (if considered by the investigator to be transient and inconsistent with the subject’s clinical condition) may be repeated within the screening window to confirm abnormal results. If results return to protocol acceptable limits within the scre ening period, the subject may enter the study. Subjects who do not meet eligibility criteria (ie, screen fail) may be re -screened once (with a new screening number) at the discretion of the investigator. 4.3.Lifestyle Requirements 4.3.1. Contraception Subjects who are, in the opinion of the investigator, sexually active and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must agree to use 2 methods of effective contraception (at least 1 highly effective method) throughout the study and for at least 28daysafter the last dose of investigational p roduct . The investigator or his or her designee , in consultation with the subject, will confirm that the subject has selected 2 appropriate methods of contraception for the individual subject and his /herpartner(s)from the list of permitted contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has been instructed in their consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities, t he investigato ror designee will inform the subjec t of the need to use 2 methods of effective contraception (at least 1 highl y effective method) consistently and correctl y and document the conversation , and the subject’s affirmation, in the subject’s chart. In addition ,the investigator or designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if 1or both of the selected contraception method s is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the subject or partner . Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie,perfect use) and include the following: 1.Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associa ted with inhibition of ovulat ion. 2.Intrauterine device (IUD). 3.Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS). 4.Bilateral tubal occlusion. 5.Vasectomized partner.

To facilitate access to appropriatel y quali fied medical personnel on stud y-related medical questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers , subject study numbers, contact information for the investigat orsite, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigat orsite staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another hea lthcare professional not involved in the subject’s p articipation in the study .The contact number can also be used by investiga tor staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the est ablished communication pathway s between the investig atorsite and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study . The contact number is not intended for use b y the subject directly , and if a subject calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigat orsite. 5.STUDY TREATMENTS For the pur poses of this study , and per International Conferenc eon Harmoni sation ( ICH) guidelines ,investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference /comparator in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33) . For this study , the investigational product(s) a re PF-06651600 and PF -06700841 table ts. 5.1.Allocation to Treatment Allocation of subjects to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive response technology (IRT) system ( interactive Web -based response [IWR]). The site personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) wil l be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification ( ID)and password, the protocol number ,andthe subject number. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatme nt assignment ,randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when investigational product is being supplied via the I RTsystem . The IRT sy stem will provide a confirmation report containing the subject number , randomization number ,andDU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system ."

At the initiation of the study , the investigator site will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The met hod will be an electronic process. Blinding codes should b e broken only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment code is absolutely essential for further management of the subject. If an investigator believe sthat immediate unblinding is necessary and time and circumstances allow s, he/ she is encouraged to discuss unblinding with a member of the study team. However, discussion with a member of the study team in advance of unblinding is not required . When the blindi ng code is broken, the reason must be fully documented and entered on th ecase report form (CRF) . 5.3.Subject Compliance IP accountability and compliance will be assessed by the site at each clinic visit starting at the visit after the baseline visit up throug h Week 32. Subject compliance will be verified b y the accounting of inv estigational product at each visit. When investigational product is administered at the research facility , it will be administered under the supervision of study personnel. Complianc e of the IP willbe monitored by delegated site personnel by the account ing of unused I P returned by the subject at study visits. Compliance will be documented on the CRF and source document. Non-compliance is defined as taking less than 80% or more than 120% of IP during the double -blind study treatment (induction) and/or chronic dosing period(s) and as directed by the dosing instructions , regardless of reason . Subjects are to bring t he blister cards and/or bottles with any remaining stud y drug to each visit for review. The investigator has the discretion to withdraw any s ubject from the study for reasons of non-compliance with the dosing regimen. Investigators should indicate on appropriate CRF page non -compliance with study treatment and provide an explanation. I nventory control of all IP must be rigorousl y maintained t hroughout the duration of the stud y until all IPhas been accounted for and/or returned to the sponsor. An y discrepancies noted between drug dispensing records and drug inventory must be reported to Pfizer. 5.4.Investigational Product Supplies 5.4.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging Blinded PF-06651600, PF -06700841 andmatching placebo swill be provided as tablets in blister cards for oral administration during the induction period of the study . For the chronic dosing period , PF-06700841 tablets will be supplied in bott les, PF -06651600 tablets will be supplied as tablets in blister cards.

Blinding occurs within investigational products, not across investigational products and only for the induction phase. 5.4.2. Preparation and Dispensing The investigational product will be dispensed using anIRT drug management sy stem at each visit from baseline visit through Week24. A qualified staff member will dispense the investigational product via unique container numbers in the blister cards or bottles provided, in quantities appropriate for the stud y visit schedule . The subject should be instructed to maintain the product in t he blister cards or bottles provided throughout the course of dosing and return the blister cards or bottles to the site at the next study visit. Refe rto Appendix 10 for investigational drug dispensing during public emergencies if applicable. 5.5.Administration PF-06651600 and PF- 06700841 tablets and matching placebo for oral administration will be dispensed in blister cards or bottles as described above in Section 5.4.1 . Subjects will be dispensed an appropriate number of blister cards or bottles sufficient for administration until the next dispensing visit and give nclear dosing instructions. Sites will be trained on how subjects should take tablets at home throug h an I P manual and/or other vehicle(s). Sites are responsible for communicating this information and site staff should review the dosing instructions wit hsubjects at every study visit through Week 24. Subjects should take the IP orally for 8 weeks during the induction period and an additional 24 weeks during the chronic dosing period for a total of 32 weeks. Subjects should swallow the tablets with ambi ent temperature water to a total volume of approximately 240 mL. Subjects should swallow the I P whole, and will not manipulate or chew the IP prior to swallowing. Subjects will be instructed to take the IP in the morning after breakfast whenever possible even though IP may be taken with or without food; however, for study visit days (ie, baseline, W eeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24) , subjects are to be instructed to refrain from dosing at home, bring their blister cards or bottles to the site . Subjects areto take the dose in the clinic from their current blister card or bottle . If a subject administers the morning dose prior to the visit, the subject may be rescheduled within the permitted window or the visit may be conducted If a dose is missed a nd the interval to the next dose is less than 8hours, the missed dose should not be administered. During the induction phase, if subjects require discontinua tion of investigational product for medically mandated reasons (eg, following instructions from investigator ) for more than 7consecutive day s at any time during the stud y, they will be discontinued from treatment and should undergo the procedures for an Ea rly Term ination visit on the last day the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible thereafter before entering the follow -up period, and will not be permitted to enter the chronic dosing period . During the chronic dosing period, if dosing is missed for more than 7 consecutive day s, the subject should be considered for discontinuation following consultation with the Sponsor. CCI"

Investigational product sshould be stored in their original container sand in accordan ce with the label s. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD willbe superseded b y the storage conditions stated on the product label. Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated ,and/or room -temperature products). This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study . Even for continuous -moni toring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available . The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the l ast evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all non -working day s upon return to normal operations. The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrig erator), as applicable, should be regularl y inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order. Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery . The site should actively pursue options for return ing the product to thestorage conditions described in the labeling , as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to Pfizer . Once an excursion is identified, the investigation al product must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the investigational product. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the investigati onal product after the temperature excursion. Useof the investigational product prior to Pfizer approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the si te. Receipt of materials, door opening and closing ,and other routine handling operations where the products are briefl y out of thetemperature range described in the labeling are not considered excursions. Site staff will instruct subjects on the proper storage requirements for take home investigational products . 5.7.Investigational Product Accountability The investiga torsite must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the investigational product supplies. Allinvestigational products will be accounted for us ing a drug accountabilit y form/record ."

Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of un used investigational product (eg , at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, i nstitutional policy , and any special instructions provided by Pfizer ,and all destruction must be adequatel y documented. For all blisters and/or bottles returned to the i nvestigator b y the subject, the investigator will maintain the returned supply until d estruction is authorized. Pfizer will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused investigational product. 5.8.Concomitant Treatment(s) All concomitant medicati on(s) and treatment(s) administered/taken during the study must be recorded with indic ation, daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration. All subjects will be questioned about concomitant medication at each site visit. A subject who is receivin g metformin as concomitant medication must allow at least two hours after taking eithe rmedication and before taking investigational product . Medication(s) administered/taken following the first dose of I P will be documented as concomitant medication(s). Treatments taken within 42 days before the first dose of study drug will be documented as prior treatment. Treatments taken after the first dose of study drug will be documented as concomitant treatment. 5.8.1. Oral Corticosteroids Any oral corticosteroids taken during the screening and treatment periods of the study will be captured on the appro priate CRF . 5.8.2. Permitted Medications Subjects will be allowed to use the following medications as detailed below: Concomitant use of oral 5 -ASA or sulfasalazine. Dose must be stable for at least 4weeks prior to baseline and through end of study (Week36). If oral 5 -ASA treatment has been recently discontinued, it must have been stopped for at least 2weeks prior to baseline . A stable dose of oral corticosteroids ( dose equivalent to prednisone up to 25mg/day ; budesonide up to 9 mg/day ; See Appendix 9) for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline and through end of the induction period (Week 8 , except for the case of subjects undergoing optional steroid tapering in the chronic dosing period )."

Rectal steroids are prohibited. Decreases in steroid use due to AEs are allowed. Upon a subject achieving remission during the chronic dosing period , steroids may be slowly taper ed per local guidelines. Steroid tapering is allowed onl y in the chronic dosing period . Subject smay reduce the dail y dose of prednisone or equivalent by 2.5to 5mgweekly (based on their sy mptom s) until the dose of prednisone or equivalent is 10 mg/day ,then reduce the dail y dose of prednisone or equivalent by 2.5mg weekl y until the dose is 0 mg. If a subject experiences worsening of UC symptoms during the corticosteroid taper that in the opinion of the investigator are attributable to the corticoster oid taper, then the invest igator may instruct the subject to revert back to the preceding dose in the taper schedule (ie, “step up”). The signs or symptoms leading to this change (eg, increased stool frequency , increased rectal bleeding) must be recorded on the CRF. Study subject s with signs or s ymptoms attributed to corticosteroid taper are permitted to step up their corticosteroid dosage one time during stud y participation and then resume corticosteroid taper to achieve steroid -free status. See Appendix 9for guidance on steroid equivalency . 5.8.3. Prohibited Medications The following medications are prohibited for the specified time periods as described below: Oral budesonide (>9 mg/day) or predn isone (> 25mg/day ) or equivalent ora lsystemic corticosteroid within 2 weeks prior to baseline and through end of stud y (Week36). IV, IM (parenteral), or topical (rectal) treatment of 5 -ASA or corticosteroid enemas/suppositories within 2 weeks prior to baseline and through end of study (Week36). Azathioprine, 6 -mercaptopurine, or methotrexate within 2 weeks prior to baseline and through end of study (Week 36). Biologics including anti -TNF inhibitors ( eg, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab) , or biosimilars ther eof,within 8 weeks prior to bas eline and through end of study (Week36). Anti-integrin inhibitors (eg, vedolizumab) within 8weeks prior to baseline and through end of study (Week36). Interferon therap y within 8 weeks prior to baseli ne and through end of study (Week36). Lym phocy te-depleting agents/therapies within 1 year prior to baseline and through end of study (Week 36)."

Withdrawal of Consent Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study treatment wi ll remain in the study and continue to be foll owed for protocol specified follow -up procedures ; the follow -up visit should occur 4 weeks after their last dose whenever possible. The procedures scheduled for Week 32will be performed on the last day the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible thereafter. The onl y exception to this is when a subject specificall y withdraws consent for any further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the subject to provide this information. Subjects should notify the inves tigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow -up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical r ecords by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt ofinvestigational product or also from study procedures and/or post treatment study follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status ( whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available informatio nshould be used to determine vital status only as appropriatel y directed in accordance with local law."

Lost to Follow -up All reasonable efforts must be made to locate s ubjects to determine and report their ongoing status. This includes follow -up with pe rsons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost tofollow -up is defined by the inabilit y to reach the subject after a minimum of 2documented phone calls, faxes, or e-mails as well as lack of response b y the subject to 1registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third -party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study has been include d in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor -retained third -party representative to assist site staff with obtaining the subject’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up por tion of the study . The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If,after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow -up, then the last -known -alive date as determined by the investigator should be reported and documented in the subject’s medical records. Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their ow nrequest, or they may be withdrawn at an y time at the discretio n of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons , or the inabil ity of the subject to comply with the protocol -required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site. If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the subject. All attempts to contact the subj ect and information received during contact attempts must be docu mented in the subject’s medical record . In an y circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withd rawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding an y unresolved adverse events ( AEs). If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent . Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced at t he discretion of the investigator upon consultation with the sponsor. 6.5.Guidelines for Monitoring and Discontinuations The following laboratory abnormalities require monitoring and re -testing ideall ywithin 3-5days, except as noted below when a shorter re -testing period is required : Absolute neutrophil counts <1.2 x 109/L (<1200/ mm3). Hemoglobin <9.0 g/dL ."

Creatinine and Cystatin C Serum creatinine is the best known standard test for monitoring renal function. However, serum creatinine based estimates of glomerular filtration rat e(eGFR) may be affected b y factors other than renal function, including chronic and acute illness. Cystatin C is a test that can be used either as an adjunct to or as a replacement for serum creatinine. The most reliable estimates of GFR use both test r esults.5 Cystatin C is a l ow molecular weight protein that is used as an alternative to serum creatinine for monitoring of renal function. It seems to correlate more closely with GFR than does serum creatinine concentration and may be a more sensitive detector of early renal dysfunction.6,7While use of cy statin C has been limited, its independence of demographic factors ( eg, race) has made it an interesting means of determining changes in renal function in clinical settings and it is included in the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Estimated GFR may be calculated via the 2012 CKD -EPI creatinine, cy statin C, or creatinine -cystatin C equations.8 Serum creatinine will be measure d and creatinine based eGFR will be calculated at times specified in theSchedule of Activities .Serum cy statin C will be measured and cy statin C based eGFR will be calculated at times specified in the Schedul e of Activities . 7.2.3. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Serum creatinine and serum cy statin -C based estimated GFR (eGFR) will be calculated at times specified inthe Schedule of activities , in order to facilitate calculation of eGFR at these time points. Corresponding serum creatinine and cystatin -C based eGFR will be determined to assess renal func tion. The estimated GFR (eGFR) will be calculated using the 2 sets of equations developed b y the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD -EPI), which utilize serum creatinine (SCr) and serum Cy statin C (S Cy statin C) respectivel y.9 7.2.4. Pregnancy Testing All pregnancy tests used in this study , either urine or serum, must have a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL and must be performed by a certified laboratory . For female subjects of childbearing potent ial, 2negative pregnancy tests are required before receiving investigational product (1negative pregnancy test at screening and 1at the baseline visit immediately before investigational product administration). Following a negative pregnancy test resul tat screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and the second negative pregnancy test result will then be required at t he baseline visit before the subject may receive the investigational product. In the absence of regular menstrual bleeding, the study candidate should have used 2 forms of contraception for at least 1 month before the second pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests will also be repeated at allvisits and at the end of the study to confirm that the subject has not become pregnant durin gthe study . Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cy cle is missed and when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspe cted, and may be repeated if requested by institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required b y local regulations.

Mantoux/ Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) Tuberculin Test Subjects may be screened for TB using the PPD Tuberculin Test per local guidelines. The test consists of an intracutaneous injection of 5 Tuberculi n Units (5 TU) PPD in 0.1 mL of solution on the volar aspect of the forearm, using a short beveled 26 -or 27 -gauge needle (Mantoux test). After the tuberculin test is administered, the test area will be evaluated b y a qualified healthcare professional, per local guidelines, 48 to 72 hours later. The test is positive if the induration diameter is ≥5mm at 48 to72hours post injection. To be eligible for this study , a negative test response is required during screening unless the test was performed and documented negative within 12 weeks prior to screening. If a subject had a CT scan of the chest (with or with out contrast) w ithin 12 weeks prior to screening, the CT scan results can substitute for chest radiograph results. Subjects with suspected false positive PPD results, eg, results from suspected BCG vaccination, should be further tested with an Interferon Gamma Release A ssay (IGRA) assay during screening. 7.2.6. Interferon Gamma Release Assay Tuberculin Test Subjects may be screened for TB using an IGRA per local guidelines. IGRA will be tested locally (where feasible) during screening or within 12 weeks prior to screening. Th e following are acceptable assay s: QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (QFT -G), QuantiFERON®-TB Gold I n-Tube test (QFT -GIT) and T -SPOT®TB test. Central lab used for the stud y ma y replace these tests with other acceptable QFT tests . Blood sampling may include 3 mLup to 10 mL of blood. Site personnel should follow the processing and analyses steps based on the assay chosen. Ensure incubation steps are followed as appropriate. An IGRA is preferred for subjects with a prior BCG vaccination, but may be used for any subject. Documentation of IGRA product used and the test result must be in the sub ject’s source documentation. If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may be repeated, and if a negative result is obtained, enrollment may proceed. A positiv etest on repeat is exclusionary . Subjects with repeat indeterminate IGRA results may be enrolled after a documented evaluation b y appropriately qualified personnel (which may include a pulmonary or infectious disease specialist, or locally acceptable exp ert as defined b y local guidelines) , to rule out the possibility of low risk of infection (ie, subject would be acceptable for immunosuppressant treatment without additional action). Subjects adequatel y treated (in the opinion of the appropriatel y qualifie dpersonnel -which may include a pulmonary or infectious disease specialist, or locally acceptable expert as defined b y local guidelines) for latent and/or active tuberculosis infection may be enrolled regardless of Mantoux or IGRA results provided the tr eatment is well documented in the subject’s medical records and/or source docume ntation prior to enrollment in the study ."

Refer to local lab for an y additional processing information and shipp ing instructions. 7.2.7. Screening for Clostridium Difficile C.difficile testing is per formed at screening (if not performed 6 weeks prior to screening) and during the stud y when there is a suspected disease flare or gastroenteritis. C.difficile infection in th ese settings requires treatment as determined b y the PI. Subjects with Clostrid ium difficile infection may be treated and re -tested or re -screened at the discretion of the Investigator. Highl y sensitive screening tests, with high negative predictive value ,should be employ ed in evaluating subjects for eligibility for the study . The detection of C.difficile by toxigenic stool culture (stool culture followed b y detection of toxin) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of the colonization or inf ection with pathogenic C. difficile . Comparable sensitivity may be achieved by direct testing of stool via point of use rapid membrane enzy me immunoassay card for both C. difficile toxin A and B and glutamate dehy drogenase (GDH) antigen on a card. Use of the card for point of care screening is encouraged where permitted by local reg ulation. Molecular techniques such as pol ymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of toxin RNA are also acceptable alternatives. Refer to the lab manual for further guidanc eand instruction for C.difficile screening. 7.2.8. Infections Subjects will be monito red for development of any infection ( viral, bacterial, and fungal). Infections will be classified as either treated or non -treated infections. All treated infections occurri ng during the study should be cultured if feasible and the results (eg, any identified organisms or absence of growth) recorded in the CRF. Treated infections are infections that: Require antimicrobial therap y by any route of administration or; Require an ysurgical intervention (eg, incision and drainage). Treated infections will be further classified as serious or non -serious. Serious infections are treated infections that: Require parenteral antimicrobial therap y and p resent with positive pre -treatment culture; AND EITHER Requir e hospitalization for treatment; OR"

A subject who experiences a serious infection should be discontinued from the study . A serious infection should be repo rted as a SAE and should be listed as the reason for discontinuation in the CRF. All serious infections occurring during the study should undergo appropriate laboratory investigations, including culture, and the results (eg, any identified organisms or ab sence of growth) be recorded in the CRF. Subjects who experience non-serious infections that require treatment may have their study drug temporaril y discontinued during treatment at the investigator’s discretion. Consultation with the Pfizer medical monit oris available. Temporary discontinuation of study drug should be r ecorded in the CRF. 7.2.10. Vital Signs (Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate, and Temperature) Single sitting blood pressure ( BP), pulse rate, and temperature will be measured at ti mes specified in the Schedule of Activities . Additional collection times or changes to collection times will be permitted, as necessary to ensure appropriate collection of safety data. Vital signs (including temperature) should be performed before laboratory blood collection and endoscopic procedure. Sitting blood pressure will be measured with the subject’s arm supported at the level of the heart, and recorded to the nearest mmHg. It is preferred that the same arm (preferabl y the dominant arm) be used throughout th e stud y. The same size BP cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be used to measure BP each time. The use of automated devices for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable, although, when done manual ly, pulse rate will be measured in t he brachial/radial artery for at least 30 seconds. When the timing of these measurements coincides with a blood collection, it is preferred that vital signs be obtained prior to the nominal time of blood collection. Itis preferred that body temperature be collected using t ympanic, oral, or axillary methods and that the same method be used consistently throughout the study . CCI"

When the timing of these mea surements coincides with a blood collection, the ECG should be obtained prior to the nominal time of the blood collection, BP, and pulse rate. To ensure safet y of the subjects, a qualified individual (eg, sub -investigator) at the investigator site will ma ke compar isons to baseline studies taken at screening. A cop y of the ECG should be available as source documents for review. ECGs will be read locall y during the dosing period. In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lea d placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings. If a machine -read QTc value is prolonged, repeat measurements may not be nec essary if a qualified phy sician’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable range. QTc prolongations are defined as a QTc ≥480msec or an absolute change in QTc >60 msec. 7.2.14. Chest Radiograph Chest x -ray (posterior -anterior and later al views are recommended however local guidelines should be followed) with no current evidence of untreated latent or active TB infection or evidence of currentl y active TB, general infections, heart failure or malignancy taken at screening or within the 1 2weeks prior to screening and read b y a qualified radiologist. If a subject had a CT scan of the chest (with or without I V contrast) within 12 week s prior to screening, the CT scan results can substitute for chest radiograph results. Documentation of the official reading must be located and available in the source documentation. 7.3.Diagnostic and Efficacy Assessments 7.3.1. Endoscopy Endoscopy (colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy) should be performed (during the screening period and preferabl y after all other eligibility criteria have been verified) within 10days of baseline, preferabl y 5to 7days prior to the baseline to allow tot al May o score calculation . The endoscopic subscore by the Central Reader must be available at the baseline visit. The assessment by the Central Reader will be used to derive the total May o score for study eligibility . The stool frequency , rectal bleedin g and centrall y-read endo scopic subscore sfor the endoscop y performed during the screening period and the PGA obtained at baseline will be used to determine eligibility . The endoscopic report and pathology report must be available in the source documents. Endoscopy is also perfo rmed during the W eek8and Week 32/earl y withdrawal visit where possible, but may be performed up to –7daysprior to the site visit if necessary . If it is necessary , a bowel prep should be conducted as per local routine.

Subject Stool Diary Subjects will use a diary in order to r ecord on a daily basis the following information during the study : ‘Normal’ number of stools per day (eg, pre -UC diagnosis/when not having a flare). This question will be asked only at the screening visit. Number of times needed to visit the toilet to ha ve a bowel movement (per day). Presence of blood in the stools (if any ). Description o f blood in the stools (if an y), ONLY if presence is noted. In order to encourage consistent diary recording, subjects should enter diary data continuously throughout the study . Instructions for completing the diary will be provided to subjects at screenin g and reviewed at subsequent visits. 7.3.3. Mayo Score The May o Score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for UC. The May o scoring system ranges from 0 to 12 points and consists of 4 subscores, each graded 0 to 3with the higher score indicating more severe disease activity (See Appendix 4). Stool frequency (Subscore 0 -3). Rectal bleeding (Subscore 0 -3). Findings on endosco py (Subscore 0 -3). Physician’s global assessment (Subscore 0 -3). Calculation of the May o Score requires an assessment of the subject’s stool frequency and any amount of blood in the stool. The May o scores will be calculated based on the subject’s stool di ary recorded over 3consecutive day s prior to the visit (for visits where endoscop y is not done) or endoscopy bowel preparation procedure (for visits where endoscopy is done ie,Screening, Week 8, Week 32/ET) . Investigator sites will be trained on the dia ry usage and will t rain subjects on use of the diary. Diary data entered by the subject will be reviewed by the site at each visit. If there are missing stool diary data, the average will be taken from the 3 most recentl y available day s reported within 5 days prior to the endoscop y preparation (for visits where endoscop y is done ie ,Screening, Week 8, Week 32/ET) or 5days prior to the visit (for visits where endoscop y is not done) for calculation of May o score."

In this case, stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores will be considered as missing. Note that if there is 1 day of diary data or no diary data recorded prior to the baseline endoscop y preparation, then the patient cannot be randomized into the study . Values used for May o score calculation should exclude any day when a bowel prep or endoscop y is performed . The endoscopic appearance will be read b y the Central Reader. The phy sician’s global assessment (PGA) acknowledges the other three criteria, the subject’s abdominal discomfort and sense of general well -being. In addition, the investigator should consider other observations ( eg, phy sical findings) and subject’s perfo rmance status when making the PGA assessment. In consequence, the PGA should be recorded after all other components of the May o score and relevant interval medical history and phy sical examination have been completed. The PGA assessment should take into account the centrall y read endosc opy score at baseline, Week 8, and Week 32/earl y withdrawal visits, however the locall y read endoscop y score is an acceptable alternative at Week 8 and Week 32/earl y withdrawal visits when the endoscopic subscore b y the Cen tral Reader are not available pri or to the conduct of the Week 8 or Week 32/ET PGA collection timepoint. It is preferred that the same phy sician performs all such assessment for a given subject throughout the study . The May o score at the screening visit must be ≥6with an endoscopic subscore of ≥2and rectal bleeding subscore ≥1and meet all other eligibility criteria to be eligible for the study . The duration of the time between the May o endoscopic subscore assessment and baseline should not exceed 10 days. Endpoints based on the total Mayo scores are defined below: Remission: total May o score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 and excluding an y friability . Clinical response: decrease from ba seline in total Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompany ing decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point or absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1. Deep remission: total Mayo score of 2 points or low er, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a 0 on both endoscopic and rectal bleeding subscore . Symptomatic remission: total May o score o f 2points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point, and both rectal bleeding and stool freq uency subscores of0."

Parti al Mayo Score A partial May o Score (May o Score without endoscopic subscore, ranging from 0 to 9) will be assessed at the times specified in the Schedule of Activities . On dosing days, the partial Mayo Score should be assessed prior to administration of investigational product. Response based on change in partial Mayo score is defined a s a decrease from baseline of at least 2points, while remission is defined as an absolute value of partial May o score <2 points with no individual subscore >1.10 7.3.6. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) for Health Outcomes Assessment Patient reported outcomes (PRO) asse ssments are self -administered during the study . Refer to Appendix 10for Altern ative Measures During Public Emergencies if applicable. It is important to note that the PRO measurements are collected and evaluated in a different manner than the observed or volun teered adverse events. Given those differences, no attempt will be made t o resolve any apparent discrepancies between observed or volunteered adverse events and PRO data collected from subjects. Adverse event incidence r ates will not be calculated from t hese solicited data but rather from the information recorded on the AE pag es on the CRF. The following PROs will be completed as specified in the Schedule of Activities. Subjects should be encourag ed to complete the PROs at the clinic at the beginning of the study visit prior to an y clinical assessments.

Inflammatory Bowel Disea se Questionnaire (IBDQ) IBDQ is a psy chometrically validated PRO instrume nt for measuring the disease -specific quality of life in subjects with IBD, including UC. The IBDQ is comprise d of32-items, which are grouped into 4dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, sy stemic sy mptoms and social function.11The 4 domains are scored as follows: Bowel s ymptoms: 10 to 70 . Systemic s ymptoms: 5 to 35 . Emotional function: 12 to 84 . Social function: 5 to 35. The total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224. For the total score and each domain, a higher score indicates better quality of life. A score of at least 170 corresponds to clinical remission and an increase of at least 16 points is considered to i ndicate a clinicall y meaningful improvement.11,12See Appendix 5. 7.3.6.2. Short Form – 36, Version 2, Acute (SF -36) The SF -36 v2 Acute is a psychometricall y valid and reliable health status questionnaire that assesses 8 domains of functional health and well- being: Physical Functioning, Role Limitations due to Phy sical Health Problems, Bodily Pain, Social Functioning, Mental Health, Role L imitations due to Emotional Problems, Vitality , and General Health Perceptions. A phy sical health component summary score (PCS) and mental health component summary score (MCS) are calculated from the 8 domain scores. The acute for m uses a recall period of one week. Higher scores indicate a better health- related quality of life. See Appendix 6. 7.3.6.3. Euro Quality of Life Questionnaire 5Dimensions 3 Levels and Visual Analog Scale (EQ -5D-3L & VAS) The EQ -5D3L and EQ -5D VAS is a patient completed questionnaire designed to assess impact on health rel ated quality of life in five domains: mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression. Additionally , scores from the five domains may be used to calculate a single index value , also known as a utility score. The validity and reliability of the EQ -5D- 3L has been established in a number of disease states, including UC.13The EQ-5D/VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).

Events listed in t hetable above that require reporting to Pfizer Safet y on the CT SAE Report Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator are t o be reported regardless of whether the event is determined by the investigator to be related to an investigat ional product under study . In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Pfizer Safety must be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available event information. This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on previously forwarded reports. I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become immediately aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the tim e of his/her first awareness of the event. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcom e and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (see the Serious Adverse Events section below). In addition, the investigator may be requested b y Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. CCI"

In general, this will include a descripti on of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causalit y. An y information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. I n the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, C RF, laboratory data) are to be sent to Pfizer Safet y ONLY upon request. As part of ongoing safet y reviews co nducted by the sponsor, any non-serious AE that is determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by the sponsor as an SAE. To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study . 8.1.1. Additional Details on Recordin g Adverse Events on the CRF All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. I t should be noted that the CT SA E Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same dat a are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information. 8.1.2. Eliciting Advers e Event Information The investig ator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported b y the stud y subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner. 8.1.3. Withdra wal From the Study Due to Advers e Events (see also the Subject Withdrawal section) Withdrawal due to AEs sh ould be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the d efinition of AE noted below, an d recorded on the CRF. When a subject withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the Requirements section above. 8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each subject begin s from the time the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained before the subject’s p articipation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar day safter the last administration of the investigational product."

Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a subject durin g the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form. SAEs oc curring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a mini mum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to inve stigational product must be reported to Pfizer Safety . Follow up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the ev ent or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.4.2. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF During the active collection period, both non -serious AEs and SAEs are r ecorded on th e CRF. Follow -up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.5. Causality Assessment The investigator’s assessment of causalit y mu st be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal r elationship on the CRF, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. An investigator’s causalit yassessment i s the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational p roduct caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be h andled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor. If the investigator's causality assessment is “un known but not related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study records. In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in th e source docu ments and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements. 8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities AE reporting, including suspected unexpected s erious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations."

Adverse Events An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include, but are not li mited to: Abnormal test findings; Clinically significant signs and sy mptoms; Changes in ph ysical examination findings; Hypersensitivity ; Progressio n/worsening of underl ying disease; Drug abuse; Drug dependency . Additionally , AEs may include signs and s ymptoms resulting from: Drug overdose; Drug withdrawal; Drug misuse; Drug interactions; Extravasation; Exposure during pregnancy (EDP); Exposure via b reastfeeding; Medication error; Occupational exposure. 8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings Abnormal objective test findin gs should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following conditions are met: Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or"
146,page_146,"PF-06651600, PF -06700841 B7981005 Final Protocol Amendment 7, 18November 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 147Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or Test result leads to a chan ge in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant drug t reatment, or other therapy ; and/or Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor. Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. An y abnormal test resul t that is determin ed to be an error does not require recording as an AE. 8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization o r prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (subs tantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect. Or that is considered to be: An imp ortant medical event. Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an imp ortant medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospi talization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the o ther AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatm ent in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a h ospital or equivalent healthcare facility , or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric wing to a medical floor, med ical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessaril y consti tute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for medical importance."

Hospitalization or p rolongation of hospitalizat ion in the absence of a precipitating clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisti ng condition (eg, for worku p of a persistent pretreatment laboratory abnormality ); Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep) ; Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination); Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the s tudy protocol); Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective cosmeti c surgery ); Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE; Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures. These s hould be noted in the baseli ne documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject . Diagnostic and therapeutic nonin vasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not be reported as SAEs. However, the medical condition for whi ch the procedure was perform ed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of th e AE."

For purposes of consistency , these intensity grade s are defined as follows: MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function. MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usu al function. SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function. Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE . A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantl y with the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria f or SAEs, listed above. 8.4.Special Situat ions 8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study . All SAEs will be reported to Pfizer Safety by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled a s SAEs in the safet y database. 8.4.2. Poten tial Cases of Drug -Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determ ined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are ""susceptible"" to progressive and serious liver injury , commonly referred to as drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Subjec ts who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal ( ×ULN) should be monitor ed more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransfera se (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by seve ral days or weeks. The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be e levated within the same lab sample). In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnorm al elevations in either AST OR AL T in additio n to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criter ia) cases and should alway s be considered important medical events, even before all other possible caus es of liver injury have been excluded."

Subjects who present with the following laboratory abnormalities shou ld be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value >2×ULN with no evid ence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2×ULN or not available; For subjects with baseline AS T OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition menti oned above, as needed, depending on which val ues are above the ULN at baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is smaller). Preexisting valu es of TBili above the normal range: TBili lev el increased from baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches >3×ULN (whicheve r is smaller). Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case wh ere uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sp onsor. The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the ab normal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements o f AST and AL T and TBili, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), to tal bile acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contem poraneous analyses at the time of the rec ognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, s uch as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or ov er-the-counter medications) , recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history , sexual history , travel history , history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and poten tial occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted."

Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availab ility of all the results of the investiga tions performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology . 8.4.3. Potential Cases of Decreased eGFR In the PF -06700841 FIH study B7931001, serum creatinine elevation was reported across dose levels in both healthy volunteers and psoriasis patients. The proposed mechanism for the observed serum cre atinine increases in study B7931001 is inhibition of creatinine transport in the kidney (ie, transporter -mediated rather than direct nephrotoxicity )(See Section 1.4.2.1.2 ). All subjects will h ave serum creatinine based and serum cy statin -C based eGFR calculated at times specified in the Schedule of Activities .Abnor mal values in serum cre atinine concurrent with absence of increase in blood urea nitrogen ( BUN )that meet th e below criteria, in the absence of other causes of kidney injury , are considered important medical events. Based on these measurements, estimated GFR using serum creatin ine (2009 CKD -EPI eGFR14) and serum cy statin C (2012 CDK -EPI eGFR8) will be determined at the time of elevation in serum creatinine above ULN. If an individual subject demonstrates a CONCOMITANT serum creatinine based AND serum cystatin C based eGFR decline of ≥30% compared to the subject’s baseline eGFR, then the subject should not be further dosed and adequate, immediate, supportive measures including immediate evaluation b y a nephrologist (preferabl y within 24 hours) with appropriate management . If the s ubject cannot be seen b y a nephrologist within 24 hours, then the subject should be sent to a local emergency room for assessment of renal function. Results should be repeated as indicated b y the nephrologist or weekly at a minimum until the eGFR returns to baseline ±15% or the renal parameters are deemed to be stable b y the nephrologist and/or PI. eGFR results will be communicated to the treating phy sician. Subjects should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferabl y within 24to48hours from awareness of the abnormal eGFR (CONCOMITANT serum creatinine based AND serum cy statin C based eGFR decline of ≥30% compared to the subject’s baseline eGFR) result for a safet y follow -up visit. This evaluation should include labora tory tests, detailed history , and ph ysical assessment. I n addition to repeating serum creatinine and serum cy statin C, laboratory tests should also include: serum BUN, serum CK, serum electrol ytes (including at a minimum potassium, sodium, p hosphate/phosp horus, calcium), in addition to urine dipstick, urine microscopic examination, and urinary indices. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the above pre -set laboratory criteria, with no other cause(s) of laboratory abnormalities id entified shoul d be considered as important"

All relevant test results will be forwarded to Pfizer immediat elyby the PI. This requirement applies to all subjects, all cohorts. 8.4.4. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupati onal exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.4.4.1. Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if: A female becomes, or is foun d to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigat ional product : An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products). Amale has been exposed (eg , because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy . If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the sub ject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safety using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy ). Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safet y of the outcome a s a follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should b e specified and, if clinic ally possible, the structural"
152,page_152,"PF-06651600, PF -06700841 B7981005 Final Protocol Amendment 7, 18November 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 153integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). If the outco me of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should fo llow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safet y as SAEs follows: Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion; Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth s hould be reported, without regard to causality , as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the invest igational product. Additio nal information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case -by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provid e to his partner. 8.4.4.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, usi ng the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.4.4.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professi onal or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether ther e is an associated SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator s ite file."

Medication Errors Other exposures to the investigational product under study may occur in clinical trial settings, such as medication errors. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness Medication erro rs All (regardless of whether associated with an AE)Only if associated with an SAE 8.4.5.1. Medication Errors Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the investigational product b y the wrong subje ct, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Medication errors include : Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product; Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participating sub ject. Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page. In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately . Whe ther or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non-serious, are recorded on an AE p age of the CRF. Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report Form only when associated with an SAE . 9.DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS Detailed methodology for summary and stat istical anal yses of the data collect ed in this study is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical anal ysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary and/or secondary endpoint definitions or their anal yses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. The information from the two placebo arms in the induction stage will be combined for the statistical analy sis. It will be further combined with the hist oricaldatabase using Bay esian statistical methodology . The historic alstudy data base will include the data obtained from Phase 3tofacitinib trials available to the Sponsor. The integration details and historical d ata"

The integration with historical data will involve application of statistical procedures attempting maximization of the commensurability between the current trial and the subgroup of the historical data used for synthesizing the prior distributio n. 9.1.Sample Size Determination The primary endpoint for the study is based on total May o score at Week 8. The study is powered for the induction stage. The study will enroll approximately 318subject s with the expecte d number of completers of 286assuming an estimated drop out rate of ~ 10%. The table below represents the approximate number of expected completers per arm in the induction phase: PF-06651600 Pla ceboPF-06651600 200mgPF-06651600 70 mgPF-06651600 2 0mgPF-06700841 P laceboPF-06700841 60 mgPF-06700841 30 mgPF-06700841 10 mg 11 44 44 44 11 44 44 44 For induction phase analysis purposes, the combined placebo group is thus expected to have approximately 22completers. Using a between -group comparison at Week 8 (end of induction), assuming es timated standard deviation of the total May o score equal to 3, Type1 error =10% (2-sided )) and assuming a true difference between drug and placeb o to be 2.1, planned sample size of 44completers in the active and 2 2completers in the placebo will provide 84.3% power. The delta of 2.1 is based on what has been seen in Tofacitinib Phase 3studies for this endpoint . 9.2.Efficacy Analysis 9.2.1. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint During Induction Period Primary efficacy anal ysis will be conducted based on total May o score at Week 8. The primary analysisat Week 8 will be based on constrained Longitudin al Data Anal ysis (cLDA) model15,16using Total May o score. The constraint in cL DA is that the expec ted baseline values of Total May o score are identical in all of the treatment groups as a result of randomization. The model will include baseline and week 8 values of the Total May o Score as the r esponse vector. The model will include treatment ( 6 activ e dose and pooled placebo), visit (baseline and Week 8) and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects .An unstructured variance -covariance matrix will be all owed. Other statistical analy sis methods will include fitting bayesian emax model for dose -response estimation after conducting Bayesian predictive checks on monotonicity .The Bayesian emax model will estimate the dose response a nd will be supportive tothe primary anal ysis. The primary anal ysis will be conducted on the intention -to-treat (ITT ) population , defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of investigational product or placebo . Sensitivity analy sis handling of the missin g values (including subjects who are missing due to COVI D-19) will be outlined in the SAP."

Analysis of Secondary Endpoints During Induction Period Analy sis of the secondary endpoints, including the endpoints coll ected during the 24 week chronic dosing period, will be outlined in the SAP. For the binar yendpoints such as remission , improvement in endoscopic appearance, and so on, missing data will be treated as non-responders and therisk difference sbetween treat ment and placebo will be computed along with exact confidence intervals . Continuous and discrete modelling techniques will be applied wh enever applicable. The statistical summaries will be presented by dose groups. The correlations between the endpoints will be analy zed. 9.2.3. Analysis of Sec ondary Endpoints During Chronic Period Total Mayo score at Week 32is one of the secondary endpoint dur ing the chronic period . The anal ysis model will be similar to the primary anal ysis using cLDA . The model will inc lude treatment (active dose sand p lacebo), visit (baseline, Week 8 and Week32) and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects . An unst ructured variance - covariance matrix will be allowed. This model will not include the data from the chronic period f or the subjects assigned to placebo during this period. For the remaining secondary endpoints ofRemission and ,improvement in endoscopic a ppearance , missing data will be treated as non -responders and andthe risk differen ces between treatment and placebo will be computed along with exact CI .Additional details will be described in the SAP. 9.3.Analysis of Other Endpoints During Induction and Ch ronic Period Analy sis of other endpoints will be conducted as dee med appropriate. Continuous and discrete modelling techniques will be applied whenever applicable. Distribution summaries will be presented b y means of summary tables and data visualization methods. 9.3.1. Pharmacokinetic Analysis During Induction and Chronic P eriod The PK conce ntration population is defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of PF -06651600 or PF -06700841 and in whom at least one concentration value is reported . PK concentrations will be summarized and presented with summary statistics and, i f appropriate, non -compartmental PK parameter estimates will be provided. A population PK model may be developed for the purpose of estimating PK parameters. Any populatio n PK model developed to characterize the PK data will be reported separatel y. Data permitting, the relationship between exposure and clinical responses (efficacy ,safet y and pharmacod ynamic ) from the 8 week induction period of treatment in subjects with moderate to severe active UC may be explored using either observed or modeled exposur es. Similar analy ses may be conducted with data collected from the chronic dosing period . Any population analy ses conducted will not be part of the clinical study report ( CSR) and may be reported separatel y."

PK/PD Unblinding Plan A PK/P D unblinding plan approved b y the clinical lead, clinical pharmacology lead and statistical lead will be in place to describe the procedures to be employ ed in safeguarding the study blind for members of the study team. These procedures will be in accordan ce with applicable Pfizer SOPs for releasing randomization codes and breaking the study blind. Under this plan a group of statisticians, PK/PD data provider, PK/PD anal yst and PK/PD support would be unblinded in order to initiate the building of statistical models of the P K, dose/response as well as exposure/response analy sis models and conduct associated simulations. The aim of this work would be to facilitate a fuller interpretation of the study upon completion (at appropriate interim milestone ). This group will not ser ve on the study team during the period of earl y unblinding. The unblinding may occur after the last subject has been randomized. The details of the procedures will be desc ribed in the PK/PD Unblinding Plan for Modelling and Sim ulation for study B7981005 which will be finalized prior to the start of the PK/PD unblinding. 9.3.3. Biomarkers Unblinding Plan In order to expedite the analy ses of the biomarkers, an unblinded team may review the biomarker data (including exploratory biomarkers) [excluding any biomarker data that is or contributes to a primary endpoint] and exposure data on an ongoing basis. This group will minimally be comprised of a bioanal yst and statistician, but may also include clinicians/precision m edicine personnel, clinical pharmacologist and P K/PD anal yst/support staff. This group will be unblinded when needed in order to conduct the analy ses of the biomarkers in accordance with a biomarker data analy sis plan, a nd will be independent of the study team. This unblinding process will be in accor dance with Pfizer SOPs related to Releasing Randomization Codes and Breaking the Blind and will not have any impact on the conduct of the stud y. The biomarker plan, approve d by the clinical lead, clinical pharmacology lead and statistical lead, will be in place to describe the procedures to be employ ed in safeguarding the study blind for members of the study team. The biomarker plan will outline the range of possible anal yses and provide details of the decis ion-making process regarding unblinding. 9.4.Safety Analysis During the Induction and Chronic Period All clinical AEs, SAEs, TEAEs, withdrawal due to AEs, ECGs, vital signs and safet y laboratory data will be reviewed and summ arized on an ongoing basis during t he stud y to evaluate the safet y of subjects. The safet y analysis set will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of IP. Safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format for both the ind uction and chronic period and summa rized descriptivel y, where appropriate. All saf ety endpoints will be listed and summarized in accordance with Pfizer Data Standards. Categorical outcomes (eg,AEs) will be summarized by subject counts and percentage. C ontinuous outcome (eg,BP, heart ra te, etc) will be summarized using N, mean, media n, standard deviation, etc. Change from baseline in laboratory data, ECGs and vital signs will also be summarized. Subject listings will be produced for these safet y endpo ints accordingl y."

Interim Analysis At least one interim analys is for futility may be performed. The final number and timing of the IA(s) will be defined by the Sponsor, but a preliminarily one may be conducted approximately 6month safter the randomization of the first subject and/or aft er at least 50% of the planned subjects, ie, app roximately 160subjects, have completed the 8 week induction period . Anactive arm may be stopped for futility if the posterior probability of the given active arm being be tter than the placebo is less than 20%. Further details related to the i nterim ana lysis will be outlined in the SAP. 9.6.Data Monitoring Committee This stud y will use an external data m onitoring c ommittee (E -DMC ). The E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the efficacy and safet y of subjects in the study according to the charter. The E -DMC will review accumulating renal safet y data and propose changes to the protocol as needed to ensure subject safet y. The recommendations made by the E- DMC toalter the conduct of the stud y will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision. Pfizer will for ward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safety data thatare not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. Additional information can be obtained in the E -DMC charter. 10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during stud y conduct to ensur e that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents toconfirm that the data recorded on CRFs areaccurate. The investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perfor m this verifi cation. This verification may also occur after study completion. CCI"

The investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of an y regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study .Furthermore, th e investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the stud y data and the subject's medical records. The investigator will promptl y provide copies of the inspection findings t o Pfizer or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authoritie s, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. It is important that the investigator(s) and t heir relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING 11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record As used in this protocol, th e term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electroni c data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study . A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The completed original C RFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any for m to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer . The investigator shall ensure that the CRFs are securel y stored at the study site in encrypted electronic an d/orpaper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access b y unauthorized third parties. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safet y,and laboratory data entered on th e CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring th at they are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring ,and available when req uired. The CRFs must be signed b ythe investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs aretrue. Any correcti ons to entries made in the CRFs orsource documents m ust be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necess ary) and should not obscure the original entry . In most cases, the source documents are the hospital or the ph ysician subject chart. In these cases ,data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts."

In these ca ses, a document should be available at the investigator site andat Pfizer that clearl y identifies those data that will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will st and as the source document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or inspectio ns/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to lin k records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents , copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence ( eg,letters, me eting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be re tained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines , according to local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer . The investigator m ust ensure that the records continue to be stored securel y for so lon g as they are retained. If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer sh ould be prospe ctivel y notified. The study records must be transferred to a designe e acceptable to Pfizer , such as another investigator, another institution, or an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if requ ired by applicable local regulations. The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, even if retention requirements have been me t. 12.ETHICS 12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents , and other relevant documents, eg,recruitment advertisem ents, if appli cable, from the I RB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator f ile. Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing im mediately after the implementation."

Use of these alternative study measures are expected to cease upon the return of business as usual circumstances (including the lifting of an y quarantines and travel bans/advisories). All procedures should be performed per protocol Schedule of Activities to monitor the safet y of the partcipant . If the spon sor d etermines that the impact of COVID -19 on protocol visits and procedures and associated timeframe needs to be reported on a CRF, this will be requested. In situations where participants are quarantined, self -isolating or unable to visit the study site, theparticipant verbal consent must be documented in the site’s source documents prior to performing an y protocol procedures or shipping stu dy intervention. Appendix 10.1. Eligibility Not Applicable . Appendix 10.2. TeleHealth Visits In the event that in -clinic study visits cannot be conducted, every effort should be made to follow up on the safet y of study participants at scheduled visits per the Schedule of Activities or unscheduled visits. Telehealth visits m ay be used to continue to assess participant safet y and collect data points , (ifpermitted b y law or local guidance ). Telehealth includes the exchange of healthcare information and services v ia telecommunication technologies (eg, audio, video, video -confe rencing software) remotel y, allowing the participa nt and the investigator to communicate on aspects of clinical care, including medical advice, reminders, education, and safet y monitoring. The following assessments must be performed during a telehealth vi sit. Review and record an y AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to Section 8. Review and record an y new concomitant medicat ions or changes in concomitant medications since the last contact. Review and record contraceptive method and re sults of pregnancy testing.

Appendix 10.3. Alternative Facilities for Safety Assessments Appendix 10.3.1. Laboratory Testing If a stud y parti cipant is unable to visit the site for protocol -specified safety laboratory evaluations, testing may be conducted at a local laboratory if permitted by local regulation s. The local laboratory may be a standalone institution or within a hospital. The foll owing safet y laboratory evaluations may be performed at a local laboratory : See SoA. If a local laboratory is used, qualified study site personn el must order, receive, and review results. Site staff must collect the local laboratory reference ranges and certifications/accreditations for filing at the site. Laboratory test results are to be provided to the site staff as soon as possible. The loc al laboratory reports should be filed in the participant’s source documents/medical recor ds. Relevant data from t he local laboratory report should be recorded on the CRF. If a participant requiring pregnancy testing cannot visit a local laboratory for pr egnancy testing, a home urine pregnancy testing kit with a sensitivity of at least 25 IU/mL may be used by the par ticipant to perform the test at home, if compliant with local regulatory requirements. The pregnancy test outcome should be documented in the participant’s source documents/medical records and relevant data recorded on the CRF. Confirm that the participa nt is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. Appendix 10.4. Investigational Product If the safet y of a trial participant is at ris k because they cannot complete required evaluations or adhere to critical mitigation steps, then discontinuing tha t participant from study intervention (investigational product) must be considered. Investigati onal product may be shipped by courier to stud y participants if permitted by local regulations and in accordance with storage and transportation requirements fo r the investigational product . Pfizer does not permit the shipment of investigational product by mail. The tracking record of shipmen ts and the chain of custod y of investigational product must be kept in the participant’s source documents/medical records . Appendix 10.5. Home Health Visits A home health care service may be utilized to facilitate scheduled visits p er the Schedule of Activities . Home health visits include a healthcare provider conducting an in -person study visit at the participant’ s location, rather than an in -person stud y visit at the site. The following may be performed dur ing a home health visit: See SoA."

If the study participant does not understa nd, the site staff should repeat the question and response choices verbatim and ask the participan t to select the response that they feel best represents his/her experience . Encourage the study participant to answer based on his/her first instincts and remind the study participant that there are no right or wrong answers. If needed, use a prompt such as “Which answer most closel y matches what you are thinking or feeling?” Confirm the study participant’s response selection before you record the answer (eg,you would like me to select “moderate pain,” is that right? Indicate that the PCOA was administere d via telehealth . For the telehealth adminis tration of a paper PCOA, indicate this on the participant worksheet (ie, the participant facing source document). Include the name of the site staff administering the PCOA and confirm that the study participant was the one to answer the questions . For PCO As that are collected via telehealth ,the PCOA CRF must be completed. Document the administration and completion date in the CRF ."
