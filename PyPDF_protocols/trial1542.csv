Current treatments, utilizing nonspecific inhibitors of inflammation (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], colchicine, corticosteroids [CS]), result in significant morbidity with chronic use. Some patients develop CS dependency or require surgical pericardiectomy to treat the symptoms of their disease. The interleukin -1 (IL -1) pathway plays a major role in the pathophysiology of recurrent pericarditis. Rilonacept (KPL -914) is a recombinant fusion protein that blocks IL -1 signaling. It is currently approved for treatment of another autoinflammatory condition, Cryopyrin -Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS). Based on its IL-1–antagonistic properties and pharm acokinetics (PK), which allow for once -weekly subcutaneous (SC) injections, it is reasonable to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rilonacept in subjects with recurrent pericarditis to address the unmet need in treatment of this disease. Study Objectives: Primary: To assess the efficacy of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. Secondary: To assess the safety of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis."

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 14 Page 15 Study Population: Subjects eligible for the study are subjects with recurrent pericarditis who do not have pericarditis secondary to prohibited conditions. The study population includes both adult subjects ≥18 years old and pediatric subjects ≥12 and <18 years old with a history of at least 2 prior pericarditis episodes (including the first episode and 1 recurr ence). Enrollment of pediatric subjects will be limited to up to 20% of the study population. To be eligible for the study, subjects must present at screening with at least a third pericarditis episode, defined as at least 1 day with pericarditis pain meas urement ≥4 on the 11 -point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and C -reactive protein (CRP) value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) within 7 days prior to first study drug administration. Subjects included in the study may be receiving concomitant NSAIDs and/or colchicine and/or oral CS treatment in any combination, provided that the dosages of these medications have been stable (or not increased) for at least 3 days prior to first administration of study drug, and that chan ges in medications made within this time period (for instance, 1 -time use of NSAIDs) are not anticipated by the investigator to significantly alter assessments of baseline disease activity. Study Design: This study has 5 periods: (1) Screening period , during which assessment of disease characteristics, baseline therapy, and the pre-treatment workup is completed (up to 4 weeks) (2) Single -blind Run-In (RI) period (12 weeks), during which blinded rilonacept is administered SC once weekly in all subjects. The RI period includes the following: • 1-week Stabilization period, during which blinded rilonacept is administered in addition to standard of care (SOC) pericarditis therapy and the ongoing pericarditis episode is treated • 9-week Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues • 2-week Monotherapy period during which subjects who have successfully weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy will continue to receive blinded rilonacept In the single -blind RI period (subjects are blinded regarding the time of transition from the single -blind to the double -blind period), adult subjects ≥18 years old will receive rilonacept as an initial loading dose of 320 mg (2 SC injections of 160 mg each) at the RI baseline visit (2 × 2 ml), followed by a 160 mg (2 ml) SC dose once weekly throughout the RI period. Pediatric subjects (≥12 and <18 years old) will receive an initial loading dose of rilonacept 4.4 mg/kg (2 SC injections of 2.2 mg/kg each) at the RI baseline visit (maximum 2 × 2 ml), and then 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 2 ml) SC once weekly throughout RI period. Subjects who stopped background SOC pericarditis therapy and who a chieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12, defined as the weekly average of daily pericarditis pain score ≤2.0 on the 11 -point NRS within the 7 days prior to and including the day of randomization on RI Week 12/Randomization Withdrawal (RW) baseline and a CRP level ≤0.5 mg/dL at the RI Week 12/RW baseline visit, will proceed into the double -blind placebo -controlled RW period.

(3) Double -blind placebo -controlled RW period (pericarditis recurrence event -driven duration, with a minimum of 24 weeks), during which subjects who were able to stop background SOC pericarditis therapy and who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12/RW baseline are randomized in a double -blind manner at a 1:1 ratio to the following: • Rilonacept 160 mg (2.2 mg/kg in pediatric subjects) SC injections once weekly • Matching placebo SC injections once weekly Pericard itis Recurrence in the RW Period Pericarditis recurrence is defined as the recurrence of typical pericarditis pain associated with supportive objective evidence of pericarditis. Upon pericarditis recurrence, subjects who report at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11 -point NRS and have 1 CRP value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) will receive bailout rilonacept (2 open -label injections of 160 mg rilonacept [or 4.4 mg/kg for pediatric subjec ts] followed by once-weekly open -label rilonacept SC injections of 160 mg [or 2.2 mg/kg for pediatric subjects]). irrespective of randomized treatment assignment and as soon as at least 5 days have passed since the last study drug injection. Sequential Ora l Rescue Therapy (ORT), i.e., analgesics first, then NSAIDs, and then colchicine, can be added if needed at the discretion of the investigator, as outlined in the protocol and Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence and who do not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept will continue blinded study drug until the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept are met or through the end of the RW period. For those subjects, sequential ORT can be added to blinded study drug at the discr etion of the investigator, as outlined in the protocol and Pharmacy Manual. All suspected pericarditis recurrence events in the RW period will be formally adjudicated by the Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC), and only events that are confirmed by the CEC as pericarditis recurrences will be used in the Primary Endpoint analysis. (4) Long Term Extension Treatment Period (LTE -TP) (24 weeks), during which all subjects completing the RW period (including subjects transitioned to open -label rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence) will have an option to receive up to 24 weeks of open -label rilonacept 160 mg (or 2.2 mg/kg for pediatric subjects) SC injections once weekly based on their clinical status and at the discretion of the investigator, after signing L TE informed consent. Any subject who, in the opinion of investigator, should not continue open -label rilonacept will be offered participation in the LTE off study drug and after signing LTE informed consent.

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 17 Page 18 Investigational Medicinal Product, Dosage, and Route of Administration: Rilonacept (KPL -914) is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domains of human IL-1 cytokine receptor and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). It acts as a soluble decoy receptor binding IL-1α/IL -1β and prevents their interaction with the IL-1 cell-surface receptor. Study drug (rilonacept or placebo) is supplied in a single use, 20 ml glass vial containing a sterile, white to off -white, lyophilized powder. Each vial is to be reconstituted with 2.3 ml sterile Water for Injection (WFI). A volume up to 2 ml can be withdrawn, which is designated to deliver up to 160 mg of rilonacept or up to 2 ml of placebo for SC injection only. The resulting solution is clear, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free of particulates. Each rilonacept vial contains 220 mg of rilonacept lyophilized powder. After reconstitution with 2.3 ml WFI, the rilonacept vial contains 80 mg/ml rilonacept, 40 mM histidine, 50 mM arginine, 3.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 2.0% (w/v) sucrose, and 1.0% (w/v) glycine at a pH of 6.5. No preservatives are present. The first injection of rilonacept loading dose at the RI baseline visit will be administered at the study site by study site staff. The second injection of rilonacept loading dose at the RI baseline visit will be prepared and administered by the subject or the subject’s caregiver after adequate training and under the supervision of study site personnel. Subsequent once -weekly study drug doses will be self -administered SC by the subject or administered to the subject by a trained caregiver as an outpatient SC administration. Sample Size: Approximately 56 subjects (not to exceed 75 subjects) with recurrent pericarditis will be enrolled, which will allow approximately 50 subjects to be randomly assigned to blinded treatment. Statistical Methods: The primary efficacy endpoint is time to pericarditis recurrence, defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first pericarditis recurrence for each subject. Only CEC -confirmed pericarditis recurrence will be considered as an event for the primary efficacy analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be done based on the investigator’s assessment of the pericarditis recurrence. In order to control the overall 1 -sided type I error rate at the 0.025 l evel, a gatekeeping procedure in combination with Hochberg’s procedure will be applied to testing the primary and major secondary efficacy endpoints. Major secondary efficacy endpoints for the RW period include: • Proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 24 of the RW period • Percentage of days with no or minimal pain (pain ≤1 on the 11-point NRS) in the first 24 weeks of the RW period • Proportion of subjects with absent or minimal pericarditis symptoms (based on the 7-point rating scale of PGIPS) at Week 24 of the RW period Other secondary efficacy endpoints for the RW period include: • Proportion of subjects without pericarditis recurrence in the first 24 weeks of the RW period • Time to pericarditis pain NRS ≥4"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 1 Introduction Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the double -walled sac surrounding the heart. Etiologies of pericarditis include infectious causes (viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic) and non- infectious causes (idiopathic, autoimmune, neoplastic, metabolic, traumatic, post -surgical, and drug- related) (Adler et al 2015). In 80% of cases in developed countries, the cause of pericarditis is either post-viral or “idiopathic” in that it cannot be attributed to a specific condition (Imazio et al 2010; Zayas et al 1995). The underlying pathog enesis of recurrent pericarditis remains unclear, although a growing body of evidence suggests that abnormal immune responses play a role in the pathogenic processes. While the adaptive immune system plays a role in autoimmune disorders that manifest with pericarditis as one of the many organ systems involved (such as in systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis), the innate immune system, including interleukin 1 (IL -1) signaling, is often the major effector in autoinflammatory disorders, such as isolated pericarditis (Baskar et al 2016; Brucato et al 2016; Imazio et al 2016, Dinarello et al 2012). Diagnosis of pericarditis is based on the presence of typical chest pain (improved by sitting up and leaning forward) along with f ever, pericardial friction rub, electrocardiographic changes, pericardial effusion, or elevated levels of inflammation markers (white blood cell [WBC] count, C -reactive protein [CRP], or erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) (Adler et al 2015). The Europea n Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Pericardial Diseases define an acute pericarditis episode as the presence of at least 2 of the 4 following criteria: pericarditic chest pain, pericardial rubs, new widespread ST -segment elevation or PR -segment depression based on electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and pericardial effusion (new or worsening). Elevations of certain markers of inflammation (i.e., CRP, ESR, and WBC) or evidence of pericardial inflammation by an imaging technique (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are used as supportive findings (Adler et al 2015). Recurrent pericarditis is characterized by the recurrence of pericarditis signs and symptoms after a symptom -free period of at least 4 to 6 weeks (Adler et al 2015). Recurrent pericarditis affects 20% to 30% of patients with acute pericarditis (Imazio 2014) and can be debilitating for patients due to pain and limitations in physical function during pericarditis episodes. Pericarditis recurrences res ult in increased emergency room admissions and hospitalizations. In the United States, 5% of patients presenting to the emergency room with non -ischemic chest pain are diagnosed with pericarditis (Agarwal et al 2015). The estimated prevalence of recurre nt pericarditis in the US and Europe is 70,000 to 160,000 patients including approximately 8,000 to 21,000 patients who are refractory or intolerant to current therapies or who require long -term administration of corticosteroids (CS) to control their disea se (Brucato et al 2016; Lazaros et al 2016; Imazio et al 2010; Khandaker et al 2010; Imazio et al 2008). 30 Page 31"
31,page_31,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 1.1 Current Therapeutic Management of Pericarditis There are no approved therapies for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. Current treatments include nonspecific inhibitors of inflammation, i.e., aspirin, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and CS (Lilly et al 2013). Aspirin and other NSAIDs are the first -line approach. Because high doses of aspirin and NSAIDs are often required, consideration must be given to gastric protection therapy, as potential risks of therapy include stomach ulcers and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, as well as renal and cardiovascular toxicity. Colchicine is another mainstay therapy for pericarditis and is commonly used with NSAIDs to hasten the response to NSAIDs and reduce the risk of subseq uent recurrences. However, its use may be associated with the risk of fatal overdosing, significant drug interactions, and neuromuscular toxicity. In addition, approximately 10% to 15% of patients experience significant GI side effects with colchicine, including GI intolerance or severe diarrhea, requiring treatment discontinuation (Imazio et al 2016). Available ESC guidelines stipulate that CS should be prescribed for the management of pericarditis episodes only in cases of incomplete res ponse, intolerance, or contraindications to NSAIDs and colchicine because of their unfavorable long -term benefit -risk profile. Corticosteroid use is associated with side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, avascular bone necrosis, and increased risk for infections (Imazio et al 2008). For the management of pericarditis, CS are usually administered at low to moderate doses and can provide rapid control of symptoms. However, they often require many months of tapering after the normalizatio n of CRP levels. In addition, there is a high rate of pericarditis relapse when CS use is tapered or stopped (Lotrionte et al 2010; Imazio et al 2005; Maisch et al 2004), particularly in the absence of concurrent colchicine treatment. Patients with recurrent pericarditis who are refractory or intolerant to current therapeutic management options or who require long -term administration of CS to control their disease can be particularly challenging to manage. As a last resort, some refractory patients a re being referred to the surgical procedure of pericardiectomy, with variable outcomes. Multiple immunosuppressive medications have been used without consistent benefit (Baskar et al 2016). 1.2 Pathogenesis of Recurrent Pericarditis: Role of IL-1 Interleukin -1 is a key cytokine that drives the pathophysiology of many inflammatory processes, and it is implicated as a causative factor in various inflammatory diseases in humans. The two distinct IL -1 genes, IL1A and IL1B , encode IL -1α and IL -1β, respectively. IL -1α and IL -1β bind to the universally -expressed cell surface receptor, IL -1 receptor type -1, triggering a cascade of inflammatory mediators. The precursor form of IL-1α is expressed in keratinocytes, mucous membrane epithelial cells, and organs such as the liver and vascular endothelium in healthy individuals. During pathological states, IL-1α moves to the cell surface or is released after cell death to activate IL-1 receptors in adjacent cells, thus beginning the cascade of sterile inflammation. IL-1β, 31 Page 32"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 however, is not expressed in healthy individuals until a stimulus, such as microbial products or other chemokines, triggers its transcription in monocytes, tissue macrophages, and dendritic cells via the inflammasome. IL -1 drives the inflammatory cascade in classic autoinflammatory conditions, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and plays a significant role in systemic onset of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Baskar et al 2016). IL-1–blocking therapies are effective at controlling end -organ disease and damage in patients with various autoinflammatory disorders, and different strategies to block IL -1 have been used in clinical trials and demonstrated substantial success in contro lling episodes of fever and elevations in acute -phase reactants (Cantarini et al 2015). This mechanistic plausibility of IL-1 antagonism in addressing pathophysiology related to the inflammasome extends to other conditions characterized by sterile acute inflammation, such as 32 Page 33 recurrent pericarditis."

(Regeneron) of Tarrytown, NY, and is approved with the trade name ARCALYST® in the US for the treatment of CAPS, including Familial Cold Auto - Inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle -Wells Syndrome (MWS) in adults and children age 12 and older. Rilonacept is currently manufactured and marketed as ARCALYST® by Regeneron. Rilonacept receive d marketing authorization in the European Union for the treatment of CAPS with severe symptoms, including FCAS and MWS in adults and children aged 12 years and older, but based on a request from Regeneron, the marketing authorization was withdrawn. The wit hdrawal was a business decision and was not related to any concern with the safety or efficacy of rilonacept. Rilonacept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of human cytokine receptor extracellular domains and the Fc portion of human IgG1. Rilonacept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a total molecular weight of approximately 250 kDa. The dimer is covalently linked by disulfide bonds in the Fc region. Rilonacept incorporates in a single molecule the extracellular domains of both receptors requir ed for IL -1 signaling: the IL -1 type I receptor (IL -1R1) and the IL -1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1R-AcP) (Figure 1). Rilonacept is expressed in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Rilonacept blocks IL -1 by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL -1 and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. 33 Page 34"

The available rilonacept safety data is summarized below. Rilonacept has been evaluated in 23 studies, including 22 complete and 1 ongoing. In the completed studies, 2243 subjects (2152 patients and 91 healthy volunteers) were exposed to rilonacept. Thirty of these patients were pediatric (<18 years of age). Doses up to 320 mg subcutaneously (SC) once weekly and 2000 mg intravenously (IV) monthly have been studied for different indications, including CAPS, gout, and other inflammatory disorders. Injection Site Reactions In clinical studies with rilonacept, the most common and consistently reported AE associated with rilonacept was injection site reaction (ISR). The ISRs included erythema, swelling, pruritus, mass, bruising, inflammation, pain, edema, dermatitis, discomfort, urticaria, vesicles, warmth, and hemorrhage. Most ISRs were mild to moderate. In the gout clinical studies, approximately 1% of subjects treated with rilonacept discontinued due to ISRs. Similar results have been seen in other patient populations. Infections Interleukin -1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections.

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 Changes in Laboratory Parameters Cholesterol and lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Subjects treated with rilonacept in clinical trials experienced increases in their mean total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected using an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In clinical trials with rilonacept, approximately 30% to 35% of subjects tested positive for treatment -emergent antibodies to rilonacept on at least 1 occasion. Systemic Hypersen sitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions are a potential risk with protein therapeutics in general. In clinical studies with rilonacept, systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been rare. Malignancies The impact of treatment with rilonacept on the development of malignancies is not known. However, treatment with immunosuppressants, including rilonacept, may result in an increase in the risk for malignancies. Fetal Defects There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of rilonacept in pregnant women. Based on animal data, rilonacept may cause fetal harm. An embryo -fetal developmental toxicity study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys treated with 0, 5, 15, or 30 mg/kg given twice a week (highest dose is approximately 3.7 -fold higher than the human dose of 160 mg based on body surface area). The fetus of the only monkey with exposure to rilonacept during the later period of gestation showed multiple fusion and absence of the ribs and thoracic verte bral bodies and arches. Exposure to rilonacept during this time period was below that expected clinically. Likewise, in the cynomolgus monkey, all doses of rilonacept reduced serum levels of estradiol up to 64% compared to controls and increased the incide nce of lumbar ribs compared to both control animals and historical control incidences. In perinatal and postnatal developmental toxicology studies in the mouse model using a murine analog of rilonacept (0, 20, 100, or 200 mg/kg), there was a 3 -fold increas e in the number of stillbirths in dams treated with 200 mg/kg 3 times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Nonteratogenic effects : A peri - and postnatal reproductive toxi cology study was performed in which mice were administered a murine analog of rilonacept at doses of 20, 100, and 200 mg/kg SC 3 times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Results indicated an increased incidence in unscheduled deaths of the F1 offspring during maturation at all doses tested. 35 Page 36"

The study includes a 6 -week Treatment Period in which all the subjects receive once -weekly rilonacept 160 mg SC (2.2 mg/kg for subjects ≥6 and <18 years old) following a loading dose of 320 mg SC in subjects ≥18 years old (4.4 mg/kg in subjects ≥6 and <18 years old) in addition to background pericarditis therapies (NSAIDS, colchicine, CS). After completing the 6 -week Treatment Period and based on response status, the subjects have the option to enter the 18 -week Extension Period during which they continue to receive rilonacept at the same dose, but during which investigators are encouraged to wean and stop background pericarditis medications. The primary objectives of the study are to explore clinical and biochemical endpoints of recurrent pericarditis symptomatology, as well as to assess feasibility to wean from concomitant pericarditis medication in the Extension Period while continuing treatment with rilonacept. The study population includes the following 5 subject categories (Parts): • Part 1 enrolls symptomatic subjects with recurrent idiopathic pericarditis with an elevated marker of systemic inflammation (CRP level >1 mg/dL). Part 2 enrolls symptomatic subjects with recurrent idiopathic pericarditis with CRP level ≤1 mg/dL that, in the opinion of the investigator, can be attributed to concomitant medications (e.g., CS) and with pericardial inflammation present on cardiac MRI confirmed by the imaging core lab. Part 3 enrolls subjects with CS-dependent recurrent idiopathic pericarditis not experiencing symptoms that would meet the diagnostic criteria for a recurrence of pericarditis. Part 4 enrolls symptomatic subjects with recurrent PPS with an elevated marker of system ic inflammation (CRP level >1 mg/dL). Part 5 enrolls subjects with CS -dependent recurrent PPS not experiencing symptoms that would meet the diagnostic criteria for a recurrence of pericarditis. • • • • Preliminary data in this ongoing study suggest that subjects enrolled in Part 1 experience improvements in pain, CRP levels, and other pericarditis parameters compared to baseline. Adverse events observed in the study are consistent with the overall rilonacept safety profile. 2 Study Objectives and Endpoints 2.1 Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. 36 Page 37"

This study has 5 periods (Figure 2). 3.1.1 Screening Period (up to 4 weeks) During the screening period, assessment of disease characteristics, baseline therapy, and the pre- treatment workup will be completed during a period of up to 4 weeks. 3.1.2 Single -blind Run-In (RI) Period (12 weeks) During the single -blind RI period, treatment with blinded rilonacept is administered and subjects are weaned off background standard of care (SOC) therapy for their pericarditis disease. Subjects will be blinded regarding the time of transition from the single -blind to the double -blind period; i.e., they will not be aware of the duration of the RI period. In the single -blind RI period, subjects ≥18 years old will receive blinded rilonacept as an initial loading dose of 320 mg (2 SC injections of 160 mg each) at the RI baseline visit (2 × 2 ml), followed by a 160 mg (2 ml) SC dose once weekly throughout the RI period. Pediatric subjects (≥12 and <18 years old) will receive an initial loading dose of blinded rilonacept 4.4 mg/kg (2 SC injections of 2.2 mg/kg each) at the RI baseline visit (maximum 2 × 2 ml), and then 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 2 ml) SC once weekly throughout the RI period. The RI period includes: • 1-week Stabilization period, during which blinded rilonacept is administered in addition to SOC pericarditis therapy, and the ongoing pericarditis episode is treated. 9-week Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues. The dosages of CS, NSAIDs, and colchicine will be tapered according to the weaning protocol in the Pharmacy Manual ( for the purpose of the protocol, aspirin is considered an NSAID). In general, CS doses will be tapered off starting at RI Week 1 and will be withdrawn by RI Week 10 (over a total of 9 weeks). NSAID and colchicine doses will be tapered off starting at RI Week 4 and will be withdrawn by RI Week 10 (over a total of 6 weeks). 2-week Monotherapy period: Subjects who have been successfully weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy will continue to receive blinded rilonacept. • • 37 Page 38"

For definition of Clinical Response, refer to Section 6.2.2. Subjects who are unable to achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept monotherapy at RI Week 12/RW baseline are to be discontinued from study drug, transitioned to SOC pericarditis therapy at the investigator’s discretion, and followed through the end of the RW period. 3.1.3 Double -blind Placebo -controlled RW Period (pericarditis recurrence event -driven duration with a minimum of 24 weeks) During the RW period, subjects who were able to stop background pericarditis medications and who achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept monotherapy at RI Week 12/RW baseline will be randomized 1:1 to double -blinded administration of study drug: • Rilonacept 160 mg (or 2.2 mg/kg in pediatric subjects ≥12 and <18 years old) SC injections once weekly OR Matching placebo SC injections once weekly • Pericarditis Recurrence in the RW Period For the definition of pericarditis recurrence, refer to Section 6.2.3 . Upon pericarditis recurrence, subjects who report at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11 -point Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] and have 1 CRP value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) will receive bailout rilonacept (2 open -label injections of 160 mg rilonacept [or 4.4 mg/kg for pediatric subjects]) irrespective of randomized treatment assignment and as soon as at least 5 days have passed since the last study drug injection. The subjects transitioning to bailout rilonacept will remain blinded to their prior RW period treatment assignment. Sequential Oral Rescue Therapy (ORT), i.e., analgesics first, then NSAIDs, and then colchicine, can be added, if needed, at the discretion of the investigator, as outlined in Section 5.8.3 and det ailed in the Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence who do not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept will continue blinded study drug until they meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept or through the end of the RW p eriod. For those subjects, sequential ORT can be added to blinded study drug at the discretion of the investigator, as outlined in Section 5.8.3 and detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. All suspected pericarditis recurrence events in the RW period will be formally adjudicated by the Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC), and only events that are confirmed by the CEC as pericarditis recurrences will be used in the Primary Endpoint analysis.

41,page_41,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 3.1.6 Rationale of Study Design Subjects eligible for this KPL -914-C002 study will be subjects with recurrent pericarditis presenting with an acute pericarditis episode at screening. The KPL -914-C002 study design ensures that during the RI period all subjects will receive rilonacept, a drug with evidence supporting clinical activity base d on the preliminary clinical data with rilonacept from Part 1 of the ongoing Phase 2 proof -of-concept study (KPL -914-C001) obtained to date. During the RI period, pericarditis will be stabilized with symptoms controlled and background pericarditis medicat ions (NSAIDs, colchicine, CS) will be tapered and withdrawn, while rilonacept treatment continues. The design then allows half of the subjects to continue receiving active treatment after having achieved Clinical Response on that treatment, which maximizes subject exposure to a potentially beneficial therapy. The temporary withdrawal of rilonacept (by switching to placebo) in the half of the subjects who were randomly assigned to placebo is expected to result in an accelerated time to pericarditis recurrence and a higher recurrence rate compared to those who continue on active treatment, a finding that demonstrates that the underlying pericarditis etiology is still ongoing and will provide further support for the anticipated observation of the clini cal effect of rilonacept during the RI period of the study. The period of exposure to an ineffective treatment is minimized in this design, as subjects will be removed from blinded treatment when the condition returns to a specified severity (i.e., for hav ing met the criteria of pericarditis pain ≥4 on the 11 -point NRS and CRP level ≥1 mg/dL) without unblinding them to prior treatment assignment, thus protecting the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. All subjects who meet the pain and CRP criteria desc ribed above will be treated with open -label bailout rilonacept using a loading dose, followed by once-weekly SC injections. In addition, sequential ORT such as NSAIDs and/or colchicine will be allowed upon recurrence at the investigator’s discretion based on the subject’s clinical status, as outlined in Section 5.8.3 and as stipulated in the Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence not meeting criteria for bailout rilonacept, can b e treated with sequential ORT based on investigator judgement and as described in protocol Section 5.8.3 and the Pharmacy Manual. If the subject requires the addition of CS treatment to control the pericarditis recurrence, th e subject will be discontinued from study drug. All subjects will be followed for the duration of RW period. In summary, the proposed RW trial with rilonacept allows all enrolled subjects an opportunity to receive the active drug during the acute episode of pericarditis yet provides pivotal -quality data on the efficacy of rilonacept in this enriched cohort by subsequently randomly assig ning subjects to placebo versus active treatment after they achieve a predefined clinical response. Subjects with pericarditis recurrences after randomization will receive bailout rilonacept treatment and/or sequential ORT according to the protocol. This a pproach minimizes the exposure to placebo, which is important for a study that requires active disease upon enrollment and includes a pediatric population. The available regulatory guidance supports the use of an RW study design in the setting of recurrent pericarditis as 41 Page 42"

In the rilonacept development program in CAPS, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions, over 2000 subjects were exposed to rilonacept, including 1650 subjects receiving a rilonacept dose of 160 mg or higher. A total of 103 and 169 subjects were exposed to any rilonacept dose for at least 1 year or 6 months, respectively. Most of the real -life experience with rilonacept comes from the CAPS population treated at this marketed dose. As of March 2018, approximately 365 CAPS patients have been exposed to rilonacept in the post -marketing setting since 2008. The safety data accumulated so far support the benefit/risk ratio for the ril onacept dose intended to be evaluated in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. Based on the preliminary clinical data with rilonacept from Part 1 of the Phase 2 proof of concept study (KPL -914-C001) obtained to date, it is expected that rilonacept doses (320 mg followed by 160 mg SC once weekly and corresponding pediatric doses), and evaluated in the KPL -914-C001 study, will consistently provide adequate suppression of clinical inflammatory response, including CRP levels, in patients with recurrent pericarditis. Bailout Rilonacept Dose Subjects who meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence in the RW period of the study ( Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ), irrespective of treatment assignment at randomization, will receive open -label rilonacept (loading dose of 320 mg SC followed by once-weekly SC injections of 160 mg, or the corresponding pediatric doses). The rationale for bailout rilonacept treatment upon pericarditis recurrence for subjects who were randomly assigned to placebo is that rilonacept had controlled their disease activity during the RI period; therefore, re -initiation of rilonacept is justified to regain contro l of pericarditis signs and symptoms upon recurrence. Subjects who were randomly assigned to rilonacept and qualify for bailout rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence in the RW period were initial responders to rilonacept treatment during the RI period; thus it could be assumed that the loss of response during the RW 42 Page 43"
43,page_43,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 period could be due to development of resistance to rilonacept due to different mechanisms, e.g., higher IL -1 levels or a change in rilonacept pharmacokinetics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics. Therefore, re-administration of a loading dose of rilonacept may help to restor e Clinical Response. 4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal Criteria 4.1 Selection of Study Population Approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled (and not more than 75 subjects), which will allow at least 50 subjects to be randomized at approximately 50 sites globally. Subjects will be assigned to study drug only if they meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability, or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. Subjects eligible for the study are subjects with recurrent perica rditis who do not have pericarditis secondary to prohibited conditions. The study population includes both adult subjects ≥18 years old and pediatric subjects ≥12 and <18 years old with a history of at least 2 pericarditis episodes (including the first epi sode and 1 recurrence) prior to screening. Enrollment of pediatric subjects will be limited to up to 20% of the study population.

Subjects who stopped background SOC pericarditis therapy and who achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept at RI Week 12/RW baseline will be randomly assigned in a double -blind manner to continue to receive blinded rilonacept or matching placebo using a 1:1 allocation ratio. The definition of Clinical Response is provided in Section 6.2.2. An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to administer the randomization schedule. Biostatistics will generate the randomization schedule using SAS® software Version 9.4 or later (SAS Institu te Inc, Cary, North Carolina) for the IWRS, which will link sequential subject randomization numbers to treatment codes. The randomization schedule will be stratified by 2 factors: • • Oral CS use at baseline (RI baseline, i.e., beginning of RI period): yes or no Diagnosis of recurrent idiopathic pericarditis (RI baseline): yes or no 51 Page 52"

Both will be administered as applicable by SC injection. Study drug administration will be performed once a week (every 7 ± 2 days). The interval between study drug administrations must be at least 5 days. Study drug will be dosed as follows: Adult Subjects (≥18 years old): Rilonacept: Loading dose 320 mg administered as 2 SC injections, 160 mg each (2 ml) at RI baseline, followed by once-weekly SC injections of 160 mg (2ml). Placebo: administered as once-weekly SC injections of 2 ml each in the RW period Upon meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept ( Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ) in the RW period, subjects will be transitioned to open -label rilonacept 320 mg administered as 2 SC injections, 160 mg each (2 ml) at the next scheduled study drug administration date, followed by once-weekly SC injections of 160 mg (2ml) . Pediatric Subjects (≥12 and <18 years old): Rilonacept: Loading dose 4.4 mg/kg administered as 2 SC injections, 2.2 mg/kg each (maximum 160 mg each) at RI baseline, followed by once-weekly SC injections of 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 160 mg). The volume of injections will be based on the subject’s weight (Table 5–1). Placebo (in RW): once-weekly SC injections with volume based on the subject’s weight (Table 5–1, maximum 2 ml). Upon meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept ( Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ) in the RW period, subjects will be transitioned to open -label rilonacept 4.4 mg/kg administered as 1 (maximum 2 ml) or 2 SC injections at the next scheduled study drug administration date, followed by once -weekly SC injections of 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 2 ml). The volume of injections will be based on the subject’s weight (Table 5–1). Study drug dose/volume will be calculated by the investigator or pharmacist during site clinic visits based on body weight (as specified in the Study Schedule of Activities ) using a weight -based dosing chart in kilograms (Table 5–1). 52 Page 53"

In addition, accurate records will be kept regarding when and how much study drug is dispensed and used by each subject in the study. Reasons for deviating from the expe cted dispensing regimen must also be recorded. At the completion of the study, to satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all used and unused study drug containers must be retained by the study site/clinic and subject for cataloguing and documentation of compliance. The full process for drug dispensing, documentation, and destruction will be described in the Pharmacy Manual. A full drug accountability log will be maintained at the study site at all times. 5.4.3 Other Supplies Rilonacept should be reconstituted with preservative -free WFI that will be provided by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals or designee along with 27 -gauge, ½ -inch needles, 3 -ml syringes, alcohol wipes, gauze pads, bandages, and a puncture resistant contain er for disposal of needles and syringes. Only the syringes and needles provided by the Sponsor or its designee should be used to prepare and inject the study drug. The Sponsor also will provide coolers and refrigerated gel packs to ensure that the subjects transport the study drug at the proper temperature. On occasion, sites may be asked to locally procure ancillary materials. 5.5 Study Drug Overdose An overdose is any dose of study drug given to a subject or taken by a subject that exceeds the dose described in the protocol. Any overdose must be promptly reported to the Pharmacovigilance (PVG) in the same way and using the same procedures as for a serious adverse event (SAE) (Section 6.4.6 ), regardless of whether any AEs are associated with the overdose. If there are AEs associated with the overdose, these should be recorded on the relevant AE/SAE sections in the eCRF; however, overdoses without signs or symptoms do not need to be recorded as AEs in the eCRF. 5.5.1 Treatment of Study Drug Overdose The maximum amount of rilonacept that can be safely administered has not been determined. Maximum once -weekly doses of rilonacept up to 320 mg have been administered SC for up to approximately 18 months in a small number of subjects with CAPS, and for up to 6 months in subjects in an unapproved indication in clinical trials without evidence of dose -limiting toxicities. In addition, rilonacept given IV at doses up to 2000 mg monthly for up to 6 months in another subject population was tolerated without dose -limiting toxic ities (Rilonacept IB). In case of overdose, it is recommended that the subject be monitored for any signs or symptoms of AEs and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately (Section 13.1, ARCALYST® Prescribing Information). 55 Page 56"

It should be taken only by the subjects participating in the study and as instructed by study site personnel. Guidelines regarding the management of temperature excursions during storage will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. Pediatric dosing is calculated based on body weight in kilograms, not pounds. • • Any study drug error must be promptly reported to the same procedures as for an SAE (Section 6.4.6 ) PVG, in the same way and using the 5.6 Transmission of Infectious Agents The lyophilized study drug is to be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) inside the original carton to protect it from light. Study drug should not be used beyond the date stamped on the label. After reconstitution, study drug may be kept at room temperature, should be protected from light, and should be used within 3 hours of reconstitution. Study drug doe s not contain preservatives; therefore, unused portions of study drug should be discarded. 5.7 Misuse for Illegal Purposes Rilonacept does not have addicting potential, and the risk of misuse for illegal purposes is minimal. 5.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications Use of all concomitant medications and any changes in concomitant medications will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. The minimum requirement is that drug name and dates of administration are to be recorded. This will include all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, and over-the- counter medications. Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the welfare of the subject during the study may be given at the discretion of the investigator. However, it is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded in full in the eCRF. The initiation of protocol prohibited medication (Section 5.8.6 ) requires discontinuation of study drug. Guidelines regarding the use of concomitant medication will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual and are summarized in the following sections. 56 Page 57"

Analgesics can be used at the discretion of the investigator during screening activities prior to the first study drug dose, but only after the subject has documented a pericarditis pain l evel ≥4 on the 11 -point NRS within 7 days prior to and including RI baseline (first administration of study drug). Subjects can enter the study on prednisone (or equivalent dose) not exceeding 60 mg/day for adults and not exceeding 0.5 mg/kg/day (with a maximum dose of 60 mg/day) in pediatric subjects. 5.8.2 Single -blind RI Period • 1-week Stabilization period, during which rilonacept is administered in addition to SOC pericarditis therapy and ongoing pericarditis episode is treated. All concomitant pericarditis medications including NSAIDs, analgesics, colchicine and CS will remain stable, unless the dosing must be decreased or stopped in the judgement of the investigator due to an AE. 9-week background medication Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues. The guidelines for background medication taper and discontinuation will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Corticosteroids Starting at Week 1 and through Week 10, CS will be tapered and discontinued at a rate dependent on the dose at study entry. Analgesics Starting at Week 1 and through Week 10, analgesics (non -opioid and opioid) will be taper ed and discontinued. Opioid analgesics can continue beyond Week 10 at stable doses through the end of the RW period if it is not feasible to discontinue them without causing withdrawal symptoms. NSAIDs and Colchicine Starting at Week 4 and through Week 10, NSAIDs and colchicine will be tapered and discontinued. • 57 Page 58"

Because open -label rilonacept can be administered only if at least 5 days have passed from the last blinded study drug administration, the i nvestigators are allowed to use sequential ORT, i.e., analgesics, NSAIDs, and colchicine if necessary at their discretion. The use of those medications will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual; it is briefly given as follows: • Analgesics (including n on-opioid and opioid) can be used for pain control prior to completing the diagnostic workup for a recurrent pericarditis episode. The use of analgesics during pericarditis recurrence evaluation will provide pain relief for subjects without impacting their CRP levels or other objective components of the diagnostic workup. • After the diagnostic workup is completed based on the medical monitor’s assessment, NSAIDs followed by colchicine can be added to open -label rilonacept based on the subject’s clinical status and at the discretion of the investigator. If, after transition to open -label rilonacept, the investigator decides that the subject requires CS for pericarditis therapy, the subject will be discontinued from rilonacept and followed through the EORW visit. • Subjects not meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept If, based on the investigator’s judgement, the subject is experiencing pericarditis recurrence that does not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept (Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ) but does require additional treatment, the subject will continue blinded study drug, and the investigator should manage the pericarditis recurrence using sequential ORT for pericarditis, i.e., analgesics, NSAIDs, colchicine as described in the Pharmacy Manual and outlined briefly below: 58 Page 59"

The RW period is a double -blind period in which rilonacept and placebo are identical in appearance. Neither the subject nor any of the investigator/site staff, or Sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received (International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] E9). In the event of a pericarditis recurrence that meets the criteria for bailout rilonacept ( Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ), the subject will be transitioned to open -label rilonacept but will remain blinded to their prior RW treatment assignment. At the end of the RW period, all sites and subjects will be unblinded. Subjects will be offered participation in the LTE -TP, in which once -weekly open -label rilonacept can be continued for an additional 24 weeks. 5.9.1 Breaking the Blind A subject’s treatment assignment will not be broken until the end of the RW period. If the treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, the Sponsor must be notified immediately. If the investigator intends to unblind treatment allocation for a subject, then the Sponsor should be not ified immediately. The investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject. In most cases, the managemen t of a medical emergency would be the same, regardless of whether the subject received active drug. The treatment assignment will be unblinded through the IWRS. The investigator must notify Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals and medical monitors as soon as possible but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded subject, unless that information is important for the safety of subjects currently in the study. The date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded in the eCRF. The PVG staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any subject with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the blinded report may be sent to clinical investigators in accordance with local regulations. 5.10 Treatment Compliance Subjects will record the administration of all doses of study drug (whether as an outpatient or in the clinic) in a subject’s diary. In addition, throughout all study periods, adherence to study drug administration will be assessed by the study site in collaboration with the visiting RN ( Section 6). 60 Page 61"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 6 Study Assessments and Procedures Before performing any study procedures, all potential subjects will provide informed consent or an assent, if applicable. Potential subjects will have the study risks and benefits explained to them, the associated ICF reviewed with them, and all questions answered for them. Subjects will undergo screening procedures specific to the study only after the ICF has been provided by the subject unless performed as part of SOC practice. The investigator or designee will also sign the ICF. 6.1 Study Visits The schedule of assessments for the study site visits is summarized in the Study Schedule of Activities. Following screening assessments, qualifying subjects will be enrolled and enter the RI period. Subjects who stop background pericarditis medications and achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12 (Section 6.2.2 ), will be randomized and enter the RW period. During both the RI and RW period, a combination of clinic and outpatient visits will occur. Outpatient visits may consist of telephone or virtual contacts as well as home visits conducted by a visiting nurse. For each scheduled visit of the study (including outpatient and clinic), assessments should occur prior to scheduled injections of study drug. Subjects can be brought to the clinic in place of a scheduled outpatient visit or for an unscheduled visit at the discretion of the investigator. The visit schedule is derived from the day of the RI baseline visit. One week is equal to 7 calendar days. Although visits do not occur every week, subjects are required to record pericarditis pain NRS measurements on a daily basis in their study device and to administer study drug on a once -weekly basis and record it in their study electronic diary (eDiary). If a subject is unable to independently complete the daily eDiary, a careg iver may help enter the data. Upon completion of the RI and RW periods, all subjects will have the opportunity to continue participating in the LTE. This will require each subject again providing informed consent prior to LTE participation. The LTE period will have a treatment period (LTE -TP) and an off treatment follow -up period (LTE -FUP). Any subject who prematurely discontinues study drug will be followed for the duration of the trial as specified in Section 4.2.2 . In addition, throughout all study periods, compliance with study drug administration will be assessed by the site in collaboration with the visiting RN. 6.1.1 Screening: Clinic and Remote as Needed A study screening eCRF is required to be completed for every subject with a signed ICF.

A validated 11 -point pericarditis NRS ( Section 13.2) will be used to measure the subject’s level of pain intensity on a daily basis throughout the study (Hawker et al 2011; Mannion et al 2007; Dworkin et al 2005). It is recommended that daily pericarditis pain measurements using the 11 -point NRS are performed by subjects at the same time of the day each day, and prior to stud y drug injection on days with study drug administration. 6.2.1.3 Electrocardiogram Twelve -lead ECGs will be performed at study visits as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. Pericarditis commonly involves ch anges in the electrophysiologic activity of the heart, resulting in typical ECG findings, namely widespread ST-segment elevation or PR-segment depression. 6.2.1.4 Echocardiogram Echocardiographic assessment of presence of pericardial effusion including new or worsening of pericardial effusion should be obtained at study visits as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. Pericardial effusion is characterized by accumulati on of excess fluid in the pericardial space surrounding the heart, and pericarditis is one of the main causes of pericardial effusion. Echocardiography is a sensitive tool and the most widely used imaging technique for the detection of pericardial effusion and/or thickening. Echocardiograms are to be acquired per the ECHO core imaging parameters. Upon local assessment and interpretation, the ECHO is then to be submitted to the designated central imaging laboratory. 6.2.1.5 Patient Global Impression of Pericarditis Severity Patient Global Impression questionnaires have been developed for a variety of indications. The PGIPS is a single -item PRO measure that assesses the subject’s impression of overall severity of pericarditis symptoms at the time the questionnaire is administered, using a 7 -point rating scale ranging from absent (no recurrent pericarditis symptoms) to very severe (recurrent pericarditis symptoms cannot be ignored) (Guy 1976). The PGIPS can be completed in less than 30 seconds. The subject will select the box that best describes the severity of pericarditis symptoms right now: Absent: no symptoms Minimal: can be easily ignored without effort Mild: can be ignored with effort Moderate: cannot be ignored but does not influence my daily activities Moderately severe: cannot be ignored and occasionally limits my daily activities 78 Page 79"

The PGA -PA is a single -item clinician -reported outcome measure that investigators use to rate their impression of the patient’s overall pericarditis disease activity at the time the assessment is completed, using a 7 -point rating scale ranging from absent to very severe (Guy 1976). Like the PGIPS, the PGA -PA can be completed in less than 30 seconds. The investigator will select the box that best describes subject’s pericarditis activity right now. Absent Minimal Mild Moderate Moderately severe Severe Very severe The PGA -PA will be collected as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. 6.2.1.7 36-Item Short Form Health Survey The SF -36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality -of-life measures. The SF -36 was developed at RAND Corporation as part of its Medical Outcomes Study. The SF-36 assesses 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emoti onal problems, general mental health, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. SF-36 will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. 6.2.1.8 EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health - related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ- 5D-5L consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/di scomfort and anxiety/depression. The rating scale records the subject’s self-rated health on a vertical VAS. This can be used as a quantitative 79 Page 80"

The scores on these 5 dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles (https://euroqol.org/eq -5d-instruments). The EQ-5D-5L will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in Study Schedule of Activities. 6.2.1.9 Insomnia Severity Index The ISI is a 7 -item self -report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. The usual recall period i s the “last 2 weeks” and the dimensions evaluated are severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by other s, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5 -point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0=no problem; 4=very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: no clinically significan t insomnia (0 –7); subthreshold insomnia (8 –14); clinical (moderate) insomnia (15–21); and clinical (severe) insomnia (22–28) (Morin et al 2011). The ISI will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in Study Schedule of Activities. 6.2.1.10 Cardiac MRI Cardiac MRI will be performed as described in the Study Schedule of Activities at selected sites in approximately 10 subjects in the cardiac MRI substudy. Cardiac MRI will be performed to assess any changes in pericardial inflammation. Cardiac MRI readings will be performed by a central imaging laboratory. The study site/clinic reading of the MRI at the time of the examination may be us ed by the investigator for clinical decision -making. 6.2.2 Assessment of Clinical Response at the End of the Run -In Period Week 12/RW Baseline At RI Week 12/RW baseline visit, all subjects receiving rilonacept who are able to discontinue background SOC pericarditis therapy during the RI period ( Section 3.1) are assessed for Clinical Response. Only subjects who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12 and have discontinued background medications for pericarditis are eligible for randomization in the RW period. Clinical Response at RI Week 12 is defined as follows: • A weekly average of daily pericarditis pain of ≤2.0 on the 11-point NRS during the 7 days prior to and including the day of randomization, AND CRP level ≤0.5 mg/dL at the RI Week 12/RW baseline visit. • 80 Page 81"

At any time point during the RW period, subjects who experience suspected recurrence of their pericarditis will have been instructed to inform their site investigator as soon as possible. Subjects who experience a suspected recurrence of pe ricarditis symptoms will be requested to report to the study site/clinic for a scheduled or unscheduled visit, during which clinical assessments will be performed to gather all the necessary diagnostic data to confirm or rule out the presence of pericarditis recurrence (Section 6.1.6.1 ). The investigator will evaluate all assessments performed for a diagnostic workup, whether at the study site or at locations outside. Upon completion of pericarditis workup, the investigator is required to contact the medical monitor to confirm that the protocol required diagnostic workup is complete prior to implementing treatment for the event. Following communication with the medical monitor, if the event meets the criteria for bailout rilonacept (at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11-point NRS and one CRP value ≥1 mg/dL either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days), and after the medical monitor has confirmed with the investigator that the diagnostic workup is complete, the attainment of bailout criteria is confirmed in the IWRS, blinded study drug is discontinued, and open -label rilonacept treatment is dispensed. If needed, sequential ORT is allowed as outlined in Section 5.8.3. The subject will continue to be followed up according to the Study Schedule of Activities for the RW period. Following communication with the medical monitor, if the event does not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept but in the judgement of investigator requires treatment, after the medical monitor has confirmed with the investigator that the diagnostic workup is complete, the investigator is allowed to add sequential ORT to blinded study drug, and as outlined in Section 5.8.3. Blinded study drug treatment will continue until a pericarditis recurrence that meets criteria for bailout rilonacept, or until the end of the RW period. For a summary of management of suspected pericarditis recurrence, refer to Figure 3. Upon suspected pericarditis recurrence, the event is required to be captured in the el ectronic data capture (EDC) system within 24 hours of learning of the event, and a pericarditis recurrence event adjudication package must be prepared for adjudication by CEC. The event package will include, but may not be limited to, data on the subject’s pericarditis pain level, CRP value, ECG tracing, ECHO result, the presence or absence of pericardial rub, and any additional source documentation relevant to 81 Page 82"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 6.3.1 Physical Examination A full physical examination should include at minimum an evaluation of vital signs, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat as well as cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, GI, genitourinary, and neurological systems. Body weight and height will be measured as per the Study Schedule of Activities and will be recorded in the eCRF. Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the medical history and physical examination eCRFs. At selected visits as specified in the Study Schedule of Activities, an abbreviated physical examination will be performed to evaluate vital signs, lung and heart sounds, including evaluation for pericardial rub. At all visits at the study site, limited symptom -directed physical examinations may need to be performed in order to determine changes from baseline or abnormalities and should be recorded in the subject’s trial notes. New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs on the Adverse Event eCRF. 6.3.2 Vital Signs Vital signs include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and temperature. Blood pressure measurements should be obtained after the subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes. 6.3.3 Chest X-ray Chest x -rays in accordance with local requirements will be obtained at screening (or an existing chest x-ray within 12 weeks of first study drug administration can be used) according to the Study Schedule of Activities. Chest x -rays should be reviewed by a qualified radiologist for clinically significant abnormalities and evidence of pulmonary disease that would exclude the potential subject. 6.3.4 Tuberculosis Screening An IGRA test or another TB test based on acceptable clinical practice in each country will be performed in order to evaluate for the presence of active or latent TB infection at screening. 6.4 Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the study, regardless of their relationship to study drug or their clinical significance. 6.4.1 6.4.1.1 Definitions Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 83 Page 84"
84,page_84,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 An AE can therefore be any unfavorable sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs also include: any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug; abnormal laboratory findings considered by the reporting investigator to be clinically significant; and any untoward medical occurrenc e. 6.4.1.2 Treatment -emergent Adverse Event A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before exposure to the study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after exposure to the study drug. 6.4.1.3 Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any dose: • Results in death . Includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to the study drug (e.g., car accident where the subject is a passenger). Is life-threatening . In the view of the investigator, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event at the time of the event (i.e., it does not include an AE that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form). Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization. (Complications occurring during hospitalization are AEs and are SAEs if they cause prolongation of the current hospitaliza tion. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing non-worsening condition is not, however, considered an AE. The details of such pre -existing condition must be recorded on the medical history or physical examination page of the eCRF. Hospitalization is defined as an admission to the hospital ward, a short -stay type unit, or Emergency Room for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital stay longer than originally anticipated for the event or development of a new AE as determined by the Investigator or treating physician.) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . (An AE is incapacitating or disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions.) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Is an important medical event . Important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subjec t or may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or developm ent of drug dependency or drug abuse). 84 • • • • • Page 85"

All SAEs that occur after signing of study -related informed consent, whether or not the SAEs are related to the study drug or study procedures, must be reported. 6.4.1.4 Adverse Event of Special Interest An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is defined as an AE of scientific and medical interest specific to the understanding of the study drug and requiring close monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the Sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non -serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing an alysis of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of the study drug. Treatments with immunosuppressants, including rilonacept, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. Therefore, malignancy is an AESI for rilonacept. Any AE of malignancy (excluding basal cell carcinoma of the skin) requires reporting to the Pharmacovigilance (PHV) within 24 hours after the time the site personnel first learn about the event, following the process as described in Section 6.4.6. 6.4.1.5 Adverse Reaction Any noxious and unintended response to the study drug (i.e., where a causal relationship between the study drug and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reaction. 6.4.1.6 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is an adverse reaction that is “unexpected”, i.e., it is not listed (or not listed at the severity that has been observed) in the designated Reference Safety Information of the Investigator’s Brochure. Evaluation and reporting requirements for SUSARs are detailed in Section 6.4.8. 6.4.2 6.4.2.1 Assessing Adverse Events Relationship to Study Drug The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to the study drug is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determin ing what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. 85 Page 86"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 The relationship or association of the study drug in causing or contributing to the AE will be characterized by investigator using the following classification and criteria: • Not Related : when the AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedure/conditions Unlikely Related : when the temporal association between the AE and the study drug is such that the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE Possibly Related : when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedures/conditions Related : when the AE follows a reasonable tempor al sequence from administration of the study drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause -effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced • • • 6.4.2.2 Intensity The severity of an AE will be recorded as one of the following: • Mild : easily tolerated, does not interfere with normal daily activities, does not require intervention Moderate : causes some interference with daily activities; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated Severe : as a consequence of the event, daily activities are limited or completely halted; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated • • Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 6.4.3 Recording Adve rse Events Each subject should be monitored for the development of any AEs. This information should be collected by asking nonleading questions (such as “How are you feeling?”) and from observations of and conversations with patients. AEs may also be co llected by direct physical exam, diagnostic procedures, or any other appropriate source. At every study visit (telephone or at the site), subjects will be asked a standard nonleading question to elicit any medically related changes in their well-being. They will also be asked if they have been admitted to the hospital, had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over-the-counter medications). 86 Page 87"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 All AEs (serious and non-serious) will be documented in the subject’s source documents and recorded in the eCRF. Any clinically relevant (as determined by the investigator) deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and in the eCRF. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. Also, when possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. Information to be collected includes the following: • • • • • • • • • Event term Date and time of onset Investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship study drug Date of resolution of the event Seriousness Any required treatment or actions Outcome Whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study drug. Whether or not the AE is an Injection Site Reaction (ISR). ISR is defined as any AE that occurs at the study drug injection site. If an ISR is observed, the subject may be treated at the discretion of the investigator. Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all AEs. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened but does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. 6.4.3.1 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject or reported in response to the open question from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of a diagnosis is preferred (when possible) to the recording of a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 87 Page 88"

Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia vs low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically significant findings on examinations and tests should be reported as AEs. Any new or aggravated clinically significant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. 6.4.3.3 Pericarditis Disease Related Events Signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings associated with pericarditis are to be captured as a pericarditis recurrence event rather than as an AE unless the event is more severe than expected for the subject. In any case, pericarditis recurrence is required to be ca ptured in the eCRF (see Section 6.2.3 ) within 24 hours of learning of the event. 6.4.4 Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events Adverse events will be assessed from the time the subjects signs the ICF and through the duration of the study, or at least through the SFU period (6 weeks after the last dose of study drug). 6.4.5 Follow -Up of Unresolved Adverse Events Every reasonable effort will be made to follow subjects who have AEs. Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s SFU visit are to be followed up by the investigator until resolution or for as long as medically indicated. Additional information for any subject with an ongoing AE at the end of the SFU period may be requested by the PHV, as needed. 6.4.6 Reporting Serious Adverse Events Any AE that meets SAE criteria (Section 6.4.1.3 ) must be reported to the PHV using the EDC system, immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) after the time site personnel first learn about the event. In the event the EDC entry is not possible (e.g., system failure or access problems), the study site should complete the paper SAE report form and fax the form to the PHV within 24 hours of awareness. The EDC system should be updated as soon as it is available. A full description of every SAE will need to be provided to the PHV (this may be supported by source documentation such as discharge summary or laboratory report should these documents be requested by the PHV). Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should be sent to the PHV as soon as possible and placed with the original SAE information. 88 Page 89"

The CEC will complete assessments on an ongoing basis. 7 7.1 The Statistical and Analytical Plan Primary Efficacy Endpoint primary efficacy endpoint is time to pericarditis recurrence, defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first pericarditis recurrence for each subject. Only CEC -confirmed pericarditis recurrence will be considered as an event for the primary analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be done based on the investigator’s assessment of the event. Pericarditis recurrence is defined in Section 6.2.3 . Subjects who do not have a pericarditis recurrence will be censored at the date of the last available assessment during the RW period before data cutoff. Detailed censo ring rules will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 7.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints for the RW Period This section defines secondary efficacy endpoints for the RW period. Endpoints for the RI period and for the LTE-TP are defined in Section 7.3. 7.2.1 Major Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 1. Proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 24 of the RW period.

97,page_97,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 Given these assumptions, a total of 22 adjudicated pericarditis recurrence events is required to achieve the power. About 25 subjects per arm (a total of 50 subjects) will be randomized. Considering 10% of subjects in the RI period that will not reach the RW period, approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Patient enrollment and the pericarditis recurrence event accrual will be closely monitored during the study. The monitoring activities will be done in a blinded fashion during the RW period. If the number of patients randomized is less than 50 and/or the time anticipated for the num ber of events required for the analysis of primary efficacy endpoint significantly exceeds the projected timeline, additional patients may be enrolled and/or randomized at Kiniksa Pharmaceutical’s discretion. However, at this time it is anticipated that no more than 75 subjects will be enrolled into this study. Since the data cutoff will be the event date of the 22nd adjudicated pericarditis recurrence AND all subjects still in the RW period have been treated for 24 weeks, the actual powe r could be higher if the assumed hazard ratio holds. 7.5 Analysis Sets The following analysis sets will be used in the statistical analyses. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: All subjects who are randomized in the RW period will be included in the ITT analysis set. The primary analysis for efficacy endpoints in the RW period will be based on the ITT analysis set. Treatment comparisons for all ITT analyses will be based on each subject’s treatment assignment from randomization. Safety Analysis Set: All subjects who take at least 1 dose of study drug in the RI period will be included in the safety analysis set (SS). Safety analyses will be based on the actual treatment a subject received. Run-in Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the RI period will be included in the RI analysis set (RIS). Per-protocol Analysis Set : The per protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set with the exclusion of subjects with major protocol violations or violations that may potentially bias statistical analyses or the ethical conduct of the study. The criteria of these violations will be determined prior to unblinding. This analysis set may be used for sensitivity analyses for efficacy endpoints in the RW period. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: The PK analysis set includes subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have at least 1 PK sample. The PK analysis set will be used for all PK analyses. 97 Page 98"

These analyses are for the RW period only. Details will be provided in the SAP. 7.7 Statistical Analysis Methodology This section outlines the overall methodologies. Details of the statistical analyses, methods, and data conventions will be described in the SAP. 7.7.1 General Methods Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS® software Version 9.4 or later. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean, the standard deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value. Time -to-event variables will be summarized using percent censored, event rate, and 25th, 50th, 75th and percentiles with 95% CI, if estimable. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Data will be listed in data listings. At each of RI and RW periods and in the LTE -TP, baseline will be the last value before the first dose of study drug within each individual period unless otherwise specified. For change -over-time endpoints in the RW period, by-visit analysis will be performed at each scheduled visit for at least 24 weeks. 7.7.2 Stratified Analysis There will be 2 stratification variables for randomization: • • Oral CS use at RI baseline: yes or no Diagnosis of recurrent idiopathic pericarditis at RI baseline: yes or no When a stratified analysis is used in the analysis and a stratum has no event of interest or no responder, the stratum will be pooled with the other stratum in the same stratification variable. 7.7.3 Testing Hypotheses and Multiplicity Adjustment All statistical tests for the treatment comparison of efficacy endpoints in the RW period will be based on the ITT analysis set with 1 -sided α=0.025. For each endpoint, the null hypothesis is that the effects of rilonacept and placebo are the same. The alternative hypothesis is that ri lonacept is better than the placebo. In order to control the overall 1-sided type I error rate at the 0.025 level, a gatekeeping procedure in combination with Hochberg’s procedure will be applied to testing the primary and major secondary 98 Page 99"

If the 1-sided p-value for testing the primary endpoint is ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect on the primary endpoint will be claimed. Section 7.2.1 provides the order of major secondary endpoints. If the primary endpoint is significant, the first major secondary endpoint, i.e., proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 24 of RW period will be tested at 1 -sided α=0.025. A significant treatment effect on this major secondary endpoint will be claimed if the 1 -sided p -value is ≤0.025. If the treatment effect is not significant on the primary endpoin t, significance on this major secondary endpoint cannot be claimed regardless of the result. If both primary and first major secondary endpoints are significant following the above procedure, the second and third major secondary endpoints defined in Section 7.2.1 will be tested with Hochberg’s procedure at overall 1-sided α=0.025. If both 1-sided unadjusted p-values are ≤0.025, claim significance of rilonacept for both endpoints. If the larger 1 -sided p -value is >0.025, compare the smaller 1 -sided p -value with 0.0125. If the smaller 1 -sided p -value is ≤0.0125, claim significance of rilonacept on this endpoint. 7.7.4 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 22nd Primary analysis of this study will be done after CEC -confirmed pericarditis recurrence AND after all subjects in the RW period have been treated for 24 weeks. The log rank test will be the primary method for the analysis of time to recurrence, stratified by the stratification variables for randomization. A sensitivity analysis will be performed based on the investigator’s judgement of pericarditis recurrence. Additional sensitivity may be defined in the SAP. 7.7.5 7.7.5.1 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Analysis of the Major Secondary Endpoints 1. Proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 24 of the RW period (defined as a weekly average of daily pericarditis pain ≤2.0 on the 11-point NRS and CRP ≤0.5 mg/dL at Week 24). The Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test will be used in this analysis, stratified by the stratification variables for randomization. 2. Percentage of days with minimal or no pain in the first 24 weeks post randomization. Minimal or no pain is defined as non -missing daily NRS ≤1. This endpoint will be analyzed with an analysis of covariance.

CONTRAINDICATIONS 5 5.1 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infections Interleukin -1 (IL -1) blockade may interfere with the immune response to infections. Treatment with another medication that works through inhibition of IL -1 has been associated with an increased risk of serious infecti ons, and serious infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. There was a greater incidence of infections in patients on ARCALYST compared with placebo. In the controlled portion of the study, one infection was reported as severe, which was bronchitis in a patient on ARCALYST. In an open -label extension study, one patient developed bacterial meningitis and died [ see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infectio n. Treatment with ARCALYST should not be initiated in patients with an active or chronic infection. 113 Page 114"
114,page_114,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 In clinical studies, ARCALYST has not been administered concomitantly with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of an IL -1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. Taking ARCALYST with TNF inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections. Drugs that affect the immune system by blocking TNF have been associated with an increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). It is possible that taking drugs such as ARCALYST that block IL - 1 increases the risk of TB or other atypical or opportunistic infections. Healthcare providers should follow current CDC guidelines both to e valuate for and to treat possible latent tuberculosis infections before initiating therapy with ARCALYST. 5.2 Immunosuppression The impact of treatment with ARCALYST on active and/or chronic infections and the development of malignancies is not known [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. However, treatment with immunosuppressants, including ARCALYST, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. 5.3 Immunizations Since no data are available on either the efficacy of live vaccines or on the risks of secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ARCALYST, live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ARCALYST. In addition, because ARCALYST may interfere with normal immune r esponse to new antigens, vaccinations may not be effective in patients receiving ARCALYST. No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccination with inactivated (killed) antigens in patients receiving ARCALYST. Because IL -1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections, it is recommended that prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST adult and pediatric patients receive all recommended vaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza va ccine. (See current Recommended Immunizations schedules at the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html). 5.4 Lipid Profile Changes Patients should be monitored for changes in their lipid profiles and provided with medical treatment if warranted [see Adverse Reactions (6.7) ]. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions associated with ARCALYST administration in the clinical studies were rare. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of ARCALYST should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Six serious adverse reactions were reported by four patients during the clinical program. These serious adverse reactions were Mycobacterium intracellulare infection; gastrointestinal bleeding and colitis; sinusitis and bronchitis; and Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. 114 Page 115"
115,page_115,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 The most commonly reported adverse reaction associated with ARCALYST was injection -site reaction (ISR) [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )]. The next most commonly reported adverse reaction was upper respiratory infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described herein reflect exposure to ARCALYST in 600 patients, including 85 exposed for at least 6 months and 65 exposed for at least one year. These included patients with CAPS, patients with other diseases, and healthy volunteers. Approximately 60 p atients with CAPS have been treated weekly with 160 mg of ARCALYST. The pivotal trial population included 47 patients with CAPS. These patients were between the ages of 22 and 78 years (average 51 years). Thirty -one patients were female and 16 were male. A ll of the patients were White/Caucasian. Six pediatric patients (12 -17 years) were enrolled directly into the open -label extension phase. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Part A of the clinical trial was conducted in patients with CAPS who were naïve to treatment with ARCALYST. Part A of the study was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, six -week study comparing ARCALYST to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 1 reflects the frequency of adverse events reported by at least two patients during Part A.

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 6.2 Injection -Site Reactions In patients with CAPS, the most common and consistently reported adverse event associated with ARCALYST was injection -site reaction (ISR). The ISRs included erythema, swelling, pruritus, mass, bruising, inflammation, pain, edem a, dermatitis, discomfort, urticaria, vesicles, warmth and hemorrhage. Most injection -site reactions lasted for one to two days. No ISRs were assessed as severe, and no patient discontinued study participation due to an ISR. 6.3 Infections During Part A, the incidence of patients reporting infections was greater with ARCALYST (48%) than with placebo (17%). In Part B, randomized withdrawal, the incidence of infections were similar in the ARCALYST (18%) and the placebo patients (22%). Part A of the trial was initiated in the winter months, while Part B was predominantly performed in the summer months. In placebo -controlled studies across a variety of patient populations encompassing 360 patients treated with rilonacept and 179 treated with placebo, the incidence of infections was 34% and 27% (2.15 per patient -exposure year and 1.81 per patient -exposure year), respectively, for rilonacept and placebo. Serious Infections: One patient receiving ARCALYST for an unapproved indication in another s tudy developed an infection in his olecranon bursa with Mycobacterium intracellulare . The patient was on chronic glucocorticoid treatment. The infection occurred after an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection into the bursa with subsequent local exposure to a suspected source of mycobacteria. The patient recovered after the administration of the appropriate antimicrobial therapy. One patient treated for another unapproved indication developed bronchitis/sinusitis, which resulted in hospitalization. One patient died in an open -label study of CAPS from Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. 6.4 Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 6.5 Hematologic Events One patient in a study in an unapproved indication developed transient neutropenia (ANC < 1 x 109/L) after receiving a large dose (2000 mg intravenously) of ARCALYST. The patient did not experience any infection associated with the neutropenia. 6.6 Immunogenicity Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected by an ELISA assay in patients with CAPS after treatment with ARCALYST. Nineteen of 55 patients (35%) who had received ARCALYST for at least 6 weeks tested positive for treatment -emergent bin ding antibodies on at least one occasion. Of the 19, seven tested positive at the last assessment (Week 18 or 24 of the open -label extension period), and five patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies on at least one occasion. There was no correlation of antibody activity and either clinical effectiveness or safety. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to the rilonacept receptor domains in specific assays, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. The observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is 116 Page 117"
117,page_117,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to rilonacept with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.7 Lipid Profiles Cholesterol and lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Patients with CAPS treated with ARCALYST experienced increases in their mean total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The mean increases from baseline for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were 19 mg/dL, 2 mg/dL, 10 mg/dL, and 57 mg/dL respectively after 6 weeks of open -label therapy. Physicians should monitor the lipid profiles of their patients (for example after 2 -3 months) and consider lipid -lowering therapies as needed based upon cardiovascular risk factors and current guidelines. 7 7.1 DRUG INTERACTIONS TNF -Blocking Agent and IL-1 Blocking Agent Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ARCALYST. Concomitant administration of another drug that blocks IL -1 with a TNF -blocking agent in another patient population has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and an increased risk of neutropenia. The concomitant administration of ARCALYST with T NF-blocking agents may also result in similar toxicities and is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The concomitant administration of ARCALYST with other drugs that block IL -1 has not been studied. Based upon the potential for pharmacolog ic interactions between rilonacept and a recombinant IL -1ra, concomitant administration of ARCALYST and other agents that block IL-1 or its receptors is not recommended. 7.2 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL -1) during chronic inflammation. Thus it is expected that for a molecule that binds to IL -1, such as rilonacept, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. This is clinically relevant for CYP45 0 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted (e.g., warfarin). Upon initiation of ARCALYST, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or drug concentratio n should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted as needed. 8 8.1 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of ARCALYST in pregnant women. Based on animal data, ARCALYST may cause fetal harm. An embryo -fetal developmental toxicity study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys treated with 0, 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg given twice a week (highest dose is approximately 3.7-fold higher than the human doses of 160 mg based on body 117 Page 118"
118,page_118,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 surface area). The fetus of the only monkey with exposure to rilonacept during the later period of gestation showed multiple fusion and absence of the ribs and thoracic vertebral bodies and arches. Exposure to rilonacept during this time period was below that expected clinically. Likewise, in the cynomolgus monkey, all doses o f rilonacept reduced serum levels of estradiol up to 64% compared to controls and increased the incidence of lumbar ribs compared to both control animals and historical control incidences. In perinatal and postnatal developmental toxicology studies in the mouse model using a murine analog of rilonacept (0, 20, 100 or 200 mg/kg), there was a 3 -fold increase in the number of stillbirths in dams treated with 200 mg/kg three times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg mainten ance dose based on body surface area). ARCALYST should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic effects. A peri - and post -natal reproductive toxicology study was performed in which mice were subcutaneously administered a murine analog of rilonacept at doses of 20, 100, 200 mg/kg three times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Results indicated an increased inci dence in unscheduled deaths of the F 1 offspring during maturation at all doses tested. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether rilonacept is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ARCALYST is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Six pediatric patients with CAPS between the ages of 12 and 16 were treated with ARCALYST at a weekly, subcutaneous dose of 2.2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 160 mg) for 24-weeks during the open - label extension phase. These patients showed improvement from baseline in their symptom scores and in objective markers of inflammation (e.g. Serum Amyloid A and C -Reactive Protein). The adverse events included injection site reactions and upper respiratory symptoms as were commonly seen in the adult patients. The trough drug levels for four pediatric patients measured at the end of the weekly dose interval (mean 20 mcg/mL, range 3.6 to 33 mcg/mL) were similar to those observed in adult patients with CAPS (mean 24 mcg/mL, range 7 to 56 mcg/mL). Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. When administered to pregnant primates, rilonacept treatment may have contributed to alterations in bone ossification in the fetus. It is not known if ARCALYST will alter bone development in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients treated with ARCALYST should undergo appropriate monitoring for growth and development. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 8.5 Geriatric Use In the placebo -controlled clinical studies in patients with CAPS and other indications, 70 patients randomized to treatment with ARCALYST were 65 years of age, and 6 were 75 years of age. In the CAPS clinical trial, efficacy, safety and tolerability were generally similar in elderly patients as compared to younger adults; however, only ten patients 65 years old participated in the trial. In an open -label extension study of CAPS, a 71 year old woman developed bacterial meningitis and died [see Adverse 118 Page 119"

Age did not appear to have a significant effect on steady -state trough concentrations in the clinical study. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment No formal studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of rilonacept administered subcutaneously in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment No formal studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of rilonacept administered subcutaneously in patients with hepatic impairment. 10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of overdose with ARCALYST. Maximum weekly doses of up to 320 mg have been administered subcutaneously for up to approximately 18 months in a small number of patients with CAPS and up to 6 months in patients with an unapproved indication in clinical trials without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. In addition, ARCALYST given intravenously at doses up to 2000 mg monthly in another patient population for up to six months were tolerated without dose -limiting toxic ities. The maximum amount of ARCALYST that can be safely administered has not been determined. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. 11 DESCRIPTION Rilonacept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the ligand -binding domains of the extracellular portions of the human interleukin -1 receptor component (IL-1RI) and IL -1 receptor accessory protein (IL- 1RAcP) linked in -line to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Rilonacept has a molecular weight of approximately 251 kDa. Rilonacept is expressed in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. ARCALYST is supplied in single -use, 20 -mL glass vials containing a sterile, white to off -white, lyophilized powder. Each vial of ARCALYST is to be reconstituted with 2.3 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. A volume of up to 2 mL can be withdrawn, which is designed to deliver 160 mg for subcutaneous administrat ion only. The resulting solution is viscous, clear, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free from particulates. Each vial contains 220 mg rilonacept. After reconstitution, each vial contains 80 mg/mL rilonacept, 46 mM histidine, 50 mM arginine, 3.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 2.0% (w/v) sucrose, and 1.0% (w/v) glycine at a pH of 6.5 ± 0.3. No preservatives are present. 12 12.1 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action CAPS refer to rare genetic syndromes generally caused by mutations in the NLRP -3 [Nucleotide -binding domain, leucine rich family (NLR), pyrin domain containing 3] gene (also known as Cold -Induced Auto - 119 Page 120"
120,page_120,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 inflammatory Syndrome -1 [CIAS1 ]). CAPS disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with male and female offspring equally affected. Features common to all disorders include fever, urticaria -like rash, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, and conjunctivitis. In most cases, inflammation in CAPS is associated with mutations in the NLRP -3 gene which encodes the protein cryopyrin, an important component of the inflammasome. Cryopyrin regulates the protease caspase -1 and controls the activation of interleukin -1 beta (IL -1β). Mutations in NLRP -3 result in an overactive inflammasome resulting in excessive release of activated IL-1β that drives inflammation. Rilonacept blocks IL-1β signaling by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL-1β and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. Rilonacept also binds IL -1α and IL -1 receptor antagonist (IL -1ra) with reduced affinity. The equilibrium dissociation constants for rilonacept bin ding to IL -1β, IL -1α and IL-1ra were 0.5 pM, 1.4 pM and 6.1 pM, respectively. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Serum Amyloid A (SAA) are indicators of inflammatory disease activity that are elevated in patients with CAPS. Elevated SAA has been associated with the development of systemic amyloidosis in patients with CAPS. Compared to placebo, treatment with ARCALYST resulted in sustained reductions from baseline in mean serum CRP and SAA to normal levels during the clinical trial. ARCALYST also normalized mean SAA from elevated levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The average trough levels of rilonacept were approximately 24 mcg/mL at steady -state following weekly subcutaneous doses of 160 mg for up to 48 weeks in patients with CAPS. The steady -state appeared to be reached by 6 weeks. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. No study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age, gender, or body weight on rilonacept exposure. Based on limited data obtained from the clinical study, steady state trough concentrations were similar between male and female patients. Age (26-78 years old) and body weight (50-120 kg) did not appear to have a significant effect on trough rilo nacept concentrations. The effect of race could not be assessed because only Caucasian patients participated in the clinical study, reflecting the epidemiology of the disease. 13 13.1 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long -term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of rilonacept. The mutagenic potential of rilonacept was not evaluated. Male and female fertility was evaluated in a mouse surrogate model using a murine analog of rilonacept. Male mice were treated beginning 8 weeks prior to mating and continuing through female gestation day 15. Female mice were treated for 2 weeks prior to mating and on gestation days 0, 3, and 6. The murine analog of rilonacept did not alter either male or female fertility parameters at doses up to 200 mg/kg (this dose is approximately 6-fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). 120 Page 121"

Part A was a 6 -week, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group period comparing ARCALYST at a dose of 160 mg weekly after an initial loading dose of 320 mg to placebo. Part B followed immediately after Part A and consisted of a 9 -week, patient -blind period during which all patients received ARCALYST 160 mg weekly, followed by a 9 -week, double -blind, randomized withdrawal period in which patients were randomly assigned to either remain on ARCALYST 160 mg weekly or to receive placebo. Patients were then given the option to enroll in a 24 -week, open -label treatment extension phase in which all patients were treated with ARCALYST 160 mg week ly. Using a daily diary questionnaire, patients rated the following five signs and symptoms of CAPS: joint pain, rash, feeling of fever/chills, eye redness/pain, and fatigue, each on a scale of 0 (none, no severity) to 10 (very severe). The study evaluated the mean symptom score using the change from baseline to the end of treatment. The changes in mean symptom scores for the randomized parallel -group period (Part A) and the randomized withdrawal period (Part B) of the study are shown in Table 2 . ARCALYST -treated patients had a larger reduction in the mean symptom score in Part A compared to placebo -treated patients. In Part B, mean symptom scores increased more in patients withdrawn to placebo compared to patients who remained on ARCALYST. Table 2: Mean Symptom Scores *Differences are adjusted using an analysis of covariance model with terms for treatment and Part A baseline. **A confidence interval lying entirely below zero indicates a statistical difference favoring ARCALYST versus placebo.

In Part A, patients treated with ARCALYST experienced more improvement in each of the five components of the composite endpoint (joint pain, rash, feeling of fever/chills, eye redness/pain, and fatigue) than placebo -treated patients. In Part A, a higher proportion of patients in the ARCALYST group experienced improvement from baseline in the composite score by at least 30% (96% vs. 29% of patients), by at least 50% (87% vs. 8%) and by at least 75% (70% vs. 0%) compared to the placebo group. Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and C -Reactive Protein (CRP) levels are acute phase reactants that are typically elevated in patients with CAPS with active disease. During Part A, mean levels of CRP decreased versus baseline for the ARCALYST treated patients, while there was no change for those on placebo ( Table 3 ). ARCALYST also led to a decrease in SAA versus baseline to levels within the normal range. Table 3.

Discard the vial after a single withdrawal of drug. 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA -approved patient labeling. The first injection of ARCALYST should be performed under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional. If a patient or caregiver is to administer ARCALYST, he/she should be instructed on aseptic reconstitution of the lyophilized product and injection technique. The ability to inject subcutaneously should b e assessed to ensure proper administration of ARCALYST, including rotation of injection sites. (See Patient Information Leaflet for ARCALYST®). ARCALYST should be reconstituted with preservative -free Sterile Water for Injection to be provided by the pharma cy. A puncture -resistant container for disposal of vials, needles and syringes should be used. Patients or caregivers should be instructed in proper vial, syringe, and needle disposal, and should be cautioned against reuse of these items. Injection -site Reactions: Physicians should explain to patients that almost half of the patients in the clinical trials experienced a reaction at the injection site. Injection -site reactions may include pain, erythema, swelling, pruritus, bruising, mass, inflammation, dermatitis, edema, urticaria, vesicles, warmth, and hemorrhage. Patients should be cautioned to avoid injecting into an area that is already swollen or red. Any persistent reaction should be brought to the attention of the prescribing physicia n. Infections: Patients should be cautioned that ARCALYST has been associated with serious, life-threatening infections, and not to initiate treatment with ARCALYST if they have a chronic or active infection. Patients should be counseled to contact their h ealthcare professional immediately if they develop an infection after starting ARCALYST. Treatment with ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Patients should be counseled not to take any IL -1 blocking drug, including AR CALYST, if they are also taking a drug that blocks TNF such as etanercept, infliximab, or adalimumab. Use of ARCALYST with other IL -1 blocking agents, such as anakinra, is not recommended. Vaccinations: Prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST physicians should review with adult and pediatric patients their vaccination history relative to current medical guidelines for vaccine use, including taking into account the potential of increased risk of infection during treatment with ARCALYST. 123 Page 124"

To remove the air bubbles, slowly and gently push in the plunger so only the air is pushed through the needle. 10. Check to make sure that you have the amount of medicine prescribed by your healthcare provider in the syringe. 11. Throw away the ARCALYST vial in the puncture -resistant container even if there is any medicine left in the vial (see Figure 18). Do not use any vial of ARCALYST more than one time. Figure 18 STEP 5: Giving the Injection 1. ARCALYST is given by subcutaneous injection, an injection that is given into the tissue directly below the layers of skin. It is not meant to go into any muscle, vein, or artery. You should change (rotate) the sites and inject in a different place each time in order to keep your skin healthy. 137 Page 138"
138,page_138,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 Rotating injection sites helps to prevent irritation and allows the medicine to be completely absorbed. Ask your healthcare provider any questions that you have about rotating injection sites. • Do not inject into skin that is tender, red, or hard. If an area is tender or feels hardened, cho ose another site for injection until the tenderness or ""hardening"" goes away. Tell your healthcare provider about any skin reactions including redness, swelling, or hardening of the skin. Areas where you may inject ARCALYST include the left and right sides of the abdomen, and left and right thighs. If someone else is giving the injection, the upper left and right arms may also be used for injection (see Figure 19): (Do not inject within a 2-inch area around the navel) • • Figure 19 Choose the area for the injection. Clean the area in a circular motion with a new alcohol wipe. Begin at the center of the site and move outward. Let the alcohol air dry completely. Take the cover off the needle and be careful not to touch the needle. Hold the syringe in one hand like you would hold a pencil. With the other hand gently pinch a fold of skin at the cleaned site for injection (see Figure 20). 2. 3. 4. 5. 138 Page 139"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.0, 26 Sep 2018 Figure 20 Use a quick “dart like” motion to insert the needle straight into the skin (90 degree angle) (see Figure 21). Do not push down on the plunger while inserting the needle into the skin. For small children or persons with little fat under the skin, you may need to hold the syringe and needle at a 45 degree angle (see Figure 21). 6. Figure 21 After the needle is completely in the skin, let go of the skin that you are pinching. With your free hand hold the syringe near its base. Gently pull back the plunger. If blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. Remove the needle, discard the syringe and needle. Start over with “STEP 1: Setting up for an injection” using new supplies (syringes, needles, vials, alcohol swabs and gauze pad). If no blood appears, inject all the medicine in the syringe at a slow, steady rate, pushing the plunger all the way down. It may take up to 30 seconds to inject the entire dose. 7. 8. 9. 10. Pull the needle out of the skin, and hold a piece of sterile gauze over the injection site for several seconds (see Figure 22). 139 Page 140"

DO NOT throw away vials, needles, or syringes in the household trash or recycle. Figure 23 12. Keep the puncture -resistant container out of reach of children. When the container is about two-thirds full, dispose of it as instructed by your healthcare provider. Follow any special state or local laws about the right way to throw away needles and syringes. 13. Used alcohol wipes can be thrown away in the household trash.

Current treatments, utilizing nonspecific inhibitors of inflammation (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], colchicine, corticosteroids [CS]), result in significant morbidity with chronic use. Some patients develop CS dependency or require surgical pericardiectomy to treat the symptoms of their disease. The interleukin -1 (IL -1) pathway plays a major role in the pathophysiology of recurrent pericarditis. Rilonacept (KPL -914) is a recombinant fusion protein that blocks I L-1 signaling. It is currently approved for treatment of another autoinflammatory condition, Cryopyrin -Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS). Based on its IL-1–antagonistic properties and pharmacokinetics (PK), which allow for once -weekly subcutaneous (SC) i njections, it is reasonable to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rilonacept in subjects with recurrent pericarditis to address the unmet need in treatment of this disease. Study Objectives: Primary: To assess the efficacy of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. Secondary: To assess the safety of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis."

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 14 Page 157 Study Population: Subjects eligible for the study are subjects with recurrent pericarditis who do not have pericarditis secondary to prohibited conditions. The study population includes both adult subjects ≥18 years old and pediatric subjects ≥12 and <18 years old with a history of at least 2 prior pericarditis episodes (including the first episode and 1 recurrence). Enrollment of pediatric subjects will be limited to up to 20% of the study population. To be eligible for the study, subjects must present at screening with at least a third pericarditis episode, defined as at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11 -point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and C-reactive protein (CRP) value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) within 7 days prior to first study drug administration. Subjects included in the study may be receiving concomitant NSAIDs and/or colchicine and/or oral CS treatment in any combination, provided that the dosages of these medications have been stable (or not increased) for at least 3 days prior to first administration of study drug, and that changes in medications made within this time period (for inst ance, 1 -time use of NSAIDs) are not anticipated by the investigator to significantly alter assessments of baseline disease activity. Study Design: This study has 5 periods: (1) Screening period , during which assessment of disease characteristics, baseline therapy, and the pre-treatment workup is completed (up to 4 weeks) (2) Single -blind Run-In (RI) period (12 weeks), during which blinded rilonacept is administered SC once weekly in all subjects. The RI period includes the following: • 1-week Stabilization period, during which blinded rilonacept is administered in addition to standard of care (SOC) pericarditis therapy and the ongoing pericarditis episode is treated • 9-week Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues • 2-week Monotherapy period during which subjects who have successfully weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy will continue to receive blinded rilonacept In the single -blind RI period (subjects are blinded regarding the time of transition from the single -blind to the double -blind period), adult subjects ≥18 years old will receive rilonacept as an initial loading dose of 320 mg (2 SC injections of 160 mg each) at the RI baseline visit (2 × 2 ml), followed by a 160 mg (2 ml) SC dose once weekly throughout the RI period. Pediatric subjects (≥12 and <18 years old) will receive an initial loading dose of rilonacept 4.4 mg/kg (2 SC injections of 2.2 mg/kg each) at the RI baseline visit (maximum 2 × 2 ml), and then 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 2 ml) SC once weekly throughout RI period. Subjects who stopped background SOC pericarditis therapy and who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12, defined as the weekly average of daily pericarditis pain score ≤2.0 on the 11 -point NRS within the 7 days prior to and including the day of randomization on RI Week 12/Randomization Withdrawal (RW) baseline and a CRP level ≤0.5 mg/dL at the RI Week 12/RW b aseline visit, will proceed into the double -blind placebo -controlled RW period.

(3) Double -blind placebo -controlled RW period (pericarditis recurrence event -driven duration, with a minimum of 24 weeks), during which subjects who were able to stop background SOC pericarditis therapy and who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12/RW baseline are randomized in a double -blind manner at a 1:1 ratio to the following: • Rilonacept 160 mg (2.2 mg/kg in pediatric subjects) SC injections once weekly • Matching placebo SC injections once weekly Pericarditis Recurrence in the RW Period Pericarditis recurrence is defined as the recurrence of typical pericarditis pain associated with supportive objective evidence of pericarditis. Upon pericarditis recurrence, subjects who report at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 1 1-point NRS and have 1 CRP value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) will receive bailout rilonacept (2 open -label injections of 160 mg rilonacept [or 4.4 mg/kg for pediatric subjects] followed by once-weekly open -label rilonacept SC injections of 160 mg [or 2.2 mg/kg for pediatric subjects]). irrespective of randomized treatment assignment and as soon as at least 5 days have passed since the last study drug injection. Sequential Oral Rescue Therapy (ORT), i.e., analgesics first, then NSAIDs, and then colchicine, can be added if needed at the discretion of the investigator, as outlined in the protocol and Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence and who do not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept will continue blinded study drug until the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept are met or through the end of the RW period. For those subjects, sequential ORT can be added to blinded study drug at the discretion of the investigator, as outlined in the protocol and Pharmacy Manual. All suspected pericarditis recurrence events in the RW period will be formally adjudicated by the Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC), and only events that are confirmed by the CEC as pericarditis recurrences will be used in the Primary Endpoint analysis. (4) Long Term Extension Treatment Period (LTE -TP) (24 weeks), during which all subjects completing the RW period (including subjects transitioned to open -label rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence) will have an option to receive up to 24 weeks of open -label rilonacept 160 mg (or 2.2 mg/kg for pediatric subjects) SC injections once weekly based on their clinical status and at the discretion of the investigator, after signing LTE informed consent. Any subject who, in the opinion of investigator, should not continue open -label rilonacept will be offered participation in the LTE off study drug and after signing LTE informed consent. (5) Long Term Extension Follow -Up Period (LTE -FUP) (24 weeks), during which all subjects in the LTE-TP will be followed in the LTE-FUP for safety and potential pericarditis recurrences."

It acts as a soluble decoy receptor binding IL-1α/IL -1β and prevents their interaction with the IL-1 cell-surface receptor. Study drug (rilonacept or placebo) is supplied in a single use, 20 ml glass vial containing a sterile, white to off -white, lyophilized powder. Each vial is to be reconstituted with 2.3 ml sterile Water for Injection (WFI). A volume up to 2 ml ca n be withdrawn, which is designated to deliver up to 160 mg of rilonacept or up to 2 ml of placebo for SC injection only. The resulting solution is clear, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free of particulates. Each rilonacept vial contains 220 mg of rilonacept lyophilized powder. After reconstitution with 2.3 ml WFI, the rilonacept vial contains 80 mg/ml rilonacept, 40 mM histidine, 50 mM arginine, 3.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 2.0% (w/v) sucrose, and 1.0% (w/v) glycine at a pH of 6.5. No preservatives are present. The first injection of rilonacept loading dose at the RI baseline visit will be administered at the study site by study site staff. The second injection of rilonacept loading dose at the RI baseline visit will be p repared and administered by the subject or the subject’s caregiver after adequate training and under the supervision of study site personnel. Subsequent once -weekly study drug doses will be self -administered SC by the subject or administered to the subject by a trained caregiver as an outpatient SC administration. Sample Size: Approximately 56 subjects (not to exceed 75 subjects) with recurrent pericarditis will be enrolled, which will allow approximately 50 subjects to be randomly assigned to blinded treatment. Statistical Methods: The primary efficacy endpoint is time to pericarditis recurrence, defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first pericarditis recurrence for each subject. Only CEC -confirmed pericarditis recurrence will be considered as an event for the primary efficacy analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be done based on the investigator’s assessment of the pericarditis recurrence. In order to control the overall 1 -sided type I error rate at the 0.025 level, a gatekeeping procedure in combination with Hochberg’s procedure will be applied to testing the primary and major secondary efficacy endpoints. Major secondary efficacy endpoints for the RW period include: • Proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 24 of the RW period • Percentage of days with no or minimal pain (pain ≤1 on the 11-point NRS) in the first 24 weeks of the RW period • Proportion of subjects with absent or minimal pericarditis symptoms (based on the 7-point rating scale of PGIPS) at Week 24 of the RW period Other secondary efficacy endpoints for the RW period include: • Proportion of subjects without pericarditis recurrence in the first 24 weeks of the RW period • Time to pericarditis pain NRS ≥4"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 1 Introduction Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the double -walled sac surrounding the heart. Etiologies of pericarditis include infectious causes (viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic) and non- infectious causes (idiopathic, autoimmune, neoplastic, metabolic, traumatic, post -surgical, and drug- related) ( Adler et al 2015 ). In 80% of cases in developed countries, the cause of pericarditis is either post-viral or “idiopathic” in that it cannot be attributed to a specific condition ( Imazio et al 2010 ; Zayas et al 1995 ). The underlying pathogenesis of recurrent pericarditis remains unclear, although a growing body of evidence suggests that abnormal immune responses pl ay a role in the pathogenic processes. While the adaptive immune system plays a role in autoimmune disorders that manifest with pericarditis as one of the many organ systems involved (such as in systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis), the innate immune system, including interleukin 1 (IL -1) signaling, is often the major effector in autoinflammatory disorders, such as isolated pericarditis ( Baskar et al 2016 ; Brucato et al 2016 ; Imazio et al 2016 , Dinarello et al 2012 ). Diagnosis of pericarditis is based on the presence of typical chest pain (improved by sitting up and leaning forward) along with fever, pericardial friction rub, electrocardiographic changes, pericardial effusion, or elevated levels of inflammation markers (white blood cell [WBC] count, C -reactive protein [CRP], or erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) (Adler et al 2015). The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Pericardial Diseases define an acute pericarditis episode as the presence of at least 2 of the 4 following criteria: pericarditic chest pain, pericardial rubs, new widespread ST -segment elevation or PR -segment depression based on electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and pericardial effusion (new or worsening). Elevations of certain markers of inflammation (i.e., CRP, ESR, and WBC) or evidenc e of pericardial inflammation by an imaging technique (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are used as supportive findings (Adler et al 2015). Recurrent pericarditis is characterized by the recurrence of pericarditis signs and symptoms after a symptom -free period of at least 4 to 6 weeks (Adler et al 2015). Recurrent pericarditis affects 20% to 30% of patients with acute pericarditis ( Imazio 2014 ) and can be debilitating for patients due to pain and limitations in physical function during pericarditis episodes. Pericarditis recurrences result in increased emergency room admissions and hospitalizations. In the United States, 5% of patients presenting to the emergency room with non -ischemic chest pain are diagnosed w ith pericarditis (Agarwal et al 2015 ). The estimated prevalence of recurrent pericarditis in the US and Europe is 70,000 to 160,000 patients including approximately 8,000 to 21,000 patients who are refractory or intoleran t to current therapies or who require long -term administration of corticosteroids (CS) to control their disease (Brucato et al 2016; Lazaros et al 2016 ; Imazio et al 2010; Khandaker et al 2010 ; Imazio et al 2008 ). 30 Page 173"
173,page_173,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 1.1 Current Therapeutic Management of Pericarditis There are no approved therapies for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. Current treatments include nonspecific inhibitors of inflammation, i.e., aspirin, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and CS (Lilly et al 2013 ). Aspirin and other NSAIDs are the first -line approach. Because high doses of aspirin and NSAIDs are often required, consideration must be given to gastric protection therapy, as potential risks of therapy include stomach ulcers and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, as well as renal and cardiovascular toxicity. Colchicine is another mainstay therapy for pericarditis and is commonly used with NSAIDs to hasten the response to NSAIDs an d reduce the risk of subsequent recurrences. However, its use may be associated with the risk of fatal overdosing, significant drug interactions, and neuromuscular toxicity. In addition, approximately 10% to 15% of patients experience significant GI side effects with colchicine, including GI intolerance or severe diarrhea, requiring treatment discontinuation ( Imazio et al 2016 ). Available ESC guidelines stipulate that CS should be prescribed for the management of pericarditis episodes only in cases of incomplete response, intolerance, or contraindications to NSAIDs and colchicine because of their unfavorable long -term benefit -risk profile. Corticosteroid use is associated with side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, avascular bone necrosis, and increased risk for infections ( Imazio et al 2008 ). For the management of pericarditis, CS are usually administered at low to moderate doses and can provide rapid control of symptoms. However, they often require many months of tapering after the normalization of CRP levels. In addition, there is a high rate of pericarditis relapse when CS use is tapered or stopped ( Lotrionte et al 2010 ; Imazio et al 2005; Maisch et al 2004), particularly in the absence of concurrent colchicine treatment. Patients with recurrent pericarditis who are refractory or intolerant to current therapeutic management options or who require long -term administration of CS to control their disease can be particularly challenging to manage. As a last resort, some refractory patients are being referred to the surgical procedure of pericardiectomy, with variable outcomes. Multiple immunosu ppressive medications have been used without consistent benefit (Baskar et al 2016 ). 1.2 Pathogenesis of Recurrent Pericarditis: Role of IL-1 Interleukin -1 is a key cytokine that drives the pathophysiology of many inflammatory processes, and it is implicated as a causative factor in various inflammatory diseases in humans. The two distinct IL -1 genes, IL1A and IL1B , encode IL -1α and IL -1β, respectively. IL -1α and IL -1β bind to the universally -expressed cell surface receptor, IL -1 receptor type -1, triggering a cascade of inflammatory mediators. The precursor form of IL-1α is expressed in keratinocytes, mucous membrane epithelial cells, and organs such as the liver and vascular endothelium in healthy individuals. During pathological states, IL-1α moves to the cell surface or is released after cell death to activate IL-1 receptors in adjacent cells, thus beginning the cascade of sterile inflammation. IL-1β, 31 Page 174"

IL -1 drives the inflammatory cascade in classic autoinflammatory conditions, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) a nd plays a significant role in systemic onset of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Baskar et al 2016 ). IL-1–blocking therapies are effective at controlling end-organ disease and damage in patients with various autoinflammatory disorders, and different strategies to block IL -1 have been used in clinical trials and demonstrated substantial success in controlling episodes of fever and elevations in acute -phase reactants (Cantarini et al 2015). This mechanistic plausibility of IL-1 antagonism in addressing pathophysiology related to the inflammasome extends to other conditions characterized by sterile acute inflammation, such as 32 Page 175 recurrent pericarditis."

(Regeneron) of Tarrytown, NY, and is approved with the trade name ARCALYST® in the US for the treatment of CAPS, including Familial Cold Auto - Inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle -Wells Syndrome (MWS) in adults and children age 12 and older. Rilonacept is currently manufactured and marketed as ARCALYST® by Regeneron. Rilonacept received marketing authorization in t he European Union for the treatment of CAPS with severe symptoms, including FCAS and MWS in adults and children aged 12 years and older, but based on a request from Regeneron, the marketing authorization was withdrawn. The withdrawal was a business decisio n and was not related to any concern with the safety or efficacy of rilonacept. Rilonacept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of human cytokine receptor extracellular domains and the Fc portion of human IgG1. Rilonacept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a total molecular weight of approximately 250 kDa. The dimer is covalently linked by disulfide bonds in the Fc region. Rilonacept incorporates in a single molecule the extracellular domains of both receptors required for IL -1 signaling: t he IL -1 type I receptor (IL -1R1) and the IL -1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1R-AcP) (Figure 1). Rilonacept is expressed in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Rilonacept blocks IL -1 by acting as a soluble deco y receptor that binds IL -1 and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. 33 Page 176"

The available rilonacept safety data is summarized below. Rilonacept has been evaluated in 23 studies, including 22 complete and 1 ongoing. In the completed studies, 2243 subjects (2152 patients and 91 healthy volunteers) were exposed to rilonacept. Thirty of these patients were pediatric (<18 years of age). Doses up to 320 mg subcutaneously (SC) once weekly and 2000 mg intravenously (IV) monthly have been studied for different indications, including CAPS, gout, and other inflammatory disorders. Injection Site Reactions In clinical studies with rilonacept, the most common and consistently reported AE associated with rilonacept was injection site reaction (ISR). The ISRs included erythema, swelling, pruritus, mass, bruising, inflammation, pain, edema, dermatitis, discomfort, urticaria, vesicles, warmth, and hemorrhage. Most ISRs were mild to moderate. In the gout clinical studies, approximately 1% of subjects treated with rilonacept discontinued due to ISRs. Similar results have been seen in other patient populations. Infections Interleukin -1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections. Serious life-threatening infections have been reported in clinical trials in subjects treated with rilonacept. 34 Page 177 CH2 CH3 1 IL"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 Changes in Laboratory Parameters Cholesterol and lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Subjects treated with rilonacept in clinical trials experienced increases in their mean total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected using an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In clinical trials with rilonacept, approximately 30% to 35% of subjects tested positive for treatment -emergent antibodies to rilonacept on at least 1 occasion. Systemic Hypersen sitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions are a potential risk with protein therapeutics in general. In clinical studies with rilonacept, systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been rare. Malignancies The impact of treatment with rilonacept on the development of malignancies is not known. However, treatment with immunosuppressants, including rilonacept, may result in an increase in the risk for malignancies. Fetal Defects There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of rilonacept in pregnant women. Based on animal data, rilonacept may cause fetal harm. An embryo -fetal developmental toxicity study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys treated with 0, 5, 15, or 30 mg/kg given twice a week (highest dose is approximately 3.7 -fold higher than the human dose of 160 mg based on body surface area). The fetus of the only monkey with exposure to rilonacept during the later period of gestation showed multiple fusion and absence of the ribs and thoracic vert ebral bodies and arches. Exposure to rilonacept during this time period was below that expected clinically. Likewise, in the cynomolgus monkey, all doses of rilonacept reduced serum levels of estradiol up to 64% compared to controls and increased the incid ence of lumbar ribs compared to both control animals and historical control incidences. In perinatal and postnatal developmental toxicology studies in the mouse model using a murine analog of rilonacept (0, 20, 100, or 200 mg/kg), there was a 3 -fold increa se in the number of stillbirths in dams treated with 200 mg/kg 3 times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Nonteratogenic effects : A peri - and postnatal reproductive tox icology study was performed in which mice were administered a murine analog of rilonacept at doses of 20, 100, and 200 mg/kg SC 3 times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Results indicated an increased incidence in unscheduled deaths of the F1 offspring during maturation at all doses tested. 35 Page 178"

The study includes a 6 -week Treatment Period in which all the subjects receive once -weekly rilonacept 160 mg SC (2.2 mg/kg for subjects ≥6 and <18 years old) following a loading dose of 320 mg SC in subjects ≥18 years old (4.4 mg/kg in subjects ≥6 and <18 years old) in addition to background pericarditis therapies (NSAIDS, colchicine, CS). After completing the 6 -week Treatment Period and based on response status, the subjects have the option to enter the 18 -week Extension Period during which they continue to receive rilonacept at the same dose, but during which investigators are encouraged to wean and stop background pericarditis medications. The primary objectives of the study are to explore clinical and biochemical endpoints of recurrent pericarditis symptomatology, as well as to assess feasibility to wean from concomitant pericarditis medication in the Extension Period while continuing treatment with rilonacept. The study population includes the following 5 subject categories (Parts): • Part 1 enrolls symptomatic subjects with recurrent idiopathic pericarditis with an elevated marker of systemic inflammation (CRP level >1 mg/dL). Part 2 enrolls symptomatic subjects with recurren t idiopathic pericarditis with CRP level ≤1 mg/dL that, in the opinion of the investigator, can be attributed to concomitant medications (e.g., CS) and with pericardial inflammation present on cardiac MRI confirmed by the imaging core lab. Part 3 enrolls subjects with CS-dependent recurrent idiopathic pericarditis not experiencing symptoms that would meet the diagnostic criteria for a recurrence of pericarditis. Part 4 enrolls symptomatic subjects with recurrent PPS with an elevated marker of syste mic inflammation (CRP level >1 mg/dL). Part 5 enrolls subjects with CS -dependent recurrent PPS not experiencing symptoms that would meet the diagnostic criteria for a recurrence of pericarditis. • • • • Preliminary data in this ongoing study suggest that subjects enrolled in Part 1 experience improvements in pain, CRP levels, and other pericarditis parameters compared to baseline.

This study has 5 periods (Figure 2). 3.1.1 Screening Period (up to 4 weeks) During the screening period, assessment of disease characteristics, baseline therapy, and the pre- treatment workup will be completed during a period of up to 4 weeks. 3.1.2 Single -blind Run-In (RI) Period (12 weeks) During the single -blind RI period, treatment with blinded rilonacept is administered and subjects are weaned off background s tandard of care (SOC) therapy for their pericarditis disease. Subjects will be blinded regarding the time of transition from the single -blind to the double -blind period; i.e., they will not be aware of the duration of the RI period. In the single -blind RI period, subjects ≥18 years old will receive blinded rilonacept as an initial loading dose of 320 mg (2 SC injections of 160 mg each) at the RI baseline visit (2 × 2 ml), followed by a 160 mg (2 ml) SC dose once weekly throughout the RI peri od. Pediatric subjects (≥12 and <18 years old) will receive an initial loading dose of blinded rilonacept 4.4 mg/kg (2 SC injections of 2.2 mg/kg each) at the RI baseline visit (maximum 2 × 2 ml), and then 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 2 ml) SC once weekly throughout the RI period. The RI period includes: • 1-week Stabilization period, during which blinded rilonacept is administered in addition to SOC pericarditis therapy, and the ongoing pericarditis episode is treated. 9-week Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues. The dosages of CS, NSAIDs, and colchicine will be tapered according to the weaning protocol in the Pharmacy Manual (for the purpose of the protocol, aspirin is considered an NSAID). In general, CS doses will be tapered off starting at RI Week 1 and will be withdrawn by RI Week 10 (over a total of 9 weeks). NSAID and colchicine doses will be tapered off starting at RI Week 4 and will be withdrawn by RI Week 10 (over a total of 6 weeks). 2-week Monotherapy period: Subjects who have been successfully weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy will continue to receive blinded rilonacept. • • 37 Page 180"

For definition of Clinical Response, refer to Section 6.2.2 . Subjects who are unable to achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept m,onotherapy at RI Week 12/RW baseline are to be discontinued from study drug, transitioned to SOC pericarditis therapy at the investigator’s discretion, and followed through the end of the RW period. 3.1.3 Double -blind Placebo -controlled RW Period (pericarditis recurrence event -driven duration with a minimum of 24 weeks) During the RW period, subjects who were able to stop background pericarditis medications and who achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept monotherapy at RI Week 12/RW baseline will be randomized 1:1 to double -blinded administration of study drug: • Rilonacept 160 mg (or 2.2 mg/kg in pediatric subjects ≥12 and <18 years old) SC injections once weekly OR Matching placebo SC injections once weekly • Pericarditis Recurrence in the RW Period For the definition of pericarditis recurrence, refer to Section 6.2.3 . Upon pericarditis recurrence, subjects who report at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11 -point Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] and have 1 CRP value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) will receive bailout rilonacept (2 open -label injections of 160 mg rilonacept [or 4.4 mg/kg for pediatric subjects]) irrespective of randomized treatment assignment and as soon as at least 5 days have passed since the last study drug injection. The subjects transitioning to bailout rilonacept will remain blinded to their prior RW period treatment assignment. Sequential Oral Rescue Therapy (ORT), i.e., analgesics first, then NSAIDs, and then colchicine, can be added, if needed, at the discretion of the investigator, as outlined in Section 5.8 .3 and detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 3.1.6 Rationale of Study Design Subjects eligible for this KPL -914-C002 study will be subjects with recurrent pericarditis presenting with an acute pericarditis episode at screening. The KPL -914-C002 study design ensures that during the RI period all subjects will receive rilonacept, a drug with evidence supporting clinical activity based on the preliminary cli nical data with rilonacept from Part 1 of the ongoing Phase 2 proof -of-concept study ( KPL -914-C001 ) obtained to date. During the RI period, pericarditis will be stabilized with symptoms controlled and background pericarditis medications (NSAIDs, colchicine , CS) will be tapered and withdrawn, while rilonacept treatment continues. The design then allows half of the subjects to continue receiving active treatment after having achieved Clinical Response on that treatment, which maximizes subject exposure to a potentially beneficial therapy. The temporary withdrawal of rilonacept (by switching to placebo) in the half of the subjects who were randomly assigned to placebo is expected to result in an accelerated time to pericarditis recurrence and a higher recurrence rate compared to those who continue on active treatment, a finding that demonstrates that the underlying pericarditis etiology is still ongoing and will provide further support for the anticipated observation of the clinical effect of rilo nacept during the RI period of the study. The period of exposure to an ineffective treatment is minimized in this design, as subjects will be removed from blinded treatment when the condition returns to a specified severity (i.e., for having met the criter ia of pericarditis pain ≥4 on the 11 -point NRS and CRP level ≥1 mg/dL) without unblinding them to prior treatment assignment, thus protecting the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. All subjects who meet the pain and CRP criteria described above will b e treated with open -label bailout rilonacept using a loading dose, followed by once-weekly SC injections. In addition, sequential ORT such as NSAIDs and/or colchicine will be allowed upon recurrence at the investigator’s discretion based on the subject’s clinical status, as outlined in Section 5.8.3 and as stipulated in the Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence not meeting criteria for bailout rilonacept, can be treated with sequential ORT based on investigator judgement and as described in protocol Section 5.8.3 and the Pharmacy Manual. If the subject requires the addition of CS treatment to control the pericarditis recurrence, the subject will be discontinued from study drug. All subjects will be followed for the duration of RW period. In summary, the proposed RW trial with rilonacept allows all enrolled subjects an opportunity to receive the active drug during the acute episode of pericarditis yet provides pivotal -quality data on the efficacy of rilonacept in this enriched cohort by subsequently randomly assigning subjects to placebo versus active treatment after they achieve a predefined clinical response. Subjects with pericarditis recurrences after randomization will receive bailout rilonacept treatment and/or sequential ORT according to the protocol. This approach minimizes the exposure to placebo, which is important for a study that requires active disease upon enrollment and includes a pediatri c population. The available regulatory guidance supports the use of an RW study design in the setting of recurrent pericarditis as 41 Page 184"

In the rilonacept development program in CAPS, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammat ory conditions, over 2000 subjects were exposed to rilonacept, including 1650 subjects receiving a rilonacept dose of 160 mg or higher. A total of 103 and 169 subjects were exposed to any rilonacept dose for at least 1 year or 6 months, respectively. Most of the real -life experience with rilonacept comes from the CAPS population treated at this marketed dose. As of March 2018, approximately 365 CAPS patients have been exposed to rilonacept in the post -marketing setting since 2008. The safety data accumulated so far support the benefit/risk ratio for the rilonacept dose intended to be evaluated in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. Based on the preliminary clinical data with rilonacept from Part 1 of the Phase 2 proof of concept study (KPL -914-C001 ) obtained to date, it is expected that rilonacept doses (320 mg followed by 160 mg SC once weekly and corresponding pediatric doses), and evaluated in the KPL -914-C001 study, will consistently provide adequate suppression of clinical inflam matory response, including CRP levels, in patients with recurrent pericarditis. Bailout Rilonacept Dose Subjects who meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence in the RW period of the study ( Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ), irrespective of treatment assignment at randomization, will receive open -label rilonacept (loading dose of 320 mg SC followed by once-weekly SC injections of 160 mg, or the corresponding pediatric doses). The rationale for bailout rilonacept treatment upon pericarditis recurrence for subjects who were randomly assigned to placebo is that rilonacept had controlled their disease activity during the RI period; ther efore, re -initiation of rilonacept is justified to regain control of pericarditis signs and symptoms upon recurrence. Subjects who were randomly assigned to rilonacept and qualify for bailout rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence in the RW period were in itial responders to rilonacept treatment during the RI period; thus it could be assumed that the loss of response during the RW 42 Page 185"
185,page_185,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 period could be due to development of resistance to rilonacept due to different mechanisms, e.g., higher IL -1 levels or a change in rilonacept pharmacokinetics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics. Therefore, re-administration of a loading dose of rilonacept may help to restore Clinical Response. 4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal Criteria 4.1 Selection of Study Population Approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled (and not more than 75 subjects), which will allow at least 50 subjects to be randomized at approximately 50 sites globally. Subjects will be assigned to study drug only if they meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Deviations from the inclusi on and exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability, or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. Subjects eligible for the study are subjects with recurrent pericarditis who do not have pericarditis secondary to prohibited conditions. The study population includes both adult subjects ≥18 years old and pediatric subjects ≥12 and <18 years old with a history of at least 2 pericarditis episodes (including the first episode and 1 recurrence) prior to screening. Enrollment of pediatric subjects will be limited to up to 20% of the study population. To be eligible for the study, subjects must present with at least a third pericarditis episode, defined as at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11-point administration.

Subjects who stopped background SOC pericarditis therapy and who achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept at RI Week 12/RW baseline will be randomly assigned in a double -blind manner to continue to receive blinded rilonacept or matching placebo using a 1:1 allocation ratio. The definition of Clinical Response is provided in Section 6.2.2 . An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to administer the randomization schedule. Biostatistics will generate the randomization schedule using SAS® software Version 9.4 or later (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina) for the IWRS, which will link sequential subject randomization numbers to treatment codes. The randomization schedule will be stratified by 2 factors: • • Oral CS use at baseline (RI baseline, i.e., beginning of RI period): yes or no Diagnosis of recurrent idiopathic pericarditis (RI baseline): yes or no 51 Page 194"

It should be taken only by the subjects participating in the study and as instructed by study site personnel. Guidelines regarding the management of temperature excursions during storage will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. Pediatric dosing is calculated based on body weight in kilograms, not pounds. • • Any study drug error must be promptly reported to the same procedures as for an SAE (Section 6.4.6 ) PVG, in the same way and using the 5.6 Transmission of Infectious Agents The lyophilized study drug is to be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) inside the original carton to protect it from light. Study drug should not be used beyond the date stamped on the label. After reconstitution, study drug may be kept at room temperature, should be protected from light, and should be used within 3 hours of reconstitution. Study drug does not contain preservatives; therefore, unused portions of study drug should be discarded. 5.7 Misuse for Illegal Purposes Rilonacept does not have addicting potential, and the risk of misuse for illegal purposes is minimal. 5.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications Use of all concomitant medications and any changes in concomitant medications will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. The minimum requirement is that drug name and dates of administration are to be recorded. This will include all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, and over-the- counter medications. Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the welfare of the subject during the study may be given at the discretion of the investigator. However, it is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded in full in the eCRF. The initiation of protocol prohibited medication (Section 5.8.6 ) requires discontinuation of study drug. Guidelines regarding the use of concomitant medication will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual and are summarized in the following sections. 56 Page 199"

Anal gesics can be used at the discretion of the investigator during screening activities prior to the first study drug dose, but only after the subject has documented a pericarditis pain level ≥4 on the 11 -point NRS within 7 days prior to and including RI baseline (first administration of study drug). Subjects can enter the study on prednisone (or equivalent dose) not exceeding 60 mg/day for adults and not exceeding 0.5 mg/kg/day (with a maximum dose of 60 mg/day) in pediatric subjects. 5.8.2 Single -blind RI Period • 1-week Stabilization period, during which rilonacept is administered in addition to SOC pericarditis therapy and ongoing pericarditis episode is treated. All concomitant pericarditis medications including NSAIDs, analgesics, colchicine and CS will remain stable, unless the dosing must be decreased or stopped in the judgement of the investigator due to an AE. 9-week background medication Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues. The guidelines for background medication taper and discontinuation will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Corticosteroids Starting at Week 1 and through Week 10, CS will be tapered and discontinued at a rate dependent on the dose at study entry. Analgesics Starting at Week 1 and through Week 10, analgesics (non -opioid and opioid) will be tapered and discontinued. Opioid analgesics can continue beyond Week 10 at stable doses through the end of the RW period if it is not feasible to discontinue them without causing withdrawal symptoms. NSAIDs and Colchicine Starting at Week 4 and through Week 10, NSAIDs and colchicine will be tapered and discontinued. • 57 Page 200"

Because open -label rilonacept can be administered only if at least 5 days have passed from the last blinded study drug administration, the investigators are allowed to use sequential ORT, i.e., analgesics, NSAIDs, and colchicine if necessary at their discretion. The use of those medications will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual; it is briefly given as follows: • Analgesics (including non -opioid and opioid) can be used for pain control prior to completing the diagnostic workup for a recurrent pericarditis episode. The use of analgesics during pericarditis recurrence evaluation will provide pain relief for subjects wi thout impacting their CRP levels or other objective components of the diagnostic workup. • After the diagnostic workup is completed based on the medical monitor’s assessment, NSAIDs followed by colchicine can be added to open -label rilonacept based on the subject’s clinical status and at the discretion of the investigator. If, after transition to open -label rilonacept, the investigator decides that the subject requires CS for pericarditis therapy, the subject will be discontinued fro m rilonacept and followed through the EORW visit. • Subjects not meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept If, based on the investigator’s judgement, the subject is experiencing pericarditis recurrence that does not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept (Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3) but does require additional treatment, the subject will continue blinded study drug, and the investigator should manage the pericarditis recurrence using sequential ORT for pericarditis, i.e ., analgesics, NSAIDs, colchicine as described in the Pharmacy Manual and outlined briefly below: 58 Page 201"

The use of analgesics during pericarditis recurrence evaluation will provide pain relief for subjects without impacting their CRP levels or other objective components of the diagnostic workup. • After the diagnostic workup is completed based on the medical monitor’s assessment, NSAIDs followed by colchicine can be added to blinded study drug based on the subject’s clinical status and at the discretion of the investigator. If, after the addition of NSAIDs and colchicine, the investigator decides that the subject requires CS for pericarditis therapy, the subject will be discontinued from blinded study drug and followed through the EORW visit. • 5.8.4 Long Term Extension Treatment Period (LTE -TP) Subjects who opt to continue open -label rilonacept in the LTE-TP will have their concomitant pericarditis medications managed at the discretion of the investigator and based on the subject’s clinical status.

The RW period is a double -blind period in which rilonacept and placebo are identical in appearance. Neither the subject nor any of the investigator/site staff, , or Sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received (International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] E9). In the event of a pericarditis recurrence that meets the criteria for bailout rilonacept ( Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ), the subject will be transitioned to open -label rilonacept but will remain blinded to their prior RW treatment assignment. At the end of the RW period, all sites and subjects will be unblinded. Subjects will be offered participation in the LTE -TP, in which once -weekly open -label rilonacept can be continued for an additional 24 weeks. 5.9.1 Breaking the Blind A subject’s treatment assignment will not be broken until the end of the RW period. If the treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, the Sponsor must be notified immediately. If the investigator intends to unblind treatment allocation for a subject, then the Sponsor should be notified immediately. The investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case o f an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject. In most cases, the management of a medical emergency would be the same, regardless of whether the subject received active drug. The treatment assignment will be unblinded through the IWRS. The investigator must notify Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals and medical monitors as soon as possible but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded subject, unless that information is important for the safety of subjects currently in the study. The date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded in the eCRF. The PVG staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any subject with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the blinded report may be sent to clinical investigators in accordance with local regulations. 5.10 Treatment Compliance Subjects will record the administration of all doses of study drug (whether as an outpatient or in the clinic) in a subject’s diary. In addition, throughout all study periods, adherence to study drug administration will be assessed by the study site in collaboration with the visiting RN ( Section 6). 60 Page 203"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 6 Study Assessments and Procedures Before performing any study procedures, all potential subjects will provide informed consent or an assent, if applicable. Potential subjects will have the study risks and benefits explained to them, the associated ICF reviewed with them, and all questions answere d for them. Subjects will undergo screening procedures specific to the study only after the ICF has been provided by the subject unless performed as part of SOC practice. The investigator or designee will also sign the ICF. 6.1 Study Visits The schedule of assessments for the study site visits is summarized in the Study Schedule of Activities . Following screening assessments, qualifying subjects will be enrolled and enter the RI period. Subjects who stop background pericarditis medications and achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12 (Section 6.2.2 ), will be randomized and enter the RW period. During both the RI and RW period, a combination of clinic and outpatient visits will occur. Outpatient visits may consist of telephone or virtual contacts as well as home visits conducted by a visiting nurse. For each scheduled visit of the study (including outpatient and clinic), assessment s should occur prior to scheduled injections of study drug. Subjects can be brought to the clinic in place of a scheduled outpatient visit or for an unscheduled visit at the discretion of the investigator. The visit schedule is derived from the day of t he RI baseline visit. One week is equal to 7 calendar days. Although visits do not occur every week, subjects are required to record pericarditis pain NRS measurements on a daily basis in their study device and to administer study drug on a once -weekly basis and record it in their study electronic diary (eDiary). If a subject is unable to independently complete the daily eDiary, a caregiver may help enter the data. Upon completion of the RI and RW periods, all subjects will have the opportunity to contin ue participating in the LTE. This will require each subject again providing informed consent prior to LTE participation. The LTE period will have a treatment period (LTE -TP) and an off treatment follow -up period (LTE -FUP). Any subject who prematurely discontinues study drug will be followed for the duration of the trial as specified in Section 4.2.2 . In addition, throughout all study periods, compliance with study drug administration will be assessed by the site in collaboration with the visiting RN. 6.1.1 Screening: Clinic and Remote as Needed A study screening eCRF is required to be completed for every subject with a signed ICF. For each subject, the subject identification is obtained from the IWRS. It is anticipated that some subjects may have a portion of the study screening procedures done as part of routine care outside the auspices of this study. As long as these procedures were done within the 61 Page 204"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 allotted screening period timeframe, the results of these procedures may be used to support study screening and completion of the study screening eCRF. Any protocol -specified study qualification procedures/tests not already done as part of routine care will need to be conducted after the subject provides informed consent and before enrollment. It is possible that the screening and enrollme nt visit will occur on the same day. The below procedures are required to be completed to screen a subject ≤28 days prior to enrollment. All assessments and procedures are not required to be completed on-site; however, the site is expected to obtain the medical records for subject source documentation. • • • Obtain the ICF. Enter the subject into the IWRS. Review inclusion/exclusion criteria; ensure that the subject has a diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis based and is presenting with at least the third pericarditis episode. Record: demographic information, medical/surgical history, concomitant medications, all prior and current concomitant pericarditis medications, a detailed pericarditis history including all recurrent pericarditis events. Perform a full physical examination (may be performed by an investigator or other healthcare provider designated by the investigator). Perform/obtain: • • • - 11-point pericarditis pain NRS assessment – required to be >4 within 7 days prior to and including the day of RI baseline.

In a substudy at selected sites in approximately 10 subjects, a cardiac MRI will be performed. Note that in case the electronic versions of the PROs and assessments/questionnaires (PGIPS, PGA - PA, SF -36, EQ -5D-5L, and ISI) are not availa ble, the paper forms must be completed until the electronic versions are available again. 6.2.1 6.2.1.1 Individual Efficacy Assessments C-Reactive Protein Central and local laboratory assessments of CRP will be performed at study visits as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. Centrally assayed CRP values will be used for statistical evaluations of changes from baseline. Locally assayed CRP will be used for screening, evaluation of treatment response prior to randomization, and asse ssment of suspected pericarditis recurrence in the RW period. The POC device provided by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals is the preferred method for local laboratory CRP assessment. 77 Page 220"

A validated 11 -point pericardi tis NRS ( Section 13.2 ) will be used to measure the subject’s level of pain intensity on a daily basis throughout the study ( Hawker et al 2011 ; Mannion et al 2007 ; Dworkin et al 2005 ). It is recommended that daily pericarditis pain measurements using the 11 -point NRS are performed by subjects at the same time of the day each day, and prior to study drug injection on days with study drug administration. 6.2.1.3 Electrocardiogram Twelve -lead ECGs will be performed at study visits as described in the Study Schedul e of Activities. Pericarditis commonly involves changes in the electrophysiologic activity of the heart, resulting in typical ECG findings, namely widespread ST-segment elevation or PR-segment depression. 6.2.1.4 Echocardiogram Echocardiographic assessment of presence of pericardial effusion including new or worsening of pericardial effusion should be obtained at study visits as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. Pericardial effusion is characterized by accumulation of excess fluid in the pericardial space surrounding the heart, and pericarditis is one of the main causes of pericardial effusion. Echocardiography is a sensitive tool and the most widely used imaging technique for the detection of pericardial effusion and/or thickening. Echocardiograms are to be acquired per the ECHO core imaging parameters. Upon local assessment and interpretation, the ECHO is then to be submitted to the designated central imaging laboratory. 6.2.1.5 Patient Global Impression of Pericarditis Severity Patient Global Impression questionnaires have been developed for a variety of indications. The PGIPS is a single -item PRO measure that assesses the subject’s impression of overall severity of pericarditis symptoms at the time the questionnaire is administered, using a 7 -point rating scale ranging from absent (no recurrent pericarditis symptoms) to very severe (recurrent pericarditis symptoms cannot be ignored) (Guy 1976 ). The PGIPS can be completed in less than 30 seconds. The subject will select the box that best describes the severity of pericarditis symptoms right now: Absent: no symptoms Minimal: can be easily ignored without effort Mild: can be ignored with effort Moderate: cannot be ignored but does not influence my daily activities Moderately severe: cannot be ignored and occasionally limits my daily activities 78 Page 221"

The PGA -PA is a single -item clinician -reported outcome measure that investigators use to rate their impression of the patient’s overall pericarditis disease activity at the time the assessment is completed, using a 7 -point rating scale ranging from absent to very severe ( Guy 1976 ). Like the PGIPS, the PGA -PA can be completed in less than 30 seconds. The investigator will select the box that best describes subject’s pericarditis activity right now. Absent Minimal Mild Moderate Moderately severe Severe Very severe The PGA -PA will be collected as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. 6.2.1.7 36-Item Short Form Health Survey The SF -36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality -of-life measures. The SF -36 was developed at RAND Corporation as part of its Medical Outcomes Study. The SF-36 assesses 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, general mental health, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. SF-36 will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. 6.2.1.8 EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health - related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ- 5D-5L consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The rating scale records the subject’s self-rated health on a vertical VAS. This can be used as a quantitative 79 Page 222"

The scores on these 5 dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles (https://euroqol.org/eq -5d-instruments). The EQ-5D-5L will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in Study Schedule of Activities . 6.2.1.9 Insomnia Severity Index The ISI is a 7 -item self -report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. The usual recall peri od is the “last 2 weeks” and the dimensions evaluated are severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5 -point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0=no problem; 4=very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: no clin ically significant insomnia (0 –7); subthreshold insomnia (8 –14); clinical (moderate) insomnia (15–21); and clinical (severe) insomnia (22–28) (Morin et al 2011 ). The ISI will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in Study Schedule of Activities. 6.2.1.10 Cardiac MRI Cardiac MRI will be performed as described in the Study Schedule of Activities at selected sites in approximately 10 subjects in the cardiac MRI substudy. Cardiac MRI will be performed to assess any changes in pericardial inflammation. Cardiac MRI readings will be performed by a central imaging laboratory. The study site/clinic reading of the MRI at the time of the examination may be used by the investigator for clinical decisi on-making. 6.2.2 Assessment of Clinical Response at the End of the Run -In Period Week 12/RW Baseline At RI Week 12/RW baseline visit, all subjects receiving rilonacept who are able to discontinue background SOC pericarditis therapy during the RI period ( Section 3.1 ) are assessed for Clinical Response. Only subjects who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12 and have discontinued background medications for pericarditis are eligible for randomization in the RW period. Clinical Response at RI Week 12 is defined as follows: • A weekly average of daily pericarditis pain of ≤2.0 on the 11-point NRS during the 7 days prior to and including the day of randomization, AND CRP level ≤0.5 mg/dL at the RI Week 12/RW baseline visit. • 80 Page 223"

At any time point during the RW period, subjects who experience suspected recurrence of their pericarditis will have been instructed to inform their site investigator as soon as possible. Subjects who experience a suspected recurrence of pericarditis symptoms will be requested to report to the study site/clinic for a scheduled or unscheduled visit, during which clinical assessments will be performed to gather all the necessary diagnostic data to confirm or rule out the presence of pericarditis recurrence (Section 6.1.6.1 ). The investigator will evaluate all assessments performed for a diagnostic workup, whether at the study site or at locations outside. Upon completion of pericarditis workup, the investigator is required to contact the medical monitor to confirm that the protocol required diagnostic workup is complete prior to implementing treatment for the event. Following communication with the medical monitor, if the event meets the criteria for bailout rilonacept (at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11-point NRS and one CRP value ≥1 mg/dL either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days), and after the medical monitor has confirmed with the investigator that the diagnostic workup is complete, the attainment of bailout criteria is confirmed in the IWRS, blinded study drug is discontinued, and open -label rilonacept treatment is dispensed. If needed, sequential ORT is allowed as outlined in Section 5.8.3. The subject will continue to be followed up according to the Study Schedule of Activities for the RW period. Following communication with the medical monitor, if the event does not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept but in the judgement of investigator requires treatment, after the medical monitor has confirmed with the investigator that the diagnostic workup is complete, the investigator is allowed to add sequential ORT to blinded study drug, and as outlined in Section 5.8.3. Blinded study drug treatment will continue until a pericarditis recurrence that meets criteria for bailout rilonacept, or until the end of the RW period. For a summary of management of suspected pericarditis recurrence, refer to Figure 3. Upon suspected pericarditis recurrence, the event is required to be captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system within 24 hours of learning of the event, and a pericarditis recurrence event adjudication package must be prepared for adjudication by CEC. The event package will include, but may not be limited to, data on the subject’s pericarditis pain level, CR P value, ECG tracing, ECHO result, the presence or absence of pericardial rub, and any additional source documentation relevant to 81 Page 224"

Body weight and height will be measured as per the Study Schedule of Activities and will be recorded in the eCRF. Any abnormality identified at baselin e should be recorded on the medical history and physical examination eCRFs. At selected visits as specified in the Study Schedule of Activities, an abbreviated physical examination will be performed to evaluate vital signs, lung and heart sounds, including evaluation for pericardial rub. At all visits at the study site, limited symptom -directed physical examinations may need to be performed in order to determine changes from baseline or abnormalities and should be recorded in the subject’s trial notes. New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs on the Adverse Event eCRF. 6.3.2 Vital Signs Vital signs include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and temperature. B lood pressure measurements should be obtained after the subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes. 6.3.3 Chest X-ray Chest x -rays in accordance with local requirements will be obtained at screening (or an existing chest x-ray within 12 weeks of first study drug administration can be used) according to the Study Schedule of Activities. Chest x -rays should be reviewed by a qualified radiologist for clinically significant abnormalities and evidence of pulmonary disease that would exclude the potential subject. 6.3.4 Tuberculosis Screening An IGRA test or another TB test based on acceptable clinical practice in each country will be performed in order to evaluate for the presence of active or latent TB infection at screening. 6.4 Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the study, regardless of their relationship to study drug or their clinical significance. 6.4.1 6.4.1.1 Definitions Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 83 Page 226"
226,page_226,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 An AE can therefore be any unfavorable sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the u se of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs also include: any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug; abnormal laboratory findings considered by the reporting investigator to be clinically significant; and any untoward medical occurrence. 6.4.1.2 Treatment -emergent Adverse Event A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before exposure to the study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after exposure to the study drug. 6.4.1.3 Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any dose: • Results in death . Includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to the study drug (e.g., car accident where the subject is a passenger). Is life-threatening . In the view of the investigator, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event at the time of the event (i.e., it does not include an AE that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form). Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization. (Complications occurring during hospitalization are AEs and are SAEs if they cause prolongation of the current hospitalization. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing non-worsening condition is not, however, considered an AE. The details of such pre -existing condition must be recorded on the medical history or physical examination page of the eCRF. Hospitalization is defined as an admission to the hospital ward, a short -stay type unit, or Emergency Room for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital stay longer than originally anticipated for the event or development of a new AE as determined by the Investigator or treating physician.) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . (An AE is incapacitating or disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions.) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Is an important medical event . Important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other se rious outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse). 84 • • • • • Page 227"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 In addition, medical and scientific judgment is required to decide if prompt notification is required in situations other than those defined for SAEs above, i.e., any event that the investigator regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but may have jeopardized the subject or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed a bove, or that would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution that may be associated with the use of the study drug. All SAEs that occur after signing of study -related informed consent, whether or not the SAEs are related to the study drug or study procedures, must be reported. 6.4.1.4 Adverse Event of Special Interest An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is defined as an AE of scientific and medical interest specific to the understanding of the study drug and requiring close monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the Sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non -serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing analysis of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of the study drug. Treatments with immunosuppressants, including rilonacept, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. Therefore, malignancy is an AESI for rilonacept. Any AE of malignancy (excluding basal cell carcinoma of the skin) requires reporting to the Pharmacovigilance (PHV) within 24 hours after the time the site personnel first learn about the event, following the process as described in Section 6.4.6 . 6.4.1.5 Adverse Reaction Any noxious and unintended response to the study drug (i.e., where a causal relationship between the study drug and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reaction. 6.4.1.6 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is an adverse reaction that is “unexpected”, i.e., it is not listed (or not listed at the severity that has been observed) in the designated Reference Safety Information of the Investigator’s Brochure. Evaluation and reporting requirements for SUSARs are detailed in Section 6.4.8 . 6.4.2 6.4.2.1 Assessing Adverse Events Relationship to Study Drug The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to the study drug is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. 85 Page 228"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 The relationship or association of the study drug in causing or contributing to the AE will be characterized by investigator using the following classification and criteria: • Not Related : when the AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedure/conditions Unlikely Related : when the temporal association between the AE and the study drug is such that the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE Possibly Related : when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequ ence from the time of study drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedures/conditions Related : when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause -effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced • • • 6.4.2.2 Intensity The severity of an AE will be recorded as one of the following: • Mild : easily tolerated, does not interfere with normal daily activities, does not require intervention Moderate : causes some interference with daily activities; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated Severe : as a consequence of the event, daily activities are limited or completely halted; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated • • Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 6.4.3 Recording Adverse Events Each subject should be monitored for the development of any AEs. This information should be collected by asking nonleading questions (such as “How are you feeling?”) and from observations of and conversations with patients. AEs may also be collected by direct p hysical exam, diagnostic procedures, or any other appropriate source. At every study visit (telephone or at the site), subjects will be asked a standard nonleading question to elicit any medically related changes in their well -being. They will also be a sked if they have been admitted to the hospital, had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over-the-counter medications). 86 Page 229"

Any clinically relevant (as determined by the investigator) deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and in the eCRF. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. Also, when possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. Information to be collected includes the following: • • • • • • • • • Event term Date and time of onset Investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship study drug Date of resolution of the event Seriousness Any required treatment or actions Outcome Whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study drug.

If an ISR is observed, the subject may be treated at the discretion of the investigator. Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all AEs. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened but does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. 6.4.3.1 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject or reported in response to the open question from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of a diagnosis is preferred (when possible) to the recording of a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 87 Page 230"

Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia vs low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically significant findings on examinations and tests should be reported as AEs. Any new or aggravated clinically significant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. 6.4.3.3 Pericarditis Disease Related Events Signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings associated with pericarditis are to be captured as a pericarditis recurrence event rather than as an AE unless the event is more severe than expected for the subject. In any case, pericarditis recurrence is required to be captured in the eCRF (see Section 6.2.3 ) within 24 hours of learning of the event. 6.4.4 Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events Adverse events will be assessed from the time the subjects signs the ICF and through the duration of the study, or at least through the SFU period (6 weeks after the last dose of study drug). 6.4.5 Follow -Up of Unresolved Adverse Events Every reasonable effort will be made to follow subjects who have AEs. Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s SFU visit are to be followed up by the investigator until resolution or for as long as medically indicated. Additional information for any subject with an ongoing AE at the end of the SFU period may be requested by the PHV, as needed. 6.4.6 Reporting Serious Adverse Events Any AE that meets SAE criteria (Section 6.4.1.3 ) must be reported to the PHV using the EDC system, immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) after the time site personnel first learn about the event. In the event the EDC entry is not possible (e.g., system failure or access problems), the study site should complete the paper SAE report form and fax the form to the PHV within 24 hours of awareness. The EDC system should be updated as soon as it is available. A full description of every SAE will need to be provided to the PHV (this may be supported by source documentation such as discharge summary or laboratory report should these documents be requested by the PHV). Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should be sent to the PHV as soon as possible and placed with the original SAE information. 88 Page 231"

239,page_239,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 Given these assumptions, a total of 22 adjudicated pericarditis recurrence events is required to achieve the power. About 25 subjects per arm (a total of 50 subjects) will be randomized. Considering 10% of subjects in the RI period that will not reach the RW period, approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Patient enrollment and the pericarditis recurrence event accrual will be closely monitored during the study. The monitoring activities will be done in a blinded fashion during the RW period. If the number of patients randomized is less than 50 and/or the time anticipated for the number of events required for the analysis of pri mary efficacy endpoint significantly exceeds the projected timeline, additional patients may be enrolled and/or randomized at Kiniksa Pharmaceutical’s discretion. However, at this time it is anticipated that no more than 75 subjects will be enrolled into t his study. Since the data cutoff will be the event date of the 22nd adjudicated pericarditis recurrence AND all subjects still in the RW period have been treated for 24 weeks, the actual power could be higher if the assumed hazard ratio holds. 7.5 Analysis Sets The following analysis sets will be used in the statistical analyses. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: All subjects who are randomized in the RW period will be included in the ITT analysis set. The primary analysis for efficacy endpoints in the RW period will be based on the ITT analysis set. Treatment comparisons for all ITT analyses will be based on each subject’s treatment assignment from randomization. Safety Analysis Set: All subjects who take at least 1 dose of study dru g in the RI period will be included in the safety analysis set (SS). Safety analyses will be based on the actual treatment a subject received. Run-in Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the RI period will be included in the RI analysis set (RIS). Per-protocol Analysis Set : The per protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set with the exclusion of subjects with major protocol violations or violations that may potentially bias statistical analyses or the ethical conduct of the study. The criteria of these violations will be determined prior to unblinding. This analysis set may be used for sensitivity analyses for efficacy endpoints in the RW period. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: The PK analysis set includes subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have at least 1 PK sample. The PK analysis set will be used for all PK analyses. 97 Page 240"

These analyses are for the RW period only. Details will be provided in the SAP. 7.7 Statistical Analysis Methodology This section outlines the overall methodologies. Details of the statistical analyses, methods, and data conventions will be described in the SAP. 7.7.1 General Methods Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS® software Version 9.4 or later. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean, the standard deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value. Time -to-event variables will be summarized using percent censored, event rate, and 25th, 50th, 75th and percentiles with 95% CI, if estimable. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Data will be listed in data listings. At each of RI and RW periods and in the LTE -TP, baseline will be the last value before the first dose of study drug within each individual period unless otherwise specified. For change -over-time endpoints in the RW period, by-visit analysis will be performed at each scheduled visit for at least 24 weeks. 7.7.2 Stratified Analysis There will be 2 stratification variables for randomization: • • Oral CS use at RI baseline: yes or no Diagnosis of recurrent idiopathic pericarditis at RI baseline: yes or no When a stratified analysis is used in the analysis and a stratum has no event of interest or no responder, the stratum will be pooled with the other stratum in the same stratification variable. 7.7.3 Testing Hypotheses and Multiplicity Adjustment All statistical tests for the treatment comparison of efficacy endpoints in the RW period will be based on the ITT analysis set with 1 -sided α=0.025. For each endpoint, the null hypothesis is that the effects of rilonacept and placebo are the same. The alternative hypothesis is that ri lonacept is better than the placebo. In order to control the overall 1-sided type I error rate at the 0.025 level, a gatekeeping procedure in combination with Hochberg’s procedure will be applied to testing the primary and major secondary 98 Page 241"

If the 1-sided p-value for testing the primary endpoint is ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect on the primary endpoint will be claimed. Section 7.2.1 provides the order of major secondary endpoints. If the primary endpoint is significant, the first major secondary endpoint, i.e., proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 24 of RW period will be tested at 1 -sided α=0.025. A significant treatment effect on this major secondary endpoint will be claimed if the 1 -sided p -value is ≤0.025. If the treatment effect is not significant on the prim ary endpoint, significance on this major secondary endpoint cannot be claimed regardless of the result. If both primary and first major secondary endpoints are significant following the above procedure, the second and third major secondary endpoints defined in Section 7.2.1 will be tested with Hochberg’s procedure at overall 1-sided α=00.52. If both 1-sided unadjusted p-values are ≤0.025, claim significance of rilonacept for both endpoints. If the larger 1-sided p-value is >0.025, compare the smaller 1-sided p-value with 0.0125. If the smaller 1-sided p-value is ≤0.0125, claim significance of rilonacept on this endpoint. 7.7.4 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 22nd Primary analysis of this study will be done after CEC -confirmed pericarditis recurrence AND after all subjects in the RW period have been treated for 24 weeks. The log rank test will be the primary method for the analysis of time to recurrence, stratified by the stratification variables for randomization. A sensitivity analysis will be performed based on the investigator’s judgement of pericarditis recurrence. Additional sensitivity may be defined in the SAP. 7.7.5 7.7.5.1 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Analysis of the Major Secondary Endpoints 1. Proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 24 of the RW period (defined as a weekly average of daily pericarditis pain ≤2.0 on the 11-point NRS and CRP ≤0.5 mg/dL at Week 24).

CONTRAINDICATIONS 5 5.1 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infections Interleukin -1 (IL -1) blockade may interfere with the immune response to infections. Treatment with another medication that works through inhibition of IL-1 has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and serious infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST [ see Clinical Studies (14)]. There was a greater incidence of infections in patients on ARCALYST compared with placebo. In the controlled portion of the study, one infection was reported as severe, which was bronchitis in a patient on ARCALYST. In an open -label extension study, one patient developed bacterial meningitis and died [ see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Treatment with ARCALYST should not be initiated in patients with an active or chronic infection. 113 Page 256"
256,page_256,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 In clinical studies, ARCALYST has not been administered concomitantly with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of an IL -1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. Taking ARCALYST with TNF inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections. Drugs that affect the immune system by blocking TNF have been associated with an increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). It is possible that taking drugs such as ARCALYST that block IL - 1 increases the risk of TB or other atypical or opportunistic infections. Healthcare providers should follow current CDC guidelines both to evaluate for and to treat possible latent tuberculosis infections before initiating therapy with ARCALYST. 5.2 Immunosuppression The impact of treatment with ARCALYST on active and/or chronic infections and the development of malignancies is not known [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. However, treatment with immunosuppressants, including ARCALYST, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. 5.3 Immunizations Since no data are available on either the efficacy of live vaccines or on the risks of secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ARCALYST, live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ARCALYST. In addition, because ARCALYST may interfere with normal immune response to new antigens, vaccinations may not be effect ive in patients receiving ARCALYST. No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccination with inactivated (killed) antigens in patients receiving ARCALYST. Because IL -1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections, it is recommended that prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST adult and pediatric patients receive all recommended vaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine. (See current Recommended Immunizations schedules at the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html). 5.4 Lipid Profile Changes Patients should be monitored for changes in their lipid profiles and provided with medical treatment if warranted [see Adverse Reactions (6.7) ]. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions associated with ARCALYST administration in the clinical studies were rare. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of ARCALYST should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Six serious adverse reactions were reported by four patients during the clinical program. These serious adverse reactions were Mycobacterium intracellulare infection; gastrointestinal bleeding and colitis; sinusitis and bronchitis; and Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. 114 Page 257"
257,page_257,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 The most commonly reported adverse reaction associated with ARCALYST was injection -site reaction (ISR) [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The next most commonly reported adverse reaction was upper respiratory infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described herein reflect exposure to ARCALYST in 600 patients, including 85 exposed for at least 6 months and 65 exposed for at least one year. These included patients with CAPS, patients with other diseases, and healthy volunteers. Approximately 60 patients with CAPS have been treated weekly with 160 mg of ARCALYST. The pivotal trial population included 47 patients with CAPS. These patients were between the ages of 22 and 78 years (average 51 years). Thirty -one patients were female and 16 were mal e. All of the patients were White/Caucasian. Six pediatric patients (12 -17 years) were enrolled directly into the open -label extension phase. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Part A of the clinical trial was conducted in patients with CAPS who were naïve to treatment with ARCALYST. Part A of the study was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, six-week study comparing ARCALYST to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Most injection -site reactions lasted for one to two days. No ISRs were assessed as severe, and no patient discontinued study participation due to an ISR. 6.3 Infections During Part A, the incidence of patients reporting infections was greater with ARCALYST (48%) than with placebo (17%). In Part B, randomized withdrawal, the incidence of infections were similar in the ARCALYST (18%) and the placebo patients (22%). Part A of the trial was initiated in the winter months, while Part B was predominantly performed in the summer months. In placebo -controlled studies across a variety of patient populations encompassing 360 patients treated with rilonacept and 179 treated with placebo, the incidence of infections was 34% and 27% (2.15 per patient -exposure year and 1.81 per patient -exposure year), respectively, for rilonacept and placebo. Serious Infections: One patient receiving ARCALYST for an un approved indication in another study developed an infection in his olecranon bursa with Mycobacterium intracellulare . The patient was on chronic glucocorticoid treatment. The infection occurred after an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection into the burs a with subsequent local exposure to a suspected source of mycobacteria. The patient recovered after the administration of the appropriate antimicrobial therapy. One patient treated for another unapproved indication developed bronchitis/sinusitis, which resulted in hospitalization. One patient died in an open -label study of CAPS from Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. 6.4 Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 6.5 Hematologic Events One patient in a study in an unapproved indication developed transient neutropenia (ANC < 1 x 109/L) after receiving a large dose (2000 mg intravenously) of ARCALYST. The patient did not experience any infection associated with the neutropenia. 6.6 Immunogenicity Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected by an ELISA assay in patients with CAPS after treatment with ARCALYST. Nineteen of 55 patients (35%) who had received ARCALYST for at least 6 weeks tested positive for treatment -emergent binding antibodies on at least one occasion. Of the 19, seven tested positive at the last assessment (Week 18 or 24 of the open -label extension period), and five patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies on at least one occasion. There was no correlation of antibody activity and either clinical effectiveness or safety. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to the rilonacept receptor domains in specific assays, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. The observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is 116 Page 259"
259,page_259,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to rilonacept with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.7 Lipid Profiles Chole sterol and lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Patients with CAPS treated with ARCALYST experienced increases in their mean total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The mean increases from basel ine for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were 19 mg/dL, 2 mg/dL, 10 mg/dL, and 57 mg/dL respectively after 6 weeks of open -label therapy. Physicians should monitor the lipid profiles of their patients (for example after 2 -3 months) and consider lipid -lowering therapies as needed based upon cardiovascular risk factors and current guidelines. 7 7.1 DRUG INTERACTIONS TNF -Blocking Agent and IL-1 Blocking Agent Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ARCALYST. Concomitant administration of another drug that blocks IL -1 with a TNF -blocking agent in another patient population has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and an increased risk of neutropenia. The concomitant administration of ARCALYST with TNF-blocking agents may also result in similar toxicities and is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The concomitant administration of ARCALYST with other drugs that block IL -1 has not been studied. Based upon the potential for pharmacologic interactions between rilonacept and a recombinant IL -1ra, concomitant administration of ARCALYST and other agents that block IL-1 or its receptors is not recommended. 7.2 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL -1) during chronic inflammation. Thus it is expected that for a molecule that binds to IL -1, such as rilonacept, th e formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted (e.g., warfarin). Upon initiation of ARCALYST, in patients being treated with thes e types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or drug concentration should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted as needed. 8 8.1 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of ARCALYST in pregnant women. Based on animal data, ARCALYST may cause fetal harm. An embryo -fetal developmental toxicity study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys treated with 0, 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg given twice a week (highest dose is approximately 3.7-fold higher than the human doses of 160 mg based on body 117 Page 260"
260,page_260,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 surface area). The fetus of the only monkey with exposure to rilonacept during the later period of gestation showed multiple fusion and absence of the ribs and thoracic vertebral bodies and arches. Exposure to rilonacept during this time period was below that expected clinically. Likewise, in the cynomolgus monkey, all doses of rilonacept reduced serum levels of estradiol up to 64% compared to controls and increased the incidence of lumbar ribs compared to both control animals and historical control incidences. In perinatal and postnatal developmental toxicology studies in the mouse model using a murine analog of rilonacept (0, 20, 100 or 200 mg/kg), there was a 3 -fold increase in the number of stillbirths in dams treated with 200 mg/kg three tim es per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). ARCALYST should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic effects. A peri - and post -natal reproductive toxicology study was performed in which mice were subcutaneously administered a murine analog of rilonacept at doses of 20, 100, 200 mg/kg three times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher th an the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Results indicated an increased incidence in unscheduled deaths of the F 1 offspring during maturation at all doses tested. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether rilonacept is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ARCALYST is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Six pediatric patients with CAPS between the ages of 12 and 16 were treated with ARCALYST at a weekly, subcutaneous dose of 2.2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 160 mg) for 24 -weeks during the open - label extension phase. These patients showed improvement from baseline in their symptom scores and in objective markers of inflammation (e.g. Serum Amyloid A and C -Reactive Protein). The adverse events included injection site reactions and upper respiratory symptoms as were commonly seen in the adult patients. The trough drug levels for four pediatric patients measured at the end of the weekly dose interval (mean 20 mcg/mL, range 3.6 to 33 mcg/mL) were similar to those observed in adult patients with CAPS (mean 24 mcg/mL, range 7 to 56 mcg/mL). Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been est ablished. When administered to pregnant primates, rilonacept treatment may have contributed to alterations in bone ossification in the fetus. It is not known if ARCALYST will alter bone development in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients treated with ARCALYST should undergo appropriate monitoring for growth and development. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 8.5 Geriatric Use In the placebo -controlled clinical studies in patients with CAPS and other indications, 70 patients randomized to treatment with ARCALYST were 65 years of age, and 6 were 75 years of age. In the CAPS clinical trial, efficacy, safety and tolerability were generally similar in elderly patients as compared to younger adults; how ever, only ten patients 65 years old participated in the trial. In an open -label extension study of CAPS, a 71 year old woman developed bacterial meningitis and died [see Adverse 118 Page 261"
261,page_261,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 Reactions (6.3) ]. Age did not appear to have a significant effect on steady -state trough concentrations in the clinical study. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment No formal studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of rilonacept administered subcutaneously in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment No formal studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of rilonacept administered subcutaneously in patients with hepatic impairment. 10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of overdose with ARCALYST. Maximum weekly doses of up to 320 mg have been administered subcutaneously for up to approximately 18 months in a small number of patients with CAPS and up to 6 months in patients with an unapproved indication in clinical trials without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. In addition, ARCALYST given intravenously at doses up to 2000 mg monthly in another patient population for up to six months were tolerated without dose -limiting toxicities. The maximum amount of ARCALYST that can be safely administered has not been determined. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. 11 DESCRIPTION Rilonacept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the ligand -binding domains of the extracellular portions of the human interleukin -1 receptor component (IL-1RI) and IL -1 receptor accessory protein (IL- 1RAcP) linked in -line to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Rilonacept has a molecular weight of approximately 251 kDa. Rilonacept is expressed in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. ARCALYST is supplied in single -use, 20 -mL glass vials containing a sterile, white to off -white, lyophilized powder. Each vial of ARCALYST is to be reconstitute d with 2.3 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. A volume of up to 2 mL can be withdrawn, which is designed to deliver 160 mg for subcutaneous administration only. The resulting solution is viscous, clear, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free from p articulates. Each vial contains 220 mg rilonacept. After reconstitution, each vial contains 80 mg/mL rilonacept, 46 mM histidine, 50 mM arginine, 3.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 2.0% (w/v) sucrose, and 1.0% (w/v) glycine at a pH of 6.5 ± 0.3. No preservatives are present. 12 12.1 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action CAPS refer to rare genetic syndromes generally caused by mutations in the NLRP -3 [Nucleotide -binding domain, leucine rich family (NLR), pyrin domain containing 3] gene (also known as Cold -Induced Auto - 119 Page 262"
262,page_262,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 inflammatory Syndrome -1 [CIAS1 ]). CAPS disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with male and female offspring equally affected. Features common to all disorders include fever, urticaria -like rash, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, and conjunctivitis. In most cases, inflammation in CAPS is associated with mutati ons in the NLRP -3 gene which encodes the protein cryopyrin, an important component of the inflammasome. Cryopyrin regulates the protease caspase -1 and controls the activation of interleukin -1 beta (IL -1β). Mutations in NLRP -3 result in an overactive inflam masome resulting in excessive release of activated IL-1β that drives inflammation. Rilonacept blocks IL-1β signaling by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL-1β and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. Rilonacept also binds IL-1α and IL -1 receptor antagonist (IL -1ra) with reduced affinity. The equilibrium dissociation constants for rilonacept binding to IL -1β, IL -1α and IL-1ra were 0.5 pM, 1.4 pM and 6.1 pM, respectively. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics C-Reactive Protein (CRP ) and Serum Amyloid A (SAA) are indicators of inflammatory disease activity that are elevated in patients with CAPS. Elevated SAA has been associated with the development of systemic amyloidosis in patients with CAPS. Compared to placebo, treatment with ARCALYST resulted in sustained reductions from baseline in mean serum CRP and SAA to normal levels during the clinical trial. ARCALYST also normalized mean SAA from elevated levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The average trough levels of rilonacept were approximately 24 mcg/mL at steady -state following weekly subcutaneous doses of 160 mg for up to 48 weeks in patients with CAPS. The steady -state appeared to be reached by 6 weeks. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. No study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age, gender, or body weight on rilonacept exposure. Based on limited data obtained from the clinical study, steady state trough concentrations were similar between male and femal e patients. Age (26-78 years old) and body weight (50-120 kg) did not appear to have a significant effect on trough rilonacept concentrations. The effect of race could not be assessed because only Caucasian patients participated in the clinical study, refl ecting the epidemiology of the disease. 13 13.1 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long -term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of rilonacept. The mutagenic potential of rilonacept was not evaluated. Male and female fertility was evaluated in a mouse surrogate model using a murine analog of rilonacept. Male mice were treated beginning 8 weeks prior to mating and continuing through female gestation day 15. Female mice were treated for 2 weeks prior to mating and on gestation days 0, 3, and 6. The murine analog of rilonacept did not alter either male or female fertility parameters at doses up to 200 mg/kg (this dose is approximately 6-fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). 120 Page 263"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS was demonstrated in a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with two parts (A and B) conducted sequentially in the same patients with FCAS and MWS. Part A was a 6-week, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group period comparing ARCALYST at a dose of 160 mg weekly after an initial loading dose of 320 mg to placebo. Part B followed immediately after Part A and consisted of a 9 -week, patient -blind period during which all patients received ARCALYST 160 mg weekly, followed by a 9 -week, double -blind, randomized withdrawal period in which patients were randomly assigned to either remain on ARCALYST 160 mg weekly or to receive placebo. Patients were then given the option to enroll in a 24 -week, open -label treatment extension phase in which all patients were treated with ARCALYST 160 mg weekly. Using a daily diary questionnaire, patients rated the following five signs and symptoms of CAPS: joint pain, rash, feeling of fever/c hills, eye redness/pain, and fatigue, each on a scale of 0 (none, no severity) to 10 (very severe). The study evaluated the mean symptom score using the change from baseline to the end of treatment. The changes in mean symptom scores for the randomized par allel-group period (Part A) and the randomized withdrawal period (Part B) of the study are shown in Table 2. ARCALYST -treated patients had a larger reduction in the mean symptom score in Part A compared to placebo -treated patients. In Part B, mean symptom scores increased more in patients withdrawn to placebo compared to patients who remained on ARCALYST.

In Part A, patients treated with ARCALYST experienced more improvement in each of the five components of the composite endpoint (joint pain, rash, feeling of fever/chills, eye redness/pain, and fatigue) than placebo -treated patients. In Part A, a higher proportion of patients in the ARCALYST group experienced improvement from baseline in the composite score by at least 30% (96% vs. 29% of patients), by at least 50% (87% vs. 8%) and by at least 75% (70% vs. 0%) compared to the placebo group. Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and C -Reactive Protein (CRP) levels are acute phase reactants that are typically elevated in patients with CAPS with active disease. During Part A, mean levels of CRP decreased versus baseline for the ARCALYST treated patients, while there was no change for those on placebo (Table 3).

ARCALYST is supplied in a carton containing four vials (NDC 61755 -001-01). The lyophilized ARCALYST product is to be stored refrigerated at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) inside the original carton to protect from light. Do not use beyond the date stamped on the label. After reconstitution, ARCALYST may be kept at room temperature, should be kept from light, and should be used within three hours of reconstitution. ARCALYST does not contain preservatives; therefore, unused portions of ARCALYST should be discarded. Discard the vial after a single withdrawal of drug. 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA -approved patient labeling. The first injection of ARCALYST should be performed under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional. If a patient or caregiver is to administer ARCALYST, he/she should be instructed on aseptic reconstitution of the lyophilized product and injection technique. The ability to inject subcutaneously should be assessed to ensure proper administration of ARCALYST, including rotation of inject ion sites. (See Patient Information Leaflet for ARCALYST®). ARCALYST should be reconstituted with preservative -free Sterile Water for Injection to be provided by the pharmacy. A puncture -resistant container for disposal of vials, needles and syringes shoul d be used. Patients or caregivers should be instructed in proper vial, syringe, and needle disposal, and should be cautioned against reuse of these items. Injection -site Reactions: Physicians should explain to patients that almost half of the patients in the clinical trials experienced a reaction at the injection site. Injection -site reactions may include pain, erythema, swelling, pruritus, bruising, mass, inflammation, dermatitis, edema, urticaria, vesicles, warmth, and hemorrhage. Patients sh ould be cautioned to avoid injecting into an area that is already swollen or red. Any persistent reaction should be brought to the attention of the prescribing physician. Infections: Patients should be cautioned that ARCALYST has been associated with serious, life-threatening infections, and not to initiate treatment with ARCALYST if they have a chronic or active infection. Patients should be counseled to contact their healthcare professional immediately if they develop an infection after starting ARCA LYST. Treatment with ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Patients should be counseled not to take any IL -1 blocking drug, including ARCALYST, if they are also taking a drug that blocks TNF such as etanercept, inflixim ab, or adalimumab. Use of ARCALYST with other IL -1 blocking agents, such as anakinra, is not recommended. Vaccinations: Prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST physicians should review with adult and pediatric patients their vaccination history relati ve to current medical guidelines for vaccine use, including taking into account the potential of increased risk of infection during treatment with ARCALYST. 123 Page 266"

Throw away the ARCALYST vial in the puncture -resistant container even if there is any medicine left in the vial (see Figure 18). Do not use any vial of ARCALYST more than one time. Figure 18 STEP 5: Giving the Injection 1. ARCALYST is given by subcutaneous injection, an injection that is given into the tissue directly below the layers of skin. It is not meant to go into any muscle, vein, or artery. You should change (rotate) the sites and inject in a different place each time in order to keep your skin healthy. 137 Page 280"
280,page_280,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL-914-C002 Version 1.1, 05 Oct 2018 Rotating injection sites helps to prevent irritation and allows the medicine to be completely absorbed. Ask your healthcare provider any questions that you have about rotating injection sites. • Do not inject into skin that is tender, red, or hard. If an area is tender or feels hardened, choose another site for injection until the tenderness or ""hardening"" goes away. Tell your healthcare provider about any skin reactions including redness, swelling, or hardening of the skin. Areas where you may inject ARCALYST include the left and right sides of the abdomen, and left and right thighs. If someone else is giving the injection, the upper left and right arms may also be used for injection (see Figure 19): (Do not inject within a 2-inch area around the navel) • • Figure 19 Choose the area for the injection. Clean the area in a circular motion with a new alcohol wipe. Begin at the center of the site and move outward. Let the alcohol air dry completely. Take the cover off the needle and be careful not to touch the needle. Hold the syringe in one hand like you would hold a pencil. With the other hand gently pinch a fold of skin at the cleaned site for injection (see Figure 20). 2. 3. 4. 5. 138 Page 281"

Do not push down on the plunger while inserting the needle into the skin. For small children or persons with little fat under the skin, you may need to hold the syringe and needle at a 45 degree angle (see Figure 21). 6. Figure 21 After the needle is completely in the skin, let go of the skin that you are pinching. With your free hand hold the syringe near its base. Gently pull back the plunger. If blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. Remove the needl e, discard the syringe and needle. Start over with “STEP 1: Setting up for an injection” using new supplies (syringes, needles, vials, alcohol swabs and gauze pad). If no blood appears, inject all the medicine in the syringe at a slow, steady rate, pushing the plunger all the way down. It may take up to 30 seconds to inject the entire dose. 7. 8. 9. 10.

Current treatments, utilizing nonspecific inhibitors of inflammation (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], colchicine, corticosteroids [CS]), result in significant morbidity with chronic use. Some patients develop CS dependency or requ ire surgical pericardiectomy to treat the symptoms of their disease. The interleukin -1 (IL -1) pathway plays a major role in the pathophysiology of recurrent pericarditis. Rilonacept (KPL -914) is a recombinant fusion protein that blocks IL-1 signaling. It is currently approved for treatment of another autoinflammatory condition, Cryopyrin -Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS). Based on its IL -1–antagonistic properties and pharmacokinetics (PK), which allow for once -weekly subcutaneous (SC) injec tions, it is reasonable to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rilonacept in subjects with recurrent pericarditis to address the unmet need in treatment of this disease. Study Objectives: Primary: To assess the efficacy of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. Secondary: To assess the safety of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis."

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr 2019 15 Page 302 Study Population: Subjects eligible for the study are subjects with recurrent pericarditis who do not have pericarditis secondary to prohibited conditions. The study population includes both adult subjects ≥18 years old and pediatric subjects ≥12 and <18 years old with a history of at least 2 prior pericarditis episodes (including the first episode and 1 recurrence). Enrollment of pediatric subjec ts will be limited to up to 20% of the study population. To be eligible for the study, subjects must present at screening with at least a third pericarditis episode, defined as at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11 -point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and C-reactive protein (CRP) value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) within 7 days prior to first study drug administration. Subjects included in the study may be receiving concomitant NSAIDs and/or colchicine and/or oral CS treatment in any combination, provided that the dosages of these medications have been stable (or not increased) for at least 3 days prior to first administration of study drug, and that changes in medications made within this time period (for instance, 1-time use of NSAIDs) are not anticipated by the investigator to significantly alter assessments of baseline disease activity. Study Design: This study has 5 periods: (1) Screening period , during which assessment of disease characteristics, baseline therapy, and the pretreatment workup is completed (up to 4 weeks). (2) Single -blind Run-In (RI) period (12 weeks), during which blinded rilonacept is administered SC once weekly in all subjects. The RI period includes the following: • 1-week Stabilization period, during which blinded rilonacept is administered in addition to standard of care (SOC) pericarditis therapy and the ongoing pericarditis episode is treated • 9-week Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues • 2-week Monotherapy period during which subjects who have successfully weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy will continue to receive blinded rilonacept In the single -blind RI period (subjects are blinded regarding the time of transition from the single -blind to the double -blind period), adult subjects ≥18 years old will receive rilonacept as an initial loading dose of 320 mg (2 SC injections of 160 mg each) at the RI baseline visit (2 × 2 ml), followed by a 160 mg (2 ml) SC dose once weekly throughout the RI period. Pediatric subjects (≥12 and <18 years old) will receive an initial loading dose of rilonacept 4.4 mg/kg (2 SC injections of 2.2 mg/kg each) at the RI baseline visit (maximum 2 × 2 ml), and then 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 2 ml) SC once weekly throughout RI period. Subjects who stopped background SOC pericarditis therapy and who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12, defined as the weekly average of daily pericarditis pain score ≤2.0 on the 11-point NRS within the 7 days prior to and including the day of randomization on RI Week 12/Randomization Withdrawal (RW) baseline and a CRP level ≤0.5 mg/dL at the RI Week 12/RW baseline visit, will proceed into the double -blind placebo -controlled RW period.

(3) Double -blind placebo -controlled RW period (pericarditis recurrence event -driven duration, with a minimum of 24 weeks), during which subjects who were able to stop background SOC pericarditis therapy and who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12/ RW baseline are randomized in a double - blind manner at a 1:1 ratio to the following: • Rilonacept 160 mg (2.2 mg/kg in pediatric subjects) SC injections once weekly • Matching placebo SC injections once weekly Pericarditis Recurrence in the RW Period Pericarditis recurrence is defined as the recurrence of typical pericarditis pain associated with supportive objective evidence of pericarditis. Upon pericarditis recurrence, subjects who report at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 1 1point NRS and have 1 CRP value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) will receive bailout rilonacept (2 open -label injections of 160 mg rilonacept [or 4.4 mg/kg for pediatric subjects] followed by once weekly open -label rilonacept SC injections of 160 mg [or 2.2 mg/kg for pediatric subjects]) irrespective of randomized treatment assignment and as soon as at least 5 days have passed since the last study drug injection. Sequential Oral Rescue Therapy (ORT), i.e., analgesics first, then NSAIDs, and then colchicine, can be added if needed at the discretion of the investigator, as outlined in the protocol and Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence and who do not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept will continue blinded study drug until the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept are met or through the end of the RW period. For those subjects, sequential ORT can be added to blinded study drug at the discretion of the investigator, as outlined in the protocol and Pharmacy Manual. All suspected pericarditis recurrence events in the RW period will be formally adjudicated by the Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC), and only events that are confirmed by the CEC as pericarditis recurrences will be used in the Primary Endpoint analysis. (4) Long Term Extension Treatment Period (LTE -TP) (24 weeks), during which all subjects completing the RW period (including subjects transitioned to open -label rilonacept upon pericarditi s recurrence) will have an option to receive up to 24 weeks of open -label rilonacept 160 mg (or 2.2 mg/kg for pediatric subjects) SC injections once weekly based on their clinical status and at the discretion of the investigator, after signing LTE informed consent. Any subject who, in the opinion of investigator, should not continue open -label rilonacept will be offered participation in the LTE off study drug and after signing LTE informed consent. (5) Long Term Extension Follow -Up Period (LTE -FUP) (24 weeks), during which all subjects in the LTE-TP will be followed in the LTE-FUP for safety and potential pericarditis recurrences."

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr 2019 18 Page 305 Investigational Medicinal Product, Dosage, and Route of Administration: Rilonacept (KPL -914) is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domains of human IL-1 cytokine receptor and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). It acts as a soluble decoy receptor binding IL-1α/IL -1β and prevents their interaction with the IL-1 cell-surface receptor. Study drug (rilonacept or placebo) is supplied in a single use, 20 ml glass vial containing a sterile, white to off -white, lyophilized powder. Each vial is to be reconstituted with 2.3 ml sterile Water for Injection (WFI). A volume up to 2 ml can be withdrawn, which is designated to deliver up to 160 mg of rilonacept or up to 2 ml of placebo for SC injection only. The resulting solution is clear, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free of particulates. Each rilonacept vial contains 220 mg of rilonacept lyophilized powder. After reconstitution with 2.3 ml WFI, the rilonacept vial contains 80 mg/ml rilonacept, 40 mM histidine, 50 mM arginine, 3.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 2.0% (w/v) sucrose, and 1.0% (w/ v) glycine at a pH of 6.5. No preservatives are present. The first injection of rilonacept loading dose at the RI baseline visit will be administered at the study site by study site staff. The second injection of rilonacept loading dose at the RI baseline visit will be prepared and administered by the subject or the subject’s caregiver after adequate training and under the supervision of study site personnel. Subsequent once -weekly study drug doses will be self -administered SC by the subject or administered to the subject by a trained caregiver as an outpatient SC administration. Sample Size: Approximately 56 subjects (not to exceed 75 subjects) with recurrent pericarditis will be enrolled, which will allow approximately 50 subjects to be randomly assigned to blinded treatment. Statistical Methods: The primary efficacy endpoint is time to pericarditis recurrence, defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first pericarditis recurrence for each subject. Only CEC -confirmed pericarditis recurrence will be considered as an event for the primary efficacy analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be done based on the investigator’s assessment of the pericarditis recurrence. In order to control the overall 1-sided type I error rate at the 0.025 level, a gatekeeping procedure in combination with Hochberg’s procedure will be applied to testing the primary and major secondary efficacy endpoints. Major secondary efficacy endpoints for the RW period include: • Prop ortion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 24 of the RW period • Percentage of days with no or minimal pain (pain ≤1 on the 11-point NRS) in the first 24 weeks of the RW period • Proportion of subjects with absent or minimal pericarditis symptoms (based on the 7-point rating scale of PGIPS) at Week 24 of the RW period Other secondary efficacy endpoints for the RW period include: • Proportion of subjects without pericarditis recurrence in the first 24 weeks of the RW period • Time to pericarditis pain NRS ≥4"

In 80% of cases in developed countries, the cause of pericarditis is either post -viral or “idiopathic” in that it cannot be attributed to a specific condition ( Imazio et al 2010 ; Zayas et al 1995 ). The underlying pathogenesis of recurrent pericarditis remains unclear, al though a growing body of evidence suggests that abnormal immune responses play a role in the pathogenic processes. While the adaptive immune system plays a role in autoimmune disorders that manifest with pericarditis as one of the many organ systems involved (such as in systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis), the innate immune system, including interleukin 1 (IL-1) signaling, is often the major effector in autoinflammatory disorders, such as isolated pericarditis (Baskar et al 2016 ; Brucato et al 2016 ; Imazio et al 2016 , Dinarello et al 2012 ). Diagnosis of p ericarditis is based on the presence of typical chest pain (improved by sitting up and leaning forward) along with fever, pericardial friction rub, electrocardiographic changes, pericardial effusion, or elevated levels of inflammation markers (white blood cell [WBC] count, C-reactive protein [CRP], or erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) (Adler et al 2015). The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Pericardial Diseases define an acute pericarditis episode as the presence of at least 2 of the 4 following criteria: pericarditic chest pain, pericardial rubs, new widespread ST-segment elevation or PR-segment depression based on electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and pericardial effusion (new or worsening). Elevations of certain markers of inflammation (i.e., CRP, ESR, and WBC) or evidence of pericardial inflammation by an imaging technique (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are used as supportive findings (Adler et al 2015). Recurrent pe ricarditis is characterized by the recurrence of pericarditis signs and symptoms after a symptom -free period of at least 4 to 6 weeks (Adler et al 2015). Recurrent pericarditis affects 20% to 30% of patients with acute pericarditis ( Imazio 2014 ) and can be debilitating for patients due to pain and limitations in physical function during pericarditis episodes. Pericarditis recurrences result in increased emergency room admissions and hospitalizations. In t he United States, 5% of patients presenting to the emergency room with non -ischemic chest pain are diagnosed with pericarditis (Agarwal et al 2015 ). The estimated prevalence of recurrent pericarditis in the US and Europe is 70,000 to 160,000 patients including approximately 8,000 to 21,000 patients who are refractory or intolerant to current therapies or who require long -term administration of corticosteroids (CS) to control their disease (Brucato et al 2016; Lazaros et al 2016 ; Imazio et al 2010; Khandaker et al 2010 ; Imazio et al 2008 ). 1.1 Current Therapeutic Management of Pericarditis There are no approved therapies for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. Current treatments include nonspecific inhibitors of inflammation, i.e., aspirin, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and CS (Lilly et al 2013 ). Aspirin and other NSAIDs are the first -line approach. Because high doses of aspirin and NSAIDs are often required, consideration must be given to gastric protection therapy, as potential risks of therapy include stomach ulcers and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, as well as renal and cardiovascular toxicity. 31 Page 318"
318,page_318,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr 2019 Colchicine is another mainstay therapy for pericarditis and is commonly used with NSAIDs to hasten the response to NSAIDs and reduce the risk of subsequent recurrences. However, its use may be associated with the risk of fatal overdosing, significant drug interactions, and neuromuscular toxicity. In addition, approximately 10% to 15% of patients experience significant GI side effects with colchicine, including GI intolerance or severe diarrhea, requiring treatment discontinuation ( Imazio et al 2016 ). Available ESC guidelines stipulate that CS should be prescribed for the management of pericarditis episodes only in cases of incomplete response, intolerance, or contraindications to NSAIDs and colchicine because of their unfavorable long -term benefit -risk profile. Corticosteroid use is associated with side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, avascular bone necrosis, and increased risk for infections (Imazio et al 2008 ). For the management of pericarditis, CS are usually administered at low to moderate doses and can provide rapid control of symptoms. However, they often require many months of tapering after the normalization of CRP levels. In addition, there is a high rate of pericarditis relapse when CS use is tapered or stopped (Lotrionte et al 2010 ; Imazio et al 2005 ; Maisch et al 2004 ), particularly in the absence of concurrent colchicine treatment. Patients with recurrent pericarditis who are refractory or intolerant to current therapeutic management options or who require long -term administration of CS to control their disease can be particularly challenging to ma nage. As a last resort, some refractory patients are being referred to the surgical procedure of pericardiectomy, with variable outcomes. Multiple immunosuppressive medications have been used without consistent benefit (Baskar et al 2016 ). 1.2 Pathogenesis of Recurrent Pericarditis: Role of IL-1 Interleukin -1 is a key cytokine that drives the pathophysiology of many inflammatory processes, and it is implicated as a causative factor in various inflammatory diseases in humans. The two distinct IL -1 genes, IL1A and IL1B , encode IL -1α and IL -1β, respectively. IL -1α and IL -1β bind to the universally -expressed cell surface receptor, IL -1 receptor type -1, triggering a cascade of inflammatory mediators. The precursor form of IL-1α is expressed in keratinocytes, mucous membrane epithelial cells, and organs such as the liver and vascular endothelium in healthy individuals. During pathological states, IL -1α moves to the cell surface or is released after cell death to activate IL -1 recepto rs in adjacent cells, thus beginning the cascade of sterile inflammation. IL -1β, however, is not expressed in healthy individuals until a stimulus, such as microbial products or other chemokines, triggers its transcription in monocytes, tissue macrophages, and dendritic cells via the inflammasome. IL-1 drives the inflammatory cascade in classic autoinflammatory conditions, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and plays a significant role in systemic onset of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Baskar et al 2016). 32 Page 319"

This mechanistic plausibility of IL-1 antagonism in addressing pathophysiology related to the inflammasome extends to other conditions characterized by sterile acute inflammation, such as 33 Page 320 recurrent pericarditis."

(Regeneron) of Tarrytown, NY, and is approved with the trade name ARCALYST® in the US for the treatment of CAPS, including Familial Cold Auto -Inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle -Wells Syndrome (MWS) in adults and children age 12 and older. Rilonacept is currently manufactured and marketed as ARCALYST® by Regeneron. Rilonacept received marketing authorization in the European Union for the treatment of CAPS with severe symptoms, including FCAS and MWS in adults and c hildren aged 12 years and older, but based on a request from Regeneron, the marketing authorization was withdrawn. The withdrawal was a business decision and was not related to any concern with the safety or efficacy of rilonacept. Rilonacept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of human cytokine receptor extracellular domains and the Fc portion of human IgG1. Rilonacept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a total molecular weight of approximately 250 kDa. The dimer is covalently linked by disulfid e bonds in the Fc region. Rilonacept incorporates in a single molecule the extracellular domains of both receptors required for IL-1 signaling: the IL -1 type I receptor (IL -1R1) and the IL -1 receptor accessory protein (IL -1R-AcP) (Figure 1). Rilonacept is expressed in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Rilonacept blocks IL-1 by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL-1 and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors.

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr 2019 1.3.1 Safety of Rilonacept For a detailed review of the available rilonacept safety data, please refer to the current Investigator Brochure and the ARCALYST® package insert (Section 13.1: ARCALYST® Prescribing Information). The available rilonacept safety data is summarized below. Rilonacept has been evaluated in 23 studies, including 22 complete and 1 ongoing. In the completed studies, 2243 subjects (2152 patients and 91 healthy volunteers) were exposed to rilonacept. Thirty of these patients wer e pediatric (<18 years of age). Doses up to 320 mg subcutaneously (SC) once weekly and 2000 mg intravenously (IV) monthly have been studied for different indications, including CAPS, gout, and other inflammatory disorders. Injection Site Reactions In clinical studies with rilonacept, the most common and consistently reported AE associated with rilonacept was injection site reaction (ISR). The ISRs included erythema, swelling, pruritus, mass, bruising, inflammation, pain, edema, dermatit is, discomfort, urticaria, vesicles, warmth, and hemorrhage. Most ISRs were mild to moderate. In the gout clinical studies, approximately 1% of subjects treated with rilonacept discontinued due to ISRs. Similar results have been seen in other patient popul ations. Infections Interleukin -1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections. Serious life-threatening infections have been reported in clinical trials in subjects treated with rilonacept. Changes in Laboratory Parameters Cholesterol and lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Subjects treated with rilonacept in clinical trials experienced increases in their mean total cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected using an enzyme -linked immunosorb ent assay (ELISA). In clinical trials with rilonacept, approximately 30% to 35% of subjects tested positive for treatment -emergent antibodies to rilonacept on at least 1 occasion. Systemic Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions are a potential risk with protein therapeutics in general. In clinical studies with rilonacept, systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been rare. 35 Page 322"

Treatment with immunosuppressants, including rilonacept, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. Fetal Defects There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of rilonacept in pregnant women. Based on animal data, rilonacept may cause fetal harm. An embryo -fetal developmental toxicity study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys treated with 0, 5, 15, or 30 mg/kg given twice a week (highest dose is approximately 3.7 -fold higher than the human dose of 160 mg based on body surface area). The fetus of the only monkey with exposure to rilonacept during the later period of gestation showed multiple fusion and absence of the ribs and thoracic vertebral bodies and arches. Exposure to rilonacept during this time period was be low that expected clinically. Likewise, in the cynomolgus monkey, all doses of rilonacept reduced serum levels of estradiol up to 64% compared to controls and increased the incidence of lumbar ribs compared to both control animals and historical control in cidences. In perinatal and postnatal developmental toxicology studies in the mouse model using a murine analog of rilonacept (0, 20, 100, or 200 mg/kg), there was a 3-fold increase in the number of stillbirths in dams treated with 200 mg/kg 3 times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6-fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Nonteratogenic effects : A peri - and postnatal reproductive toxicology study was performed in which mice were administered a murine analog of rilonacept at doses of 20, 100, and 200 mg/kg SC 3 times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6-fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Results indicated an increased incidence in unscheduled deaths of the F1 offspring during maturation at all doses tested. 1.3.2 KPL -914-C001 Study with Rilonacept (KPL -914) in Recurrent Pericarditis KPL -914-C001 is an open -label, single active -arm Phase 2 proof -of-concept study in subjects age ≥6 to 75 years old with recurrent idiopathic or post-pericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) pericarditis. The study includes a 6 -week Treatment Period in which all the subjects receive once -weekly rilonacept 160 mg SC (2.2 mg/kg for subjects ≥6 and <18 years old) following a loading dose of 320 mg SC in subjects ≥18 years old (4.4 mg/kg in subjects ≥6 and <18 years old) in addition to background pericarditis therapies (NSAIDS, colchicine, CS). After completing the 6 -week Treatment Period and based on response status, the subje cts have the option to enter the 18 -week Extension Period during which they continue to receive rilonacept at the same dose, but during which investigators are encouraged to wean and stop background pericarditis medications. The primary objectives of the study are to explore clinical and biochemical endpoints of recurrent pericarditis symptomatology, as well as to assess feasibility to wean from concomitant pericarditis medication in the Extension Period while continuing treatment with ri lonacept. The study population includes the following 5 subject categories (Parts): 36 Page 323"

Subjects will be blinded regarding the time of transition from the single -blind to the double -blind period; i.e., they will not be aware of the duration of the RI period. In the single -blind RI period, subjects ≥18 years old will receive blinded rilonacept as an initial loading dose of 320 mg (2 SC injections of 160 mg each) at the RI baseline visit (2 × 2 ml), followed by a 160 mg (2 ml) SC dose once weekly throughout the RI period. Pediatric subjects (≥12 and <18 years old) will receive an initial loading dose of blinded rilonacept 4.4 mg/kg (2 SC injections of 2.2 mg/kg each) at the RI baseline visit (maximum 2 × 2 ml), and then 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 2 ml) SC once weekly throughout the RI period. The RI period includes: • 1-week Stabilization period, during which blinded rilonacept is administered in addition to SOC pericarditis therapy, and the ongoing pericarditis episode is treated. 9-week Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues. The dosages of CS, NSAIDs, and colchicine will be tapered according to the weaning protocol in the Pharmacy Manual (for the purpose of the protocol, aspirin is considered an NSAID). In general, CS doses will be tapered off starting at RI Week 1 and will be withdrawn by RI Week 10 (over a total of 9 weeks). NSAID and colchicine doses will be tapered off starting at RI Week 4 and will be withdrawn by RI Week 10 (over a total of 6 weeks). 2-week Monotherapy period: Subjects who have been successfully weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy will continue to receive blinded rilonacept. • • Subjects who stopped background pericarditis medications and achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept monotherapy at RI Week 12/RW baseline will proceed into the double -blind placebo -controlled Randomized -Withdrawal (RW) period of the study. For definition of Clinical Response, refer to Section 6.2.2 . Subjects who are unable to achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept monotherapy at RI Week 12/RW baseline are to be discontinued from study drug, transitioned to SOC pericarditis therapy at the investigator’s discretion, and followed through the end of the RW period. 3.1.3 Double -blind Placebo -controlled RW Period (pericarditis recurrence event -driven duration with a minimum of 24 weeks) During the RW period, subjects who were able to stop background pericarditis medications and who achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept monotherapy at RI Week 12/RW baseline will be randomized 1:1 to double -blinded administration of study drug: 38 Page 325"

Upon pericarditis recurrence, subjects who report at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11 -point Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] and have 1 CRP value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) will receive bailout rilonacept (2 open -label injections of 160 mg rilonacept [or 4.4 mg/kg for pediatric subjects]) irrespective of randomized treatment assignment and as soon as at least 5 days have passed since the last study drug injection. The subjects transitioning to bailout rilonacept will remain blinded to their prior RW period treatment assignment. Sequential Oral Rescue Therapy (ORT), i.e., analgesics first, then NSAIDs, and then colchicine, can be added, if needed, at the discretion of the investigator, as outlined in Section 5.8.3 and de tailed in the Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence who do not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept will continue blinded study drug until they meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept or through the end of the RW period. For those subjects, sequential ORT can be added to blinded study drug at the discretion of the investigator, as outlined in Section 5.8.3 and detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. All suspected pericarditis recurrence events in the RW period will be formally adjudicated by the Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC), and only events that are confirmed by the CEC as pericarditis recurrences will be used in the Primary Endpoint analysis. The RW period will continue until the prespecified number of prima ry endpoint (CEC -confirmed pericarditis recurrence) events have occurred and approximately 50 randomized subjects have achieved a minimum of 24 weeks of treatment in the RW period. Based on projected event accrual and subject randomization, Kiniksa Pharmac eutical will determine the end of the RW period and announce to sites so that subject End of Randomized Withdrawal (EORW) visits can occur.

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 3.1.6 Rationale of Study Design Subjects eligible for this KPL -914-C002 study will be subjects with recurrent pericarditis presenting with an acute pericarditis episode at screening. The KPL -914-C002 study design ensures that during the RI period all subjects will receive rilonacept, a drug with evidence s upporting clinical activity based on the preliminary clinical data with rilonacept from Part 1 of the ongoing Phase 2 proof -of-concept study ( KPL -914-C001 ) obtained to date. During the RI period, pericarditis will be stabilized with symptoms controlled and background pericarditis medications (NSAIDs, colchicine, CS) will be tapered and withdrawn, while rilonacept treatment continues. The design then allows half of the subjects to continue receiving active treatment after having achieved Clinical Response on that treatment, which maximizes subject exposure to a potentially beneficial therapy. The temporary withdrawal of rilonacept (by switching to placebo) in the half of the subjects who were randomly assigned to placebo is expected to result in an accelerated time to pericarditis recurrence and a higher recurrence rate compared to those who continue on active treatment, a finding that demonstrates that the underlying pericarditis etiology is still ongoing and will provide further support for the an ticipated observation of the clinical effect of rilonacept during the RI period of the study. The period of exposure to an ineffective treatment is minimized in this design, as subjects will be removed from blinded treatment when the condition returns to a specified severity (i.e., for having met the criteria of pericarditis pain ≥4 on the 11 -point NRS and CRP level ≥1 mg/dL) without unblinding them to prior treatment assignment, thus protecting the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. All subjects who meet the pain and CRP criteria described above will be treated with open -label bailout rilonacept using a loading dose, followed by once-weekly SC injections. In addition, sequential ORT such as NSAIDs and/or colchicine will be allowed upon recurrence at the investigator’s discretion based on the subject’s clinical status, as outlined in Section 5.8.3 and as stipulated in the Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence not meeting criteria for bailout rilonacept, can be treated with sequential ORT based on investigator judgement and as described in protocol Section 5.8.3 and the Pharmacy Manual. If the subject requires the addition of CS treatment to control the pericarditis recurrence, the subj ect will be discontinued from study drug. All subjects will be followed for the duration of RW period. In summary, the proposed RW trial with rilonacept allows all enrolled subjects an opportunity to receive the active drug during the acute episode of pericarditis yet provides pivotal -quality data on the efficacy of rilonacept in this enriched cohort by subsequently randomly assigning subjects to placebo versus active treatment after they achieve a predefined clinical response. Subjects with pericarditis recurrences after randomization will receive bailout rilonacept treatment and/or sequential ORT according to the protocol. This approach minimizes the exposure to placebo, which is important for a study that requires active disease upon enrollment and includes a pediatric population. The available regulatory guidance supports the use of an RW study design in the setting of recurrent pericarditis as a means of establishing the long -term effectiveness of rilonacept, an approved product for the treatment of another rare autoinflammatory condition (CAPS). 42 Page 329"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 3.1.7 Justification for Rilonacept Dose Selection loading dose (4.4 mg/kg in subjects ≥12 and <18 years old), followed by once-weekly SC doses at 160 mg (2.2 mg/kg in subjects ≥12 and <18 years old). In the rilonacept development program in CAPS, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions, over 2000 subjects were exposed to rilonacept, including 1650 subjects receiving a rilonacept dose of 160 mg or higher. A total of 103 and 169 subjects were exposed to any rilonacept dose for at least 1 year or 6 months, respectively. Most of the real-life experience with rilonacept comes from the CAPS population treated at this marketed dose. As of March 2018, approximately 365 CAPS patients have been exposed to rilonacept in the post-marketing setting since 2008. The safety data accumulated so far support the benefit/risk ratio for the rilonacept dose intended to be evaluated in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. Based on the preliminary clinical data with rilonacept from Part 1 of the Phase 2 proof of concept study (KPL -914-C001 ) obtained to date, it is expected that rilonacept doses (320 mg followed by 160 mg SC once weekly and corresponding pediatric doses), and evaluated in the KPL- 914-C001 study, will consistently provide adequate suppression of clinical inflammatory response, including CRP levels, in patients with recurrent pericarditis. Bailout Rilonacept Dose Subjects who meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence in the RW period of the study (Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ), irrespective of treatment assignment at randomization, will receive open -label rilonacept (loading dose of 320 mg SC followed by once-weekly SC injections of 160 mg, or the corresponding pediatric doses). The rationale for bailout rilonacept treatment upon pericarditis recurrence for subjects who were randomly assigned to placebo is that rilonacept had controlled their disease activity during the RI period; therefore, re -initiation of rilonacept is justified to regain control of pericarditis signs and symptoms upon recurrence. Subjects who were randomly assigned to rilonacept and qualify for bailout rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence in the RW period were initial responders to rilonacept treatment during the RI period; thus it could be assumed that the loss of response during the RW period could be due to development of resistance to rilonacept due to different mechanisms, e.g., higher IL -1 levels or a change in rilonacept pharmacokinetics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics. Therefore, re -administration of a loading dose of rilonacept may help to restore Clinical Respo nse. 4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal Criteria 43 Page 330 , i.e., 320 mg SC"

Subjects will be assigned to study drug only if they mee t all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability, or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. Subjects eligible for the study are subjects with recurrent pericarditis who do not have pericarditis secondary to prohibited conditions. T he study population includes both adult subjects ≥18 years old and pediatric subjects ≥12 and <18 years old with a history of at least 2 pericarditis episodes (including the first episode and 1 recurrence) prior to screening. Enrollment of pediatric subjects will be limited to up to 20% of the study population.

Subjects who elect not to enter LTE will be followed for 6 weeks after receiving the last study drug administration. 4.2.2 Reasons for Discontinuation of Study Drug and Study Withdrawal Subjects have the right to stop taking study drug before the end of the study or to withdraw their consent for further participation in the study (i.e., precluding continued data collection). A subject also may be asked to stop study drug at the investigator’s discretion. In the event that a subject permanently discontinues study drug but does not withdraw the informed consent, the investigator should cont inue to follow up with the subject by telephone contact (TC) visits, in the clinic, or by other means through the EORW visit if the subject discontinues in RI or RW, or through the end of LTE -FUP if the subject discontinues in LTE -TP, unless consent is withdrawn. The reasons for premature study drug discontinuation will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 4.2.2.1 Discontinuation of Study Drug The study drug dosing will be permanently stopped if any of the following occurs: • The subject develops TB or malignancy, excluding non-metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma Initiation of protocol -prohibited medication (Section 5.8.6 ) Subject requires treatment with CS for pericarditis during RW or LTE-TP periods of the study Pregnancy or pregnancy planned during the study or within 3 months after the last study drug administration ALT or AST values ≥3 × ULN associated with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN, with no underlying medical conditions to explain the elevated values • • • • 49 Page 336"

All data collected prior to the date of the subject’s confirmed withdrawal of consent will be included in the study, as specified in the subject’s signed ICF. 5 Study Treatments 5.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups In the single -blind RI period, all subjects will receive blinded rilonacept at the same dose through Week 12; subjects will be blinded to the time of transitioning to RW. Subjects who stopped background SOC pericarditis therapy and who achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept at RI Week 12/RW baseline will be randomly assigned in a double -blind manner to continue to receive blinded rilonacept or matching placebo using a 1:1 allocation ratio. The definition of Clinical Response is provided in Section 6.2.2 . An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to administer the randomization schedule. Biostatisti cs will generate the randomization schedule using SAS® software Version 9.4 or later (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina) for the IWRS, which will link sequential subject randomization numbers to treatment codes. The randomization schedule will be stratified by 2 factors: • • Oral CS use at baseline (RI baseline, i.e., beginning of RI period): yes or no Diagnosis of recurrent idiopathic pericarditis (RI baseline): yes or no 5.2 Treatments Administered Throughout this protocol, “study drug” refers to the investigational medicinal products: rilonacept and matching placebo. Both will be administered as applicable by SC injection. Study drug administration will be performed once a week (every 7 ± 2 days). The interval between study drug administrations must be at least 5 days. Study drug will be dosed as follows: Adult Subjects (≥18 years old): Rilonacept: Loading dose 320 mg administered as 2 SC injections, 160 mg each (2 ml) at RI baseline, followed by once-weekly SC injections of 160 mg (2ml). Placebo: administered as once-weekly SC injections of 2 ml each in the RW period Upon meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept (Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ) in the RW period, subjects will be transitioned to open -label rilonacept 320 mg administered as 2 SC injections, 160 mg each (2 ml) at the next scheduled study drug administration date, followed by once-weekly SC injections of 160 mg (2ml) . 51 Page 338"

During this visit, the subject will be trained on study drug preparation and injection. In case the subject is unwilling or unable to prepare and self -inject the study drug, the subject’s caregiver will be trained. The first study drug administration for adult and pediatric subjects on RI baseline will consist of 2 SC injections, constituting a loading dose. The first injection will be prepared and administered by study site staff. The second injection will be prepared and administered by the subject or the subject’s caregiver after adequate training and under the supervision of study site personnel. Subsequent once- weekly study drug doses will be self-administered SC by the subject or administered to the subject by a trained caregiver as an outpatient SC administration. If the subject or subject’s caregiver is unable to prepare and inject the study dug, the subject may report for once-weekly injections to a study site, or injections can be administered by the visiting registered nurse (RN). 5.3 Identity of Investigational Medicinal Product Rilonacept (KPL -914) is the drug being evaluated in the current study. Refer to Section 1.3 for a detailed description of rilonacept’s mechanism of action. Study drug (rilonacept or placebo) is supplied in a single -use, 20 ml glass vial containing a sterile, white to off-white, lyophilized powder. Each vial is to be reconstituted with 2.3 ml sterile Water for Injection (WFI). A volume up to 2 ml can be withdrawn, which is designated to deliver up to 160 mg of rilonacept or up to 2 ml placebo for SC injection only. The resulting solution is clear, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free of particulates. Each rilonacept vial contains 220 mg of rilonacept lyophilized powder. After reconstitution with 2.3 ml sterile WFI, the rilonacept vial contains 80 mg/ml rilonacept, 40 mM histidine, 50 mM arginine, 3.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 2.0% (w/v) sucrose, and 1.0% (w/v) glycine at a pH of 6.5. No preservatives are present. Each placebo vial contains lyophilized powder. After reconstitution with 2.3 ml sterile WFI, the placebo vial contains 40 mM histidine, 50 mM arginine, 3.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 2.0% (w/v) sucrose, and 1.0% (w/v) glycine at a pH of 6.5. No preservatives are present. 5.4 Management of Clinical Supplies 5.4.1 Study Drug Product Packaging and Storage Additional information regarding the preparation, dispensation, administration, and storage of rilonacept or placebo will be described in the Pharmacy Manual. Study drug will be provided by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals to the study sites in the lyophilized formulation in glass vials as described in Section 5.3. Each single -use vial will have a clinical label adhered to the vial. One labeled vial will be placed into a carton. Each carton will have a clinical label adhered to the 53 Page 340"

One tamper -evident seal will be placed on the top of the carton to securely close the lid. Study drug is to be stored and shipped refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) inside the original carton to protect it from light. 5.4.2 Study Drug Accountability The sites will receive study drug for on -site administration at study site visits. Upon receipt of study drug, the investigator (or delegate) will conduct an inventory of the supplies and verify that the supplies are received intact, at the appropriate temperature, and in the correct amounts prior to completing a supplies receipt. The investigator will confirm receipt of study drug in the IWRS and retain a copy of this receipt at the study site. The inventory of supplies at eac h study site will be reviewed by the study monitor. Study drug will be dispensed to the study subjects for outpatient self-administration according to the supply chain described in the Pharmacy Manual. The investigator will maintain accurate records of receipt of all test articles, including dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will be kept regarding when and how much study drug is dispensed and used by each subject in the study. Reasons for deviating from the expected dispensing re gimen must also be recorded. At the completion of the study, to satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all used and unused study drug containers must be retained by the study site/clinic and subject for cataloguing and documentation of compliance. The full process for drug dispensing, documentation, and destruction will be described in the Pharmacy Manual. A full drug accountability log will be maintained at the study site at all times. 5.4.3 Other Supplies Rilonacept should be reconstituted with preservative -free WFI that will be provided by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals or designee along with 27-gauge, ½-inch needles, 3-ml syringes, alcohol wipes, gauze pads, bandages, and a puncture resistant container for disposal of needles and syringes. Only the syringes and needles provided by the Sponsor or its designee should be used to prepare and inject the study drug. The Sponsor also will provide coolers and refrigerated gel packs to ensure that the subjects transp ort the study drug at the proper temperature. On occasion, sites may be asked to locally procure ancillary materials. 5.5 Study Drug Overdose An overdose is any dose of study drug given to a subject or taken by a subject that exceeds the dose described in the protocol. Any overdose must be promptly reported to the Pharmacovigilance (PHV) in the same way and using the same procedures as for a serious adverse event (SAE) (Section 6.4.6 ), regardless of whether any AEs are associated with the overdose. 54 Page 341"
341,page_341,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 If there are AEs associated with the overdose, these should be recorded on the relevant AE/SAE Sections in the eCRF; however, overdoses without signs or symptoms do not need to be recorded as AEs in the eCRF. 5.5.1 Treatment of Study Drug Overdose The maximum amount of rilonacept that can be safely administered has not been determined. Maximum once-weekly doses of rilonacept up to 320 mg have been administered SC for up to approximately 18 months in a small number of subjects with CAPS, and for up to 6 months in subjects in an unapproved indication in clinical trials without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. In addition, rilonacept given IV at doses up to 2000 mg monthly for up to 6 months in another subject population was tolerated without dose-limiting toxicities (Rilonacept IB). In case of overdose, it is recommended that the subject be monitored for any signs or symptoms of AEs and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately (Section 13.1 , ARCA LYST® Prescribing Information). 5.5.2 Other Study Drug Errors To avoid study drug errors, it is important to note the following: • In this study, rilonacept is designated for SC injections only. It should be taken only by the subjects participating in the study and as instructed by study site personnel. Guidelines regarding the management of temperature excursions during storage will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. Pediatric dosing is calculated based on body weight in kilograms, not pounds. • • Any study drug error must be promptly reported to the same procedures as for an SAE (Section 6.4.6 ) PHV, in the same way and using the 5.6 Transmission of Infectious Agents The lyophilized study drug is to be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) inside the original carton to protect it from light. Study drug should not be used beyond the date stamped on the label. After reconstitution, study drug may be kept at ro om temperature, should be protected from light, and should be used within 3 hours of reconstitution. Study drug does not contain preservatives; therefore, unused portions of study drug should be discarded. 5.7 Misuse for Illegal Purposes Rilonacept does not have addicting potential, and the risk of misuse for illegal purposes is minimal. 5.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications Use of all concomitant medications and any changes in concomitant medications will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. The minimum requirement is that drug name and dates of administration are to be 55 Page 342"

This will include over-the-counter medications. all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, and Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the welfare of the subject during the study may be given at the discretion of the investigator. However, it is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded in full in the eCRF. The initiation of protocol prohibited medication (Sectio n 5.8.6 ) requires discontinuation of study drug. Guidelines regarding the use of concomitant medication will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual and are summarized in the following Sections. 5.8.1 Screening Subjects included in the study may be receiving concomitant NSAIDs and/or colchicine, and/or oral CS treatment in any combination, provided that the dosages of these medications have been stable (or not increased) for at least 3 days prior to and including RI baseline (first administration of study drug), and changes in medications made within this time period (e.g., 1 -time use of NSAIDs), in the opinion of the investigator, are not anticipated to significantly alter assessments of baseline disease activity. Analgesics can be used at the discretion of the investigator during screening activities prior to the first study drug dose, but only after the subject has documented a pericarditis pain level ≥4 on the 11 -point NRS within 7 days prior to and including RI baseline (first administration of study drug). Subjects can enter the study on prednisone (or equivalent dose) not exceeding 60 mg/day for adults and not exceeding 0.5 mg/kg/day (with a maximum dose of 60 mg/day) in pediatric subjects. 5.8.2 Single -blind RI Period • 1-week Stabilization period, during which rilonacept is administered in addition to SOC pericarditis therapy and ongoing pericarditis episode is treated. All concomitant pericarditis medications including NSAIDs, analgesics, colchicine and CS will remain stable, unless the dosing must be decreased or stopped in the judgement of the investigator due to an AE. 9-week background medication Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off backgrou nd SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues. The guidelines for background medication taper and discontinuation will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Corticosteroids Starting at Week 1 and through Week 10, CS will be tapered and discontinued at a rate dependent on the dose at study entry. Analgesics • 56 Page 343"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 Starting at Week 1 and through Week 10, analgesics (non -opioid and opioid) will be tapered and discontinued. Opioid analgesics can continue beyond Week 10 at stable doses through the end of the RW period if it is not feasible to discontinue them without causing withdrawal symptoms. NSAIDs and Colchicine Starting at Week 4 and through Week 10, NSAIDs and colchicine will be tapered and discontinued. • 2-week Monotherapy period during which rilonacept administration continues: Subjects are required to be off all background SOC pericarditis therapy, with the exception of opioid analgesics if their discontinuation is not feasible. 5.8.3 Double -blind Placebo -controlled RW Period During the RW period, subjects should not be receiving any concomitant medications for pericarditis, with the exception of opioid analgesics in case their taper down and discontinuation was not feasible in the RI period. 5.8.3.1 Concomitant Medication Upon Pericarditis Recurrence Subjects meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept Upon pericarditis recurrence and meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept (Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ) and completing the diagnostic workup as confirmed by the medical monitor, subjects will be transitioned to open -label rilonacept, as described in Section 3.1. Because open -label rilonacept can be administered only if at least 5 days have passed from the last blinded study drug administration, the investigators are allowed to use sequential ORT, i.e., analgesics, NSAIDs, and colchicine if necessary at their discretion. The use of those medications will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual; it is briefly given as follows: • Analgesics (including non -opioid and opioid) can be used for pain control prior to completing the diagnostic workup for a recurrent pericarditis episode. The use of analgesics during pericarditis recurrence evaluation will provide pain relief for subjects without impacting their CRP levels or other objective components of the diagnostic workup. • After the diagnostic workup is completed based on the medical monitor’s assessment, NSAIDs followed by colchicine can be added to open -label rilonacept based on the subject’s clinical status and at the discretion of the investigator. If, after transition to open -label rilonacept, the investigator decides that the subject requires CS for pericarditis therapy, the subject will be discontinued from rilonacept and followed through the EORW visit. • Subjects not meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept If, based on the investigator’s judgement, the subject is experiencing pericarditis recurrence that does 57 Page 344"

The use of analgesics during pericarditis recurrence evaluation will provide pain relief for subjects without impacting their CRP levels or other objective components of the diagnostic workup. • After the diagnostic workup is completed based on the medical monitor’s assessment, NSAIDs followed by colchicine can be added to blinded study drug based on the subject’s clinical status and at the discretion of the invest igator. If, after the addition of NSAIDs and colchicine, the investigator decides that the subject requires CS for pericarditis therapy, the subject will be discontinued from blinded study drug and followed through the EORW visit. • 5.8.4 Long Term Extension Treatment Period (LTE -TP) Subjects who opt to continue open -label rilonacept in the LTE-TP will have their concomitant pericarditis medications managed at the discretion of the investigator and based on the subject’s clinical status. If CS are required in addition to rilonacept to manage recurrent pericarditis, rilonacept should be discontinued. 5.8.5 Long Term Extension Follow -Up Period (LTE -FUP) During LTE-FUP, pericarditis medication can be managed at the investigator’s discretion. 5.8.6 Prohibited Concomitant Medicines During the Study Prohibited medications during the study and throughout the end of LTE-TP include the following: • • • • • Interleukin (IL) blockers other than rilonacept IL-6 blockers Janus -activating kinase inhibitors TNF inhibitors Potent immunosuppressants (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, nitrogen mustard, or other alkyl ating agents, agents that deplete B or T cells [e.g., rituximab, alemtuzumab]) Live (attenuated) vaccines, which are prohibited during the study and within 12 weeks after the last study drug administration • 58 Page 345"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 5.9 Blinding In the single -blind RI period, all subjects will receive rilonacept but will be blinded to the duration of the RI period and the timing of randomization. The RW period is a double -blind period in which rilonacept and placebo are identical in appearance. Neither the subject nor any of the investigator/site staff, , or Sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received (International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] E9). In the event of a pericarditis recurrence that meets the criteria for bailout rilonacept ( Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ), the subject will be transitioned to open -label rilonacept but will remain blinded to their prior RW treatment assignment. At the end of the RW period, all sites and subjects will be unblinded. Subjects will be offered participation in the LTE -TP, in which once -weekly open -label rilonacept can be continued for an additional 24 weeks. 5.9.1 Breaking the Blind A subject’s treatment assignment will not be broken until the end of the RW period. If the treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, the Sponsor must be notified immediately. If the investigator intends to unblind treatment allocation for a subject, then the Sponsor should be notified immediately. The investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject. In most cases, the management of a medical emergency would be the same, regardless of whether the subject received active drug. The treatment assign ment will be unblinded through the IWRS. The investigator must notify Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals and medical monitors as soon as possible but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded subject, unless that information is important for the safety of subjects currently in the study. The date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded in the eCRF. The PHV staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any subject with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the blinded report may be sent to clinical investigators in accordance with local regulations. 5.10 Treatment Compliance Subjects will record the administration of all doses of study drug (whether as an outpatient or in the clinic) in a subject’s diary. In addition, throughout all study periods, adherence to study drug administration will be assessed by the study site in collaboration with the visiting RN (Section 6). 59 Page 346"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 6 Study Assessments and Procedures Before performing any study procedures, all potential subjects will provide informed consent or an assent, if applicable. Potential subjects will have the study risks and benefits explained to them, the associated ICF reviewed with them, and all questions answere d for them. Subjects will undergo screening procedures specific to the study only after the ICF has been provided by the subject unless performed as part of SOC practice. The investigator or designee will also sign the ICF. 6.1 Study Visits The schedule of assessments for the study site visits is summarized in the Study Schedule of Activities. Following screening assessments, qualifying subjects will be enrolled and enter the RI period. Subjects who stop background pericarditis medications and achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12 ( Section 6.2.2 ), will be randomized and enter the RW period. During both the RI and RW period, a combination of clinic and outpatient visits will occur. Outpatient visits may consist of telephone or virtual contacts as well as home visits conducted by a visiting nurse. For each scheduled visit of the study (including outpatient and clinic), assessments should occur prior to scheduled injections of study drug. Subjects can be brought to the clinic in place of a scheduled outpatient visit, for an unscheduled visit at the discretion of the investigator, or if arranging a visiting nurse for an at home visit is logistical ly not feasible. The visit schedule is derived from the day of the RI baseline visit. One week is equal to 7 calendar days. Although visits do not occur every week, subjects are required to record pericarditis pain NRS measurements on a daily basis in t heir study device and to administer study drug on a once -weekly basis and record it in their study electronic diary (eDiary). If a subject is unable to independently complete the daily eDiary, a caregiver may help enter the data. Upon completion of the RI and RW periods, all subjects will have the opportunity to continue participating in the LTE. This will require each subject again providing informed consent prior to LTE participation. The LTE period will have a treatment period (LTE -TP) and an off treatment follow -up period (LTE -FUP). Any subject who prematurely discontinues study drug will be followed for the duration of the trial as specified in Section 4.2.2 . In addition, throughout all study periods, compliance with study drug administration will be assessed by the site in collaboration with the visiting RN. 6.1.1 Screening: Clinic and Remote as Needed A study screening eCRF is required to be completed for every subject with a signed ICF. For each subject, the subject identification is obtained from the IWRS. It is anticipated that some subjects may have a portion of the study screening procedures done as part of routine care outside the auspices of this study. As long as the se procedures were done within the allotted screening period timeframe, the results of these procedures may be used to support study screening and completion of the study screening eCRF. Any protocol -specified study qualification 60 Page 347"

It is possible that the screening and enrollment visit will occur on the same day. The below procedures are required to be completed to screen a subject ≤28 days prior to enrollment. All assessments and procedures are not required to be completed on-site; however, the site is expected to obtain the medical records for subject source documentation. • • • Obtain the ICF. Enter the subject into the IWRS. Review inclusion/exclusion criteria; ensure that the subject has a diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis based and is presenting with at least the third pericarditis episode. Record: demographic information, medical/surgical history, concomitant medications, all prior and current concomitant pericarditis medications, a detailed pericarditis history including all recurrent pericarditis events. Perform a full physical examination (may be performed by an investigator or other healthcare provider designated by the investigator).

Centrally assayed CRP values will be used for statistical evaluations of changes from baseline. Locally assayed CRP will be used for screening, evaluation of treatment response prior to randomization, and assessment of suspected pericarditis recurrence in the RW period. The POC device provided by Kiniksa Pharmace uticals is the preferred method for local laboratory CRP assessment. 6.2.1.2 11-Point Pericarditis Pain Numerical Rating Scale Subjects will be asked to provide a daily assessment of pericarditis pain starting at RI baseline. A validated 11-point pericarditis NRS ( Section 13.2 ) will be used to measure the subject’s level of pain intensity on a daily basis throughout the study ( Hawker et al 2011 ; Mannion et al 2007 ; Dworkin et al 2005 ). It is recommended that daily pericarditis pain measurements using the 11-point NRS are performed by subjects at the same time of the day each day, and prior to study drug injection on days with study drug administration. 6.2.1.3 Electrocardiogram Twelve -lead ECGs will be performed at study visits as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. Pericarditis commonly involves changes in the electrophysiologic activity of the heart, resulting in typical ECG findings, namely widespread ST-segment elevation or PR-segment depression. 6.2.1.4 Echocardiogram Echocardiographic assessment of presence of pericardial effusion in cluding new or worsening of pericardial effusion should be obtained at study visits as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. Pericardial effusion is characterized by accumulation of excess fluid in the pericardial space surrounding the heart, and pericarditis is one of the main causes of pericardial effusion. Echocardiography is a sensitive tool and the most widely used imaging technique for the detection of pericardial effusion and/or thickening. Echocardiograms are to be acquired per the ECHO core imaging parameters. Upon local assessment and interpretation, the ECHO is then to be submitted to the designated central imaging laboratory. 6.2.1.5 Patient Global Impression of Pericarditis Severity Patient Global Impression questionnaires have been developed for a variety of indications. The PGIPS is a single -item PRO measure that assesses the subject’s impression of overall severity of pericarditis symptoms at the time the questionnaire is administered, using a 7-point rating scale ranging from absent 76 Page 363"

The SF -36 was developed at RAND Corporation as part of its Medical Outcomes Study. The SF-36 assesses 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, general mental health, soci al functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. SF-36 will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in the Study Schedule of Activities. 77 Page 364"

The EQ-5D-5L consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, sel f-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The rating scale records the subject’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the subject’s own judgement. The scores on these 5 dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles (https://euroqol.org/eq -5d-instruments). The EQ-5D-5L will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in Study Schedule of Activities . 6.2.1.9 Insomnia Severity Index The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. The usual recall period is the “last 2 weeks” and the dimensions evaluated are severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5 -point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0=no problem; 4=very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging fr om 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: no clinically significant insomnia (0–7); subthreshold insomnia (8–14); clinical (moderate) insomnia (15– 21); and clinical (severe) insomnia (22–28) (Morin et al 2011 ). The ISI will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in Study Schedule of Activities. 6.2.1.10 Cardiac MRI Cardiac MRI will be performed as described in the Study Schedule of Activities in subjects at selected sites in the cardiac MRI substudy. Cardiac MRI will be performed to assess any changes in pericardial inflammation. Cardiac MRI readings will be performed by a central imaging laboratory. The study site/clinic reading of the MRI at the time of the examination may be used by the investigator for clinical decision -making. 6.2.2 Assessment of Clinical Response at the End of the Run -In Period Week 12/RW Baseline At RI Week 12/RW baseline visit, all subjects receiving rilonacept who are able to discontinue background SO C pericarditis therapy during the RI period ( Section 3.1 ) are assessed for Clinical Response. Only subjects who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12 and have discontinued background medications for pericarditis are eligible for randomization in the RW period. 78 Page 365"

At any time point during the RW period, subjects who experience suspected recurrence of their pericarditis will have been instructed to inform their site investigator as soon as possible. Subjects who experience a sus pected recurrence of pericarditis symptoms will be requested to report to the study site/clinic for a scheduled or unscheduled visit, during which clinical assessments will be performed to gather all the necessary diagnostic data to confirm or rule out the presence of pericarditis recurrence (Section 6.1.6.1 ). The investigator will evaluate all assessments performed for a diagnostic workup, whether at the study site or at locations outside. Upon completion of pericarditis workup, the investigator is required to contact the medical monitor to confirm that the protocol required diagnostic workup is complete prior to implementing treatment for the event. Following communication with the medical monitor, if the event meets the criteria for bailout rilonacept (at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11 -point NRS and one CRP value ≥1 mg/dL either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days), and after the medical monitor has confirmed with the investigator that the diagnostic workup is complete, the attainment of bailout criteria is confirmed in the IWRS, blinded study drug is discontinued, and open -label rilonacept treatment is dispensed. If needed, sequential ORT is allowed as outlined in Section 5.8.3 . The subject will continue to be followed up according to the Study Schedule of Activities for th e RW period. Following communication with the medical monitor, if the event does not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept but in the judgement of investigator requires treatment, after the medical monitor has confirmed with the investigator that the diagnostic workup is complete, the investigator is allowed to add sequential ORT to blinded study drug, and as outlined in Section 5.8.3. Blinded study drug treatment will continue until a pericarditis recurrence that meets criteri a for bailout rilonacept, or until the end of the RW period.

A pregnancy test (Section 6.6.6 ) will be conducted at screening and as needed during the study and must be performed 6 weeks after the last study drug administration. 6.3.1 Physical Examination A full physical examination should include at minimum an evaluation of vital signs, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat as well as cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, GI, genitourinary, and neurological systems. The decision to perform examination of genitourinary system should be guided by clinical judgement. Body weight and height will be measured as per the Study Schedule of Activities and will be recorded in the eCRF. Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the medical history and physical examination eCRFs. At selected visits as specified in the Study Schedule of Activities, an abbreviated physical examination will b e performed to evaluate vital signs, lung and heart sounds, including evaluation for pericardial rub. At all visits at the study site, limited symptom -directed physical examinations may need to be performed in order to determine changes from baseline or abnormalities and should be recorded in the subject’s trial notes. New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs on the Adverse Event eCRF. 6.3.2 Vital Signs Vital signs include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and temperature. Blood pressure measurements should be obtained after the subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes. 6.3.3 Chest X-ray Chest x -rays in accordance with local requirements will be obtained at screening (or an existing chest x-ray within 12 weeks of first study drug administration can be used) according to the Study Schedule of Activities. Chest x -rays should be reviewed by a qualified radiologist for clinically significant abnormali ties and evidence of pulmonary disease that would exclude the potential subject. 6.3.4 Tuberculosis Screening An IGRA test or another TB test based on acceptable clinical practice in each country will be performed in order to evaluate for the presence of active or latent TB infection at screening. 6.4 Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the study, regardless of their relationship to study drug or their clinical significance. 81 Page 368"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 6.4.1 Definitions 6.4.1.1 Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable sign (including an abnormal laborator y finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs also include: any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant change in frequ ency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug; abnormal laboratory findings considered by the reporting investigator to be clinically significant; and any untoward medical occurrence. 6.4.1.2 Treatment -emergent Adverse Event A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before exposure to the study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after exposure to the study drug. 6.4.1.3 Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any dose: • Results in death . Includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to the study drug (e.g., car accident where the subject is a passenger). Is life-threatening . In the view of the investigator, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event at the time of the event (i.e., it does not include an AE that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form). Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization. (Complications occurring during hospitalization are AEs and are SAEs if they cause prolongation of the current hospitalization. Hospitali zation for elective treatment of a pre -existing non -worsening condition is not, however, considered an AE. The details of such pre -existing condition must be recorded on the medical history or physical examination page of the eCRF. Hospitalization is defin ed as an admission to the hospital ward, a short -stay type unit, or Emergency Room for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital stay longer than originally anticipated for the event or development of a new AE as determined by the Investigator or treating physician.) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . (An AE is incapacitating or disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions.) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. • • • • 82 Page 369"

Important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (e.g., inte nsive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse). In addition, medical and scientific judgment is required to decide if prompt notification is required in situations other than those defined for SAEs above, i.e., any event that the investigator regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but may have jeopardized the subject or requ ired intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or that would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution that may be associated with the use of the study drug. All SAEs that occur after signing of study -related informed consent, whether or not the SAEs are related to the study drug or study procedures, must be reported. 6.4.1.4 Adverse Event of Special Interest An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is defined as an AE of scientific and medical interest specific to the understanding of the study drug and requiring close monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the Sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non -serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing analysis of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of the study drug. Treatments with immunosuppressants, including rilonacept, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. Therefore, malignancy is an AESI for rilonacept. Any AE of malignancy (excluding basal cell carcinoma of the skin) requires reporting to the Pharmacovigilance (PHV) within 24 hours after the time the site personnel first learn about the event, following the process as described in Section 6.4.6 . 6.4.1.5 Adverse Reaction Any noxious and unintended response to the study drug (i.e., where a causal relationship between the study drug and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) re lated to any dose should be considered adverse drug reaction. 6.4.1.6 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is an adverse reaction that is “unexpected”, i.e., it is not listed (or not listed at the severity that has been observed) in the designated Reference Safety Information of the Investigator’s Brochure.

If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. The relationship or association of the study drug in causing or contributing to the AE will be characterized by investigator using the following classification and criteria: • Not Related : when the AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedure/conditions Unlikely Related : when the temporal association between the AE and the study drug is such that the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE Possibly Related : when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedures/conditions Related : when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause -effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced • • • 6.4.2.2 Intensity The severity of an AE will be recorded as one of the following: • • Mild : easily tolerated, does not interfere with normal daily activities, does not require intervention Moderate : causes some interference with daily activities; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated Severe : as a consequence of the event, daily activities are limited or completely halted; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated • Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 6.4.3 Recording Adverse Events Each subject should be monitored for the development of any AEs. This information should be collected by asking nonleading questions (such as “How are you feeling?”) and from observations of and conv ersations with patients. AEs may also be collected by direct physical exam, diagnostic procedures, or any other appropriate source. 84 Page 371"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 At every study visit (telephone or at the site), subjects will be asked a standard nonleading question to elicit any medically related changes in their well -being. They will also be asked if they have bee n admitted to the hospital, had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over-the-counter medications). All AEs (serious and non-serious) will be documented in the subject’s source documents and recorded in the eCRF. Any clinically relevant (as determined by the investigator) deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and in the eCRF. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. Also, when possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. Information to be collected includes the following: • • • • • • • • • Event term Date and time of onset Investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship study drug Date of resolution of the event Seriousness Any required treatment or actions Outcome Whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study drug. Whether or not the AE is an Injection Site Reaction (ISR). ISR is defined as any AE that occurs at the study drug injection site. If an ISR is observed, the subject may be treated at the discretion of the investigator. Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all AEs. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened but does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if the condition deteri orates at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. 6.4.3.1 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject or reported in response to the open question from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of a diagnosis is preferred (when possible) to the recording of a list of signs and 85 Page 372"

However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 6.4.3.2 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests If an abnormal laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia vs low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically significant findings on examinations and tests should be reported as AEs. Any new or aggravated clinically significant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reporte d as an AE. 6.4.3.3 Pericarditis Disease Related Events Signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings associated with pericarditis are to be captured as a pericarditis recurrence event rather than as an AE unless the event is more severe than expected for the subject. In any case, pericarditis recurrence is required to be captured in the eCRF (see Section 6.2.3 ) within 24 hours of learning of the event. 6.4.4 Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events Adverse events will be assessed from the time the subjects signs the ICF and through the duration of the study, or at least through the SFU period (6 weeks after the last dose of study drug). 6.4.5 Follow -Up of Unresolved Adverse Events Every reasonable effort will be made to follow subjects who have AEs. Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s SFU visit are to be followed up by the investigator until resolution or for as long as medically indicated. Additional information for any subject with an ongoing AE at the end of the SFU period may be requested by the PHV, as needed. 6.4.6 Reporting Serious Adverse Events Any AE that meets SAE criteria (Section 6.4.1.3 ) must be reported to the PHV using the EDC system, immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) after the time site personnel first learn about the event. In the event the EDC entry is not possible (e.g., system failure or access problems), the study site should complete the paper SAE report form and fax the form to the PHV within 24 hours of awareness. The EDC system should be updated as soon as it is available. A full description of every SAE will need to be provided to the PHV (this may be supported by source documentation such as discharge summary or laboratory report should these documents be 86 Page 373"

Nonetheless, any pregnancy that occurs during study participation (including pregnancy in a female partner of a male subject) must be reported to the PHV in the same way and using the same procedures as for an SAE ( Section 6.4.6 ). The subject with pregnancy must not receive (additional) study drug. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome (including spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) and status of mother and child, even if the subject was discontinued from the study. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous miscarriage must be reported as an SAE. 87 Page 374"

Instances of perinatal death or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the investigator at any time after cessation of study drug, will be reported to the PHV within 24 hours. 6.4.8 Evaluating and Reporting SUSARs Pharmacovigilance will promptly evaluate all SUSARs and nonserious AEs of special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs/IECs, and applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. To determine reporting requirements for single AE cases, PHV staff in collaboration with Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals will assess the expectedness of these events using the Reference Safety Information (Section 6.2) of the rilonacept Investigator’s Brochure. PHV will compare the severity of each SUSAR and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator’s assessment of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by PHV and Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals as needed. All relevant information about suspected SUSARs that are fatal or life-threatening will be recorded and reported to the competent authorities in all the applicable countries, and IRBs/IECs in conjunction with Directive 2001/20/EC. 6.5 Other Assessments 6.5.1 Pharmacokinetic Sample All subjects will have PK samples obtained according to the Study Schedule of Activities. For PK analyses, it is important that the exact time of the SC injection is recorded for each subject. When PK samples are to be collected on dosing days, serum will be collected pre -dose to measure rilonacept concentrations. Specific procedures for sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment can be found in a separate Laboratory Manual provided to sites. A PK substudy will be conducted in a subset of subjects agreeing to provide a PK sample 24 hours after the first dose of study drug in the RI period.

An event of interest is defined as a subject’s first adjudicated recurrence of pericarditis. The following assumptions are used in the sample size calculation using EAST 6.4.1: • • • • • 2.5% 90% 8 0.244 10% 1-sided significance level Power Median time to event (in weeks) in placebo Hazard ratio (rilonacept/placebo) Percentage of subjects in the RI period that will not reach RW Given these assumptions, a total of 22 adjudicated pericarditis recurrence events is required to achieve the power. About 25 subjects per arm (a total of 50 subjects) will be randomized. Considering 10% of subjects in the RI period that will not reach the RW period, approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Patient enrollment and the pericarditis recurrence event accrual will be closely monitored during the study. The monitoring activities will be done in a blinded fashion during the RW period. If the number of patients randomized is less than 50 and/or the time anticipated for the number of events required for the analysis of primary efficacy endpoint significantly exceeds the projected timeline, additional patients may be enrolled and/or randomized at Kiniksa Pharmaceutical’s discretion. However, at this time it is anticipated that no more than 75 subjects will be enrolled into this study. Since the data cutoff will be the event date of the 22nd adjudicated pericarditis recurrence A ND all subjects still in the RW period have been treated for 24 weeks, the actual power could be higher if the assumed hazard ratio holds. 7.5 Analysis Sets The following analysis sets will be used in the statistical analyses. 94 Page 381"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: All subjects who are randomized in the RW period will be included in the ITT analysis set. The primary analysis for efficacy endpoints in the RW period will be based on the ITT analysis set. Treatment comparisons for all ITT analyses will be based on each subject’s treatment assignment from randomization. Safety Analysis Set: All subjects who take at least 1 dose of study drug in the RI period will be included in the safety analysis set (SS). Safety analyses will be based on the actual treatment a subject received. Run-in Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the RI period will be included in the RI analysis set (RIS). Per-protocol Analysis Set: The per protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set with the exclusion of subjects with major protocol violations or violations that may potentially bias statistical analyses or the ethical conduct of the study. The criteria of these violations will be determined prior to unblinding. This analysis set may be used for sensitivity analyses for efficacy endpoints in the RW period. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: The PK analysis set includes subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have at least 1 PK sample. The PK analysis set will be used for all PK analyses. 7.6 Description of Subgroups to be Analyzed Subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint will be performed by the stratification variable for randomization, as well as by important variables for baseline demographics and patient characteristics. These analyses are for the RW period only. Details will be provided in the SAP. 7.7 Statistical Analysis Methodology This Section outlines the overall methodologies. Details of the statistical analyses, methods, and data conventions will be described in the SAP. 7.7.1 General Methods Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS® software Version 9.4 or later. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean, the standard deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value. Time -to-event variables will be summarized using percent censored, event rate, and 25th, 50th, 75th and percentiles with 95% CI, if estimable. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Data will be listed in data listings. At each of RI and RW periods and in the LTE -TP, baseline will be the last value before the first dose of study drug within each individual period unless otherwise specified. For change -over-time endpoints in the RW period, by-visit analysis will be performed at each scheduled visit for at least 24 weeks. 95 Page 382"

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 7.7.2 Stratified Analysis There will be 2 stratification variables for randomization: • • Oral CS use at RI baseline: yes or no Diagnosis of recurrent idiopathic pericarditis at RI baseline: yes or no When a stratified analysis is used in the analysis and a stratum has no event of interest or no responder, the stratum will be pooled with the other stratum in the same stratification variable. 7.7.3 Testing Hypotheses and Multiplicity Adjustment All statistical tests for the treatment comparison of efficacy endpoints in the RW period will be based on the ITT analysis set with 1 -sided α=0.025. For each endpoint, the null hypothesis is that the effects of rilonacept and placebo are the same. The alternative hypothesis is that rilonacept is better than the placebo. In ord er to control the overall 1 -sided type I error rate at the 0.025 level, a gatekeeping procedure in combination with Hochberg’s procedure will be applied to testing the primary and major secondary endpoints. If the 1 -sided p -value for testing the primary en dpoint is ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect on the primary endpoint will be claimed. Section 7.2.1 provides the order of major secondary endpoints. If the primary endpoint is significant, the first major secondary en dpoint, i.e., proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 24 of RW period will be tested at 1 -sided α=0.025. A significant treatment effect on this major secondary endpoint will be claimed if the 1 -sided p -value is ≤0.025. If the treatm ent effect is not significant on the primary endpoint, significance on this major secondary endpoint cannot be claimed regardless of the result. If both primary and first major secondary endpoints are significant following the above procedure, the secon d and third major secondary endpoints defined in Section 7.2.1 will be tested with Hochberg’s procedure at overall 1-sided α=0.025. If both 1-sided unadjusted p-values are ≤0.025, claim significance of rilonacept for both endpoints. If the larger 1-sided p -value is >0.025, compare the smaller 1 -sided p-value with 0.0125. If the smaller 1 -sided p -value is ≤0.0125, claim significance of rilonacept on this endpoint. 7.7.4 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint Primary analysis of this study will be done after 22nd CEC -confirmed pericarditis recurrence AND after all subjects in the RW period have been treated for 24 weeks. The log rank test will be the primary method for the analysis of time to recurrence, stratified by the stratificatio n variables for randomization. A sensitivity analysis will be performed based on the investigator’s judgement of pericarditis recurrence. Additional sensitivity may be defined in the SAP. 96 Page 383"

CONTRAINDICATIONS 5 5.1 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infections Interleukin -1 (IL -1) blockade may interfere with the immune response to infections. Treatment with another medication that works through inhibition of IL -1 has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and serious infectio ns have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. There was a greater incidence of infections in patients on ARCALYST compared with placebo. In the controlled port ion of the study, one infection was reported as severe, which was bronchitis in a patient on ARCALYST. In an open -label extension study, one patient developed bacterial meningitis and died [ see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Treatment with ARCALYST should not be initiated in patients with an active or chronic infection. In clinical studies, ARCALYST has not been administered concomitantly with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of 110 Page 397"
397,page_397,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 an IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. Taking ARCALYST with TNF inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections. Drugs that affect the immune system by blocking TNF have been associated with an increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). It is possible that taking drugs such as ARCALYST that block IL - 1 increases the risk of TB or other atypical or opportunistic infections . Healthcare providers should follow current CDC guidelines both to evaluate for and to treat possible latent tuberculosis infections before initiating therapy with ARCALYST. 5.2 Immunosuppression The impact of treatment with ARCALYST on active and/or chronic infections and the development of malignancies is not known [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. However, treatment with immunosuppressants, including ARCALYST, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. 5.3 Immunizations Since no data are available on either the efficacy of live vaccines or on the risks of secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ARCALYST, live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ARCALYST. In addition, because ARCALYST may interfere with normal immune response to new antigens, vaccinations may not be effective in patients receiving ARCALYST. No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccination with inactivate d (killed) antigens in patients receiving ARCALYST. Because IL -1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections, it is recommended that prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST adult and pediatric patients receive all recommended vaccination s, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine. (See current Recommended Immunizations schedules at the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html). 5.4 Lipid Profile Changes Patients should be monitored for changes in their lipid profiles and provided with medical treatment if warranted [ see Adverse Reactions (6.7) ]. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions associated with ARCALYST administration in the clinical studies were rare. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of ARCALYST sh ould be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Six serious adverse reactions were reported by four patients during the clinical program. These serious adverse reactions were Mycobacterium intracellulare infection; gastrointestinal bleeding and colitis; sinusitis and bronchitis; and Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. 111 Page 398"
398,page_398,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 The most commonly reported adverse reaction associated with ARCALYST was injection -site reaction (ISR) [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )]. The next most commonly reported adverse reaction was upper respiratory infection [ see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the cl inical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described herein reflect exposure to ARCALYST in 600 patients, including 85 exposed for at least 6 months and 65 exposed for at least one year. These included patients with CAPS, patients with other diseases, and healthy volunteers. Approximately 60 patients with CAPS have been treated weekly with 160 mg of ARCALYST. The pivotal trial population included 47 patients with CAPS. These patients were between the ages of 22 and 78 years (average 51 years). Thirty -one patients were female and 16 were male. All of the patients were White/Caucasian. Six pediatric patients (12 -17 years) were enrolled directly into the open -label extension phase. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Part A of the clinical trial was conducted in patients with CAPS who were naïve to treatment with ARCALYST. Part A of the study was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, six -week study comparing ARCALYST to placebo [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Table 1 reflects the frequency of adverse events reported by at least two patients during Part A.

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 6.2 Injection -Site Reactions In patients with CAPS, the most common and consistently reported adverse event associated with ARCALYST was injection -site reaction (ISR). The ISRs included erythema, swelling, pruritus, mass, bruising, inflammation, pain, edema, dermatitis, discomfort, urticaria, vesicles, warmth and hemorrhage. Most injection -site reactions lasted for one to two days. No ISRs were assessed as severe, and no patient discontinued study participation due to an ISR. 6.3 Infections During Part A, the incidence of patients reporting infections was greater with ARCALYST (48%) than with placebo (17%). In Part B, randomized withdrawal, the incidence of infections were similar in the ARCALYST (18%) and the placebo patients (22%). Part A of the trial was ini tiated in the winter months, while Part B was predominantly performed in the summer months. In placebo -controlled studies across a variety of patient populations encompassing 360 patients treated with rilonacept and 179 treated with placebo, the incidence of infections was 34% and 27% (2.15 per patient -exposure year and 1.81 per patient -exposure year), respectively, for rilonacept and placebo. Serious Infections: One patient receiving ARCALYST for an unapproved indication in another study develope d an infection in his olecranon bursa with Mycobacterium intracellulare . The patient was on chronic glucocorticoid treatment. The infection occurred after an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection into the bursa with subsequent local exposure to a suspect ed source of mycobacteria. The patient recovered after the administration of the appropriate antimicrobial therapy. One patient treated for another unapproved indication developed bronchitis/sinusitis, which resulted in hospitalization. One patient died in an open -label study of CAPS from Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. 6.4 Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 6.5 Hematologic Events One patient in a study in an unapproved indication developed transient neutropenia (ANC < 1 x 109/L) after receiving a large dose (2000 mg intravenously) of ARCALYST. The patient did not experience any infection associated with the neutropenia. 6.6 Immunogenicity Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected by an ELISA assay in patients with CAPS after treatment with ARCALYST. Nineteen of 55 patients (35%) who had received ARCALYST for at least 6 weeks tested positive for treatment -emergent binding antibodies on at least one occasion. Of the 19, seven tested positive at the last assessment (Week 18 or 24 of the open -label extension period), and five patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies on at least one occasion. There was no corre lation of antibody activity and either clinical effectiveness or safety. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to the rilonacept receptor domains in specific assays, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. The observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is 113 Page 400"
400,page_400,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, con comitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to rilonacept with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.7 Lipid Profiles Cholesterol and lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Patients with CAPS treated with ARCALYST experienced increases in their mean total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The mean increases from baseline for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were 19 mg/dL, 2 mg/dL, 10 mg/dL, and 57 mg/dL respectively after 6 weeks of open -label therapy. Physicians should monitor the lipid profiles of their patients (for example after 2 -3 months) and consider lipi d-lowering therapies as needed based upon cardiovascular risk factors and current guidelines. 7 7.1 DRUG INTERACTIONS TNF -Blocking Agent and IL-1 Blocking Agent Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ARCALYST. Concomitant administration of another drug that blocks IL -1 with a TNF -blocking agent in another patient population has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and an increased risk of neutropenia. The concomitant administration of ARC ALYST with TNF -blocking agents may also result in similar toxicities and is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The concomitant administration of ARCALYST with other drugs that block IL -1 has not been studi ed. Based upon the potential for pharmacologic interactions between rilonacept and a recombinant IL -1ra, concomitant administration of ARCALYST and other agents that block IL-1 or its receptors is not recommended. 7.2 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL -1) during chronic inflammation. Thus it is expected that for a molecule that binds to IL -1, such as rilonacept, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted (e.g., warfarin). Upon initiation of ARCALYST, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeu tic monitoring of the effect or drug concentration should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted as needed. 8 8.1 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of ARCALYST in pregnant women. Based on animal data, ARCALYST may cause fetal harm. An embryo -fetal developmental toxicity study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys treated with 0, 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg given twice a week (highest dose is approximately 3.7-fold higher than the human doses of 160 mg based on body 114 Page 401"
401,page_401,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 surface area). The fetus of the only monkey with exposure to rilonacept during the later period of gestation showed multiple fusion and absence of the ribs and thoracic vertebral bodies and arches. Exposure to rilonacept during this time period was below that expected clinically. Likewise, in the cynomolgus monkey, all doses of rilonacept reduced serum levels of estradiol up to 64% compared to controls and increa sed the incidence of lumbar ribs compared to both control animals and historical control incidences. In perinatal and postnatal developmental toxicology studies in the mouse model using a murine analog of rilonacept (0, 20, 100 or 200 mg/kg), there was a 3 -fold increase in the number of stillbirths in dams treated with 200 mg/kg three times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). ARCALYST should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic effects. A peri - and post -natal reproductive toxicology study was performed in which mice were subcutaneously administered a murine analog of rilonacept at doses of 20, 100, 200 mg/kg three times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Results indicated an increased incidence in unscheduled deaths of the F 1 offspring during maturation at all doses tested. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether rilonacept is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ARCALYST is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Six pediatric patients with CAPS between the ages of 12 and 16 were treated with ARCALYST at a weekly, subcutaneous dose of 2.2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 160 mg) for 24 -weeks during the open - label extension phase. These patients showed improvement from baseli ne in their symptom scores and in objective markers of inflammation (e.g. Serum Amyloid A and C -Reactive Protein). The adverse events included injection site reactions and upper respiratory symptoms as were commonly seen in the adult patients. The trough drug levels for four pediatric patients measured at the end of the weekly dose interval (mean 20 mcg/mL, range 3.6 to 33 mcg/mL) were similar to those observed in adult patients with CAPS (mean 24 mcg/mL, range 7 to 56 mcg/mL). Safety and effectiven ess in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. When administered to pregnant primates, rilonacept treatment may have contributed to alterations in bone ossification in the fetus. It is not known if ARCALYST will alter bone develop ment in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients treated with ARCALYST should undergo appropriate monitoring for growth and development. [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 8.5 Geriatric Use In the placebo -controlled clinical studies in patients with CAPS and other indications, 70 patients randomized to treatment with ARCALYST were 65 years of age, and 6 were 75 years of age. In the CAPS clinical trial, efficacy, safety and tolerability were generally similar in elderly patients as compared to younger adults; however, only ten patients 65 years old participated in the trial. In an open -label extension study of CAPS, a 71 year old woman developed bacterial meningitis and died [see Adverse 115 Page 402"

Age did not appear to have a significant effect on steady -state trough concentrations in the clinical study. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment No formal studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of rilonacept administered subcutaneously in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment No formal studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of rilonacept administered subcutaneously in patients with hepatic impairment. 10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of overdose with ARCALYST. Maximum weekly doses of up to 320 mg have been administered subcutaneously for up to approximately 18 months in a small number of patients with CAPS and up to 6 months in patients with an unapproved indication in clinical trials without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. In addition, ARCALYST given intravenously at doses up to 2000 mg monthly in another patient population for up to six months were tolerated without dose -limiting toxic ities. The maximum amount of ARCALYST that can be safely administered has not been determined. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. 11 DESCRIPTION Rilonacept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the ligand -binding domains of the extracellular portions of the human interleukin -1 receptor component (IL -1RI) and IL -1 receptor accessory protein (IL - 1RAcP) linked in -line to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Rilonacept has a molecular weight of approximately 251 kDa. Rilonacept is expressed in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. ARCALYST is supplied in single -use, 20 -mL glass vials containing a sterile, white to off -white, lyophilized powder. Each vial of ARCALYST is to be reconstituted with 2.3 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. A volume of up to 2 mL can be withdrawn, which is designed to deliver 160 mg for subcutaneous admin istration only. The resulting solution is viscous, clear, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free from particulates. Each vial contains 220 mg rilonacept. After reconstitution, each vial contains 80 mg/mL rilonacept, 46 mM histidine, 50 mM arginine, 3.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 2.0% (w/v) sucrose, and 1.0% (w/v) glycine at a pH of 6.5 ± 0.3. No preservatives are present. 12 12.1 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action CAPS refer to rare genetic syndromes generally caused by mutations in the NLRP -3 [Nucleotide -binding domain, leucine rich family (NLR), pyrin domain containing 3] gene (also known as Cold -Induced Auto - 116 Page 403"
403,page_403,"Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Rilonacept (KPL -914) Protocol KPL -914-C002 -Amendment 1 Version 2.0, 12 Apr2019 inflammatory Syndrome -1 [CIAS1 ]). CAPS disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with male and female offspring equally affected. Features common to all disorders include fever, urticaria -like rash, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, and conjunctivitis. In most cases, inflammation in CAPS is associated with mutations in the NLRP -3 gene which encodes the protein cryopyrin, an important component of the inflammasome. Cryopyrin regulates the proteas e caspase -1 and controls the activation of interleukin -1 beta (IL -1β). Mutations in NLRP -3 result in an overactive inflammasome resulting in excessive release of activated IL-1β that drives inflammation. Rilonacept blocks IL -1β signaling by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL -1β and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. Rilonacept also binds IL -1α and IL -1 receptor antagonist (IL -1ra) with reduced affinity. The equilibrium dissociation constants for rilonacept binding to IL -1β, IL -1α and IL-1ra were 0.5 pM, 1.4 pM and 6.1 pM, respectively. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Serum Amyloid A (SAA) are indicators of inflammatory disease activity that are elevated in patients with CAPS. Elevated SAA has been associated with the development of systemic amyloidosis in patients with CAPS. Compared to placebo, treatment with ARCALYST resulted in sustained reductions from baseline in mean serum CRP and SAA to normal levels during the clinical trial. ARCALYST also normalized mean SAA from elevated levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The average trough levels of rilonacept were approximately 24 mcg/mL at steady -state following weekly subcutaneous doses of 160 mg for up to 48 weeks in patients with CAPS. The steady -state appeared to be reached by 6 weeks. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. No study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age, gender, or body weight on rilonacept exposure. Based on limited data obtained from the clinical study, steady state trough concentrations were similar between male and female patients. Age (26-78 years old) and body weight (50-120 kg) did not appear to have a significant effect on trough rilonacept concentrations. The effect of race could not be assessed because only Caucasian patients participated in the clinical study, reflecting the epidem iology of the disease. 13 13.1 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long -term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of rilonacept. The mutagenic potential of rilonacept was not evaluated. Male and female fertility was evaluated in a mouse surrogate model using a murine analog of rilonacept. Male mice were treated beginning 8 weeks prior to mating and continuing through female gestation day 15. Female mice were treated for 2 weeks prior to mating and on gestation days 0, 3, and 6. The murine analog of rilonacept did not alter either male or female fertility parameters at doses up to 200 mg/kg (this dose is approximately 6-fold higher than the 160 mg maintena nce dose based on body surface area). 117 Page 404"

Part A was a 6 -week, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group period comparing ARCALYST at a dose of 160 mg weekly after an initial loading dose of 320 mg to placebo. Part B followed immediately after Part A and consisted of a 9 -week, patient -blind period during which all patients received ARCALYST 160 mg weekly, followed by a 9 -week, double -blind, randomized withdrawal period in which patients were randomly assigned to either remain on ARCALYST 160 mg weekly or to receive placebo. Patients were then given the option to enroll in a 24 -week, open -label t reatment extension phase in which all patients were treated with ARCALYST 160 mg weekly. Using a daily diary questionnaire, patients rated the following five signs and symptoms of CAPS: joint pain, rash, feeling of fever/chills, eye redness/pain, and fatigue, each on a scale of 0 (none, no severity) to 10 (very severe). The study evaluated the mean symptom score using the change from baseline to the end of treatment. The changes in mean symptom scores for the randomized parallel -group period (Part A) and the randomized withdrawal period (Part B) of the study are shown in Table 2. ARCALYST -treated patients had a larger reduction in the mean symptom score in Part A compared to placebo -treated patients. In Part B, mean symptom scores increased more in patient s withdrawn to placebo compared to patients who remained on ARCALYST.

In Part A, patients treated with ARCALYST experienced more improvement in each of the five components of the composite endpoint (joint pain, rash, feeling of fever/chills, eye redness/pain, and fatigue) than placebo -treated patients. In Part A, a higher proportion of patients in the ARCALYST group experienced improvement from baseline in the composite score by at least 30% (96% vs. 29% of patients), by at least 50% (87% vs. 8%) and by at least 75% (70% vs. 0%) compared to the placebo group. Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and C -Reactive Protein (CRP) levels are acute phase reactants that are typically elevated in patients with CAPS with active disease. During Part A, mean levels of CRP decreased versus baseline for the ARCALYST treated patients, while there was no change fo r those on placebo (Table 3). ARCALYST also led to a decrease in SAA versus baseline to levels within the normal range. Table 3.

After reconstitution, ARCALYST may be kept at room temperature, shou ld be kept from light, and should be used within three hours of reconstitution. ARCALYST does not contain preservatives; therefore, unused portions of ARCALYST should be discarded. Discard the vial after a single withdrawal of drug. 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA -approved patient labeling. The first injection of ARCALYST should be performed under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional. If a patient or caregiver is to administer ARCALYST, he/she should be instructed on aseptic reconstitution of the lyophilized product and injection technique. The ability to inject subcutaneously should be assessed to ensure proper administration of ARCALYST, including rotation of injection sites. (See Patient Information Leaflet for ARCALYST®). ARCALYST should be reconstituted with preservative -free Sterile Water for Injection to be provided by the pharmacy. A puncture -resistant container for disposal of vials, needles and syringes should be used. Patien ts or caregivers should be instructed in proper vial, syringe, and needle disposal, and should be cautioned against reuse of these items. Injection -site Reactions: Physicians should explain to patients that almost half of the patients in the clinical trials experienced a reaction at the injection site. Injection -site reactions may include pain, erythema, swelling, pruritus, bruising, mass, inflammation, dermatitis, edema, urticaria, vesicles, warmth, and hemorrhage. Patients should be cautione d to avoid injecting into an area that is already swollen or red. Any persistent reaction should be brought to the attention of the prescribing physician. Infections: Patients should be cautioned that ARCALYST has been associated with serious, life-threate ning infections, and not to initiate treatment with ARCALYST if they have a chronic or active infection. Patients should be counseled to contact their healthcare professional immediately if they develop an infection after starting ARCALYST. Treatment with ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Patients should be counseled not to take any IL -1 blocking drug, including ARCALYST, if they are also taking a drug that blocks TNF such as etanercept, infliximab, or adalimumab. Use of ARCALYST with other IL-1 blocking agents, such as anakinra, is not recommended. Vaccinations: Prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST physicians should review with adult and pediatric p atients their vaccination history relative to current medical guidelines for vaccine use, including taking into account the potential of increased risk of infection during treatment with ARCALYST. 120 Page 407"

Current treatments, utilizing nonspecific inhibitors of inflammation (nonster oidal anti -inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], colchicine, corticosteroids [CS]), result in significant morbidity with chronic use. Some patients develop CS dependency or require surgical pericardiectomy to treat the symptoms of their disease. The interleukin -1 (IL -1) pathway plays a major role in the pathophysiology of recurrent pericarditis. Rilonacept (KPL -914) is a recombinant fusion protein that blocks IL -1 signaling. It is currently approved for treatment of another autoinflammatory condition, Cryopyrin -Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS). Based on its IL -1–antagonistic properties and pharmacokinetics (PK), which allow for once -weekly subcutaneous (SC) injections, it is reasonable to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rilonacept in subjects with recurrent pericarditis to address the unmet need in treatment of this disease. Study Objectives: Primary Objective : To assess the efficacy of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis."

Study Population: Subjects eligible for the study are subjects with recurrent pericarditis who do not have pericarditis secondary to prohibited conditions. The study population includes both adult subjects ≥18 years old and pediatric subjects ≥12 and <18 years old with a history of at least 2 prior pericarditis episodes (including the first episode and 1 recurrence). Enrollment of pediatric subjects will be limited to up to 20% of the study population. To be eli gible for the study, subjects must present at screening with at least a third pericarditis episode, defined as at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and C -reactive protein (CRP) value ≥1 mg/dL (ei ther on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) within 7 days prior to first study drug administration. Subjects included in the study may be receiving concomitant NSAIDs and/or colchicine and/or oral CS treatment in any combination, provided tha t the dosages of these medications have been stable (or not increased) for at least 3 days prior to first administration of study drug, and that changes in medications made within this time period (for instance, 1 -time use of NSAIDs) are not anticipated by the Investigator to significantly alter assessments of baseline disease activity. Study Design: This study has 4 periods: (1) Screening period , during which assessment of disease characteristics, baseline therapy, and the pretreatment workup is completed (up to 4 weeks). (2) Single -blind Run-In (RI) period (12 weeks), during which blinded rilonacept is administered SC once weekly in all subjects. The RI period includes the following: • 1-week Stabilization period, during which blinded rilonacept is administered in addition to standard of care (SOC) pericarditis therapy and the ongoing pericarditis episode is treated • 9-week Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues • 2-week Monotherapy period during which subjects who have successfully weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy will continue to receive blinded rilonacept In the single -blind RI period (subjects are blinded regarding the time of transition from the single -blind to the double -blind period), adult subjects ≥18 years old will receive rilonacept as an initial loading dose of 320 mg (2 SC injections of 160 mg each) at the RI baseline visit (2 × 2 ml), foll owed by a 160 mg (2 ml) SC dose once weekly throughout the RI period. Pediatric subjects (≥12 and <18 years old) will receive an initial loading dose of rilonacept 4.4 mg/kg (2 SC injections of 2.2 mg/kg each) at the RI baseline visit (maximum 2 × 2 ml), a nd then 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 2 ml) SC once weekly throughout RI period. Subjects who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12 defined as stopping background pericarditis therapy no later than Week 10 and weekly average of daily pericarditis pain score ≤2.0 on the 11 -point NRS within the 7 days prior to and including the day of randomization on RI Week 12/Randomization"

Subjects who do not achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12/RW baseline on rilonacept monotherapy will be discontinued from study drug, transitioned to SOC pericarditis therapy at the Investigator’s discretion and followed through the end of the RW period. Additionally, after the randomized withdrawal period has been closed when at least 22 confirmed recurrent pericarditis events have been accrued, subjects who have not yet completed the full 12 weeks of RI period at that time will be allowed to continue tapering of concomitant meds in the RI period; th ose subjects who achieved clinical response by Week 12 will be given the option to receive open -label rilonacept in the LTE without having to proceed through the RW period. (3) Double -blind placebo -controlled RW period ( Pericarditis recurrence event -driven dur ation) during which subjects who were able to stop background SOC pericarditis therapy and who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12/RW baseline are randomized in a double -blind manner at a 1:1 ratio to the following: • Rilonacept 160 mg (2.2 mg/kg in pediatric subjects) SC injections once weekly • Matching placebo SC injections once weekly Pericarditis Recurrence in the RW Period: Pericarditis recurrence is defined as the recurrence of typical pericarditis pain associated with supportive objective evidence of pericarditis. Upon pericarditis recurrence, subjects who report at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11point NRS and have 1 CRP value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) will receive bail out rilonacept (2 open -label injections of 160 mg rilonacept [or 4.4 mg/kg for pediatric subjects] followed by once weekly open -label rilonacept SC injections of 160 mg [or 2.2 mg/kg for pediatric subjects]) irrespective of randomized treatment assignment and as soon as at least 5 days have passed since the last study drug injection. Sequential Oral Rescue Therapy (ORT), i.e., analgesics first, then NSAIDs, and then colchicine, can be added if needed at the discretion of the Investigator, as outlined in the protocol and Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence and who do not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept will continue blinded study drug until the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept are met or through the end of the RW p eriod. For those subjects, sequential ORT can be added to blinded study drug at the discretion of the Investigator, as outlined in the protocol and Pharmacy Manual. All suspected pericarditis recurrence events in the RW period will be formally adjudicated by the Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC), and only events that are confirmed by the CEC as pericarditis recurrences will be used in the Primary Endpoint analysis. (4) Long Term Extension Treatment Period (LTE) (variable, up to 24 months), during which all subjects in the RW period (including subjects transitioned to open -label rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence) and subjects who are in the Run -In period after closure of the RW period, will have an option to receive up to 24 months of open -label rilonacept 160 mg (or 2.2 mg/kg for pediatric subjects) SC injections once weekly based on their clinical status and at the discretion of the Investigator, after signing LTE informed consent. Subjects will be reviewed again at 18 months after their most recent recurrence, (i.e., the qualifying episode for their original study enrollment prior to enrolling in the RI period or a recurrence in RW which was treated with bailout rilonacept, whichever is the later).

It acts as a soluble decoy receptor binding IL-1α/IL -1β and prevents their interaction with the IL-1 cell-surface receptor. Study drug (rilonacept o r placebo) is supplied in a single use, 20 ml glass vial containing a sterile, white to off -white, lyophilized powder. Each vial is to be reconstituted with 2.3 ml sterile Water for Injection (WFI). A volume up to 2 ml can be withdrawn, which is designated to deliver up to 160 mg of rilonacept or up to 2 ml of placebo for SC injection only. The resulting solution is clear, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free of particulates. Each rilonacept vial contains 220 mg of rilonacept lyophilized powder. After reconstitution with 2.3 ml WFI, the rilonacept vial contains 80 mg/ml rilonacept, 40 mM histidine, 50 mM arginine, 3.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 2.0% (w/v) sucrose, and 1.0% (w/v) glycine at a pH of 6.5. No preservatives are present. The first injection of rilonacept loading dose at the RI baseline visit will be administered at the study site by study site staff. The second injection of rilonacept loading dose at the RI baseline visit will be prepared and administered by the subject or the subject’s caregiver after adequate training and under the supervision of study site personnel. Subsequent once-weekly study drug doses will be self-administered SC by the subject or administered to the subject by a trained caregiver as an outpatient SC administration. Sample Size: Up to approximately 100 subjects with recurrent pericarditis will be enrolled, which will allow accrual of at least 22 adjudicated primary efficacy endpoint (pericarditis recurrence) events. Statistical Meth ods: The primary efficacy endpoint is time to pericarditis recurrence, defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first pericarditis recurrence for each subject. Only CEC -confirmed pericarditis recurrence will be considered as an event for the primary efficacy analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be done based on the Investigator’s assessment of the pericarditis recurrence. In order to control the overall 1 -sided type I error rate at the 0.025 level, a gatekeeping procedure in combinati on with Hochberg’s procedure will be applied to testing the primary and major secondary efficacy endpoints. Major secondary efficacy endpoints for the RW period include: • Proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 16 of the RW period • Percentage of days with no or minimal pain (pain ≤2 on the 11 -point NRS) in the first 16 weeks of the RW period • Proportion of subjects with absent or minimal pericarditis symptoms (based on the 7 -point rating scale of PGIPS) at Week 16 of the RW period"

INTRODUCTION Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the double -walled sac surrounding the heart. Etiologies of pericarditis include infectious causes (viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic) and non-infectious causes (idiopathic, autoimmune, neoplastic, metabolic, traumatic, post-surgical, and drug-related) (Adler et al 2015). In 80% of cases in developed countries, the cause of pericarditis is either post -viral or “idiopathic” in that it cannot be attributed to a specific condition (Imazio et al 2010; Zayas et al 1995 ). The underlying pathogenesis of recurrent pericarditis remains unclear, although a growing body of evidence suggests that abnormal immune responses play a role in the pathogenic processes. While the adaptive immune system plays a role in autoimmun e disorders that manifest with pericarditis as one of the many organ systems involved (such as in systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis), the innate immune system, including interleukin -1 (IL-1) signaling, is often the major effector in autoinflammatory disorders, such as isolated pericarditis ( Baskar et al 2016; Brucato et al 2016; Imazio et al 2016, Dinarello et al 2012 ). Diagnosis of pericarditis is based on the presence of ty pical chest pain (improved by sitting up and leaning forward) along with fever, pericardial friction rub, electrocardiographic changes, pericardial effusion, or elevated levels of inflammation markers (white blood cell [WBC] count, C-reactive protein [CRP], or erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) (Adler et al 2015 ). The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Pericardial Diseases define an acute pericarditis episode as the presence of at least 2 of the 4 following criteria: pericarditic chest pain, pericardial rubs, new widespread ST-segment elevation or PR -segment depression based on electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and pericardial effu sion (new or worsening). Elevations of certain markers of inflammation (i.e., CRP, ESR, and WBC) or evidence of pericardial inflammation by an imaging technique (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are used as supportive findings (Adler et al 2015 ). Recurrent pericarditis is characterized by the recurrence of pericarditis signs and symptoms after a symptom -free period of at least 4 to 6 weeks ( Adler et al 2015 ). Recurrent pericarditis affects 20% to 30% of patients with acute pericarditis ( Imazio 2014 ) and can be debilitating for patients due to pain and limitations in physical function during pericarditis episodes. Pericarditis recurrences result in increased emergency room admissions and hospitalizations. In the United States, 5% of patients presenting to the emergency room with non -ischemic chest pain are diagnosed with pericarditis (Agarwal et al 2015 ). The estimated prevalence of recurrent pericarditis in the US and Europe is 70,000 to 160,000 patients including approximately 8,000 to 21,000 patients who are refractory or intolerant to current therapies or who require long -term admi nistration of corticosteroids (CS) to control their disease ( Brucato et al 2016; Lazaros et al 2016; Imazio et al 2010; Khandaker et al 2010; Imazio et al 2008 ). 1.1. Current Therapeutic Management of Pericarditis There are no approved therapies for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. Current treatments include nonspecific inhibitors of inflammation, i.e., aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and CS (Lilly et al 2013 ).

Because high doses of aspirin and NSAIDs are often required, consideration must be given to gastric protection therapy, as potential risks of therapy incl ude stomach ulcers and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, as well as renal and cardiovascular toxicity. Colchicine is another mainstay therapy for pericarditis and is commonly used with NSAIDs to hasten the response to NSAIDs and reduce the risk of subsequent recurrences. However, its use may be associated with the risk of fatal overdosing, significant drug interactions, and neuromuscular toxicity. In addition, approximately 10% to 15% of patients experience significant GI side effects with colchicine, includi ng GI intolerance or severe diarrhea, requiring treatment discontinuation (Imazio et al 2016 ). Available ESC guidelines stipulate that CS should be prescribed for the management of pericarditis episodes only in cases of incomplete response, intolerance, or contraindications to NSAIDs and colchicine because of their unfavorable long-term benefit -risk profile. Corticosteroid use is associated with side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, avascular bone necrosis, and increased risk for infections ( Imazio et al 2008 ). For the management of pericarditis, CS are usually administered at low to moderate doses and can provide rapid control of symptoms. However, the y often require many months of tapering after the normalization of CRP levels. In addition, there is a high rate of pericarditis relapse when CS use is tapered or stopped ( Lotrionte et al 2010; Imazio et al 2005; Maisch et al 2004 ), particularly in the absence of concurrent colchicine treatment. Patients with recurrent pericarditis who are refractory or intolerant to current therapeutic management options or who require long -term adm inistration of CS to control their disease can be particularly challenging to manage. As a last resort, some refractory patients are being referred to the surgical procedure of pericardiectomy, with variable outcomes. Multiple immunosuppressive medicati ons have been used without consistent benefit (Baskar et al 1.2. Pathogenesis of Recurrent Pericarditis: Role of IL-1 Interleukin -1 is a key cytokine that drives the pathophysiology of many inflammatory processes, and it is implicated as a causative factor in various inflammatory diseases in humans. The two distinct IL -1 genes, IL1A and IL1B , encode IL -1α and IL -1β, respectively. IL -1α and IL-1β bind to the universally -expressed cell surface receptor, IL -1 receptor type -1, triggering a casca de of inflammatory mediators. The precursor form of IL -1α is expressed in keratinocytes, mucous membrane epithelial cells, and organs such as the liver and vascular endothelium in healthy individuals. During pathological states, IL -1α moves to the cell surface or is released after cell death to activate IL -1 receptors in adjacent cells, thus beginning the cascade of sterile inflammation. IL -1β, however, is not expressed in healthy individuals until a stimulus, such as microbial products or other chemokin es, triggers its transcription in monocytes, tissue macrophages, and dendritic cells via the inflammasome. IL-1 drives the inflammatory cascade in classic autoinflammatory conditions, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and familial Mediterranean Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 23 of 97 Page 455 2016 )."

IL-1–blocking therapies are effective at controlling end -organ disease and damage in patients with various autoinflammatory disorders, and different strategies to block IL-1 have been used in clinical trials and demonstrated substantial success in controlling episodes of fever and elevations in acute -phase reactants (Cantarini et al 2015 ). This mechanistic plausibility of IL-1 antagonism in addressing pathophysiology related to the inflammasome extends to other conditions characterized by sterile acute inflammation, such as recurrent pericarditis.

Rilonacept (KPL -914) Rilonacept (designated as KPL -914 in the development program by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd) was developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) of Tarrytown, NY, and is approved with the trade name ARCALYST® in the US for the treatment of CAPS, including Familial Cold Auto -Inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle -Wells Syndrome (MWS) in adults and children age 12 and older. Rilonacept is currently manufactured and marketed as ARCALYST® by Regeneron. Rilonacept received marketing authorization in the European Union for the treatment of CAPS with severe symptoms, including FCAS and MWS in adults and children aged 12 years and older, but based on a request from Regeneron, the marketing authorization was withdrawn. The withdrawal was a business decision and was not related to any concern with the safety or efficacy of rilonacept. Rilonacept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of human cytokine receptor extracellular domains and the Fc portion of human IgG1. R ilonacept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a total molecular weight of approximately 250 kDa. The dimer is covalently linked by disulfide bonds in the Fc region. Rilonacept incorporates in a single molecule the extracellular domains of both receptors require d for IL -1 signaling: the IL -1 type I receptor (IL-1R1) and the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1R-AcP) (Figure 1). Rilonacept is expressed in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Rilonacept blocks IL -1 by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL -1 and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 25 of 97 Page 457"

Safety of Rilonacept For a detailed review of the available rilonacept safety data, please refer to the current Investigator Brochure and the ARCALYST® package insert located in the Pharmacy Manual. Rilonacept has been evaluated in 23 studies, including 22 complete and 1 ongoing. In the completed studies, 2243 subjects (2152 patients and 91 healthy volunteers) were exposed to rilonacept. Thirty of these patients were pediatric (<18 years of age). Doses up to 320 mg subcutaneously (SC) once weekly and 2000 mg intravenously (IV) monthly have been studied for different indications, including CAPS, gout, and other inflammatory disorders. Injection Site Reactions In clinical studies with rilonacept, the most common and consistently reported AE associated with rilonacept was injection site reaction (ISR). The ISRs included erythema, swelling, pruritus, mass, bruising, inflammation, pain, edema, dermatitis, discomfort, urticaria, vesicles, warmth, and hemorrhage. Most ISRs were mild to moderate. In the gout clinical studies, approximately 1% of subjects treated with rilonacept discontinued due to ISRs. Similar results have been seen in other patient populations. Infections Interleukin -1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections. Serious life - threatening infections have been reported in clinical trials in subjects treated with rilonacept. Changes in Laboratory Parameters Cholesterol an d lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Subjects treated with rilonacept in clinical trials experienced increases in their mean total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides.

458,page_458,"Rilonacept (KPL -914) Study KPL-914-C002 Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd Clinical Study Protocol Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected using an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In clinical trials with rilonacept, a pproximately 30% to 35% of subjects tested positive for treatment -emergent antibodies to rilonacept on at least 1 occasion. Systemic Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions are a potential risk with protein therapeutics in general. In clinical studies with rilonacept, systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been rare. Malignancies Although malignancies have been reported in some subjects treated with rilonacept during clinical trials, the effect of rilonacept on the development of cancer is not known. Treatment with immunosuppressants, including rilonacept, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. Fetal Defects There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of rilonacept in pregnant women. Based on animal data, rilonacept may cause fetal harm. An embryo -fetal developmental toxicity study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys treated with 0, 5, 15, or 30 mg/kg given twice a week (highest dose is approximately 3.7-fold higher than the human dose of 160 mg based on body surface area). The fetus of the only monkey with exposure to rilonacept during the later period of gestation showed multiple fusion and absence of the ribs and thoracic vertebral bodies and arches. Exposure to rilonacept during this time p eriod was below that expected clinically. Likewise, in the cynomolgus monkey, all doses of rilonacept reduced serum levels of estradiol up to 64% compared to controls and increased the incidence of lumbar ribs compared to both control animals and historica l control incidences. In perinatal and postnatal developmental toxicology studies in the mouse model using a murine analog of rilonacept (0, 20, 100, or 200 mg/kg), there was a 3-fold increase in the number of stillbirths in dams treated with 200 mg/kg 3 times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Nonteratogenic effects : A peri - and postnatal reproductive toxicology study was performed in which mice were administered a murine analog of rilonacept at doses of 20, 100, and 200 mg/kg SC 3 times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6 -fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). Results indicated an increased incidence in unscheduled deaths of the F1 offspring during maturation at all doses tested. 1.3.2. KPL -914-C001 (Study with Rilonacept [KPL -914] in Recurrent Pericarditis) Study KPL -914-C001 is an open -label, single active -arm Phase 2 proof -of-concept study in subjects age ≥6 to 75 years old with recurrent idiopathic or post -pericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) pericarditis. The study includes a 6 -week Treatment Period in which all the subjects receive once -weekly rilonacept 160 mg SC (2.2 mg/kg for subjects ≥6 and <18 years old) following a loading dose of 320 mg SC in subjects ≥18 years old (4.4 mg/kg in subjects ≥6 and <18 years old) in addition to background pericarditis therapies (NSAIDS, colchicine, Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 27 of 97 Page 459"

After completing the 6 -week Treatment Period and based on response status, the subjects have the option to enter the 18 -week Extension Period during which they will continue to receive rilonacept at the same dose, but during which time Investigators are encouraged to wean and stop background pericarditis medications. The primary objectives of the study are to explore clinical and biochemi cal endpoints of recurrent pericarditis symptomatology, as well as to assess feasibility to wean from concomitant pericarditis medication in the Extension Period while continuing treatment with rilonacept. The study population includes the following 5 subject categories (Parts): • Part 1 enrolls symptomatic subjects with recurrent idiopathic pericarditis with an elevated marker of systemic inflammation (CRP level >1 mg/dL). Part 2 enrolls symptomatic subjects with recurrent idiopathic pericarditis with CRP level ≤1 mg/dL that, in the opinion of the Investigator, can be attributed to concomitant medications (e.g., CS) and with pericardial inflammation present on cardiac MRI confirmed by the imaging core lab. Part 3 enrolls subjects with CS-dependent recurrent idiopathic pericarditis not experiencing symptoms that would meet the diagnostic criteria for a recurrence of pericarditis. Part 4 enrolls symptomatic subjects with recurrent PPS with an elevated marker of systemic inflammation (CRP level >1 mg/dL). Part 5 enrolls subjects with CS -dependent recurrent PPS not experiencing symptoms that would meet the diagnostic criteria for a recurrence of pericarditis. • • • • The clinical phase of the study was completed in May 2019 (clinicaltrials.gov/ NCT03980522); the final clinical study report is in preparation . 2. 2.1.

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN Study Design This is a Phase 3, multi -center, double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized withdrawal study with open -label extension, to assess the efficacy and safety of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. This study has 4 periods (Figure 2 ). 3.1.1. Screening Period (up to 4 weeks) During the screening period, assessment of disease characteristics, baseline therapy, and the pre-treatment workup will be completed during a period of up to 4 weeks. Additional information provided in Section 6.1.2. 3.1.2. Single -blind Run-In (RI) Period (12 weeks) During the single -blind RI period, treatment with blinded rilonacept is administered and subjects are weaned off background standard of care (SOC) therapy for their pericarditis disease. Subject s will be blinded regarding the time of transition from the single -blind to the double -blind period; i.e., they will not be aware of the duration of the RI period. In the single -blind RI period, subjects ≥18 years old will receive blinded rilonacept as an initial loading dose of 320 mg (2 SC injections of 160 mg each) at the RI baseline visit (2 × 2 ml), followed by a 160 mg (2 ml) SC dose once weekly throughout the RI period. Pediatric subjects (≥12 and <18 years old) will receive an initi al loading dose of blinded rilonacept 4.4 mg/kg (2 SC injections of 2.2 mg/kg each) at the RI baseline visit (maximum 2 × 2 ml), and then 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 2 ml) SC once weekly throughout the RI period. The RI period includes: • 1-week Stabilization period, during which blinded rilonacept is administered in addition to SOC pericarditis therapy, and the ongoing pericarditis episode is treated. 9-week Weaning period, during which subjects are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues. The dosages of CS, NSAIDs, and colchicine will be tapered according to the guidelines for weaning in the Pharmacy Manual (for the purpose of the protocol, aspirin is considered an NS AID). In general, CS doses will be tapered off starting at RI Week 1 and will be withdrawn by RI Week 10 (over a total of 9 weeks). NSAID and colchicine doses will be tapered off starting at RI Week 4 and will be withdrawn by RI Week 10 (over a total of 6 weeks). 2-week Monotherapy period: Subjects who have been successfully weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy will continue to receive blinded rilonacept. • • Subjects who stopped background pericarditis medications and achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept monotherapy at RI Week 12/RW baseline will proceed into the double -blind placebo -controlled Randomized -Withdrawal (RW) period of the study.

Additionally, after the randomized withdrawal period has been closed when at least 22 confirmed recurrent pericarditis events have been accrued, subjects who have not yet completed the full 12 weeks of RI period at that time will be allowed to continue tapering of concomitant meds in the RI period; those subjects who achieved clinical response by Week 12 will be given the option to receive open -label rilonacept in the LTE without having to proceed through the RW period. 3.1.3. Double -blind Placebo -controlled RW Period (pericarditis recurrence event -driven duration) During the RW period, subjects who were able to stop background pericarditis medications and who achieve Clinical Response on rilonacept monotherapy at RI Week 12/RW baseline will be randomized 1:1 to doub le-blinded administration of study drug: • Rilonacept 160 mg (or 2.2 mg/kg in pediatric subjects ≥12 and <18 years old) SC injections once weekly OR Matching placebo SC injections once weekly • Pericarditis Recurrence in the RW Period: For the definition of pericarditis recurrence, refer to Section 6.2.3 . Upon pericarditis recurrence, subjects who report at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] and have 1 CRP value ≥1 mg/dL (either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days) will receive bailout rilonacept (2 open -label injections of 160 mg rilonacept [or 4.4 mg/kg for pediatric subjects]) irrespective of randomized treatment assignment and as soon as at least 5 days have passed since the last study drug injection. The subjects transitioning to bailout rilonacept will remain blinded to their prior RW period treatment assignment. Sequential Oral Rescue Therapy (ORT), i.e., analgesics first, then NSAIDs, and then colchicine, can be added, if needed, at the discretion of the Investigator, as outlined in Section 5.6.3 and detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence who do not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept will continue blinded study drug until they meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept or through the end of the RW period.

Long Term Extension Treatment Period (LTE) (up to 24 months) Upon completion of the RW period and the EORW visit, all subjects that did not discontinue study drug will have an option to continue treatment with open -label rilonacept in the LTE or to withdraw from the study. Subjects still in the RI period at the time that the RW period has ended and the LTE is opened will have the option to ent er the LTE directly when they have completed the RI period and have met the definition of clinical response or to withdraw from the study. Treatment in the extension period may continue until the earliest of the following dates: • Rilonacept is approved for commercial use or is available for reimbursement to treat pericarditis in the region The subject has received 24 months of treatment in the LTE or the Investigator and subject decide to continue in the study off -treatment Additio nal reasons for discontinuation of treatment can be found in section 4.3.1. • • Any subject who, in the opinion of the Investigator, should not continue open -label rilonacept will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects will be reviewed again at 18 months after their most recent recurrence, (i.e., the qualifying episode for their original study enrollment prior to enrolling in the RI period or a recurrence in RW which was treated with bailout rilonacept, whichever is the later). During this visit, the Investigator and subject will decide whether to continue treatment with open - label rilonacept, to continue in the study off -treatment for observation and rilonacept bailout upon subsequent recurrence, or discontinuation from the LTE. This review may be supplemented by cMRI and/or echocardiogram and/or additional diagnostic testing as determined by the Investigator. Subjects may also be unblinded at that time (if available) at the request of the Investigator per procedures outlined in the Unblinding Pl an to assist in clinical decision -making.

Rationale of Study Design Subjects eligible for this KPL -914-C002 study will be subjects with recurrent pericarditis presenting with an acute pericarditis episode at screening. The KPL -914-C002 study design ensures that during the RI period all subjects will receive rilonacept, a drug with evidence supporting clinical activity based on the clinical data with rilonacept from the Phase 2 proof -of-concept study (KPL -914-C001). During the RI period, pericarditis will be stabilized with symptoms controlled and background pericarditis medications (NSAIDs, colchicine, CS) will be tapered and withdrawn, while rilonacept treatment continues. The design then allows half of the subjects to continue receiving active treatment after having achiev ed Clinical Response on that treatment, which maximizes subject exposure to a potentially beneficial therapy. The temporary withdrawal of rilonacept (by switching to placebo) in the half of the subjects who were randomly assigned to placebo is expected to result in an accelerated time to pericarditis recurrence and a higher recurrence rate compared to those who continue on active treatment, a finding that demonstrates that the underlying pericarditis etiology is still ongoing and will provide further suppor t for the anticipated observation of the clinical effect of rilonacept during the RI period of the study. The period of exposure to an ineffective treatment is minimized in this design, as subjects will be removed from blinded treatment when the condition returns to a specified severity (i.e., for having met the criteria of pericarditis pain ≥4 on the 11 -point NRS and CRP level ≥1 mg/dL) without unblinding them to prior treatment assignment, thus protecting the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. All su bjects who meet the pain and CRP criteria described above will be treated with open -label bailout rilonacept using a loading dose, followed by once -weekly SC injections. In addition, sequential ORT such as NSAIDs and/or colchicine will be allowed upon recurrence at the Investigator’s discretion based on the subject’s clinical status, as outlined in Section 5.6.3 and as stipulated in the Pharmacy Manual. Subjects with pericarditis recurrence not meeting criteria for bailou t rilonacept, can be treated with sequential ORT based on Investigator judgement and as described in protocol Section 5.6.3 and the Pharmacy Manual. If the subject requires the addition of CS treatment to control the pericar ditis recurrence, the subject will be discontinued from study drug. All subjects will be followed for the duration of RW period. In summary, the proposed RW trial with rilonacept allows all enrolled subjects an opportunity to receive the active drug during the acute episode of pericarditis yet provides pivotal -quality data on the efficacy of rilonacept in this enriched cohort by subsequently randomly assigning subjects to placebo versus active treatment after they achieve a predefined clinical response. Sub jects with pericarditis recurrences after randomization will receive bailout rilonacept treatment and/or sequential ORT according to the protocol. This approach minimizes the exposure to placebo, which is important for a study that requires active disease upon enrollment and includes a pediatric population.

Justification for Dose Selection i.e., 320 mg SC loading dose (4.4 mg/kg in subjects ≥12 and <18 years old), followed by once -weekly SC doses at 160 mg (2.2 mg/kg in subjects ≥12 and <18 years old). In the rilonacept development program in CAPS, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions, over 2000 subjects were exposed to rilonacept, including 1650 subjects receiving a rilonacept dose of 160 mg or higher. A total of 103 and 169 subjects were exposed to any rilonacept dose for at least 1 year or 6 months, respectively. Most of the real -life experience with rilonacept comes from the CAPS population treated at this marketed dose. As of March 2018, approximately 365 CAPS patients have been exposed to rilonacept in the post -marketing setting since 2008. The safety data accumulated so far support the benefit/risk ratio for the rilonacept dose intended to be evaluated in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. Based on the clinical data with rilonacept from the Phase 2 proof of concept study (KPL -914-C001), it is expected that rilonacept doses (320 mg followed by 160 mg SC once weekly and corresponding pediatric doses), and evaluated in the KPL -914-C001 study, will consistently provide adequate suppression of clinical inflammatory response, including CRP levels, in patients with recurrent pericarditis. Subjects who meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence in the RW period of the study (Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ), irrespective of treatment assignment at randomization, will receive open -label rilonacept (loading dose of 320 mg SC followed by once -weekly SC injections of 160 mg, or the corresponding pediatric doses). The rationale for bailout rilonacept treatment upon pericarditis recurrence for subjects who were randomly assigned to placebo is that rilonacept had controlled their disease activity during the RI period; therefore, re -initiation of rilonacept is justified to regain control of pericarditis signs and symptoms upon recurrence. Subjects who were randomly assigned to rilonacept and qualify for bailout rilonacept upon pericarditis recurrence in the RW pe riod were initial responders to rilonacept treatment during the RI period; thus it could be assumed that the loss of response during the RW period could be due to development of resistance to rilonacept due to different mechanisms, e.g., higher IL -1 levels or a change in rilonacept pharmacokinetics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics. Therefore, re -administration of a loading dose of rilonacept may help to restore Clinical Response. Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 35 of 97 Page 467"

However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded in full in the eCRF. The initiation of protocol prohibited medication (Section 5.6.5 ) requires discontinuation of study drug. Guidelines regarding the use of concomitant medication will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual and are summarized in the following Sections. 5.6.1. Screening Subjects included in the study may be receiving concomitant NSAIDs and/or colchicine, and/or oral CS treatment in any combination, provided that the dosages of these medications have been stable (or not increased) for at least 3 days prior to and including RI baseline (first administration of study drug), and changes in medications made within this time period (e.g., 1-time use of NSAIDs), in the opinion of the Investigator, are not anticipated to sig nificantly alter assessments of baseline disease activity. Analgesics can be used at the discretion of the Investigator during screening activities prior to the first study drug dose, but only after the subject has documented a pericarditis pain level ≥4 on the 11 -point NRS within 7 days prior to and including RI baseline (first administration of study drug). Subjects can enter the study on prednisone (or equivalent dose) not exceeding 60 mg/day for adults and not exceeding 0.5 mg/kg/day (with a maximum do se of 60 mg/day) in pediatric subjects. 5.6.2. Single -blind RI Period 1-week Stabilization period, during which rilonacept is administered in addition to SOC pericarditis therapy and ongoing pericarditis episode is treated. All concomitant pericarditis medications including NSAIDs, analgesics, colchicine and CS will remain stable, unless the dosing must be decreased or stopped in the judgement of the Investigator due to an AE. 9-week background medication Weaning period, during which subject s are weaned off background SOC pericarditis therapy, as applicable, while treatment with blinded rilonacept continues.

Double -blind Placebo -controlled RW Period During the RW period, subjects should not be receiving any concomitant medications for pericarditis, with the exception of opioid analgesics in case their taper down and discontinuation was not feasible in the RI period. The use of concomitant medication is permitted upon pericarditis recurrence based on the subject meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept as follows: Subjects meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept Upon pericarditis recurrence and meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept (Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ) and completing the diagnostic workup as confirmed by the medical monitor, subjects will be transitioned to open -label rilonacept, as described in Section 3.1. Because open -label rilonacept can be administered only if at least 5 days have passed from the last blinded study drug administration, the Investigators are allowed to use sequential ORT, i.e., analgesics, NSAIDs, and colchicine, if necessary, at their discretion. The use of those medications will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual; it is briefly given as follows: • Analgesics (includin g non-opioid and opioid) can be used for pain control prior to completing the diagnostic workup for a recurrent pericarditis episode. The use of analgesics during pericarditis recurrence evaluation will provide pain relief for subjects without impacting their CRP levels or other objective components of the diagnostic workup. • After the diagnostic workup is completed based on the medical monitor’s assessment, NSAIDs followed by colchicine can be added to open -label rilonacept based on the subject’s clinical status and at the discretion of the Investigator. If, after transition to open -label rilonacept, the Investigator decides that the subject requires CS for pericarditis therapy, the subject will be discontinued fro m rilonacept and followed through the EORW visit. • Subjects not meeting protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept If, based on the Investigator’s judgement, the subject is experiencing pericarditis recurrence that does not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept (Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ) but does Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 47 of 97 Page 479"

Method of Blinding In the single -blind RI period, all subjects will receive rilonacept but will be blinded to the duration of the RI period and the timing of randomization. The RW period is a double -blind period in which rilonacept and placebo are identical in appearance. Neither the subject nor any of the Investigator/site staff, or Sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received (International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] E9). In the event of a pericarditis recurrence that meets the criteria for bailout rilonacept (Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3 ), the subject will be transitioned to open -label rilonacept but will remain blinded to their prior RW treatment assignment. If the treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the Investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, the Sponsor and must be notified immediately. The Investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject. In most cases, the management of a medical emergenc y would be the same, regardless of whether the subject received active drug. The treatment assignment will be unblinded through the IWRS. The PHV staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any subject with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the blinded report may be sent to clinical Investigators in accordance with local regulations. 5.8. Treatment Compliance Subjects will record the administration of all doses of study drug (whether as an outpatient or in the clinic) in a subject’s diary. In addition, throughout all study periods, adherence to study drug administration will be assessed by the study site in collaboration with the visit ing RN, if applicable (Section 6).

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES Before performing any study procedures, all potential subjects will provide informed consent or an assent, if applicable. Potential subjects will have the study risks and benefits explained to them, the associated ICF reviewed with them, and all questions answered for them. Subjects will undergo screening procedures specific to the study only after the ICF has been provided by the subject unless performed as part of SOC practice. The investigato r or designee will also sign the ICF. 6.1. Study Visits Refer to Section 13.1 for a comprehensive list of procedures in the Schedule of Activities. Following screening assessments, qualifying subjects will be enrolled and enter the RI period. Subjects who stop background pericarditis medications and achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12 (Section 6.2.2 ), will be randomized and enter the RW period. During both the RI and RW perio d, a combination of clinic and outpatient visits will occur. Outpatient visits may consist of telephone or virtual contacts as well as home visits conducted by a visiting nurse. For each scheduled visit of the study (including outpatient and clinic), asses sments should occur prior to scheduled injections of study drug. Subjects can be brought to the clinic in place of a scheduled outpatient visit, for an unscheduled visit at the discretion of the Investigator, or if arranging a visiting nurse for an at home visit is logistically not feasible. The visit schedule is derived from the day of the RI baseline visit. One week is equal to 7 calendar days. Although visits do not occur every week, subjects will be provided an electronic device to record daily pericarditis pain NRS measurements and administration of study drug from the beginning of the RI period through the end of the RW period. If a subject is unable to independently complete the daily entries, a caregiver may help the subject with data entry o nly. Throughout all study periods, compliance with study drug administration will be assessed by the site in collaboration with the visiting RN. Any subject who prematurely discontinues study drug will complete an EOT visit and will be followed for the duration of the trial according to the SOA unless the subject withdraws consent. In addition, throughout all study periods, compliance with study drug administration will be assessed by the site in collaboration with the visiting RN. 6.1.1. Screening Visit(s) Subjects will undergo screening procedures for the study only after the signing of informed consent or assent by the subject. Potential subjects will have the study risks and benefits explained to them, the associated ICF reviewed with them, and all questions answered for them. The Investigator or designee will also sign the ICF. All subjects that sign the informed consent will be registered in IWRS and will be assigned a unique subject ID. The screening period begins at th e signing of the ICF and must be completed within 28 days. Procedures performed per SOC prior to consent for the study, may be used for screening and do not need to be repeated for the study if performed within the 28 days of enrollment, except for the following procedures below: Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 50 of 97 Page 482"

Procedures may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator during the screening period. Subjects that are deemed not eligible must be screen failed in IWRS and can be rescreened at the discretion of the Investigator. Rescreened subjects will receive a new Subject ID through IWRS at the re-screening visit. It is possible that the screening and enrollment visit will occur on the same day. If the screening and the enrollment visit (RI Baseline Visit) is performed on the same day, procedures that are required at both visits do not need to be repeated. Refer to Section 13.1 for a comprehensive list of procedures in the Schedule of Activities for this visit. 6.1.2. Enrollment (RI Baseline Visit) Subjects meeting entry criteria will be enrolled at the RI Baseline visit. All procedures for the RI Baseline visit should be performed prior to enrollment in IWRS and the first administration of study drug. Refer to Section 13.1 for a comprehensive list of procedures in the Schedule of Activities for this visit. 6.1.3. Randomization (RI Week 12/RW Baseline Visit) All procedures for the RI Week 12 visit should be performed prior to randomization in IWRS. Subjects who stopped background SOC pericarditis therapy and who achieve Clinical Response (see Section 6.2.2) at RI Week 12 visit will be randomized in the IWRS and will complete the procedures for the RW Baseline visit. If randomization has been closed, subjects achieving Clinical Response after completing the RI period may transition directly to the LTE. For subjects that do not qualify for randomization, the Sponsor or medical monitor is to be immediately contacted to evaluate the reasons for non-qualification. Following medical monitor consultation, if the subject is deemed to not be a treatment responder, study drug will be discontinued, and the subject will not proceed to randomization. The subject will complete the EOT visit and continue with follow -up according to the SOA until the end of the RW period. Refer to Section 13.1 for a comprehensive list of procedures in the Schedule of Activities for this visit. 6.1.4. Pericarditis Recurrence Assessment: Clinic Visit If a subject experiences symptoms consistent with pericarditis recurrence, he/she should contact the study Investigator immediately for evaluation (including in the LTE). It is possible that a subject may have assessments performed remotely, however, assessments are also expected be performed at the study site as soon as possible.

End of Randomized Withdrawal and LTE Baseline (EORW and LTE Baseline Visits) All subjects, including those that have had pericarditis recurrence or have permanently discontinued study drug will have an EORW visit at the end of the RW period. Upon completion of the EORW visit procedures those subjects who have not discontinued treatment previously will provide informed consent to participate in the LTE period. The LTE Baseline visit will be completed on the same day as the EORW visit. During the LTE subjects will return to the site every 12 weeks for up to 24 months thereafter from the first dose of open -label rilonacept in the LTE. Refer to Section 13.1 for a comprehensive list of procedures in the Schedule of Activities for these visits. 6.1.7. End of Treatment Visit If at any time throughout the course of the study a subject prematurely discontinues study drug, an End of Treatment (EOT) visit is to occur as soon as possible. If the EOT visit coincides with the last study visit completed by the subject, procedures that are required at both visits do not need to be repeated and should be applied to complete the EOT requirements.

Safety Follow -up Visit The SFU visit is to be conducted 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug. In the event that a subject permanently discontinues study drug but does not withdraw the informed consent, the Investigator should continue to follow the subject per protocol for the remainder of that study period. Refer to Section 13.1 for a comprehensive list of procedures in the Schedule of Activities for this visit. 6.2. Efficacy Assessments Efficacy assessments to be performed at study visits are summarized in Section 13.1 and include: CRP, daily pericarditis pain assessment (11 -point NRS ), ECG, ECHO, Patient Global Impression of Pericarditis Severity (PGIPS), Physician Global Assessment of Pericarditis Activity (PGA -PA), and subject’s quality of life assessments (SF -36, EQ -5D-5L) and insomnia questionnaire (ISI). In a sub -study at selecte d sites, a cardiac MRI will be performed.

The POC device provided by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals is the preferred method for local laboratory CRP assessment. 6.2.1.2. 11-Point Pericarditis Pain Numerical Rating Scale Subjects will be asked to provide a daily assessment of pericarditis pain starting at RI baseline until EORW visit. A validated 11 -point pericarditis NRS (see Section 13.2) will be used to measure the subject’s level of pain intensity on a daily basis throughout the study (Hawker et al 2011; Mannion et al 2007 ; Dworkin et al 2005 ). It is recommended that daily pericarditis pain measurements using the 11 -point pericarditis NRS are performed by subjects at the same time of the day each day, and prior to study drug injection on days with study drug administration. 6.2.1.3. Electrocardiogram Twelve -lead ECGs will be performed at study visits as described in Section 13.1. Pericarditis commonly involves changes in the electrophysiologic activity of the heart, resulting in typical ECG findings, namely widespread ST-segment elevation or PR-segment depression. 6.2.1.4. Echocardiogram Echocardiographic assessment of presence of pericardial effusion including new or worsening of pericardial effusion should be obtained at study visits as described in Section 13.1. Pericardial effusion is characterized by accumulation of excess fluid in the pericardial space surrounding the heart, and pericarditis is one of the main causes of pericardial effusion. Echocardiography is a sensitive tool and the most widely used imaging technique for the detection of pericardial effusion and/or thickening. Echocardiograms are to be acquired per the ECHO core imaging parameters. Upon local assessment and interpretation, the ECHO is then to be submitted to the designated central imaging laboratory. 6.2.1.5. Patient Global Impression of Pericarditis Severity Patient Global Impression questionnaires have been developed for a variety of indications. The PGIPS is a si ngle-item PRO measure that assesses the subject’s impression of overall severity of pericarditis symptoms at the time the questionnaire is administered, using a 7-point rating scale ranging from absent (no recurrent pericarditis symptoms) to very severe (recurrent pericarditis symptoms cannot be ignored) (Guy 1976). The PGIPS can be completed in less than 30 seconds. The subject will select from the following that best describes the severity of pericarditis symptoms at the time of occurrence of the event: • • • Absent: no symptoms Minimal: can be easily ignored without effort Mild: can be ignored with effort Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 54 of 97 Page 486"

Physician Global Assessment of Pericarditis Activity Physician Global Assessment questionnaires have been developed for a variety of indications. The PGA -PA is a single -item clinician -reported outcome measure that Investigators use to rate their impression of the patien t’s overall pericarditis disease activity at the time the assessment is completed, using a 7 -point rating scale ranging from absent to very severe (Guy 1976). Like the PGIPS, the PGA -PA can be completed in less than 30 seconds.

The SF-36 was developed at RAND Corporation as part of its Medical Outcomes Study. The SF-36 assesses 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, general mental health, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. SF-36 will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in Section 13.1. 6.2.1.8. EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health -related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D-5L consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The descriptive Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 55 of 97 Page 487"
487,page_487,"Rilonacept (KPL -914) Study KPL-914-C002 Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd Clinical Study Protocol system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The rating scale records the subject’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the subject’s own judgement. The scores on these 5 dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles (ht tps://euroqol.org/eq -5d-instruments). The EQ-5D-5L will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in Section 13.1. 6.2.1.9. Insomnia Severity Index The ISI is a 7 -item self -report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. The usual recall period is the “last 2 weeks” and the dimensions evaluated are severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interf erence of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5 -point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0=no problem; 4=very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: no clinically significant insomnia (0 –7); subthreshold insomnia (8 –14); clinical (moderate) insomnia (15 –21); and clinical (severe) insomnia (22 –28) (Morin et al 2011). The ISI will be collected in subjects ≥18 years or older as described in Section 13.1. 6.2.1.10. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Cardiac MRI will be performed as described in Section 13.1 in subjects at selected sites in the cardiac MRI substudy. Cardiac MRI will be performed to assess any changes in pericardial inflammation. Cardiac MRI readings will be performed by a central imaging laboratory. The study site/clinic reading of the MRI at the time of the examination may be used by the Investigator for clinical decision -making. 6.2.2. Assessment of Clinical Response at the End of the Run-In Period Week 12/RW Baseline At RI Week 12/RW baseline visit, all subjects receiving rilonacept who are able to discontinue background SOC pericarditis therapy during the RI period (Section 3.1) are assessed for Cli nical Response. Only subjects who achieve Clinical Response at RI Week 12 and have discontinued background medications for pericarditis are eligible for randomization in the RW period. Clinical Response at RI Week 12 is defined as follows: • A weekly average of daily pericarditis pain of ≤2.0 on the 11 -point NRS during the 7 days prior to and including the day of randomization, AND CRP level ≤0.5 mg/dL at the RI Week 12/RW baseline visit. • Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 56 of 97 Page 488"

Management of Suspected Pericarditis Recurrence in the RW Period Pericarditis Recurrence Definition: Pericarditis recurrence, for the purpose of the protocol, is defined as the recurrence of typical pericarditis pain associated with supportive objective evidence of pericarditis. At any time point during the RW period, s ubjects who experience suspected recurrence of their pericarditis will have been instructed to inform their site Investigator as soon as possible. Subjects who experience a suspected recurrence of pericarditis symptoms will be requested to report to the st udy site/clinic for a scheduled or unscheduled visit, during which clinical assessments will be performed to gather all the necessary diagnostic data to confirm or rule out the presence of pericarditis recurrence (Section 6.1.4). The Investigator will evaluate all assessments performed for a diagnostic workup, whether at the study site or at locations outside. Upon completion of pericarditis workup, the Investigator is required to contact the medical monitor to confirm that the protocol required diagnostic workup is complete prior to implementing treatment for the event. Following communication with the medical monitor, if the event meets the criteria for bailout rilonacept (at least 1 day with pericarditis pain measurement ≥4 on the 11-point NRS and one CRP value ≥1 mg/dL either on the same day or separated by no more than 7 days), and after the medical monitor has confirmed with the Investigator that the diagnostic workup is complete, the attainment of bailout criteria is confirmed in the IWRS, blinded study drug is discontinued, and open -label rilonacept treatment is dispensed. If needed, sequential ORT is allowed as outlined in Section 5.6.3 . The subject will continue to be followed up according to Section 13.1 for the RW period. Following communication with the medical monitor, if the event does not meet the protocol criteria for bailout rilonacept but in the judgement of Investigator requires treatment, after the medical monitor has confirmed with the Investigator that the diagnostic workup is complete, the Investigator is allowed to add sequential ORT to blinded study drug, and as outlined in Section 5.6.3 . Blinded study drug treatment will continue until a pericarditis recurrence that meets criteria for bailout rilonacept, or until the end of the RW period. For a summary of management of suspected pericarditis recurrence, refer to Figure 3. Upon suspected pericarditis recurrence, the event is required to be captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system within 24 hours of learning of the event, and a pericarditis recurrence event adjudication package must be prepared for adjudication by CEC. The event package will include, but may not be limited to, data on the subject’s pericarditis pain level, CRP value, ECG tracing, ECHO result, the presence or abse nce of pericardial rub, and any additional source documentation relevant to the assessment of the suspected event. Details on endpoint package requirements will be described in the CEC charter. The CEC -confirmed pericarditis recurrences will be used for Pr imary Endpoint efficacy analysis.

At all visits at the study site, limited symptom -directed physical examinations may need to be performed in order to determine changes from baseline or abnormalities and should be recorded in the subject’s trial notes. New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs on the Adverse Event eCRF. 6.3.2. Vital Signs Vital signs include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and temperature. Blood pressure measurements should be obtained after the subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes. 6.3.3. Chest X-ray Chest x -rays in accordance with local requirements will be obtained at screening (or an existing chest x -ray within 12 weeks of first study drug administration can be used) according to Section 13.1. Chest x -rays should be reviewed by a qualified radiologist for clinically significant abnormalities and evidence of pulmonary disease that would exclude the potential subject. 6.3.4. Tuberculosis Screening An IGRA test or another TB test based on acceptable clinical practice in each country will be performed in order to evaluate for the presence of active or latent TB infection at screening (see Section 4.2). 6.4. Adverse Events The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the study, regardless of their relationshi p to study drug or their clinical significance. 6.4.1. Definitions 6.4.1.1. Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or n ot related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs also include: any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug; abnorma l laboratory findings considered by the reporting Investigator to be clinically significant; and any untoward medical occurrence.

Treatment -emergent Adverse Event A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before exposure to the study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after exposure to the study drug. 6.4.1.3. Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any dose: • Results in death . Includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to the study drug (e.g., car accident where the subject is a passenger). Is life-threatening . In the view of the Investigator, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event at the time o f the event (i.e., it does not include an AE that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form). Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization. (Complications occurring during hospitalization are AEs and are SAEs if they cause prolongation of the current hospitalization. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing non -worsening condition is not, however, considered an AE. The details of such pre -existing condition m ust be recorded on the medical history or physical examination page of the eCRF. Hospitalization is defined as an admission to the hospital ward, a short -stay type unit, or Emergency Room for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization i s defined as a hospital stay longer than originally anticipated for the event or development of a new AE as determined by the Investigator or treating physician.) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . (An AE is incapacitating or disab ling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions.) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Is an important medical event . Important medical events may not be immediately life-threaten ing or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse). • • • • • In addition, medical and scientific judgment is required to decide if prompt notification is required in situations other than those defined for SAEs above, i.e., any event that the Investigator regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but may have jeopardized the subject or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or that would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution that may be associated with the use of the study drug. All SAEs that occur after signing of study -related informed consent, whether or not the SAEs are related to the study drug or study procedures, must be reported.

Adverse Event of Special Interest An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is defined as an AE of scientific and medical interest specific to the understanding of the study drug and requiring close monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non - serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing analysis of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of the study drug. Treatments with immunosuppressants, including rilonacept, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. Therefore, malignancy is an AESI for rilonacept. Any AE of malignancy (excluding basal cell carcinoma of the skin) requires reporting to the Pharmacovigilance (PHV) within 24 hours after the time the site personnel first learn about the event, following the process as described in Section 6.4.6 . 6.4.1.5. Adverse Reaction Any noxious and unintended response to the study drug (i.e., where a causal relationship between the study drug and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reaction. 6.4.1.6. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is an adverse reaction that is “unexpected”, i.e., it is not listed (or not listed at the seve rity that has been observed) in the designated Reference Safety Information of the Investigator’s Brochure. Evaluation and reporting requirements for SUSARs are detailed in Section 6.4.8 . 6.4.2. Assessing Adverse Events 6.4.2.1. Relationship to Study Drug The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to the study drug is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If ther e is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. The relationship or association of the study drug in causing or contributing to the AE will be characterized by Investigator using the following classification and criteria: • Not Related : when the AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedure/conditions Unlikely Related : when the temporal association between the AE and the study drug is such that the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE Possibly Related : when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedures/conditions • • Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 61 of 97 Page 493"
493,page_493,"Rilonacept (KPL -914) Study KPL-914-C002 Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd Clinical Study Protocol • Related : when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause -effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced 6.4.2.2. Intensity The severity of an AE will be recorded as one of the following: • Mild : easily tolerated, does not interfere with normal daily activities, does not require intervention Moderate : causes some interference with daily activities; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated Severe : as a consequence of the event, daily activities are limited or completely halted; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated • • Changes in the severity of an AE shoul d be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 6.4.3. Recording Adverse Events Each subject should be monitored for the development of any AEs. This information should be collected by asking nonleading questions (such as “How are you feeling?”) and from observations of and conversations with patients. AEs may also be collected by direct physical exam, diagnostic procedures, or any other appropriate source. At every study visit (telephone or at the site), subjects will be asked a standard nonleading question to elicit any medically related changes in their well-being. They will also be asked if they have been admitted to the hospital, had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter medications). All AEs (serious and non -serious) will be documented in the subject’s source documents and recorded in the eCRF. Any clinically relevant (as determined by the Investigator) deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded in the su bject’s source documents and in the eCRF. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. Also, when possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. Information to be collected includes the following: • • • • Event term Date and time of onset Investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship study drug Date of resolution of the event Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 62 of 97 Page 494"

Whether or not the AE is an Injection Site Reaction (ISR). ISR is defined as any AE that occurs at the study drug injection site. If an ISR is observed, the subject may be treated at the discretion of the Investigator. Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all AEs. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened but does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if the condition deteriora tes at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. 6.4.3.1. Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject or reported in response to the open question from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of a diagnosis is preferred (when possible) to the recording of a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 6.4.3.2. Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests If an abnormal laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting Investigator uses the clinical rather t han the laboratory term (e.g., anemia vs low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically significant findings on examinations and tests should be reported as AEs. Any new or aggravated clinically significant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. 6.4.3.3. Pericarditis Disease -related Events Signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings associated with pericarditis are to be captured as a pericarditis recurrence event rather than as an AE unless the event is more severe than expected for the subject. In any case, pericarditis recurrence is required to be captured in the eCRF (see Section 6.2.3 ) within 24 hours of learning of the event. Version 3.0; 10 March 2020 Page 63 of 97 Page 495"

Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events Adverse events will be assessed from the time the subject’s signs the ICF and through 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug. 6.4.5. Follow -Up of Unresolved Adverse Events Every reasonable effort will be made to follow subjects who have AEs. Any AEs that are unresolved at the end of the subject’s SFU visit are to be followed up by the Investigator until resolution or for as long as medically indi cated. Additional information for any subject with an ongoing AE at the end of the SFU period may be requested by the PHV, as needed. 6.4.6. Reporting Serious Adverse Events Any AE that meets SAE criteria (Section 6.4.1.3 ) must be reported to the PHV using the EDC system, immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) after the time site personnel first learn about the event. In the event the EDC entry is not possible (e.g., system failure or access problems), the study site should complete the paper SAE report form and fax the form to the PHV within 24 hours of awareness. The EDC system should be updated as soon as it is available. A full description of every SAE will need to be provided to the PHV (this may be supported by source documentation such as discharge summary or laboratory report should these documents be requested by the PHV). Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should be sent to the original SAE information. PHV as soon as possible and placed with the The following contact information is to be used for SAE reporting: Information on non-serious AEs that become serious must also be reported to the PHV as soon as it is available. Investigators must report SAEs and follow -up information to their responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) as applicable per institutional policy. The Sponsor or designee will provide regulatory authorities, IRBs, IECs, and principal Investigators with clinical safety updates/reports according to local requirements. 6.4.6.1.

Pregnancy Pregnancy is regarded as an AE only if there is a suspicion that study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Nonetheless, any pregnancy that occurs during study participation (including pregnancy in a female partner of a male subject) must be reported to the PHV in the same way and using the same procedures as for an SAE (Section 6.4.6 ). The subject with pregnancy must not receive (additional) study drug. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome (including spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) and status of mother and child, even if the subject was discontinued from the study. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous miscarriage must be reported as an SAE. Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to the Investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study, and considered by the Investigator as possibly related to the study drug, must be promptly reported to the PHV. In the event that a subject is found to be pregnant after having received at least 1 study drug dose, the study drug must be discontinued, and the pregnancy will be followed to term and the status of mother and child will be reported to the PHV after delivery. Instances of perinatal death or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after cessation of study drug, will be reported to the PHV within 24 hours. 6.4.8. Evaluating and Reporting SUSARs Pharmacovigilance will promptly evaluate all SUSARs and nonserious AEs of special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to Investigators, IRBs/IECs, and applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. To determine reporting requirements for single SAE cases, PHV staff in collaboration with Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals will assess the expectedness of these events using the Reference Safety Information (Section 6.2) of the rilonacept Investigator’s Brochure. PHV will compare the severity of each SUSAR and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator’s assessment of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by needed.

Sample Size Calculations For the purpose of sample size estimation, time to pericarditis recurrence is assumed to follow an exponential distribution. An event of interest is defined as a subject’s first adjudicated recurrence of pericarditis. The following assumptions are used in the sample size calculation using EAST 6.4.1: • • • • • 1-sided significance level Power Median time to event (in weeks) in placebo Hazard ratio (rilonacept/placebo) Percentage of subjects in the RI period that will not reach RW 2.5% 90% 8 0.244 10% Given these assumptions, a total of 22 adjudicated pericarditis recurrence events is required to achieve the power. About 25 subjects per arm (a total of 50 subjects) will be randomized. Considering 10% of subjects in the RI period that will not reach the RW period, approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Patient enrollment and the pericarditis recurrence event accrual will be closely monitored during the study. The monitoring activities will be done in a blinded fashion during the RW period. If the number of patients randomized is less than 50 and/or the time anticipated for the number of events required for the analysis of primary efficacy endpoint significantly exceeds the projected timeline, additional patients may be enrolled and/or randomized at Kiniksa Pharmaceutical’s discretion. However, at this time it is anticipated that no more than 100 subjects will be enrolled into this study. 7.5. Analysis Sets The following analysis sets will be used in the statistical analyses. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set : All subjects who are randomized in the RW period will be included in the ITT analysis set. The primary analysis for efficacy endpoints in the RW period will be based on the ITT analysis set. Treatment comparisons for all ITT analyses will be based on each subject’s treatment assignment from randomization.

Data will be listed in data listings. At each of RI and RW periods and in the LTE, baseline will be the last value before the first dose of study drug within each individual period unless otherwise specified. For change -over-time endpoints in the RW period, by -visit analysis will be performed at each scheduled visit for at least 24 weeks. The analysis for treatment comparison will be triggered after at least the 22nd CEC - confirmed pericarditis recurrence events have been accrued. At that time, randomization will be closed, and subjects will return to study sites for the EORW visit. At that point study treatment will stop (com pleting the database for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis), and subjects will either continue into the LTE or complete their study participation. Missing data due to end of RW period will be considered as missing at random. Handling of missing values will be described in the SAP. 7.7.2. Stratified Analysis There will be 2 stratification variables for randomization: • • Oral CS use at RI baseline: yes or no Diagnosis of recurrent idiopathic pericarditis at RI baseline: yes or no When a stratified analysis is used in the analysis and a stratum has no event of interest or no responder, the stratum will be pooled with the other stratum in the same stratification variable. 7.7.3. Testing Hypotheses and Multiplicity Adjustment All statistical tests for the treatment comparison of efficacy endpoints in the RW period will be based on the ITT analysis set with 1 -sided α=0.025 unless otherwise specified. For each endpoint, the null hypothesis is that the effects of ril onacept and placebo are the same. The alternative hypothesis is that rilonacept is better than the placebo. In order to control the overall 1 -sided type I error rate at the 0.025 level, a gatekeeping procedure in combination with Hochberg’s procedure will be applied to testing the primary and major secondary endpoints. If the 1-sided p-value for testing the primary endpoint is ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect on the primary endpoint will be claimed. Section 7.2.1 provides the order of major secondary endpoints. If the primary endpoint is significant, the first major secondary endpoint, i.e., proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 24 of RW period will be t ested at 1 -sided α=0.025.

Additional sensitivity analyses may be defined in the SAP. 7.7.5. Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 7.7.5.1. Analysis of the Major Secondary Endpoints The analyses for the 3 major secondary endpoints will be based on the ITT Week 16 analysis set, with the Week 8 and Week 24 ITT analysis sets providing supportive sensitivity analyses. • Proportion of subjects who maintained Clinical Response at Week 16 of the RW period (defined as a weekly average of daily pericarditis pain ≤2.0 on the 11 -point NRS, CRP ≤0.5 mg/dL, and on monotherapy of randomized study drug at Week 24). The Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test will be used in this analysis, stratified by the strati fication variables for randomization. Percentage of days with no or minimal pain in the first 16 weeks post randomization. Minimal or no pain is defined as non -missing daily NRS ≤2 on the 11 -point NRS. This endpoint will be analyzed with an analysis of covariance. In addition to treatment arm, the following covariates will be included in this analysis: the stratification variables for randomization, and RI baseline NRS weekly average in 2 categories: NRS ≤2 versus NRS >2. Proportion of subjec ts with absent or minimal pericarditis symptoms (based on the 7-point PGIPS) at Week 16 of the RW period.

Full physical examination includes at minimum evaluation of vital signs, head, eye, ear, nose, and throat as well as cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, GI, genitourinary, and neurological systems. The decision to perform examination of genitourinary system should be guided by clinical judgement. Abbreviated physical examination includes at minimum evaluation of vital signs, lung and heart sounds, including evaluation for pericardial rub. ECHO is required to be obtained according to the central core lab parameters and then read locally and submitted to the centr al core lab for separate review and analysis. Both a documented CRP > 1.0 mg/dL AND a pericarditis pain level of > 4 is required 7 days prior to and including the Run -In Baseline visit. These are not required to occur on the same day. Subjects missing ≥ 4 daily pain measurements during the 7 days prior to and including the Randomization Withdrawal baseline v isit will be unable to proceed to randomization due to lack of data required for treatment response evaluation. Lipid panels are non -fasting and are to be drawn at a minimum of every 6months during the randomization withdrawal and LTE periods, or more freque ntly as needed, with mandated evaluations as detailed in the schedule of events. Applicable to 24-hour post dose PK sub-study participants only. For women of child bearing potential - urine pregnancy testing can be repeated as needed throughout the course of the study and serum pregnancy can be drawn as need ed; urine pregnancy is required to be performed at enroll ment and 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
