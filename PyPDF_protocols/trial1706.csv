Inducible T Cell Costimulatory Receptor and GSK3359609 Inducible T cell co -stimulatory receptor (ICOS) is a co -stimulatory recept or belonging to the CD28/B7immunoglobulin (Ig) super family with expression restricted to T cells [Hutloff , 1999]. ICOS differentiates from first generati on immunomodulatory antibodies directed against Cytotoxic T -Lymphocyte -Associated Protein 4 (CTLA -4) and PD -1/PD - L1 by targeting a different axis in the antitumor T cell response cascade and promoting activation. ICOS is weakly expressed on resting T cells yet is highly induced on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon T cell receptor (TCR) engagement with cognate antigen and activation. The effect of ICOS agonist activity is to promote activation of cytotoxic CD8+ and conventional CD4+ cells, augmenting the expansion, function and survival of these populations thereby resulting in an increased antitumor immune response that is durable [Fan, 2014; Paulos , 2010; Wakamatsu , 2013, Sharpe , 2002]. GSK3359609 is a humanized anti -ICOS mAb selected for its nanomolar (nM) binding to and agonist activity in ICOS -expressing CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells. GSK3359609 is specifically engineered as an IgG4 hi nge-stabilized isotype, IgG4PE, to markedly decrease binding affinity of the Fc (Fragment crystallizable) region of the mAb to activating Fcγ receptors and C1q, and thereby diminish the cytotoxic potential of GSK3359609 that would result in depletion of IC OS-positive T cells through antibody - dependent or complement -dependent cell mediated mechanisms, respectively. Moreover, the IgG4PE isotype retains functional binding to the Fc  inhibitor receptor, Fc RIIb, a feature described as critical for modulating an tibody agonist activity [ Li, 2011], which also may be essential for optimal ICOS agonist activity and its associated antitumor effects in humans. The T cell activat ing potential of GSK3359609 was evaluated in multiple in vitro assay formats as a single agent and in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors. GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrated a more robust pro - inflammatory cytokine res ponse, including increases in interferon gamma ( IFN) secretion, than either single agent alone. In vivo experiments in different mouse models either using GSK3359609/pembrolizumab or anti -mouse ICOS in combination with PD -1 surrogate antibodies demonstrated enhanced growth inhibition and increased survivability of mice compared to either agent alone. The upregulation of ICOS with the mouse anti - PD-1 antibodies and the converse whereby ICOS mouse surrogate antibodies increased tumor PD -L1 expressi on in these in -vivo experiments further support evaluating this combination. Furthermore, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas gene expression data demonstrate s that tumors with higher ICOS expression also tend to have higher PD -L1 expression , with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas observed as having the highest ICOS expression suggesting that targeting both axes may result in greater anti -tumor immune response . Refer to the GSK3359609 IB for details on the non -clinical experiments and findings [GlaxoSm ithKline Document Number 2017N319717_0 3, 2020]."

GSK3359609 Clinical Experience INDUCE -1 (Study 204691; NCT02723955) is an ongoing, first in -human, dose escalation and expansion study of GSK3359609, alone and in combination with other agents including pembrolizumab, in participants with advanced solid tumors. Analysis from the dose es calation phases of GSK3359609 monotherapy (Part 1A, n=22) and GSK3359609 combination with pembrolizumab (Part 2A, n=36), and GSK3359609 monotherapy pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic cohort (n=47) demonstrated GSK3359609 alone and in combination with pem brolizumab was well tolerated across the 0.001 –3 mg/kg dose range. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in Part 1A and Part 2A; maximum administered dose of GSK3359609 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab was 3 mg/kg . A range of G SK3359609 doses (≥0.1 -1 mg/kg) demonstrated biological and clinical activity supporting the mechanism of action of a non -depleting ICOS agonist as a clinical target [ Hansen , 2018]. A summary safety analyses from a later clinical data cut -off date of 16 March 2020 that included all participants dosed with GSK3359609 monotherapy (n= 249), which included participants do sed at GSK3359609 10 mg/kg (MAD) , or GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab (n= 340) showed that 42% (n= 104) and 58% (n= 197) of participants, respectively, experienced at least 1 treatment -related adverse events (TR-AE). In the overall Part 1 population, TR -AEs occurring in ≥5% of parti cipants were fatigue (10%, n= 26), asthenia ( 9%, n= 23), diarrhea ( 6%, n= 16), pruritis (6%, n=14) , nausea (5%, n=13) and arthralgia (5%, n=12) . Eleven participants ( 4%) experienced at least 1 Grade 3 TR-AE; none of which were Grade 5 in severity . In the overall Part 2 population (GSK3359609 combination with pembrolizumab) , TR-AEs occurring in ≥5% of participants were diarrhea ( 9%, n= 32), asthenia ( 9%, n= 32), fatigue ( 9%, n= 29), pruritus (7%, n=23), aspartate aminotransferase elevations ( 6%, n= 22), alanine aminotransferase elevations (6%, n=19) , nausea (5%, n=1 7), hypothyroidism (5%, n=16) and rash (5%, n=16) . Twenty -one participants ( 6%) experienced at least 1 Grade 3 TR- AE, 3 of whom experienced a t least 1 treatment -related Grade 5 event (<1%) . Refer to GSK3359609 IB for further details [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N319717_0 3, 2020]. 1.1.2. Pembrolizumab Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 mAb with high specificity of binding to the PD-1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD-L1 and PD -ligand 2 (PD -L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advance d malignancies. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of indications, which includes first-line treatment of metastatic or unre sectable recurrent HNSCC . Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, another PD -1 inhibitor, is also considered a second -line/subsequent -line standard of care for patients with R/M HNSCC. Refer to the pembrolizumab IB [ Merck, 2021] and approved labeling for detailed background information on MK-3475."
12,page_12,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 12 The most common reported AEs ( 20% of patients) with pembrolizumab single agent include fatigue, musculoskeletal pa in, decreased appetite, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, constipation, pain and abdominal pain [ KEYTRUDA , 2019]. Serious and fatal AEs associated with treatment include immune -mediated adverse reactions, which consisted of pneumonitis, colitis, endocrinopathies (i.e., hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and Type1 diabetes mellitus), hepatitis, nephritis, infusion reactions, and skin reaction s including Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. 1.1.2.1. Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 that has bee n shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD L1 and/or PD -L2) [Greenwald , 2005; Okazaki , 2001]. The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [ Zhang , 2004]. PD -1 and its family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig -variable –type (IgV type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for t he binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif. Following T cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP -1 and SHP -2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C -theta (PKCθ ), and zeta -chain - associate d protein kinase (ZAP70), which are involved in the CD3 T cell signaling cascade [ Okazaki , 2001; Chemnitz , 2004; Shepard , 2004; Riley , 2009]. The mechanism by which PD -1 down -modulates T cell responses is similar to, but distinct from, that of CTLA -4, because both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins [Parry , 2005; Francisco , 2010]. As a consequence, the PD 1/PD -L1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention . 1.1.2.2. Non-clinical and Clinical Studies Therapeutic studies in mouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking PD -1/PD -L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -speci fic CD8+ T cells and ultimately leads to tumor rejection, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities [ Hirano , 2005; Blank , 2004; Weber , 2010; Strome , 2003; Spranger , 2014; Curran , 2010; Pilon -Thomas , 2010]. Anti -mouse PD -1 or anti -mouse PD-L1 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor responses in models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal carcinoma [ Strome , 2003; Curran , 2010; Pilon -Thomas , 2010; Nomi , 2007; Zhang , 2004]. In such studies, tumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells and increased IFNγ, granzyme B and perforin expression were observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of PD -1 checkpoint inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effector T cell function in vivo [Curran , 2010].

GSK3359609 Monotherapy and in Combination with Pembrolizumab in HNSCC The ongoing INDUCE -1 expansion phase is investigating GSK3359609 as a monotherapy (Part 1B) and GSK3359609 in comb ination with pembrolizumab (Part 2B) in participants with HNSCC. At the clinical data cut -off date of 26 July 2019, 17 participants with anti -PD-1/L1 treatment experienced HNSCC received at least 1 dose of 1 mg/kg GSK3359609 in Part 1B cohort . In the treat ed population (n=17), the median age was 56 years (range: 41-73 years); 8 2% were male and 82% received ≥1 prior line of systemic therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting. Sixteen of the 17 dosed participants were considered evaluable for efficacy analysis; the overall response rate (ORR) in the evaluable population was 6% with 1 of the 1 6 participants achieving a partial response (PR) . In the Part 2B cohort, 34 participants with an ti-PD-1/L1 naïve HNSCC received at least one cycle of 0.3 mg/kg GSK3359609 in combination with 200 mg pembrolizumab. In the treated population (n=34), the median age was 6 2 years (range 3 7-77 years); 85% were male and 53% received ≥1 prior line of systemic therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting. All 34 dosed participants were considered evaluable for efficacy analyses. The ORR in the evaluable population (n= 34) was 2 4% (95% CI: 1 0.7%, 41.2%) with 8 of the 34 participants achieving a complete response (n =3) or PR (n=5) ; disease control rate (DCR) was 65% (n=22; 95% CI: 46.5, 80.3). In addition, the majority of participants that achieved a respon se or stable disease ha d PD-L1 CPS status <20 (10/14 p articipants with CPS1 and <20, and 1 pa rticipants with CPS <1 ). The median progression -free survival (PFS) was 5.6 months (95% CI: 2.4, 7.4) [Rischin , 2019]. 1.2. Synopsis Protocol Title: A Randomized, Double -blind, Adaptive, Phase II/III Study of GSK3359609 or Placebo in Combination with Pembrolizumab for First -Line Treatment of PD -L1 Positive Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Short Title: INDUCE -3: A Phase II/III study of GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab compared with pembrolizumab plus placebo in participants with PD-L1 positive recurrent or metastatic HNSCC Rationale: KEYNOTE -048 (KN -048; NCT02358031) is a randomized, three arm study in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC who had not received prior systemic therapy in the R/M setting. In the standard first -line treatment arm patients received chemotherapy (platinum and fluorouracil) in combination with cetuximab based on the EXTREME protocol [Vermorken , 2008]. In the two experimental arms patients either receive pembrolizumab in combination with platinum plus fluorouracil (5FU) or alone. Pembrolizumab was g iven at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W), for up to 35 cycles."
14,page_14,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 14 Pembrolizumab alone and in combination with chemotherapy compared with the EXTREME regimen as first -line treatment improved the survival of patients with R/M HNSCC. However, the degree of o verall survival (OS) improvement for pembrolizumab alone or in combination with 5FU/platinum chemotherapy depended on the programmed cell death receptor 1 -ligand 1 (PD -L1) combined positive score ( CPS) status [Burtness , 2018; Rischin , 2019], with OS improvement in the total PD -L1 population requiring pembrolizumab in combination with 5FU -platinum regimen. Although pembrolizumab alone did not reach statistical significance f or superiority in the final OS analysis in the total population (HR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.70 -0.99; p -value: 0.0199), the interim analysis declared pembrolizumab alone as delivering non -inferior OS effect in this population. More importantly, the frequency of al l treatment related toxicities (58.3% versus 96.9%) and  Grade 3 events (16.7% versus 69.0%) were much less with pembrolizumab alone as compared with the EXTREME regimen. The results from KN48 supported the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of p embrolizumab alone and in combination with 5FU platinum chemotherapy as first -line treatment of patients with R/M HNSCC in the PD-L1 CPS 1 and total populations, respectively [KEYTRUDA , 2019]. In the European Union (EU) , the European Commission approved pembrolizumab alone or in combination with 5FU platinum chemotherapy in the PD -L1-positive (CPS 1) populations [KEYTRUDA , 2019] . Despite the treatment advancements pembrolizumab has afforded patients with R/M HNSCC, there remains an unmet need due to the limited population of benefit with the aim to further improve disease control, a feature that if not addressed adversely impacts patient quality of life in the disease setting, and to improve survival across all HNSCC populations. The non -clinical data demonstrate that the activity of targeting ICOS with an agonist antibody is further enhanced with PD -1 blockade and that the mechanism s of action for each antibody are complementary with one another as evidenced by the non -clinical finding s that treatment with a mouse anti -PD-1 antibody resulted in upregulation of ICOS+ cluster of differentiation ( CD)4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumors and lymph nodes ; conversely, treatment with anti -mouse ICOS antibodies increased PD -L1 levels in the tumor . Furthermore, when combined, the two agents resulted in a greater survival effect than either agent alone in syngeneic mouse tumor models (refer to Section 1.1.1 ). The preliminary clinical data from INDUCE -1 demonstrate that the combination of GSK3359609 with pembrolizumab exhibits promising antitumor activity in participants with HNSCC (refer to Section 1.1.3 ). Combining immunomodulatory agents targeting different components of the cancer immunity cycle [ Chen , 2013] may be able to overcome the multiple mechanisms of immune suppression which prohibit an effective antitumor immune response. Thus, targeting both the ICOS and PD -1 axes may translate into enhanced clinical activity and expand the population that benefits with the combination of GSK3359609 (ICOS agonist antibody) and pembrolizumab (PD -1 blocking antibody) which is supported by the available non -clinical and clinical evidence. The clinical data from INDUCE -1 has validated the non -clinical findings whereby the 24% ORR observed with the combination of GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab was higher than that observed with GSK3359609 monotherapy as described in Section 1.1.3 , and higher than that reported for"

Refer to Section 9.4.1.2 for definitions of efficacy endpoints , Section 9.1 for key endpoints /hypotheses and Section 9.8 or multiplicity control. Overall Design: This is a randomized, double -blind , Phase II/III study comparing a combination of GSK3359609 (ICOS agonist ) and pembrolizumab to pembrolizumab plus placebo in participants with PD-L1 CPS 1 recurrent or metastatic HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx. The study will evaluate the efficacy of GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab compared with pembrolizumab plus placebo as a standard first -line chemotherapy -free regimen in HNSCC. All participants will be stratified by 2 factors i) PD-L1 CPS status (CPS ≥20 vs . 1≤ CPS <20); ii) HPV status in oropharyngeal cancers (positive vs . negative/unknown) vs non -oropharyngeal cancers then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the GSK3359609/ pembrolizumab arm or pembrolizumab /placebo arm. A 2-in-1 adaptive Phase II/III design [Chen , 2018] is considered, with the option to expand the Phase II study seamlessly into Phase III confirmatory study, without changing the eligibility criteria, endpoints or randomization scheme. ORR per RECIST v1.1 will be used for the adapt ive decision. This analysis will be conducted in the approximately first 100 participants (PD -L1 CPS 1 population) with a minimum follow -up of 6 months. If at this interim analysis, the outcome meets the defined ORR positive criterion, t he study will expand from a Phase II to a Phase III design with 600 participants randomized. If the outcome does not meet the defined criteria, then the study will remain as Phase II with 374 participants randomized. All participants randomized are include d for inference at the end of Phase II or Phase III regardless of the interim adaptive decision. In addition, all primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints are formally tested for statistical significance at the end of Phase II or Phase III. Disclosure Statement : This is a parallel group treatment study with 2 arms that is double -blinded. Crossover between study treatment arms is not permitted. Number of Participants: Overall, the Phase II study will randomize approximately 374 participants with a 1:1 r atio between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab (Arm 1) and pembrolizumab and placebo (Arm 2). Based on the prevalence of PD -L1 CPS status reported in KN -048 [Burtness , 2018], in a target sample size of 374 participants with PD-L1 CPS 1 (PD -L1 positive expression) , the study will enroll approximately 198 participants with PD -L1 CPS 20 (PD -L1 high expression ). Should the decision be made to expand the Phase II study into Phase III study an additional 2 26 participants will be randomly assigned to treatment in a 1:1 ratio between"
18,page_18,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 18 the GSK3359609/pembrolizumab combination treatment arm and the pembrolizumab /place bo treatment arm. The participants randomized prior to the adaptive decision which consists of those participants included in the analysis for the adaptive decision will be included in Phase III analyses. The Phase III study will have an overall sample size of 600 participants in the PD-L1 CPS 1 population and 318 participants in the PD -L1 CPS 20 population . The overall proportion of participants by PD -L1 CPS status will be capped such that the maximum proportion of participants in PD-L1 CPS 20 or 1 CPS <20 will not exceed the planned proportion by 5% for either subgroup. Intervention Groups and Duration: The study is comprised of three periods: screening, treatment, and follow -up. The total duration of study participation begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). After a screening period of up to 28 days, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment arms. For participants who meet all eligibility criteria and are randomized within the s tudy, the maximum duration of treatment with pembrolizumab, GSK3359609 and placebo is expected to be approximately 2 years, up to 35 cycles. A decision to permanently discontinue treatment due to disease progression may be based upon immune -based RECIST [i RECIST]) as disease progression per RECIST v1.1 is further evaluated for confirmation by imaging/clinical assessments 4 weeks later and is critical to the analysis of immune -based PFS (iPFS) [ Seymour , 2017]. The follow -up period begins when study treatment is permanently discontinued; participants will undergo follow -up assessments for safety , PFS on first subsequent anti - cancer therapy (PFS2) and survival as indicated in the Schedule of Activities (SoA); refer to Section 1.4. The total duration of study participation begins with the sign ing of the ICF through the final protocol -defined follow -up assessment for survival. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive the combination of GSK3359609 24 mg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo plus pembrolizumab 200 mg. GSK3359609, pl acebo, and 200 pembrolizumab are administered each as a 30-minute IV infusion once Q3W. GSK3359609 or placebo will be administered first followed by pembrolizumab. Independent Data Monitoring Committee: The study will use an Independent Data Monitoring Co mmittee (IDMC). The IDMC membership and governance will be outlined in a separate charter. The IDMC will make recommendations for discontinuation or modification of the study based on ongoing reviews of safety data according to the Charter. In addition, th e IDMC will also evaluate all interim efficacy data, including the adapt ive decision as well as interim analyses of PFS and OS, and make a recommendation based on observed results of the study."

INTRODUCTION Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, accounting for more than 550,000 new cases and 380,000 deaths per year [ Vos, 201 7; Naghavi , 2017]. HNSCC is a heterogeneous disease, encompassing a variety of tumors that originate from different anatomic subsites in the head and neck region, and include carcinomas of the oral cavity, or opharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, and nasal cavity/sinuses. The etiology of HNSCC is well -established as being multifactorial with risk factors that include tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption; human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is also an important factor in the pathophysiology and prognosis of HNSCC which includes playing an immunosuppressive role, mainly in the oropharyngeal region [Gillison , 2015; Ang, 2010; Fung , 2017]. Most patients are diagnosed with locally advanced disease and are usually treated with multimodal therapy including surgery, radiotherapy/ chemotherapy and systemic therapy. Despite advanc es in surgical and radiation techniques, as well as the addition of chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor -targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the treatment of locally advanced HNSCC, more than half of patients eventually experience relaps e or distant metastases. Most of these patients are no longer suitable for curative treatment approaches. For locally recurrent disease, local treatment options such as surgery and radiotherapy play an important role in this setting. For recurrent disease no longer amenable to local therapy or metastatic HNSCC, platinum - based chemotherapy  cetuximab was the standard treatment option in the United States (US) before the US FDA approval of pemb rolizumab in this setting . Even with current multi -agent chemothe rapy that now includes pembrolizumab , the expected median survival for a patient in the incurable or metastatic relapse setting remains under 15 month s [KEYTRUDA , 2019 ]. 2.1. Study Rationale KEYNOTE -048 (KN -048; NCT02358031) was a randomized, three arm study in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC who had not received prior systemic therapy in the R/M setting. In the standard first -line treatment arm patients received chemotherapy (platinum and fluorouracil) in combination with cetuximab based on the EXTREME protocol [ Vermorken , 2008]. In the 2 experimental arms patients either receive pembrolizumab in combination with platinum plus fluorouracil (5FU) or pembrolizumab alone. Pembrolizumab was given at a dose of 200 mg e very 3 weeks (Q3W), for up to 35 cycles. Pembrolizumab alone and in combination with chemotherapy compared with the EXTREME regimen as first -line treatment improved the survival of patients with R/M HNSCC . However, the degree of overall survival (OS) impro vement for pembrolizumab alone or in combination with 5FU/platinum chemotherapy depended on the programmed cell death receptor 1 -ligand 1 (PD -L1) combined positive score (CPS) status .[Burtness , 2018; Rischin , 2019] , with OS improvement in the total PD -L1 population requiring pembroliz umab in combination with 5FU -platinum regimen . Although pembrolizumab"
32,page_32,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 32 alone compared to the EXTREME regimen did not reach statistical significance for superiority at the final OS analysis in the total population (HR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.70 -0.99; p-value: 0.019 9), the analysis declared pembrolizumab alone as delivering a non-inferior OS effect in this population. More importantly, the frequency of all treatment related toxicities (58.3% versus 96.9%) and  Grade 3 events (16.7% versus 69.0%) were much less with pembrolizumab alone as compared with the EXTREME regimen . The KN -048 results supported the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of pembrolizumab alone and in combination with 5FU platinum chemotherapy as first -line treatment of patients with R/M HNSCC in the PD-L1 CPS 1 and total populations, respectively [KEYTRUDA , 2019] . In the EU, the European Commission approved pembrolizumab alone or with 5FU platinum chemotherapy in the PD -L1-positive (CPS 1) population [KEYTRUDA , 2019]. In addition pembrolizumab alone and in combination with 5FU -platinum chemotherapy were incorporated into the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the Society for Immun otherapy of Cancer guidelines as an option for the first -line treatment in patient s with non -nasopharyngeal HNSCC ; the choice of which pembrolizumab -based regimen may consider PD-L1 expression status as well as other patient and disease characteristics [National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) , 2021; Cohen , 2019 ]. However , there was a lack of improvement in PFS with pembrolizumab alone and in combination with chemotherapy compared with the EXTREME regimen in the overall population and in the PD-L1 CPS populations analyzed. Moreover, t he ORR reported for pembrolizumab alone was 23.3 % in PD -L1 CPS 20 population , 19.1% in PD -L1 CPS 1 population and 16.9% in the total population ; which was lower than the ORR observed with the EXTREME regimen [ Burtness , 2018 ; Rischin , 2019 ]. Despite the treatment advancements pembrolizumab has afforded patient s with R/M HNSCC, there remains an unmet need due to the limited population of benefit with the aim to further improve disease control , a feature that if not addressed , adversely impacts patient quality of life in this disease setting , and to improve survival across all HNSCC populations . The non -clinical data demonstrate that the activity of targeting ICOS with an agonist antibody is further enhanced with PD -1 blockade . Further rationale for targeting the ICOS and PD -1 axes is supported by th e non -clinical finding that treatment with a mouse anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in upregulation of ICOS+ cluster of differentiation ( CD)4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumors and lymph nodes ; conversely, treatment with anti -mouse ICOS antibodies increased PD -L1 leve ls in the tumor. Furthermore, when combined, the 2 agents resulted in a greater survival effect than either agent alone in syngeneic mouse tumor models (refer to Section 1.1.1 ). The preliminary clinical data from INDUCE -1 demonstrate that the combination of GSK3359609 with pembrolizumab exhibits promising antitumor activity in participants with HNSCC (refer to Section 1.1.3 ). Combining immunomodulatory agents targeting different components of the cancer immunity cycle [ Chen , 2013] may be able to overcome the multiple mechanisms of immune suppression which prohibit an effective antitumor immune response and contribute to the progression of HNSCC [Ferris , 2015 ]. Thus, targeting both the ICOS and PD -1 axes may translate into enhanced clinical activity and expand the population that benefits with the combination of GSK3359609 (ICOS agonist antibod y) and"
33,page_33,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 33 pembrolizumab (PD -1 blocking antibody) which is supported by the available non - clinical and clinical evidence. The clinical data from INDUCE -1 has validated the non - clinical findings whereby the 28% ORR observed with the combination of GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab was higher than GSK3359609 monotherapy as described in Section 1.1.3 , and higher than that reported for pembrolizumab alone as first -line therapy [Burtness , 2018 ; Rischin , 2019 ] or subsequen t-line therapy [ Cohen , 2019] in R/M HNSCC. The purpose of Study 209229 is to evaluate if the addition of GSK3359609 to pembrolizumab as first-line treatment improves the efficacy of pembrolizumab in participants with R/M HNSCC. 2.2. Benefit/Risk Assessment Summaries of findings from both clinical and non -clinical studies conducted with GSK3359609 [GSK3359609 IB, GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N319717_0 3, 2020] and pembrolizumab [ Merck, 2021] can be found in the respective IBs . The following sub sections outline the risk assessment and mitigation strategy for GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab in this protocol. 2.2.1. Risk Assessment Of 260 participants treated with the combination of GSK3359609 (at various doses) and pembrolizumab in various tumor type s across the dose escalation and expansion phases of the INDUCE -1 study , 94% experienced at least 1 adverse event regardless of causality; with 41% experienc ing at least 1 Grade 3 event and 41% experiencing at least 1 serious event. The events reported wi th the highest frequency ( 10%) regardless of causality were anemia , fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, asthenia, pyrexia, deceased appetite, dyspnea, constipation , cough and vomiting ; these most common all -cause AEs are consistent with the those reported for pembrolizumab alone [ KEYTRUDA , 2019] . Regarding immune related events (irAEs) most have been low grade and were treated successfully; few high grade irAEs were considered significant or required hospitalization (i.e., hyperglycemia and pneumonitis). Refer to the GSK3359609 IB for further details [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N319717_0 3, 2020]. Table 2 outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol."

Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion This is a randomized, double -blinded , adaptive design, Phase II/III study of pembrolizumab (a standard of care) plus placebo or in combination with GSK3359609 for first line treatment of R/M HNSCC. Regarding benefit, the focus should be on the following key points: first, the K N-048 results support pembrolizumab as a backbone agent as a standard of care for the first -line treat ment of R/M HNSCC in which OS for pembrolizumab alone was superior to the EXTREME regimen in the PD -L1 CPS 1 population (refer to Section 2.1); second, GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab was shown to have a positive ORR and median PFS in a small cohort (n=2 9) of participants with PD -1/L1 treatment naïve HNSCC (refer to Sect ion 1.1.3 ). The risks seen in participants exposed to GSK3359609 (at various doses) in combination with pembrolizumab are summarized in Table 2 and are consistent with those observed with pembrolizumab alone . Of 2 60 participants treated with the combination of GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab in the INDUCE -1 study, most had at least 1 adverse event, the majority of which were low grade in severity . The evidence to date for the combination of GSK3359609 with pembrolizuma b favor an acceptable safety profile and an expected clinical benefit in participants with HNSCC within the context of the anti -tumor effect s observed in the small cohort of participants with HNSCC enrolled in INDUCE -1. Additionally, the safety profile of pembrolizumab alone is more favorable than the EXTREME regimen as the frequency of Grade 3 events and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were markedly lower in comparison with the EXTREME regimen. Therefore, within the context of the significant survival effect and the favorable safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the first-line R/M HNSCC PD -L1 CPS 1 population, pembrolizumab plus placebo as the control arm is supported. Moreover , initiating a Phase II/III adaptive design study to investi gate pembrolizumab in combination with GSK3359609 provides participants with first-line R/M HNSCC a potentially favorable risk/ benefit profile . 3.

Overall Design This is a randomized, double -blind, adaptive Phase II/III study comparing a combination of GSK3359609 (ICOS agonist) and pembrolizumab to pembrolizumab plus placebo in participants with PD-L1 CPS 1 recurrent or metastatic HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx. The study will evaluate the efficacy of GSK3359609 (ICOS agonist ) in combination with pembrolizumab compared with pembrolizumab as a first-line chemotherapy -free regimen in HNSCC. All participants will be stratified by the following factors i) PD-L1 CPS status (CPS ≥20 vs . 1≤ CPS <20); ii) HPV status (oropharyngeal cancers [positive vs . negative/unknown] vs . non-oropharyngeal cancers) then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the GSK3359609/pembrolizumab arm or pembrolizumab/placebo arm. A 2-in-1 adaptive Phase II/III design [Chen , 2018 ] is considered, with the option to expand the Phase II study seamlessly into Phase III confirmatory study, without changing the eligibility criteria, endpoints or randomization scheme. The st udy schematic is provided in Section 1.3. The study does not permit crossover between study treatment arms as one of the primary endpoints is overall su rvival and the study is double blinded. The adapt ive decision will be guided by the analysis of ORR/DCR per RECIST v1.1 in the approximate first 100 participants (PD -L1 CPS ≥1 population) with a minimum follow -up of 6 months. If at this interim analysis, the outcome meets the defined ORR positive criterion (refer to Section 9.5), the study will expand from a Phase II to a Phase III design with 600 participants randomized. If the outcome does not meet the defined criteria, then the study will remain as Phase II with 374 participants randomized. The overall proportion of participants by PD -L1 CPS status will be capped such that the maximum proportion of participants in PD -L1 CPS20 or 1CPS <20 will not exce ed the"
39,page_39,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 39 planned proportion by 5% for either subgroup ; refer to Section 9.2 for expected prevalence and planned sample size estimate s. All participan ts randomized are included for inference at the end of Phase II or Phase III regardless of the interim adaptive decision. In addition, all primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints are formally tested for statistical significance at the end of Phase II or Phase III. The detailed interim analysis plan including making the adapt ive decision is pre -specified in Section 9.5. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design A 2-in-1 adaptive Phase II/III design [ Chen , 2018] is cons idered as an efficient approach to either expand a Phase II study seamlessly into a Phase III study with pre -specified adaptive decision rules, by randomizing additional participants without changing the inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrollment, end points and randomization scheme. This approach supports the Phase III design by properly balancing the risk and benefit of the expansion decision. If the decision is not to expand, the study remains as a Phase II design and the primary analysis is conducte d at the end of Phase II. The selection of ORR as the endpoint for the adaptive decision is supported by a meta - analysis of data from published HNSCC studies. Randomization will be stratified by the following factors associated as prognostic, and selective of clinical benefit from pembrolizumab: 1. PD-L1 CPS (degree of benefit from pembrolizumab alone depended on PD -L1 status [ Burtness , 2018]) 2. HPV status (established as a prognostic factor in the oropharynx region and oropharyngeal cancers are staged according by HPV status [Fung , 2017 ; AJCC , 2017 ]) The selection of pembrolizumab monotherapy as the control arm is supported by the data from KN -048; the evidence of which supported the FDA approval of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the fir st-line disease setting for patients with PD -L1 CPS 1 R/M HNSCC [Burtness , 2018; Rischin , 2019] . The primary endpoints are appropriate for this population as overall survival is the gold standard measure of clinical benefit and PFS by RECIST v1.1 as a direct measure of disease contr ol in a randomized Phase III study setting. The double -blinded design will mitigate the intentional or inadvertent bias inherent to an open -label study."
40,page_40,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 40 4.3. Justification for Dose 4.3.1. GSK3359609 Dose Justification The dose of GSK3359609 planned for registration st udies in HNSCC is 24 -mg administered Q3W. The 24 mg dose of GSK3359609 was selected based upon the cumulative clinical evidence to date from the first -time in human (FTIH) Study 204691/INDUCE -1 that included preliminary efficacy data from the GSK3359609/pe mbrolizumab combination HNSCC expansion cohort, pooled preliminary population PK and exposure -response assessments, as well as peripheral target engagement and preliminary tumor biomarker assessments. Overall, GSK3359609 clinical data demonstrate a lack of dose-dependent differences in efficacy or safety outcomes. A flat GSK3359609 exposure -response relationship for efficacy and safety was found in participants across the range of dose levels evaluated (0.001mg/kg to 3 mg/kg). Exposures for 24 -mg Q3W are ex pected to lie within this dose level range and will be close to those obtained with 0.3 mg/kg Q3W, the dose level where in the HNSCC cohort durable objective responses were observed in combination with 200 -mg pembrolizumab. The PK disposition of GSK3359609 was evaluated after 30 minutes of IV infusion at the aforementioned dose level range in Study 204691. A preliminary population PK model (n = 251; October 2018), which characterized the influence of body weight, age, and other participant covariates on exp osure, has been developed. Results indicate the PK disposition of GSK3359609 is consistent with that of other humanized mAbs, which typically have a low clearance (CL) and a limited central volume of distribution (Vc). Plasma concentration -time profiles of GSK3359609 exhibit a bi -exponential decline with dose-proportional increases in exposure, e.g. Cmax and Cmin. The preliminary comparisons of the FTIH data from Part 1 (monotherapy) versus Part 2 (pembrolizumab combination) demonstrate no differences in GS K3359609 exposure with concomitant administration of pembrolizumab; no drug -drug interaction affecting PK for the combination of GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab would be anticipated given that both are mAb catabolized via high capacity, non -specific pathways. The preliminary FTIH population PK analysis dataset encompassed a wide distribution of bodyweight, with a median of 73 kg and a range of 40.8 –133 kg. Estimates (90% confidence intervals [CI]) of the relationship between clearance and body weight based on the population PK model revealed an allometric exponent (α) of 0.056 (95% CI, - 0.364 – 0.475) for the CL and 0.314 (95% CI, -0.009 – 0.637) for Vc. In theory, body - weight –based dosing would be considered most appropriate where CL scales linearly with patien t bodyweight (α equals to 1), whereas fixed dosing would be more appropriate when CL is unaffected by body weight (α = 0). Given that α estimates were closer to 0 for both CL and Vc, no advantage of weight -based dosing over fixed dosing is expected for GSK 3359609. Distributions of GSK3359609 exposures from potential fixed doses administered Q3W were simulated with the preliminary FTIH population PK model and compared with the distributions expected from weight -based dosing regimens, using bodyweight distrib utions resampled from the Centers for Disease Control National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database. These simulations reveal that a GSK3359609 bodyweight -based dose results in slightly higher exposure in heavier"
41,page_41,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 41 weight participants, with a GSK 3359609 fixed dose expected to provide more consistent control of PK variability across the entire bodyweight spectrum. As previously indicated, no MTD was established and no dose limiting toxicities were observed in the dose escalation cohorts over the ra nge of GSK3359609 dose levels (0.001 mg/kg [~0.08 mg] to 3 mg/kg [~240 mg]) evaluated in Study 204691. An exposure -response, time -to-event analysis of all reported Grade 2 AEs supports the conclusion of similar safety outcomes across the exposure/dose range evaluated, both in pooled monotherapy cohorts and pembrolizumab combination cohorts. Evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction were observed in the HNSCC expansion cohort at the 0.3 mg/kg dose level. Doses of 0.3 mg/kg (~24 -mg) showed high ICOS receptor occupancy (RO) levels on CD4 and CD8 T cells over the 21 -day dosing cycle. Concentration -ICOS RO analyses suggest bodyweight -based doses of approximately >0.1 mg/kg maintained approximately >~70% CD4/CD8 RO over the entire dosing interval. Preliminary exposure -response assessments of tumor size reduction at Week 9 (stratified by tumor type) demonstrate little difference in efficacy outcomes across the exposure/ dose range evaluated. Hence, the integrated body of evidence supports a 24 -mg Q3W dose for evaluation in the pivotal studies of HNSCC in combination with pembrolizumab. The distribution of exposures from the 24 -mg fixed dose are predicted to considerably overlap those obtained with the 0.3 mg/kg dose, and importantly, will maintain individual patient exposures within the exposure range established in the FTIH study. 4.3.2. Pembrolizumab Dose Justification The planned dose of pembroli zumab for this study is 200 mg Q3W. This pembrolizumab dose and schedule is consistent with that administered in the KN -048 study and which is administered in combination with GSK3359609 in the ongoing INDUCE -1 study. Based on the totality of data generate d in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications, regardless of tumor type. As outlined below, this dose is justified by: • Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demonstrating flat dose- and exposure -efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), • Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including overall survival at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, and • Pharmacology data showing f ull target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred from PK data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically -based PK [PBPK] analysis) at 200 mg Q3W. Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with mel anoma and non -small cell lung cancer, covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously treated, PD -L1 enriched, and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/ kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001"
42,page_42,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 42 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of these studies demonstrated flat dose - and exposure -response relationships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5 - to 7.5 -fold difference in exposure. The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed -dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. Subsequently, flat dose -exposure -response relationship s were also observed in other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose independent of the tumor type. These findings are consistent with the m echanism of action of pembrolizumab, which acts by interaction with immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells. Additionally, pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK data in KN001 evaluating target -mediated d rug disposition conclusively demonstrated saturation of PD -1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W. Second, a PBPK analysis was conducted to predict tumor PD -1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetration and PD -1 expression. Thi s evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor. Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed - dosing provides similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by these PK characteristics and giv en that fixed -dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols. 4.4.

Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding Randomization will occur centrally using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) ; refer to the SRM for detail on randomiz ation process. Participants will be randomly assigned to a study treatment arm in a 1:1 ratio to either receive the combination of GSK3359609 24 mg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo plus pembrolizumab 200 mg. Randomization will be stratified according t o the following factors: 1. PD-L1 CPS status (CPS ≥20 vs. 1≤ CPS <20) 2. HPV status (oropharyngeal cancers [positive vs. negative/unknown ] vs. non - oropharyngeal cancers ). The overall proportion of participants by PD-L1 C PS status will be capped by the IRT such that the maximum proportion of participants in PD -L1 CPS 20 or 1 CPS <20 will not exceed the planned proportion by 5% for either subgroup. This is a double -blind study. The participant, the investigator and site staff involved in the treatment administra tion or clinical management of the participants will remain"
52,page_52,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 52 blinded to each participant’s assigned study treatment throughout the course of the study. Site unblinded staff will provide the investigative blinded staff with prepared blinded GSK3359609 or placebo infusion solutions, packaged identically in order to maintain the blinding, for administration at scheduled infusion visits. Refer to the SRM for information on labelling and dispensing procedures to mitigate unblinding. In the event a participant’ s study treatment assignment is unblinded to the blinded site staff and/or the participant, the participant is permitted to continue/remain in the study; the site must notify the GSK’s clinical research associate ( CRA ) within 24 hours. GSK personnel or del egates, except GSK staff involved in the review/monitoring of site pharmacy records and GSK clinical supplies group, will remain blinded to each participant’s assigned study treatment throughout the course of the study. GSK’s Global Clinical Safety and Pha rmacovigilance staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant w ith an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s interventi on assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy. In the event of a medical emergency, Investigators may unblind a participant’s treatment assignment immediately through the IRT system by accessing a partic ipant’s home screen using the Subjects tab and clicking the Unblind button. Further details may be found in the SRM and the IRT manual. 6.4. Study Intervention Compliance • All study agents will be intravenously administered to participants at the site. Administration will be documented in the source documents and reported in the eCRF. Refer to the SRM for further details. 6.5.

54,page_54,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 54 Please note: In instances where the investigator is directed to permanently discontinue study treatment, the instructions are mandatory as described in Section 7.1. All AEs are to be graded according to NCI -CTCAE (version 5.0) [NCI, 2017 ]. All dose modifications and the reason(s) for the dose modification must b e documented in the eCRF. Refer to pembrolizumab prescribing information [KEYTRUDA , 201 9] for additional information regarding the background and the management of other AEs or potential safety -related issues. The investigator may consult the GSK Medical Monitor on study treatment modifications (i.e., holds or discontinuation) or on the management of AEs. 6.6.1. General Guidelines for Immune -Related Adverse Events AEs as sociated with immunotherapy treatment may be immune -mediated . These immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment, or during the treatment course, and may affect more than one body syst em simultaneously . Therefore, early recognition of and initiation of treatment for these events is critical to reduce potential complications. Based on existing data from the study 204691, most treatment -related AEs were Grade 1 or 2, managed with supporti ve care and if appropriate the administration of corticosteroids . For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm the etiology or exclude other causes . Additional procedures or tests such as, but not limited to, bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation . Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue treatment and administer corticosteroids . Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with immunotherapies a re provided in Table 5. Before administration of study treatment, investigators are to review a participant’s AEs, concomitant medications, and clinical evaluation results, e.g., vital signs, laboratory results, EC OG PS, physical examination findings, responses, etc. as outlined in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1) to monitor for new or worsening irAEs and ensure continues dosing is appropriate. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) AESI are defined as events of potential immunologic etiology, including irAEs. Such events recently reported after treatment with other immune modulatory therapy include colitis, u veitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, diarrhea, endocrine disorders, and specific cutaneous toxicities, as well as other events that may be immune mediated. Table 5 Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune - Related AEs General instructions : • Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon irAE improving to Grade 1 and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks. • For situations where immunotherapy treatment has been withheld, treatment can be resumed after irAE has been red uced to Grade 1 and corticosteroid has been"

Dose Modification and Toxicity Management of Infusion - Reactions Related to Immunotherapy Treatment Infusion reactions are a well -documented AE associated with the administration of mAb. Infusion reactions typically develop within 30 minutes to 2 hours after initiation of drug infusion, although symptoms may be delayed for up to 48 hours. The incidence of infusion reactions v aries by mAb agent, and there are multiple mechanisms known to lead to infusion -related reactions including both IgE -dependent anaphylactic and non -IgE dependent anaphylactoid hypersensitivities. Cytokine release syndrome, and when severe, cytokine “storm” , has been identified as a sequela of the immune system activation associated with infusion reactions. Infusion reactions may affect any organ system in the body; most are mild in severity, although severe and even fatal reactions occur. As a group, infusi on reactions (including both cytokine -mediated and allergic) usually occur during or within a few hours of drug infusion. Occasionally, a reaction may occur 1 to 2 days after administration . The NCI-CTCAE (version 5.0) for grading adverse reactions during chemotherapy administration has a scale for grading the severity of infusion reactions and separate grading scales for allergic reactions and anaphylaxis . While use of these separate grading scales may be useful for classifying the nature of an infusion re action for research purposes, they are less useful for clinical care, since it may not be obvious if the participant is having an allergic infusion reaction or a non -allergic infusion reaction. Clinically, an infusion reaction may present with flushing, i tching, urticaria, and/or angioedema, repetitive cough, sudden nasal congestion, shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheeze, sensation of throat closure or choking, and/or change in voice quality, faintness, tachycardia (or less often bradycardia), hypot ension, hypertension and/or loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and/or diarrhea, sense of impending doom, tunnel vision, dizziness, and/or seizure, severe back, chest, and pelvic pain. Refer to Table 7 for dose modification and treatment guidance for immunotherapy infusion reactions. To better understand the underlying etiology of these events, serum tryptase, C -reactive protein (C RP), ferritin, and a cytokine panel should be drawn during the occurrence of an infusion reaction/CRS of any grade as outlined in Table 6. The serum tr yptase, CRP and ferritin panels should be performed at the investigator’s designated local laboratory . The serum cytokine panel will be performed at a GSK designated laboratory . These data will aid in the classifying (albeit retrospectively) the etiology of the AE ."

Discontinuation of Study Intervention Participants will receive study treatment for the duration indicated in Section 6.1 as applicable, unless one of the following events occurs earlier: • Disease progression • Death • Unacceptable toxicity (refer to Section 6.6 and subsections ) • Pregnancy (refer to Section 8.3.5 for det ails) In addition, study treatment may be permanently discontinued for any of the following reasons: • Deviation(s) from the protocol or non -compliance with study requirements • Request of the participant or proxy (withdrawal of consent by participant or proxy) • Discretion of the investigator • Participant is lost to follow -up • Closure or termination of the study Participants who have disease progression by RECIST v1.1 may continue study treatment up to the protocol specified 35 cycles at the discretion of the Investigator to confirm progression as per iRECIST guidelines. Nevertheless, the consideration to continue study treatment should be balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the participant is clinically stable. Continuation on study treatment is contingent upon the following conditions: • Absence of clinical signs or symptoms indicating clinically significant disease progression • ECOG PS has not worsened, or worsen ing by no more than 1 point from baseline • Absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (e.g., CNS metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor compression, or spinal cord compression) requiring urgent alternat ive medical intervention. • No significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities related to study treatment. All participants who permanently discontinue study treatment for any reason (except consent withdrawn) will have safety assessments at the time o f discontinuation and during follow -up as specified in the SoA."
62,page_62,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 62 The primary reason study treatment was permanently discontinued must be documented in the participant’s medical records and eCRF. If the participant voluntarily discontinues from treatment due to toxicity, ‘adverse event (AE)’ will be recorded as the primary reason for permanent discontinuation on the eCRF. Once a participant has permanently discontinued from study treatment, the participant will not be allowed to be retreated. Refer to the SoA for assessments to be performed at the time study treatment is permanently discontinued and for evaluations that need to be completed. All participants who permanently discontinue study treatment without disease progression will be followed for progressio n according to the protocol -defined on - treatment disease assessment schedule in the SoA until one or more of the following occur: • a new anticancer therapy is initiated • disease progression • death All participants who permanently discontinue study treatment for any reason , except withdrawal of consen t (refer to Section 7.2), will be followed for survival every 12 weeks until death or until last patient discontinues treatment and has had their last follow up for safety . The every 12 -week schedule (refer to Table 1 SoA for details of frequency of all assessments during follow -up period) should begin once study treatment has been permanently discontinued. If particip ants are unable or unwilling to attend clinic visits during follow -up, contact to assess survival , may be made via another form of communication (e.g., telephone, email, etc.). 7.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping, and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology. Discontinuation of study intervention for abnormal liver tests is required when: • a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in Appendix 8 and Section 6.6.1 or • when in the presence of ab normal liver chemistries not meeting protocol -specified stopping rules, the investigator believes study intervention discontinuation is in the best interest of the participant. 7.1.1.1. Study Intervention Restart or Rechallenge after liver stopping criteria met If participant meets liver chemistry stopping criteria do not restart/rechallenge participant with study intervention unless:"

If GSK Medical Governance approval to restart/rechallenge participant with study intervention is not granted , then participant must permanently discontinue study intervention and may continue in the study for protocol -specified follow up assessments. 7.2. Participant Discontinuation /Withdrawal from the Study • A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. • At the time of withdrawing from the study, if possible, an early treatment discontinuation visit should be conducted. Refer to SoA ( Table 1) for the assessments at the time of study discontinuation. • The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time. • If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. • A participant will be considered to have withdrawn from the study if the participant ha s not died and is lost to follow -up. 7.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: • The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit sch edule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. • Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record."

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES • Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. • Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed • Immediate safety concerns should be discuss ed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention . • Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. • All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log or equivalent to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. • Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management ( e.g., blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. • The maximum volume of blood collecte d from each participant from Screening through Week 21 of the study treatment phase is estimated not to exceed 180 mL • Note: Repeat or unscheduled blood samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples ; these estimates are no t included in the calculated maximum Screening All screening assessments must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization unless otherwise specified. The ICF may be signed within 45 days prior to randomization; archival tumor tissu e collection or tumor tissue biopsy procedure can be performed as of 45 days prior to randomization after participant ICF ob tained . The term ‘baseline’ refers to the assessment performed during the screening period prior to first dose of study treatment that serves as a comparison or control. For example, the baseline laboratory assessment is the laboratory assessment performed prior to first dose. Refer to SoA ( Table 1) for additional details on assessments required at Screening and prior to start of study treatment. The following assessments are required during screening: • Demographic parameters such as year of birth and sex will be captured • Medical history including ca rdiovascular medical history, tobacco use, and other risk factors will be assessed as related to the inclusion/exclusion criteria"

Follow -up assessments Participants who permanently discontinue study treatment for any reason, except withdrawal of consent (refer to Section 7.2), will be followed for surv ival every 12 weeks (14 days) until death . 8.1. Efficacy Assessments RECIST version 1.1 guidelines will be used to determine the overall tumor burden at screening, select target and non -target lesions, and in the disease assessments through the duration of the study [ Eisenhauer , 2009]. The primary measure of response -based efficacy endpoints is according to RECIST v1.1 definitions as assessed by the Investigator. S cans will be collected centrally ; refer to Section 9.7 for details on response assessment by BICR. Additio nally, iRECIST guidelines may used in the assessment of response/progression to account for the unique tumor kinetics observed with immunotherapeutic agents which may manifest as an increase in tumor burden then later is followed by regression suggesting t he apparent observed neoplastic growth representing transient lymphocyte infiltration. Thus, participants with disease progression by RECIST version 1.1 guidelines may have a confirmatory disease assessment no sooner than 4 weeks after the date disease pro gression was declared in order to confirm disease progression by iRECIST guidelines. Confirmatory scans may be done as per clinical standard of care and at the discretion of the Investigator up to the protocol specified 35 cycles. The visit level response s and treatment -based decisions will incorporate iRECIST guidelines [Seymour , 2017]. Refer to the SoA ( Table 1) for the frequency of disease assessments post Screening. Imaging of the head/neck, chest and abdomen is required at each disease assessment visit and at confirmation of disease progression ; the same modality used at Screening must remain consistent throughout the study duration. Other imaging modalities and regions assessed at Screening and required to measure/evaluate the target and nontarget lesions are required at each visit and for confirma tion of disease progression. A random BICR audit will be performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis. Participant BICR randomization designation will not be known to the investigators; refer to Section 9.7 for details."

Refer to the imaging manual for details on imaging/clinical assessment requirements and submission guidelines . 8.1.1. Disease Assessments • RECIST version 1.1 guidelines will be used to determine the overall tumor burd en at screening, select target and non -target lesions, and in the disease assessments through the duration of the study [ Eisenhauer , 2009]. • As indic ated in RECIST version 1.1 guidelines: • Lymph nodes that have a short axis of <10 mm are considered non -pathological and must not be recorded or followed. • Pathological lymph nodes with <15 mm but 10 mm short axis are considered non-measurable. • Pathological lymph nodes with 15 mm short axis are considered measurable and can be selected as target lesions; however, lymph nodes should not be selected as target lesions when other suitable target lesions are available. • Measurable lesions up to a maximum of two l esions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions, and recorded and measured at baseline. These lesions should be selected based on their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and thei r suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). Note: Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases must not be selected as target lesions when other suitable target lesions are available. Note : Measur able lesions that have been previously irradiated and have not been shown to be progressing following irradiation must not be considered as target lesions. • Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that ca n be evaluated by CT or MRI can be considered measurable. Bone scans, FDG -PET scans or X -rays are not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. • All other lesions (or sites of disease) must be identified as non -target and must also be recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions will be grouped by organ. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each must be noted throughout follow -up. • Disease assessment modalities may include imaging (e.g., CT scan, MRI , bone scan) and physical examination (as indicated for palpable/superficial lesions). • At each post -baseline assessment, evaluation of the sites of disease (all target and non-target lesions) identified by the baseline scans is required. CT scans with contrast of the chest, and abdomen, or if contra -indicated, MRI, is required at each post-baseline assessment. To ensure comparability between the baseline and"
68,page_68,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 68 subsequent assessments, the same method of assessment and the same technique will be used when asses sing response. • Refer to the SoA for the frequency of disease assessment. Assessments must be performed on a calendar schedule and should not be affected by dose interruptions/delays. • Participants whose disease responds (either CR or PR) may have a confirmatory disease assessment performed at least 4 weeks after the date of assessment during which the response was demonstrated. More frequent disease assessments may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. 8.2. Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 8.2.1. Physical Examinations • A complete physical examination performed at Screening will include, at a minimum, assessment of the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. • A brief physical examination performed at each subsequent visit will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen). • Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 8.2.2. Performance Status Performance status will be assessed us ing the ECOG scale at each visit; refer to Appendix 5. 8.2.3. Vital Signs • Vital signs will be measured after 5 minutes of rest and will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (measured by pulse oximetry). Blood pressure should be taken in the same position throughout the study and captured in the eCRF. • Vital signs will be measured more frequently if warranted by clinical condition of the participant. • If a participant develops fever and infusion related reaction or cytokine release syndrome is suspected, refer to management guidelines (Section 6.6.2 ). • Height will be recorded at Screening only. • Weight will be measured and recorded (in kilograms) at baseline and at every treatment visit."
69,page_69,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 69 8.2.4. Electrocardiograms A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Screening as indicated in the SoA using an ECG machine that calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, and QT intervals. The QT interval corrected for heart rate or RR interval using Fridericia’s formula may be by machine or manual calculation. ECG af ter Screening will be performed as clinically indicated. 8.2.5. Echocardiogram s Echocardiogram will be performed at Screening to assess cardiac ejection fraction for the purpose of study eligibility, as specified in the SoA and Section 5.1. Additional ECHO assessments may be performed if clinically warranted. MUGA can be used in lieu of ECHO (if not available) in the assessment of LVEF; the same modality should be used in any subsequent assessments. 8.2.6. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments • Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical labor atory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency. The clinical laboratory tests will be performed by local laboratory unless otherwise indicated. • The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record an y clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlyin g disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. • All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 30 days after the last d ose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. • If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time j udged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. • All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3 . The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AE s that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or the study, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (Refer to Section 7)."

Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information • All AESIs and SAEs will be collected from the start of treatment until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment at the time points specified in the SoA ( refer to Appendix 3 for details on SAEs ). However, any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., study treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) will be recorded from the time a participant consen ts to participate in the study. If subsequent anti -cancer treatment is initiated during the 90 -day follow -up period yet <30 days after the date study treatment was discontinued, AESI ad SAEs must continue to be collected until 30 days after last dose of st udy treatment. • All AEs will be collected from the start of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment at the time points specified in the SoA ( Table 1). • Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF a nd not in the AE section. • All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of t he event . • Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs • The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the proc edures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 . • Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open - ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 8.3.3. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the i nvestigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non -serious AESIs will be followed until event s are resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up as defined in Section 7.3. Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3 ."
71,page_71,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 71 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs • Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. • The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators. • Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to lo cal regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. • An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor w ill review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Pregnancy • If a participant becomes pregnant while on study treatment, study treatment must be immediately discon tinued. • Details of all pregnancies in female participants and female partners of male participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until 120 days after the last dose of study treatment. • If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy . • Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAE. 8.3.6. Cardiovascular and Death Events For any cardiova scular events detailed in Section 10.3.3 and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The C V information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. In itial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported."

Events of Clinical Interest Selected events that may be non-serious or serious adverse events and are considered as Events of Clinical Interest (EC I) in this study protocol and must be reported to the Sponsor. Events of clinical interest include: 1. An overdose of Study Treatment (GSK3359609/Pembrolizumab), as defined in Section 8.4, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results. 2. An elevated AST (aspartate aminotransferase) or ALT (alanine aminotransferase) lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* *Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evalua tion for an underlying etiology. The study site guidance for assessment and follow up of these criteria can be made available. It may also be appropriate to conduct additional evaluation for an underlying etiology in the setting of abnormalities of liver b lood tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase that do not meet the criteria noted above. In these cases, the decision to proceed with additional evaluation will be made through consultation between the study investigators and the GSK M edical Monitor. However, abnormalities of liver blood tests that do not meet the criteria noted above are not ECIs for this study. 8.4. Treatment of Overdose In the event there is an overdose of GSK3359609 and/or pembrolizumab the investigator must : 1. Contact the Medical Monitor immediately. 2. Closely monitor the participant for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities for at least 130 days. 3. Obtain a PK analysis within 28 days from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determ ined on a case -by-case basis) 4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF. An overdose event that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is defined as an ECI; refer to Sect ion 8.3.7 for details on the expedited reporting requirements for ECI. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the inve stigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant."
73,page_73,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 73 8.4.1. GSK3359609 An overdose of GSK3359609 is defined as administration of a dose that is >240 mg (>10 times the 24 mg intended dose) . There is no specific antidote for overdose with GSK3359609. In the event of a suspected overdose, it is recommended that the appropriate supportive clinical care be instituted as dictated by the participant’s clinical status. 8.4.2. Pembrolizumab An overdose of pembrolizumab is defin ed as ≥1000 mg (5 times the dose) of pembrolizumab. In the event of a suspected overdose, it is recommended that the appropriate supportive clinical care be instituted as dictated by the participant’s clinical status. 8.5. Pharmacokinetics • Plasma samples will be collected for measurement of GSK3359609 concentrations at the timepoints specified in the SoA . Refer to the Q2 laboratory manual for i nstructions on the collection and handling of the plasma samples . The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded. • Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of GSK3359609 . Samples collected for analyses of GSK3359609 plasma concentration may also be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study. Drug concentration information that would unblind the study will not be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. If appropriate, de-identified drug concentration information may be analysed prior to study un blinding. In that case, GSK C linical Pharmacology Modelling Simulation analysts will have access to a blinded population PK dataset (including, but not limited to, concentration, actual dosing information, demographics, and some vital sign and laboratory i nformation, but excluding adverse event and efficacy information) at several time points (e.g., prior to each interim analysis) throughout the trial for population PK model development/refinement. 8.6. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluat ed in this study. 8.7. Genetics Refer to Appendix 7 for information regarding genetics research. A blood sample for deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) isolation will be c ollected from participants who have consented to participate in the genetics analysis component of the study. Participation is optional. Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study."
74,page_74,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 74 In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement genetic blood sample may be requested from the participant. Signed informed consent will be required to obtain a replacement sample unless it was included in the original consent. Details on blood volume collected, th e processes for collection , shipment and destruction of these samples can be found in Q2 laboratory manual. 8.8. Biomarkers • Collection of samples for biomarker research is also part of this study. The following samples for biomarker research are required and wi ll be collected from all participants in this study as specified in the SoA: • Whole blood for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation . The PBMC may be used for biomarker assays including but not limited to TCR diversity, functional assays and immune cell phenotyping etc. • Plasma at baseline and on -treatment timepoints specified in the SoA . The sample may be used to extract and analyze cell-free DNA (cfDNA ) and/or cell-free ribonucleic acid (cf RNA ) as well as other soluble factors and protei ns. • Archival tumor tissue (refer to Section 8.8.3 ): tumor tissue acquired within 2 years prior to randomization is required otherwise fresh tumor biopsy performed at Screening will be required. • Optional samples for biomarker research to be obtained from participants at the following timepoints : • Tumor biopsy at Screening in those participants providing archival tissue (i.e., archival tumor tissue meets the protocol defined time requirements) • Tumor tissue biopsy during the treatment period in participants with a mixed tumor response and/or disease progression . • Tumor tissue biopsy at the completion of 35 cycles of study treatment • Samples may be teste d for ICOS expression, germline and /or somatic mutations including and tumor mutation burden, gene expression, TCR sequences and/ or any other DNA, RNA or protein -based biomarker that may emerge from other studies using the test drugs, to evaluate their as sociation with the efficacy endpoints to the study treatments . • In additio n, with the participant’s consent, samples will be stored , and analysis may be performed on biomarker variants thought to play a role in the mechanism of action, sensitivity or resistance or could support future combination s. Analyses may include association s of biomarker variants with efficacy endp oints . Furthermore, the samples and any biomarker data generated may be used to support the development and filing of a diagnostic."
75,page_75,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 75 Samples may be stored for a maximum of 15 years (or according to local regulations) following the last participant’s last visit for the study at a facility selected by the sponsor to enable further analysis of biomarker responses to study intervention. 8.8.1. RNA Research Transcriptome studies will be conducted using either next generation sequencing (NGS) based technologies , targeted probe set and/or alternative equivalent technologies, which facilitates the simultaneous measurement of the relative abundances of thousands of ribonucleic acid (RNA) species resulting in a transcriptome profile for each blood and / or tumor sample. This will enable the evaluation of baseline transcriptome profiles or any changes upon treatment with the study drugs that may correlate w ith response to the combination of GSK3359609 and Pembrolizumab. This may include tumor and/or immune cells from blood as well as from tumor tissues. RNA expression studies may be conducted using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and/or alternative equivalent technologies, which can facilitate the simultaneous measurement of the relative abundances of RNA species resulting in a n RNA expression profile for each blood and/or tumor tissue samples. The RNAs assayed may be t hose involved with the pathogenesis of HNSCC; the biology of ICOS -ICOSL or PD -1-PD-L1 signaling pathways and may help identify responder populations to the combination of GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab and pla cebo. The RNAs that code for these proteins and/or regulatory RNAs may also be studied. The same samples may also be used to confirm findings by application of alternative technologies. 8.8.2. DNA Research DNA analysis using either whole exome and/or targeted sequencing of circulating tumor DNA from plasma and/or tumor will be performed. T cell repertoire analysis for clonality and diversity of TCRs at baseline and on treatment may also be evaluated . 8.8.3. Tumor Tissue All participants will provide a rchival tumor tissue or if not available or eval uable for screening assessments (refer to Section 5.1 inclusion 12 and SoA [ Table 1]) then a fresh pre-treatment biops y. Fresh biopsy will be optional at Screening for those participants providing archival tissue. The tumor tissue collected (archival or fresh biopsy material) will be evaluated by methods that include PD-L1 IHC testing (using the US FDA approved and CE -marked EU PD -L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay ), other IHC tests and may include multiplex immunofluorescence technolog ies or other methods for evaluating the expression of phenotypic and functional immune cell markers on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and other immune cells as well as markers on tumor cells . Additionally, tumor tissue may undergo DNA/RNA -based genetic/genomic profiling (i.e., tumor mutation burden, T cell receptor diversity) which may include sequencing technologies that provide DNA/RNA sequence information. In addition, when possible, similar analyses will be performed on tumor tissue obtained upon progression. These"
76,page_76,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 76 samples may also be evaluated for predictive measures of efficacy ; if a predictive biomarker is identified, these tissues may be used for the development of a diagnostic test. Details for the sample collection, processing, storage and shipment will be provided in the SRM and Q2 laborat ory manual. 8.8.4. Blood Samples Plasma and/or serum samples are collected at baseline, during treatment and at disease progression to evaluate soluble factors such as cytokine s, chemokines and other secreted proteins as well as c fDNA /cfRNA . PBMC samples will be collected at baseline, during treatment and at disease progression and may be used for evaluating the expression of phenotypic and functional immune cell markers as well as for evaluating the polyfunctionality of immune cells and to test any novel biology emerging from other ICOS studies. Other biomarkers may be evaluated as determined by additional data. Details for the samples collection, processing, storage and shipment will be provided in the SRM and Q2 laboratory manual. 8.9. Immunogenicity Antibodies to GSK3359609 will be evaluated in serum samples collected from all participants according to the SoA. Additionally, serum samples should also be collected at the final visit from participants who discontinued study intervention or were withdrawn from the stu dy. These samples will be tested by the sponsor or sponsor's designee. Serum samples will be screened for antibodies binding to GSK3359609 and the titer of confirmed positive samples will be reported. Other analyses may be performed to verify the stability of antibodies to GSK3359609 and/or further characterize the immunogenicity of GSK3359609. The detection and characterization of antibodies to GSK3359609 will be performed using a validated assay method by or under the supervision of the sponsor. All sampl es collected for detection of antibodies to study intervention will also be evaluated for GSK3359609 concentration to enable interpretation of the antibody data. Antibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for their ability to neutralize the a ctivity of GSK3359609. 8.10. Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) will be collected for all participants randomized to study treatment and may be used to conduct exploratory economic analyses . HCRU includes non -protocol healthcare encounters , such as provider visits, emergency room visits, hospitalizations (including ward, admission and discharge dates, and primary discharge diagnosis) , medications, tests, or proc edures ."

Primary Hypotheses The following primary hypotheses will be tested: Overall Survival (OS) • Hypothesis (H1): GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab prolongs OS compared with pembrolizumab/placebo in participants with PD -L1 CPS1 R/M HNSCC . • Hypothesis (H 2): GSK 3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab prolongs OS compared with pembrolizumab/placebo in participants with PD -L1 CPS20 R/M HNSCC . Progression -free Survival ( PFS) • Hypothesis ( H3): GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab prolongs PFS by investigator assessment compared with pembrolizumab/placebo in participants with PD -L1 CPS1 R/M HNSCC. 9.1.2. Key Secondary Hypotheses The following key secondary hypotheses will be tested: Immune -based progression -free Survival (iPFS ) • Hypothesis ( H4): GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab prolongs iPFS by investigator assessment compared with pembrolizumab/placebo in participants with PD -L1 CPS1 R/M HNSCC. Time to Deterioration (TTD) in Pain • Hypothesis ( H5): GSK3359609 in combination with pembro lizumab prolongs TTD in Pain (measured by EORTC QLQ H&N 35 pain domain ) compared with pembrolizumab/placebo in participants with PD -L1 CPS1 R/M HNSCC. • Hypothesis (H 6): GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab prolongs TTD in Pain (measured by EORTC QL Q H&N 35 pain domain ) compared with pembrolizumab/placebo in participants with PD -L1 CPS20 R/M HNSCC. TTD in Physical Functioning • Hypothesis (H 7): GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab prolongs TTD in Physical Functioning (measured by PROMIS PF 8c) compared with pembrolizumab/placebo in participants with PD -L1 CPS1 R/M HNSCC.
81,page_81,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 81 • Hypothesis (H 8): GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab prolongs TTD in Physical Functioning (measured by PROMIS PF 8c ) compared with pembrolizumab/placebo in participants with PD -L1 CPS20 R/M HNSCC. 9.2. Sample Size Determination The 2-in-1 adaptive Phase II/III study design [ Chen , 2018] allows expanding the Phase II study seamlessly into a Phase III confirmatory study; refer to Section 4 for details of the study design. The Phase II study will randomize approximately 374 participants with a 1:1 ratio between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab arm and the pembrolizumab/placebo arm. Assuming the prevalence r ate of PD-L1 CPS ≥20 among the PD-L1 CPS ≥1 population is 53%, a sample size of 374 PD-L1 CPS 1 participants will provide approximately 198 PD -L1 CPS 20 participants . Should expanding the Phase II study into a Phase III be decided, a total of 600 participants with PD -L1 CPS 1 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab arm and the pembrolizumab/placebo arm, including those participants already enrolled. Participants already used for the decision maki ng in the ongoing study will be included in Phase III analyses. The Phase III study will have an overall sample size of 600 participants. Assuming the aforementioned prevalence rate of PD -L1 CPS status, a sample size of 600 participants with PD-L1 CPS 1 status will provide 318 PD-L1 CPS 20 participants . The study is event -driven , and the sample size calculation is driven by overall survival events. The assumptions for the sample size and power calculation apply to the study whether it remains as a Phase II study (i.e. without expansion) or expand s to a Phase III study (i.e. with expansion). Overall Survival (OS) A long -term survival benefit, observed as a long -lasting plateau towards the tail of the survival curve, and a delayed treatment effect, observed as a late separation in survival curves between the experimental and control arms, have been reported in rando mized clinical trials among participants treated with immuno -oncology drugs. Given the OS data reported in the KN-048 clinical trial , a long -term survival benefit in the pembrolizumab/placebo arm and potential non-proportional hazards with a delayed treatm ent effect are anticipated . Therefore, t he sample size and power calculation of OS in PD -L1 CPS 1 participants and PD -L1 CPS 20 participants are based on the following assumptions: 1. Overall survival in the pembrolizumab/placebo arm follows a piecewise exponential distribution with the milestone OS rates in the"
82,page_82,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 82 pembrolizumab/placebo arm the same as the rates in the pembrolizumab arm reported in the KN -048 trial . That is, the survival rates at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months are approximately 71%, 50.4%, 28.9% and 22.1%, respectively, with a median survival of 12.3 months for PD-L1 CPS1 participants in the pembrolizumab/placebo arm ; the survival rates at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months are approximately 74%, 56.4%, 35.3% and 29.3%, respectively, with a median survival of 14.9 months for PD -L1 CPS20 participants in the pembrolizumab/placebo arm 2. True hazard ratio between GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and the pembrolizumab/placebo arm is time varying leading to a delayed treatment effect with a lag -time of 6 months . For the first 6 months from randomization, a hazard ratio of 1 is assumed in PD -L1 CPS 1 and CPS 20 participants. For the time beyond 6 months from randomization, a hazard ratio of ~0.512 and ~0.446 is assumed in PD -L1 CPS 1 and CPS 20 participants, respectively 3. An enrollment period of ~15 months if the study remains as a Phase II study, and an enrollment period of ~19 months if the study expands to a Phase III study 4. Yearly drop -out rate of 5% . Progression -free Survival (PFS) /Immune -based Progression -free Survival (iPFS) The power calculation of PFS/iPFS in PD -L1 CPS 1 participants is based on the following assumptions: 1. PFS/iPFS in the pembrolizumab/placebo arm follows a piecewise exponential distribution with t he milestone PFS/iPFS rates in the pembrolizumab/placebo arm the same as the rates in the pembrolizumab arm reported in the KN -048 trial . That is, the PFS/iPFS rates at 6 and 12 months are approximately 28.7% and 20.6% , respectively, with a median PFS/iPFS of 3.2 months for PD-L1 CPS 1 participants in the pembrolizumab/placebo arm 2. True hazard ratio for PFS/iPFS between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab arm and the pembrolizumab/placebo arm of 0. 61 for PD -L1 CPS 1 participants 3. If the study remains as a Phase II study, an enrollment period of 15 months and a minimum of 14-month follow -up after enrol lment completion If the study expands to a Phase III study, an enrollment period of 19 months and a minimum of 9-month follow -up afte r enrol lment completion 4. Yearly dropout rate of 10% . 9.2.1. Remain as a Phase II Study Overall Survival The final OS analysis in the PD -L1 CPS1 and CPS20 participants for a Phase II study (i.e. without expansion) will be carried out after approximately 24 4 deaths in PD -L1"
83,page_83,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 83 CPS1 participants have occurred between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab arm and the pembrolizumab/placebo arm, barring early stopping for futility or efficacy . It is expected that approximately 113 deaths in PD -L1 CPS20 participants have occurred between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab arm and the pembrolizumab/placebo arm. With the above numbers of OS events and before any alpha re-allocation , the study provides , a 79.8% power in the PD -L1 CPS1 particip ants and a 60% power in the PD - L1 CPS20 participants to demonstrate superiority of OS of GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab relative to pembrolizumab plus placebo at the pre - specified initial alpha (one -sided) level of 2.49% . Please refer to Section 9.8 for details in the alpha spending. Progression -free Survival /Immune -based progression -free Survival The estimated numbers of PFS/iPFS events for a Phase II study (i.e. without expansion) at the final PFS evaluation are estimated to be 281 in the PD -L1 CPS1 participants. The estimated number of PFS /iPFS events in the PD -L1 CPS1 participants provides a 67.6% power for detecting a HR of 0. 61 in PFS /iPFS in the PD -L1 CPS1 participants at the alpha level of 0.01% (one -sided). 9.2.2. Expand to a Phase III Study Overall Survival The final OS analysis in the PD-L1 CPS1 and CPS 20 participants for a Phase III study (i.e. with expan sion) will be carried out after approximately 367 deaths in the PD-L1 CPS1 participants have occurred between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab arm and the pembrolizumab/placebo arm, barring early stopping for futility or efficacy. It is expected that approximately 171 deaths in PD -L1 CPS20 participants have occurred between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab arm and the pembrolizumab/placebo arm. With the above numbers of OS events and before any alpha re-allocation , the st udy provides a 90 .1% power in the PD-L1 CPS1 participants and a 73.5% power in the PD - L1 CPS20 participants to demonstrate superiority of OS of GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab relative to pembrolizumab plus placebo at the pre - specified initi al alpha (one -sided) level of 2.49% . Progression -free Survival/Immune -based Progression -free Survival The estimated numbers of PFS/iPFS events for a Phase III study (i.e. with expansion) at the final PFS evaluation are estimated to be 432 in the PD -L1 CPS1 participants. The estimated number of PFS /iPFS events in the PD -L1 CPS1 participants provides a 92.5% power for detecting a HR of 0. 61 in PFS /iPFS in the PD -L1 CPS1 participants at the alpha level of 0.01% (one -sided)."
84,page_84,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 84 The family -wise type I error rate for the primary hypotheses on PFS and OS as well as the key secondary hypotheses on iPFS, TTD in pain and TTD in PF is strongly controlled at the alpha level of 2.5% (one -sided). The strategy to address multiplicity issues with regards to multiple efficacy endpoints, multiple populations and interim analyses are described in Section 9.5 and Section 9.8. The study is considered to have met the study primary objective if GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab is superior to pembrolizumab administered with placebo on either PFS OR OS in PD -L1 CPS1 participants. 9.2.3. Sample Size Sensitivity In the case that there is no violation of the proportional hazards in OS between GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and the pembrolizumab/placebo arm throughout the entire course of the study , the powers in OS for PD -L1 CPS 1 participants and PD -L1 CPS 20 participants are estimated below. Specifically, a consta nt OS hazard ratio of 0.71 in PD -L1 CPS 1 participants and 0.67 in PD-L1 CPS 20 participants is assumed , in addition to the assumptions in the distribution of the survival curve, the enrol lment duration and the drop-out rate as described in the OS sample size calculation in Section 9.2. It is assumed that t he sample size and the number of OS events at each look in the proportional hazard case follow the expected number in the non -proportional hazards case (details in Section 9.5). If the study remains as a Phase II trial, the study provides a 75 .3% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.71 in OS for PD -L1 CPS 1 participants , and a 55.6% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 in OS for PD -L1 CPS 20 participants , respectively, under the proportional hazards assumption at the one -sided alpha level of 2.49%. If the study expands to a Phase III trial, the study provides a 90.1% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.71 in OS for PD -L1 CPS 1 participants , and a 73.5% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 in OS for PD -L1 CPS 20 participants , respectively, under the proportional hazards assumption at the one -sided alpha level of 2. 49%. The sample size, power calculations, and simulations were performed in the software EAST 6 and R (package “gsDesign”). 9.3.

Participants without documented death will be censored at last known alive date. The non -parametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curves. The treatment difference in survival will be assessed by the stratified log -rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., the hazard ratio). The hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with a single treatment covariate will be reported. The max-combo test, Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) method , or piecewise HR method may be conducted as appropriate to account for the possible non -proportional hazards effect. Additional analyses of OS adjust ing for the effect of subsequent treatment may be performed based on recognized methods, if a sufficient proportion of participants switch . The choi ce of the method will be based on an examination of the appropriateness of the data to the assumptions required by the method.

Secondary Analyses Progression -Free Survival per iRECIST (iPFS) Progression -free survival per iRECIST (iPFS) is one of the key secondary endpoints of this study. It is defined as the interval of time from the date of ra ndomization to the date of the first documented disease progression confirmed consecutively per iRECIST based on investigator assessment, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Unlike RECIST 1.1, iRECIST requires the confirmation of progression and uses the terms unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD) and confirmed progressive disease (iCPD). The progression event date (iPD date) to be used in the calculation of PFS per iRECIST should be the first date of documented iUPD provided that iCPD is c onfirmed at the next assessment. If iUPD occurs, but is disregarded because of later iSD, iPR, or iCR, that iUPD date should not be used as the progression event date. If progression is not confirmed and there is no subsequent iSD, iPR, or iCR, then the iUPD date will be used as iPD date in the following scenarios: • Participant discontinues study treatment because the participant was judged not to be clinically stable • Participant does not undergo further response assessments due to any reason (i.e., partici pant refusal, protocol non -compliance, or participant death) • Next timepoint response of iUPD, and iCPD never occurs Determination of dates of iPFS events and dates for censoring in the secondary analysis of iPFS are summarized in Table 10."

Patient Reported Outcome s EORTC IL50 and IL51(subset of domains from the EORTC QLQ -C30 and H&N35 respectively) are not pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected by both disease symptoms and treatment tolerability in addition to HRQoL domains. The time to deterioration (TTD) curves in Pain measured by the EORTC QLQ -H&N35 pain domain (included in the EORTC IL51) and the TTD in Physical Function (PF) measured by the PROMIS PF 8c will be analysed in the ITT population using the non - parametric Kaplan -Meier method. The treatment effect in TTD in Pain and PF will be assessed separately by the stratified log-rank test. A stratifie d Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., hazard ratio) between the treatment arms.

Interim Analyses Adapt ive Decision Making The analysis for adapt ive decision will be conducted using ORR/DCR per RECIST v1.1 based on investigator assessment when approximately the first 100 PD -L1 CPS ≥1 participants have a minimum follow -up of 6 months. The adaptive decision criteria will be positive if there is at least 8% improvement of ORR in the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab arm comparing with the pembrolizumab/placebo arm in PD -L1 CPS ≥1 population. Table 12 presents the operating characteristics of the adaptive decision criteria based on the improvement of ORR. Confirmation of CR and PR is not required in the adapt ive decision making. 1) If the ORR outcome per RECIST v1.1 is positive with ∆ORR≥8% in PD -L1 CPS ≥1 population, the study continues to an originally planned Phase III sample size for a definitive Phase III evaluation."

The probability is estimated based on 50,000 simulations and it is assumed that the ORR of the Pembrolizumab/Placebo arm is 19% in the simulations. 2. The final futility decision is based on both ORR and DCR; the probability of futility will be lower. A meta-analysis was performed using published PD -1/L1 treated studies in HNSCC ; the analysis only included data from PD-1/L1 regimens that did contain chemotherapy . The selection of O RR as the endpoint for the adaptive decision is supported by results of the meta -analysis which showed that median OS is significantly positively correlated with ORR (refer to Section 10.11 for details) . There is no penalty in alpha spending for the option to expand Phase II to Phase III, given that neither OS nor PFS are negatively correlated with ORR per RECIS T v1.1 based on th is meta -analysis (Section 10.11 ). All participants from the study are used for statistical inference at the end of Phase II or Phase III regardless of the interim expansion decision. In addition, all the primary and key secondary endpoints are formally tested for statistical significance at the end of Phase II or Phase III. PFS/iPFS Analysis and Interim Analyses of OS The study is designed to have 1 PFS/iPFS analysis and 2 OS analyses in PD -L1 CPS ≥1 participants. Two OS analyses will be performed in PD -L1 CPS ≥20 participants. The safety of the treatment will also be assessed at the interim analysis. The timing of PFS/iPFS analysis and the OS interim analysis is triggered by the pre - specified number of PFS events in the PD-L1 CPS ≥1 population. At the time of PFS /iPFS analysis, the OS interim analysis will be conducted in PD-L1 CPS ≥1 participants to allow for early stopping of the study due to efficacy or allow for"

The timing of the final OS analysis in the PD -L1 CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥20 participants will be triggered by the pre -specified number of OS events in the PD-L1 CPS ≥1 population. The nominal significance levels for the interim and final analyses of OS will be determined by the Lan -DeMet s spending function based upon the O’Brien -Fleming boundary. The futility bounds of this study are non -binding and the bounds are considered guidance rather than strict bounds. Table 13 summarizes the information fraction , sample size and decision guidance for the planned PFS /iPFS and OS analyses as a Phase II study. Table 14 summarizes the information fraction , sample size and decision guidance for the planned PFS /iPFS and OS analyses as a Phase III study. Efficacy boundaries and non -binding futility boundaries are based on initially assigned type I error rate before any alpha re-allocation and projected number of events at study milestones. The actual boundaries will be determined from the actual number of events at the time of the specified interim analysis using the alpha - and beta - spending functi ons. Actual futility bounds will be updated if overall beta is changed with respect to alpha re- allocation . Results of all interim analyses, including the adaptive decision, PFS /iPFS analysis, and OS interim analysis, will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). Further details of interim analyses will be provided in the IDMC Charter. Any change to the planned event size will be described in the statistical ana lysis plan before any unblinding of the data."

The IDMC will make recommendations for discontinuation or modification of the study based on ongoing reviews of safety data according to the Charter. In addition, the IDMC will also evaluate all interim efficacy data, including the adapt ive decision , PFS/iPFS analysis and OS interim analys is, and make a recommendation based on observed results of the study. In this double -blind study, all GSK and site personnel will be restricted from access to interim analysis results provided to the IDMC until the conclusion of the study, unless the IDMC recommends significant changes to study conduct that require a protocol amendment. In this scenario, after receiving the IDMC recommendation and a decision by Chief Medical Officer (CMO), a review of the data may be required. A select group from GSK, as determined by the CMO will be unblinded to review the data to agree on future study conduct. Depending on the recommendation of the IDMC, the Sponsor may prepare a regulatory submission. More details will b e provided in the IDMC Charter. 9.7. Blinded Independent Central Review Auditing A random sample -based BICR auditing approach will be used to assess whether bias exists in estimation of PFS hazard ratio between investigator assessments and BICR assessments [ Stone , 2015] if the study expands to a Phase III trial. The study is currently designed as a randomized, double -blind study. The risk of investigator bias can be mitigated in a properly double -blinded randomized study [Dodd , 2008]. The objective of the sample -based BICR approach is to corroborate the analysis results of the investigator -assessed PFS and to assist in the evaluation of potential bias in investigator -assessed PFS in PD-L1 CPS ≥1 participants if the study expands to a Phase III trial. The BICR audit approach is not intended to provide an alternative means of definitive analysis. Evaluation bias will be assessed through the use of measure proposed by Stone et al [Stone , 2015] . The hazard ratio (HRR ), where HRR is defined as the ratio of the hazard ratio (HR) for the treatment effect estimated from the BICR to the corresponding HR for the investigator assessment s. Larger values of HRR are suggestive of a less acceptable bias. The maximum acceptable HRR will be derived based on the graded approach [Stone , 2015]. For e xample, in order to preserve two -thirds of the observed HR based on investigator assessment, the maximum acceptable HRR is 1. 213 if the full study HR based on investigator assessment for PFS in PD-L1 CPS ≥1 participants is 0.61. If the sample HRR is within the range specified by the maximum acceptable HRR, it is concluded that the sample is sufﬁcient to rule out meaningful levels of bias , and no further scans will be assessed by the BICR; otherwise the BICR will be performed in al l PD-L1 CPS ≥1 participants."
98,page_98,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 98 The audit size of the sample -based BICR will be 45% of all PD-L1 CPS ≥1 participants if the study expands to a Phase III trial. Assuming the correlation in the logarithm of HR s between investigator assessment and BICR is 0.8 , with the maximum acceptable HRR of 1.213 and the testing of evaluation of bias is conducted at the 10% alpha level , and 72% of participants have an event according to investigator assessment and 67% according to BICR, the audit size of 45% will ensure that the specificity is ~93.7 % in PD-L1 CPS ≥1 participants . Further details on the BICR auditing approach will be included in the statistical analysis plan. 9.8. Multiplicity The trial uses the graphical method [ Maurer , 2013] to provide strong multiplicity control for multiple hypotheses as well as interim analyses. The family -wise type I error for this study is strongly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) . Figure 1 shows the initial one -sided alpha-allocation for PFS/iPFS, OS, and key PRO endpoints . Hypotheses presented as nodes in squares are divided into three subfamilies presented in ellipsoids . The weights for re -allocation from each subfamily/ hypothesis to the others are represented on the lines connecting hypotheses. The multiplicity control strategy applies whether the study remains as a Phase II trial or expands to a Phase III trial. Figure 1 Multiplicity Testing Strategy for Comparisons Between GSK3359609 in Combination with Pembrolizumab and Pembrolizumab Administered with Placebo Abbreviations: CPS = combined positive score; H = hypothesis; I = GSK3359609; iPFS = progression - free survival per iRECIST; OS = overall survival; P = pembrolizumab; PF=physical function; PFS = progression -free survival per RECIST v1.1; PD-L1 = programmed cell death receptor 1 -ligand 1 ; TTD=time to deterioration 1. The alpha level assigned to a subfamily will be rolled over only if the hypotheses within the subfamily are all significant based on the weight for re -allocation presented on the dashed lines connecting subfamilies. Within each subfamily, the weights for re -allocation from each hypothesis to the others are represented on the solid lines connecting hypotheses. 2.  = 5/6 if both hypotheses in the OS subfamily (i.e. PD -L1 CPS1 and PD -L1 CPS20 participants) are significant at the time of PFS/iPFS analyses; if the OS hypothesis is not significant in either population at the time of PFS/iPFS analyses , then  = 1 at the final OS analysis ."
99,page_99,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 99 The alpha re-allocation for PFS/iPFS, OS and key PRO endpoints is further explained below : Overall Survival • An initial alpha level of 2.49% is allocated to the OS hypothesis in the PD-L1 CPS1 participants. • If PFS and iPFS test s are both significant in PD-L1 CPS1 participants , the OS hypothesis in the PD-L1 CPS1 participants will be tested at 2.5% (re -allocated alpha). • OS in the PD-L1 CPS20 participants is tested sequentially at the same overall alpha level as that of OS in PD-L1 CPS1 participants if GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrates superiority to pembrolizumab plus placebo in OS in PD-L1 CPS1 participants. If OS is not significant in PD- L1 CPS1 participants, the formal conclusion of statistical significance on OS in PD-L1 CPS20 participants will not be drawn. The following alpha - and beta -spending functions are used in the OS hypothesis of PD-L1 CPS1 participants and PD -L1 CPS20 participants . • For the OS hypothesis, the alpha -spending function based on Lan -DeMet s O’Brien -Fleming approximation spending function and the beta -spending function based on the Hwang -Shih-DeCani boundary method with a gamma parameter of -20 are constructed to implement group sequential boundaries that control the type I error rate as well as allow for non -binding futility analysis. Section 9.5 demonstrates the planned analyses as well as bounds and boundary properties for OS hypothesis testing. Efficacy boundaries and non -binding futility boundaries are based on initially assigned t ype I error rate before any alpha re -allocation and projected number of events at study milestones. The actual boundaries will be determined from the actual number of events at the time of the specified interim analysis using the alpha - and beta- spending functions. Actual futility bounds will be updated if overall beta is changed with respect to alpha re-allocation . Progression -free Survival/Immune -based Progression -free Survival • An initial alpha level of 0.01% is allocated to the PFS hypothesis in PD-L1 CPS1 participants . • If the OS hypotheses in both PD-L1 CPS1 participants and PD-L1 CPS20 participants are significant at the time of the OS interim analysis , the PFS hypothesis in PD-L1 CPS1 participants will be tested at 0.425% (re -allocated alpha). • If the PFS hypothesis in PD-L1 CPS1 is significant , the hypothesis of iPFS in PD-L1 CPS1 will be tested sequentially at the same alpha level ."

The alpha level from OS hypothesis will be propagated to key PRO hypotheses. • If OS meets superiority in both populations at the time of the OS interim analysis , a total of 2.075% alpha level will be propagated to key PRO hypotheses . • If OS meets superiority in both populations at the time of the final OS analysis but PFS or iPFS fails to demonstrate superiority in PD-L1 CPS1 participants , a total of 2.4 9% alpha level will be propagated to key PRO hypotheses. • If OS meets superiority in both populations at the time of the final OS analysis and PFS and iPFS both demonstrate superiority in PD-L1 CPS1 participants , a total of 2. 5% alpha level will be propagated to key PRO hypotheses. • The alpha level propagated from OS will be equally split between TTD in Pain and TTD in PF in PD -L1 CPS ≥1 participants, w ith the possibility to further propagate the levels between each other . • If 1 of 2 key PRO hypotheses in PD -L1 CPS ≥1 participants is rejected based on the re-allocated alpha level , the key PRO hypotheses in PD -L1 CPS ≥20 participants can be tested based on the (updated) weight , with the possibility to further propagate the levels between each other . • Based on the re -allocated cumulative alpha level, the nomin al significance level for each key PRO endpoint will be calculated based on the Lan -DeMet s O’Brien - Fleming approximation alpha -spending function.

Definition of AE AE Definition • An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. • NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. Events Meeting the AE Definition • Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator ( i.e., not related to progression of underlying disease). • Exacerb ation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. • New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. • ""Lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be rep orted as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition • Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition."
108,page_108,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 108 • The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. • Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. • Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). • Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or con dition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 10.3.2. Definition of SAE If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disea se under study, death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: Results in death Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Results in persistent disability/incapacity • The term disability means a substantial disruption of a perso n’s ability to conduct normal life functions. • This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle ) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption."
109,page_109,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 109 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Other situations: • Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the oth er outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers other than the cancer under study , intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 10.3.3. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: • Myocardial infarction/unstable angina • Congestive heart failure • Arrhythmias • Valvulopathy • Pulmonary hypertension • Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack • Peripheral arte rial thromboembolism • Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism • Revascularization 10.3.4. Recording and Follow -Up of AE and SAE AE and SAE Recording • When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation ( e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. • The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. • It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to G SK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/SAE CRF page."
110,page_110,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 110 • There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK. • The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and will assign a grade according to the NCI -CTCAE v 5.0 [NCI, 2017]. Assessment of Causality • The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. • A ""reasonable possibility"" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. • The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. • Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated. • The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochu re (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. • For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. • There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission o f the SAE data to GSK . • The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. • The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements."
111,page_111,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 111 Follow -up of AE and SAE • The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. • New or updated information will be recorded in the origin ally completed CRF. • The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 10.3.5. Reporting of SAE to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool • The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. • If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours. • The site will enter the SAE data into the elect ronic system as soon as it becomes available. • After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. • If a site receives a report of a new SAE fr om a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to the Medical Monitor by te lephone. • Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SRM. SAE Reporting to GSK via Paper CRF • Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the X/medical monitor or the SAE coordinator . • In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service. • Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the in vestigator to complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. • Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SRM."

Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s medi cal records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 3. Postmenopausal female • A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. • A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, c onfirmation with more than one FSH measurement is required."

Study Intervention Rechallenge Guidelines 10.8.1.1. Rechallenge Following Liver Stopping Events that are Possibly Related to Study Treatment Following drug -induced liver injury, drug rechallenge is associated with a 13% mortality across all drugs in prospective studies [Andrade , 200 9]. Clinical outcomes vary by drug, with nearly 50% fatality with halothane readministered within one month of initial injury. However, some drugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatality. Risk factors for a fatal drug rechallenge outcome include: • Hypersensitivity [Andrade , 2009] with initial liver injury (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia) • Jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver injury (direct bili rubin > 35% of total) • Participant currently exhibits severe liver injury defined by: ALT 3xULN, bilirubin 2xULN (direct bilirubin > 35% of total), or INR1.5 • Serious adverse event or fatality has earlier been observed with drug rechallen ges [Hunt , 2010; Papay , 2009]"
124,page_124,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 124 • Evidence of drug -related preclinical liability (e.g. reactive metabolites; mitochondrial impairment [Hunt , 2010] ) Rechallenge refers to resuming study treatment following drug induced liver injury (DILI). Because of the risks associated with rechallenge after DILI this should only be considered for a participant for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit from a critical or life -saving medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine available, and a benefit:risk assessment of rechallenge is considered to be favorable. Approval by GSK for rechallenge with study treatment can be considered where: • Investigator re quests consideration of rechallenge with study treatment for a participant who is receiving compelling benefit with study treatment that exceeds risk, and no effective alternative therapy is available . • Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approval for rechallenge with study treatment must be obtained, as required . • If the rechallenge is approved by GSK Medical Governance in writing, the participant must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of study treatmen t administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death . • The participant must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the rechallenge with study treatment. Documentation of informed consent must be recorde d in the study chart . • Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by GSK . • Participant s approved by GSK Medical Governance for rechallenge with study treatment must return to the clinic twice a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries have been demonstrated and then standard laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol. • If after study treatment rechallenge, participant meets protocol -defined liver chemistry stopping criteria, study treatment should be permanently disco ntinued. • GSK Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as required, must be informed of the participant ’s outcome following study treatment rechallenge. • GSK to be notified of any adverse events, as per Section 10.3. 10.8.1.2. Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Stopping Events NOT Related to Study Treatment Restart refers to resuming study intervention following liver stoppi ng events in which there is a clear underlying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g. biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, restart is not permitted following liver stopping event when the under lying cause was alcohol - related hepatitis."
125,page_125,"TMF-13842230 CONFIDENTIAL 209229 125 Approval by GSK for study treatment restart can be considered where: • Investigator requests consideration for study treatment restart if liver chemistries have a clear underlying cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, h ypotension and liver chemistries have improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and ALT <3xULN). • Possible study intervention -induced liver injury has been excluded by the investigator and the study team. This includes the absence of markers of hypers ensitivity (otherwise unexplained fever, rash, eosinophilia). If study intervention -related liver injury cannot be excluded, the guidance on rechallenge in Section 10.8.1.1 will apply. • There is no evidence of alcohol -related hepatitis • Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approval of study treatment restart must be obtained, as required. • If restart of study treatment is approved by GSK Medical Governance in writing, the participant must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of study treatment administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death. • The participant must also pro vide signed informed consent specifically for the study treatment restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart. • Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by GSK. • Participant s approved by GSK Medical Govern ance for restarting study treatment must return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries have been demonstrated and then laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol. • If after study treatment re -start, participant meets protocol -defined liver chemistry stopping criteria, follow usual stopping criteria instructions. • GSK Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as required, must be informed of the participant ’s outcome follow ing study treatment restart. • GSK to be notified of any adverse events, as per Section 10.3. ."

Section 7.1 – Discontinuation of Study Intervention Added language to address retreatment defined as Second Course To allow participants to have the option for retre atment upon progression after achieving a response/stable disease Section 8.8 – Biomarkers and Section 8.8.3 – Tumor Tissue Added additional information on timepoints for optional tumor tissue biopsy collections To clarify timepoints of tissue collectio ns Section 9.2 – Sample Size Determination Updated OS scenarios to account for the possibility of non - proportional hazards and long term benefit/tail effect. Updated PFS based on revised assumptions. In KEYNOTE -48 a delayed treatment effect and tail effe ct were observed in OS. Additionally, PFS assumption rates in the pembrolizumab arm are based on those reported in the KN - 048 trial."
