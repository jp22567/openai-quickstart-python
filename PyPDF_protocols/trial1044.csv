In this document, the term investigator refers to the individual responsible for the overall conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. 3.1 Background information For an assessment of benefits and risks of the trial, see Section 18.1. 3.1.1 Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism. The pathogenesis is heterogeneous involving environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by peripheral tissue insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion due to abnormal beta-cell function and abnormal glucose metabolism in the liver 3. Optimal glycaemic control is the treatment goal in subjects with T2DM in order to prevent long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia 4. Despite the availability of several anti-diabetic drugs, a significant proportion of subjects with T2DM do not achieve the recommended targets for glycaemic control 5,6. 3.1.2 Glucagon-like peptide-1 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone with a glucose-dependent stimulatory effect on insulin and inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets7,8. Subjects with T2DM have a decreased incretin effect9,10,11,12. However, the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 and thus, the ability to lower blood glucose (BG) levels, is preserved when GLP-1 is administered at supraphysiological levels13. In addition, supraphysiological levels of GLP-1 induce reduction in body weight14. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation15,16. Physiologically, GLP-1 also has a pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric emptying; however this effect seems to diminish upon chronic exposure14,15,16. These mechanisms of action make GLP-1RA an attractive pharmacological treatment for T2DM17,18,19. 3.1.3 Oral semaglutide Semaglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 RA structurally similar to liraglutide (Victoza®), a once-daily GLP-1 RA developed by Novo Nordisk and approved worldwide for the treatment of T2DM. Compared to human native GLP-1, which has a short half-life, the semaglutide molecule has three minor but important modifications ensuring protraction of its action: amino acid substitutions at CONFIDENTIAL"

The fatty di-acid side chain and the spacer mediate strong binding to albumin, thereby reducing renal clearance. The amino acid substitution at position 8 makes semaglutide less susceptible to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). The change in position 34 from a lysine to an arginine is included to have only one lysine in the sequence where to a spacer can be attached. Semaglutide is in development for oral once-daily treatment of T2DM. As the bioavailability of GLP-1 RAs is low when administered orally, semaglutide has been co-formulated with the absorption-enhancing excipient sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino] caprylate (SNAC) to increase the bioavailability of semaglutide. The absorption-enhancing properties of SNAC co- formulation are based on the concept developed by SNAC facilitates the absorption of semaglutide in a strictly time and size dependent manner, primarily via the transcellular route. The available data for semaglutide co-formulated with SNAC support that the absorption takes place in the stomach in a localised, buffered environment in close proximity to the tablet erosion. The absorption process is hampered if dosed with food, liquid or in the presence of significant stomach content. The absorption enhancement requires co-formulation between semaglutide and SNAC. Throughout this document “oral semaglutide” will refer to the drug product, that is, semaglutide co-formulated with 300 mg SNAC. 3.1.4 Nonclinical data 3.1.4.1 Semaglutide The nonclinical programme for semaglutide was designed according to the ICH M3 guideline to support the clinical development22. The standard nonclinical data package required to support phase 3 clinical trials has been completed. In addition, 2-year carcinogenicity studies and a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study have been completed. Semaglutide was generally well tolerated in animals (mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys). Two potential safety issues have been identified and these are detailed below. Thyroid C-cell tumours in rodents Treatment-related non-genotoxic proliferative changes in the thyroid C-cells of mice and rats were observed in 2-year carcinogenicity studies with semaglutide; thyroid hyperplasia was preceded by an increase in serum calcitonin. C-cell changes have not been observed in long-term studies in non- human primate. The observed pattern of effects in mice and rats and lack of these effects in the non- human primate and in man suggest that the mechanism by which semaglutide acts on the thyroid C- cells in rodents is the same as has been demonstrated for other GLP-1 RAs, including liraglutide.

The relevance for human subjects is currently unknown, but considered to be low23. Embryo−foetal development toxicity Semaglutide caused embryo-foetal development toxicity in the rat through a GLP-1 receptor mediated effect on the inverted yolk sac placenta leading to impaired nutrient supply to the developing embryo. Primates do not have an inverted yolk sac placenta which makes this mechanism unlikely to be of relevance to humans and cynomolgus monkeys. In the developmental toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey, a marked maternal body weight loss associated with the pharmacological effect of semaglutide coincided with increased early foetal loss; however, there was no indication of a teratogenic potential of semaglutide in this species. A review of the results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the investigator’s brochure (IB) for semaglutide (subcutaneous administration), edition 1124and the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924), edition 725, or any updates of these documents. 3.1.4.2 SNAC SNAC was developed as an absorption-enhancing excipient for the oral route of administration. The nonclinical programme to support clinical phase 3 development and marketing authorisation application submission has been conducted including a 26-week carcinogenicity study in transgenic rasH2 mice and a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats. Measurements of lactate levels have been included at selected time points around peak concentrations of SNAC in two of the phase 3a trials in the PIONEER programme (PIONEER 1 and 2) with the intention to document that SNAC does not impair cellular respiration in humans. In addition, events of lactic acidosis must be reported as an adverse event (AE)requiring additional data collection, please refer to Section 8.4.1.2 , Section 12.1.5and appendix B.

A review of the SNAC results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924), edition 725or any updates hereof. 3.1.5 Clinical data for oral semaglutide A comprehensive clinical pharmacology programme including 12 trials has been completed, as well as a 26-week phase 2 dose-finding trial involving more than 600 subjects with T2DM. For details on the individual trials, please see the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924) edition 725, or any updates hereof. 3.1.5.1 Pharmacokinetics In the multiple-dose trial (NN9924-3991), oral semaglutide has demonstrated a long mean terminal half-life (t½) ranging from 153 to 161 hours (~1 week) and a median time to reach maximum observed concentration (tmax) ranging from 1 to 2 hours in healthy subjects. In multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) trials, the exposure to oral semaglutide increased with increasing dose. Overall, the pharmacokinetic properties of semaglutide appeared similar in healthy subjects and in subjects with T2DM. Exposure to semaglutide exhibits a substantially greater dose-to-dose variation following oral administration compared to subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. However, when administered orally once-daily the PK properties of semaglutide, i.e. low clearance and long half-life, will limit the variation in exposure at steady state. Data obtained following investigation of different dosing conditions for oral semaglutide have demonstrated that subjects should take the oral semaglutide tablet in the morning in a fasting state and at least 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.

All tablets of oral semaglutide contain 300 mg of SNAC regardless of the semaglutide dose. SNAC is rapidly absorbed with a median tmax ranging from 0.35 −0.5 hours in healthy subjects and from 0.52−1.43 hours in subjects with T2DM. It is extensively metabolised and no accumulation of SNAC has been observed in clinical trials. 3.1.5.2 Efficacy The efficacy of oral semaglutide in adult subjects with T2DM was investigated in a 26-week phase 2 dose-finding trial (NN9924-3790). In this trial, placebo or one of the following doses of oral semaglutide were administered once daily: 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg. Results from the trial showed that oral semaglutide effectively lowered glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) and body weight. Placebo-adjusted reductions in HbA 1cwere dose-dependent and statistically significant for all oral semaglutide tr eatment arms at week 26 (range: -0.40% to -1.59%). Placebo-adjusted reductions in body weight were dose-dependent and statistically significant for oral semaglutide treatment doses of 10 mg and above at week 26 (range: -3.61 kg to -6.98 kg). 3.1.5.3 Safety In the clinical trials completed so far, no unexpected safety findings have been identified for oral semaglutide administered up to 40 mg once daily. Consistent with other GLP-1 RAs, commonly reported AEs included nausea and vomiting, most of which were mild to moderate in severity. In line with findings for other GLP-1 RAs, an increase in heart rate and serum levels of lipase and amylase has also been observed in subjects exposed to oral semaglutide. In addition to the 13 completed clinical trials with oral semaglutide, SNAC has been investigated in the programme of orally administrated heparin in combination with SNAC (heparin/SNAC). The heparin/SNAC programme ( ) included 29 phase 1 trials (SNAC doses ranged from 0.172-10.5 g). In three of these trials, SNAC alone was investigated (to a maximum dose of 10.5 g). The trials covered formulation development, food effect, hepatic and renal impairment, age-effect and drug-drug interaction. The programme also included a total of three phase 2 and 3 trials in which the effects of orally delivered heparin solution (with >1.5 g SNAC three times a day) was investigated. The overall safety profile of oral semaglutide and heparin/SNAC indicates that SNAC is safe and well-tolerated.CONFIDENTIAL"

Dulaglutide has been approved in Japan since 2015 for use as once-weekly s.c. injection for treatment of T2DM. Dulaglutide belongs to the same class of drugs as semaglutide and as such they share many of the same efficacy and safety characteristics. As dulaglutide is a marketed drug its characteristics are described in the EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC)26and the local prescribing information27. 3.2 Rationale for the trial Many patients with T2DM are not in glycaemic control with the currently marketed OADs. Nevertheless, treatment with more efficacious injectable therapies such as GLP-1 RAs and insulin are rarely added during the early stages of the disease. Oral semaglutide is the first GLP-1 RA in development in a tablet formulation and it has the potential of becoming a new attractive treatment option early in the treatment cascade due to its effects on both hyperglycaemia and body weight. The “Draft Guideline for Clinical Evaluation of Oral Hypoglycaemic Agents”28(hearafter, draft AD guideline) provided by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), Japan, specifies that in order to obtain the indication “T2DM” long-term safety and efficacy of an investigational drug should be evaluated in combination with any approved OAD that is supposed to be used in combination with the investigational drug in clinical practice in a sufficient number of Japanese patients. This trial will evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of oral semaglutide in combination with each one of the already approved OADs (SU, glinide, TZD, α-GI and SGLT-2 inhibitor) in Japanese subjects with T2DM.

The number of subjects has been set based on the agreement with PMDA for the long-term safety evaluation as combination therapy with OADs based on the draft AD guideline. The parallel treatment groups and a randomised design have been chosen to assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing of oral semaglutide (3, 7 and 14 mg) compared to once-weekly dosing of 0.75 mg dulaglutide subcutaneously, both in combination with one OAD (either of SU, glinide, TZD, α-GI or SGLT-2 inhibitor). An open label design (between the oral semaglutide arms and the dulaglutide arm) has been chosen in accordance with the draft AD guideline as it clearly states the trial design of long-term combination trial (except for insulin combination) is open-labelled. Randomisation will be stratified based on the type of background OAD medication (SU/glinide/TZD/ α-GI/SGLT-2 inhibitor) to ensure a 2:2:2:1 distribution of the 4 treatment arms (see Section 5.1) within each stratum. There will be strict rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial for all treatment arms. The treatment duration of 52 weeks have been chosen according to the draft AD guideline and is considered adequate for the purpose of the trial. The follow-up period is 5 weeks to allow for wash-out of semaglutide. 5.3 Treatment of subjects Treatment of subjects is summarised in Table 5–1 . Oral semaglutide treatment arms Oral semaglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 RA to be administered orally once-daily. All subjects randomised to oral semaglutide will initiate treatment with 3 mg once-daily. Subjects randomised to a treatment dose of 7 and 14 mg, will follow a fixed dose escalation regimen with 4 weeks between the dose escalation steps. The maintenance dose of 7 mg once-daily will be reached after 4 weeks on 3 mg once daily. The maintenance dose of 14 mg once-daily will be reached after 4 weeks on 3 mg, followed by 4 weeks on 7 mg once daily ( Table 5–1 ). All dose levels, including the dose- escalation, will be blinded. To mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs, it is important to follow the fixed 4-week dose escalation intervals.

The tablet can be taken with up to half a glass of water (approximately 120 mL). The tablet must be swallowed whole by the subject and must not be broken or chewed (see Table 9– 2). Furthermore, other oral medication can be taken 30 minutes after administration of the oral trial product. Dulaglutide dosing The administration of dulaglutide should be in accordance with the current approved label26,27. Dulaglutide should be administered once-weekly, on the same day of the week and it can be given at any time of day independent of meals. Dulaglutide is injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. When administered in the same region, the injection site should be changed by every injection.CONFIDENTIAL"

The background OAD medication must be maintained at the stable, pre-trial dose and at the same frequency during the whole treatment period unless rescue medication is needed (see Section 6.4) or a safety concern related to the background medication arises, e.g. if the subject has unacceptable hypoglycaemia on a background of SU in which case the dose of SU can be reduced. The type of the background OAD medication must not be changed during the trial. In addition, all background medication: !is considered to be non-investigational medicinal product (NIMP) !will not be provided by Novo Nordisk. !should be used in accordance with standard of care and current approved label in Japan !should not exceed the maximum approved dose in Japan 5.4 Treatment after discontinuation of trial product When discontinuing trial products, either at the scheduled end of treatment visit (see Section 8.1.5 ) or if trial product is discontinued prematurely (see Section 8.1.6 ), the subject should be switched to a suitable marketed product at the discretion of the investigator while taking into consideration the long half-life of semaglutide. Throughout the protocol, last date on trial product is defined as date of the subject’s last dosage of trial product. As this trial is a phase 3a trial, oral semaglutide will not be available for prescription until after marketing authorisation. 5.5 Rationale for treatment For phase 3 development of oral semaglutide, the three dose levels (3, 7 and 14 mg), treatment initiation with the lowest dose and the 4-week dose escalation steps have been chosen based on data from the global phase 2 dose-finding trial (NN9924-3790). This regimen is expected to have the optimal benefit-risk profile for further development for treatment of T2DM in the PIONEER programme. Dulaglutide has been chosen as active comparator since it is an important comparator within the same drug-class as semaglutide. Treatment with dulaglutide injection will be in accordance with the current approved label26,27. The duration of randomised treatments is considered adequate to collect sufficient data on safety and efficacy in accordance with the trial objectives.CONFIDENTIAL"

History or presence of malignant neoplasms within the last 5 years (except basal and squamous cell skin cancer and in situ carcinomas). 19. History of diabetic ketoacidosis. 6.4 Rescue criteria Subjects with persistent and unacceptable hyperglycaemia should be offered treatment intensification. To allow time for dose escalation to maximum dose and to observe the expected effect of treatment on glycaemic parameters, rescue criteria will be applied from week 8 and onwards. If any of the FPG values (including fasting SMPG) exceed the limits outlined below and no intercurrent cause of the hyperglycaemia can be identified, a confirmatory FPG (at central laboratory) should be obtained by calling the subject for a re-test. If the confirmatory FPG also exceeds the value described below, the subject should be offered rescue medication. In this trial, rescue medication means intensification of existing background OAD medication and/or initiation of new anti-diabetic medication: !14.4 mmol/L (260 mg/dL) from week 8 to end of week 13 !13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) from week 14 to end of week 25 !11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) from week 26 to end of treatment In addition, subject should be offered rescue medication if: !HbA 1c (at central laboratory) > 8.5% (69.4 mmol/mol) from week 26 to end of treatment CONFIDENTIAL"

Subjects that are started on rescue medication should continue to follow the protocol-specified visit schedule. Rescue medication should be prescribed at investigator’s discretion as add-on to randomised treatment and according to clinical practice in Japan or ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines29,30(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). Rescue medication and any changes hereto should be captured on the concomitant medication form in the electronic case report form (eCRF), see Section 8.2.4 . Rescue medication is considered NIMP and will not be provided by Novo Nordisk A/S. 6.5 Criteria for premature discontinuation of trial product All efforts should be made to keep the subject on trial product. However, the subject may be prematurely discontinued from trial product at the discretion of the investigator due to a safety concern. For additional guidance, refer to appendix B. The subject must be prematurely discontinued from trial product, if the following applies: 1. Safety concern related to trial product or unacceptable intolerability 2. Included in the trial in violation of the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria 3. Pregnancy 4. Intention of becoming pregnant 5. Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial of an approved or non-approved IMP 6. Calcitonin ≥ 100 ng/L If a criterion for premature discontinuation of trial product is met, trial product should not be re- initiated but subjects should continue with the scheduled site contacts. See Section 8.1.6 for procedures to be performed for subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely. 6.6 Withdrawal from trial The subject may withdraw consent at will at any time. The subject’s request to withdraw from the trial must always be respected. Only subjects who withdraw consent should be considered as withdrawn from trial. See Section 8.1.7 for procedures to be performed for subjects withdrawing consent. 6.7 Subject replacement Subjects who withdraw consent or discontinue trial product prematurely will not be replaced.

The HbA 1climits 7.0%–10.5% (53–91 mmol/mol) have been chosen to include subjects needing intensification of anti-diabetic medication. The upper limit will secure that subjects with severely dysregulated T2DM are not enrolled in the trial. In addition, FPG and HbA 1c will be monitored throughout the trial and rescue medication may be initiated in subjects with persistent, unacceptable hyperglycaemia. No BMI or blood pressure restrictions will be applied. Subjects with liver test abnormalities (ALT>2.5 x UNL) will be excluded to avoid potential confounding of liver safety assessments. In addition, subjects with severe or end-stage renal impairment will be excluded due to restrictions in the SmPC of dulaglutide 26which is comparator in this trial, and the label of SGLT-2 inhibitors that are one of the allowed background OAD medications. As SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis, subjects with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis will also be excluded from this trial. Overall, the eligibility criteria allow for enrolment of a relatively broad trial population resembling the target population in common practice. Finally, the trial population was selected on the basis of the “draft AD guideline”28and the advice from the PMDA.CONFIDENTIAL"

These are also included in the flow chart (see Section 2). Informed consent must be obtained before any trial related activity, see Section 18.2. Refer to flowchart (Section 2) for number and timing of visits and specific assessments to be performed. Each subject will attend 12 site visits and 2 phone contacts. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all site visits and phone contacts occur according to the flow chart. Planned visits can be conducted and re-scheduled within the allowed visit window. If a visit is missed and it is not possible to re-schedule, every effort should be made to ensure information is collected at a telephone contact (within the visit window) and entered into the eCRF. Subjects will be invited for the next scheduled visit according to the visit schedule. The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. Only subjects who have signed the informed consent form should be included on the logs. The subject screening log and subject enrolment log may be combined in one log. The investigator must keep a log of staff and a delegation of task(s) list at site. Investigator must sign the log of staff and the delegation of task(s) at site prior to the delegation of tasks. 8.1.1 Screening (visit 1) At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address(es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to return the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. A screening session must be made in the IWRS. Each subject will be assigned a unique 6-digit subject number which will remain the same throughout the trial. Once all data relating to visit 1 have been obtained, these must be reviewed, dated and signed by the investigator and/or documented in medical records to assess that the subject is eligible to continue in the trial.CONFIDENTIAL"

Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed by the investigator into the eCRF. Follow-up on SAEs must be carried out according to Section 12. A screening failure session must be made in the IWRS. The case book must be signed. Re-screening is NOT allowed if the subject has failed one of the inclusion or exclusion criteria; this includes re-sampling if the subject has failed one of the inclusion or exclusion criteria related to laboratory parameters. However, in case laboratory samples are lost (e.g. haemolysed/displaced), re-sampling is allowed. 8.1.2 Fasting visits The subjects must attend several visits in a fasting state (see Section 2). Fasting for blood sampling is defined as no food or liquid within the last 8 hours prior to blood sampling, however water is allowed up until 2 hours prior to blood sampling. For the subjects allocated to oral semaglutide, trial product must be taken after blood sampling (see Section 5.3.1 for dosing instructions). Other oral medication can be taken 30 minutes after trial product. Injectable medications can be administered after blood sampling. For the subjects allocated to dulaglutide, if the day of fasting visit falls on the day of his/her dulaglutide dosing, the trial product and/or other oral and injectable medications must be taken after the blood sampling has been performed. In case a subject attends a fasting visit in a non-fasting state, all non-fasting measurements should be performed. The subject should return to the site in a fasting state to have the fasting blood samples done within the visit window for the relevant visit. For fasting samples, see Section 8.3.1 . 8.1.3 Randomisation and trial product administration (visit 2) Eligible subjects will be randomised into one of 4 treatment arms. The randomisation session must be performed in the IWRS which will allocate the dispensing unit number (DUN) of trial product to be dispensed to the subject. All visit 2 assessments must be performed before administration of first dose of trial product. Trial products (see Section 9) will be dispensed to the subject by the site, hospital pharmacy or equivalent at each site visit during the trial from randomisation to last visit before the End-of-CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator must document that subjects are trained in the dosing instructions at every dispensing visit, please see Section 5.3.1 . Date of first administration of trial product will be captured in the eCRF. 8.1.4 Phone contacts The planned phone contacts 3 and 5 should be conducted 2 and 6 weeks (±3 days) after randomisation respectively (see Section 2). 8.1.5 End-of-treatment (visit 13) and Follow-up (visit 14) Subjects, who stay on trial product throughout the trial, must attend the End-of-treatment visit (visit 13) 52 weeks after randomisation (±3 days visit window) and the Follow-up visit (visit 14) 5 weeks after the last date on trial product (+3 days visit window). A completion call must be performed in the IWRS after completion of visit 13 (see Section 10). In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled visit 14, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians and medical records to collect health status. If no health status can be collected, the subject should be considered lost to follow up and this should be specified in the end-of-trial form. 8.1.6 Premature discontinuation of trial product and follow-up (visits 13A and 14A) Subjects, who discontinue trial product prematurely, should attend visit 13A scheduled to take place on the day of discontinuation of trial product (+3 days visit window). Visit 14A should be scheduled 5 weeks (+3 days visit window) after the last date on trial product. The primary reason for premature discontinuation of trial product must be specified in the end-of-trial form in the eCRF, and final drug accountability must be performed. A treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS at visit 13A (see Section 10). If premature discontinuation of trial product is decided during a scheduled visit, the visit will be converted into a visit 13A and trial procedures must be performed accordingly. Subjects should continue with the originally scheduled site contacts after visit 14A and up to and including visit 13. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after visit 14A. However, if a subject is unable or unwilling to attend all subsequent visit(s), the investigator should at least aim to have the subject attend the scheduled visit 9 (week 26) and visit 13 (week 52) as these visits should be performed for all subjects, if at all possible (except subjects who withdraw informed consent, see Section 8.1.7 ). Subjects, who only agree to attend or provide health status at the planned visit 13, should not be considered withdrawn from the trial. In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled visit 13, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. CONFIDENTIAL"

If no health status can be collected, the subject should be considered lost to follow-up and this should be specified in the end-of-trial form. In summary, subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule, missing assessments or trial product discontinuation for any reason. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial should be considered as withdrawn from the trial (for withdrawal procedures, see Section 8.1.7 ). 8.1.7 Withdrawals If a subject considers withdrawing from the trial, the investigator must aim to undertake procedures for visit 13A as soon as possible and visit 14A should be scheduled 5 weeks (+3 days visit window) after the last date on trial product, if the subject agrees to it. The end-of-trial form must be completed and final drug accountability must be performed even if the subject is not able to come to the trial site. A treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS (see Section 10). The case book must be signed. Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing consent, the investigator must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject’s rights. Where the reasons are obtained, the primary reason for withdrawing consent must be specified in the end-of-trial form in the eCRF. 8.1.8 Investigator assessments Review of diaries, PROs, laboratory reports, ECGs and fundus photography/dilated fundoscopy must be documented either on the documents or in the subject’s medical record. If clarification of entries or discrepancies in the diary or PROs is needed, the subject must be questioned and a conclusion made in the subject’s medical record. Care must be taken not to bias the subject. The documents must be retained at the site as source documentation. For ECGs, physical examinations and eye examinations, the evaluations must follow the categories: !Normal !Abnormal – Was the result clinically significant?

The subjects will be instructed in how to use the device, and the instruction will be repeated as necessary during the trial. In case a hypoglycaemic episode is suspected, the provided BG meter should be used for SMPG measurement. The BG meters use test strips calibrated to plasma values. Therefore, all measurements performed with capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values, which will be shown on the display. Only the BG meters provided by Novo Nordisk or the same model purchased by the trial site should be used for the measurements required in the protocol. Subjects should be instructed in how to record the results of the SMPG values in the diaries. The record of each SMPG value should include date, time and value. All data from the diary must be transcribed into the eCRF during or following the contact. If obtained via phone and a discrepancy is later detected between the diary and the SMPG data obtained at the phone contact, the values in the eCRF must be corrected. Occasional review by the investigator of the values stored in the memory of the BG meter and correct reporting of these in the diary is advised in order to ensure adequacy of the data reported in the trial database. 7-point self-measured plasma glucose profile The subject will be instructed to perform a 7-point SMPG profile 3 times during the trial period (see Section 2) using the BG meter provided for the trial. The 7-point SMPG profile should be performed on a day where the subject does not anticipate unusual strenuous exercise. The 7-point SMPG profile should preferably be taken within a week prior to the visit. The record of each SMPG measurement should include the following seven time points: !before breakfast !90 minutes after start of breakfast !before lunch !90 minutes after start of lunch !before dinner !90 minutes after start of dinner !at bedtimeCONFIDENTIAL"

The body weight should be assessed on the same calibrated weighing scale equipment throughout the trial, if possible. Height is measured without shoes in centimetres and recorded in the eCRF to nearest ½ cm. 8.3.4 Waist circumference The waist circumference is defined as the minimal abdominal circumference located midway between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. The measurement of waist circumference must be performed and recorded in the eCRF. Waist circumference is measured in the horizontal plane and rounded up or down to the nearest ½ cm using a non-stretchable measuring tape. The same measuring tape should be used throughout the trial. The circumference should be measured when the subject is in a standing position, with an empty bladder and wearing light clothing. The subject should be standing, feet together with arms down their side and waist accessible. The tape should touch the skin but not compress soft tissue and twists in the tape should be avoided. The subject should be asked to breathe normally and the measurement should be taken when the subject is breathing out gently. 8.3.5 Patient reported outcomes questionnaires PRO will be assessed using the questionnaires: !SF-36v2™ (acute version) health survey36,37,38 !Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL (DTR-QOL) questionnaire39 The questionnaires must be completed by the subject as specified in the flow chart, see Section 2, preferably before any other trial-related activities for that visit. It takes approximately 15 minutes to complete the two questionnaires. Subjects should be given the opportunity to complete the questionnaires by themselves without interruption. The completed questionnaires must be reviewed for potential adverse events and missing data while the subject is still at the site. All results from the questionnaires must be transferred into the eCRF. SF-36 acute version SF-36v2™ is a commonly used instrument to evaluate PROs, also in the T2DM area. SF-36v2™ acute version measures the individual overall health related quality of life on 8 domains; Physical functioning, Role physical, Bodily pain, General health, Vitality, Social functioning, Role emotional and Mental health. The acute version’s questions are based on a recall period of one week. SF-36v2™ contains 36 items.CONFIDENTIAL"

Investigator should instruct the subject to contact the site in case the pregnancy test is positive. At visit 2, females of childbearing potential will be provided with urine dip-sticks for pregnancy test at home. 8.4.8 Hypoglycaemic episodes Plasma glucose (PG) should always be measured and recorded when a hypoglycaemic episode is suspected. All PG values: !≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or !> 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) occurring in conjunction with hypoglycaemic symptoms should be reported in the diary according to the instructions below throughout the trial from visit 1 to end of trial. Upon onset of a hypoglycaemic epis ode the subject is recommended to measure PG every 15 minutes until the SMPG value is > 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved in accordance to current guidelines41. A SMPG value ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or hypoglycaemic symptoms must trigger a hypoglycaemic episode form to be completed by the subject. Repeated SMPG measurements and/or symptoms will per default be considered as one hypoglycaemic epis ode until a succeeding SMPG value is > 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved.

A randomisation session will be carried out for all subjects using the IWRS. At the randomisation visit (visit 2), subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomised to one of four parallel treatment arms as described in Section 5.1. Randomisation will be stratified by background OAD medication with the following levels: !SU !glinide !TZD !α-GI !SGLT-2 inhibitor to ensure a 2:2:2:1 distribution of the four treatment arms (see Section 5.1) within strata. The aim is to randomise a minimum of 455 Japanese subjects, i.e. 147 subjects in the strata of SU monotherapy and 77 subjects in the strata of each of the remaining OAD monotherapy (glinide, TZD, α-GI and SGLT-2 inhibitor). 11.1 Breaking of blinded codes Since the trial is partly double-blinded with regard to three dose levels of semaglutide, the blinded codes may possibly be broken for the subjects allocated to oral semaglutide arms. The IWRS will notify Novo Nordisk (monitor and the Global Safety department) immediately after the code is broken. The code for a particular subject allocated to oral semaglutide arm may be broken in a medical emergency if knowing the actual dose level would influence the treatment of the subject. Whenever a code is broken the person breaking the code must print the Code Break Confirmation Notification generated by the IWRS, record the reason, and sign and date the document. When the code is broken, the dose level allocation will be accessible to the investigator and the Novo Nordisk Global Safety department. If the IWRS is not accessible at the time of code break the IWRS helpdesk should be contacted. Contact details are listed in Attachment I.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. An AE includes: !A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. !A clinical laboratory adverse event (CLAE): a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. The following should notbe reported as AEs: !Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product (pre-existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). !Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. !Non-serious hypoglycaemia is an AE, but is reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form instead of on an AE form, see Section 8.4.8 . The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: !Severity –Mild – no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject's daily activities. –Moderate – marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject's daily activities. –Severe – considerable interference with the subject's daily activities; unacceptable. !Causality Relationship between an AE and the relevant trial product(s): –Probable – Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. –Possible – A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. –Unlikely – The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product.CONFIDENTIAL"

This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. –Recovered/resolved with sequelae – The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. –Not recovered/not resolved – The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. –Fatal – This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should beassessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. –Unknown – This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. 12.1.2 Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: !Death. !A life-threatening aexperience. !In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. !A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. !A congenital anomaly or birth defect. !Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be considered an SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. a. The term “life threatening” in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. b. The term “hospitalisation” is used when a subject: oIs admitted to a hospital or in-patient, irrespective of the duration of physical stay, or oStays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hours Medical judgement must always be exercised, and when in doubt, the hospital contact should be regarded as a hospitalisation.

Hospital admissions for surgical procedures, planned before trial inclusion, are not considered AEs or SAEs. c. A substantial disruption of a subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions (e.g. following the event or clinical investigation the subject has significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in his/her body function or structure, physical activity and/or quality of life). d. For example intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home of allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The following adverse events must always be reported as an SAE using the important medical event criterion if no other seriousness criteria are applicable: !suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the trial product !risk of liver injury defined as ALT or AST >3 x UNL and total bilirubin >2 x UNL, where no alternative aetiology exists (Hy's law). Additional assessments should be made for events meeting the criterion of Hy’s law as stated above (see appendix B) . 12.1.3 Non-serious adverse event A non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE. 12.1.4 Medication errors A medication error concerning trial products is defined as: !Administration of wrong drug or use of wrong device. Note: Use of wrong DUN is not considered a medication error unless it results in administration of wrong drug. !Wrong route of administration, such as intramuscular instead of s.c. !Administration of an overdose with the intention to cause harm (e.g. suicide attempt), misuse or abuse of trial product. !Accidental administration of a higher dose than intended. A higher dose of semaglutide is a dose of at least one tablet more than the intended dose, and for dulaglutide a higher dose than 0.75 mg/day; however, the administered dose must deviate from the intended dose to an extent where clinical consequences for the trial subject were likely to happen as judged by the investigator, although they did not necessarily occur.

The technical complaint may be associated with an AE, but does not concern the AE itself. Examples of technical complaints: !The physical or chemical appearance of trial products (e.g. discoloration, particles or contamination) !All packaging material including labelling !Problems related to devices (e.g. to the injection mechanism, dose setting mechanism or push button) 12.2 Reporting of adverse events All events meeting the definition of an AE must be collected and reported. This includes events occurring from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent until the end of the post-treatment follow-up period (visit 14) for subjects on trial product OR until the end of trial (visit 13 or 14A, whichever comes last) for the subjects who have discontinued trial product prematurely. Events for withdrawn subjects will be collected and reported until last trial related contact with the subject. The events must be recorded in the applicable eCRF forms in a timely manner, see timelines below and Figure 12–1. During each contact with the trial site staff, the subject must be asked about AEs and technical complaints, for example by asking: ""Have you experienced any problems since the last contact?"" All AEs, either observed by the investigator or subject, must be reported by the investigator and evaluated. All AEs must be recorded by the investigator in the eCRF AE form. The investigator should report the diagnosis, if available. If no diagnosis is available, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs using separate AE forms in the eCRF. For SAEs, a safety information form (SIF) must be completed in addition to the AE form. A SIF is a form to collect supplementary clinical information. If several symptoms or diagnoses occur as part of the same clinical picture, one SIF can be used to describe all the SAEs. AEs requiring additional data collection must be reported using both the AE form and the specific event form. A specific event form is a form tailored to collect specific information related to the individual event. See appendix B for details about the events and the additional information to report. In case any of these events fulfil the criteria for seriousness in Section 12.1.2, then the event should be reported as serious.CONFIDENTIAL"

Novo Nordisk may need to report this AE to relevant regulatory authorities. 12.3 Follow-up of adverse events The investigator must record follow-up information by updating the medical records and the forms in the eCRF. Follow-up information must be reported to Novo Nordisk according to the following: !SAEs: All SAEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovered/resolved”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “fatal”, and until all queries have been resolved. Cases ofchronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved”. Casescan be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow-up period and is expected by the investigator to recover. The SAE follow-up information should only include new (e.g. corrections or additional) information and must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s first knowledge of the information. This is also the case for previously non-serious AEs which subsequently become SAEs. !Non-serious AEs: Non-serious AEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved” or “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or until theend of the follow-up period stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved”. Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow-up period and is expected by the investigator to recover. !Events for adjudication: If new information becomes available for events in scope of adjudication, this must be uploaded to the adjudication database in order for the EAC to evaluate if re-adjudication is needed. The investigator must ensure that the recording of the worst case severity and seriousness of an event is kept throughout the trial. A worsening of an unresolved AE must be reported as follow up with re-assessment of severity and/or seriousness of the event.CONFIDENTIAL"

Treatment of an overdose should be symptomatic. There is a potential risk of hypoglycaemia during dosing with semaglutide. The typical signs and symptoms of a non-severe hypoglycaemia include: hunger, slight headache, nausea, light- headedness, palpitations and sweating. Symptoms of non-severe hypoglyc aemia should be treated by ingestion of carbohydrates. Severe hypoglycaemia resulting in loss of consciousness should be treated according to best available medical practise. One case of accidental overdose of oral semaglutide was reported in the NN9924-3692 trial. The subject accidentally took the trial product day and was thus treated with 20 mg of oral semaglutide. The subject did not report any symptoms and treatment was continued without any change. CONFIDENTIAL"

The oral semaglutide safety committee may recommend unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an independent ad hoc group will be established in order to maintain the blinding of the trial personnel. 12.7.2 Event adjudication committee An independent external EAC is established to perform validation of selected AEs according to pre- defined diagnostic criteria. The validation is based on review of pre-defined clinical data related to the specific AE. Pre-defined clinical data consist of copies of source documents collected and delivered by the investigational sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The events are reviewed by the EAC in a blinded manner. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact on trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The EAC works in accordance with written guidelines included in the EAC Charter describing in details the composition, tasks, responsibilities and work processes of the committee. The events outlined in Table 12–2 have been selected for adjudication in order to obtain an external independent validation of the diagnosis. In addition, cardiovascular events are being adjudicated according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements46.

The following will be provided as paper case report forms (CRF): !Pregnancy forms The following will be provided as paper CRFs to be used when access to the eCRF is revoked or if the eCRF is unavailable: !AE forms !SIFs !Technical complaint forms (also to be used to report complaints that are not subject related [e.g. discovered at trial site before allocation]). On the paper CRF forms print legibly, using a ballpoint pen. Ensure that all questions are answered and that no empty data blocks exist. Ensure that no information is recorded outside the data blocks. If a test/assessment has not been done and will not be available, indicate this by writing ""ND"" (not done) in the appropriate answer field in the CRF. If the question is irrelevant (e.g. is not applicable) indicate this by writing ""NA"" (not applicable) in the appropriate answer field. Further guidance can be obtained from the instructions in the CRF. The investigator must ensure that all information is consistent with the source documentation. By electronically signing the case book in the eCRF, the investigator confirms that the information in the eCRF and related forms is complete and correct. 13.1 Corrections to case report forms Corrections to the eCRF data may be made by the investigator or the investigator's delegated staff. An audit trail will be maintained in the eCRF application containing as a minimum: the old and the new data, identification of the person entering the data, date and time of the entry and reason for the correction.

The first monitoring visit will be performed as soon as possible after FSFV at the trial site and no later than 4 weeks after. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the eCRFs, the trial site's recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site to the protocol and GCP, but will not exceed 12 weeks until LSLV at the trial site (for trial sites with active subjects [defined as subjects in screening, treatment or follow-up]). The monitor must be given direct access to all source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition the relevant trial site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. by telephone). All data must be verifiable in source documentation other than the eCRF. For all data recorded the source document must be defined in a source document agreement at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any time for any data element. Source data generated by the trial site can be corrected by another person than the person entering the source data; any correction must be explained, signed and dated by the person making the correction. The original of the completed diaries and/or PROs must not be removed from the trial site, unless they form part of the eCRF and a copy is kept at the site. The monitor will ensure that the eCRFs are completed and that paper CRFs are collected. The following data will be source data verified for screening failures: !Date for obtaining informed consent. !Reason for screening failure Monitors will review the subject's medical records and other source data (e.g. the diaries and PROs) to ensure consistency and/or identify omissions compared to the eCRF. If discrepancies are found, the investigator must be questioned about these. A follow-up letter (paper or electronic) will be sent to the investigator following each monitoring visit. This should address any action to be taken.CONFIDENTIAL"

The SAP will be finalised before database lock. The blinding of the randomised dose level for semaglutide arms will be maintained until the database has been released for statistical analysis. No interim analyses will be performed before the database is locked. Data from all sites will be analysed and reported together. In statistical analyses where stratification is included, the background OAD medication at screening (SU, glinide, TZD, α-GI or SGLT-2 inhibitor) will be included based on the actual information collected through the eCRF. In case of missing eCRF information the information collected from the IWRS system will be used. In the statistical analyses the stratification factor will refer to background OAD medication at screening. The latest available measurement, at or prior to the randomisation visit, will be used as the baseline measurement. If no measurement(s) have been obtained, at or prior to randomisation, the baseline value will be left missing. Laboratory values below the lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) will be set to ½LLoQ. Number of values below LLoQ by treatment and visit will be summarised if deemed relevant. Results from a statistical analysis will as a minimum be presented by the estimated treatment contrasts for the below three comparisons with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals and p-values corresponding to two-sided tests of no difference with no multiplicity adjustments: !oral semaglutide 14 mg vs. dulaglutide 0.75 mg !oral semaglutide 7 mg vs. dulaglutide 0.75 mg !oral semaglutide 3 mg vs. dulaglutide 0.75 mg If no statistical analysis is specified, data will be presented using relevant summary statistics.

Generalisation of this estimand depends among other things on the extent to which the use of rescue medication in this trial reflects clinical practice and the treatment adherence reflects the behaviour of the target population. Accordingly, data collected regardless of discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication(s) will be used to draw inference. !Secondary estimand ode-jure treatment difference (oral semaglutide versus dulaglutide) at week 26 for all randomised subjects if all subjects adhered to treatment and did not initiate rescue medication The secondary de-jure estimand assesses the glycaemic benefit a future subject is expected to achieve if initiating and continuing treatment with oral semaglutide. It is considered a clinically relevant estimand as it provides information to treating clinicians about the expected glycaemic efficacy of oral semaglutide for purposes of treating individual subjects. Generalisation of this estimand depends among other things on the extent to which the adherence to trial product administration in this trial reflects the behaviour of the target population. Accordingly, only data collected prior to discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication will be used to draw inference. This will avoid confounding from rescue medication. Missing data consideration Based on the results from similar Japanese phase 3 trials investigating liraglutide and s.c. semaglutide in combination with one OAD (NN2211-3924 and NN9535-4091) and the oral semaglutide phase 2 trial (NN9924-3790), it is expected that maximum 20% of the subjects will discontinue trial product or withdrawal from the trial at week 52. The primary efficacy results will be evaluated at week 26. This approach will result in a lower proportion of missing data, use of rescue medication and premature treatment discontinuation, compared to the expected proportion at week 52. For the primary estimand, data collected regardless of discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication(s) will be used to draw inference, missing data will therefore mainly be due to withdrawal from trial or lost to follow-CONFIDENTIAL"

When estimating the secondary estimand, the proportion of missing data is expected to be higher compared to the primary estimand, since data collected after discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication(s) will be set to missing as well. Descriptive summaries and graphical representation of extent, reason(s) for and pattern of missing data will be presented by treatment arm. 17.1 Sample size calculation The sample size of this trial was determined based on a requirement of the draft AD guideline28. A total of 455 subjects will be randomised in a 2:2:2:1 manner to receive either a dose of 3, 7 or 14 mg of oral semaglutide or of 0.75 mg dulaglutide. Randomisation will be stratified by background OAD medication at screening (SU, glinide, TZD, α-GI or SGLT-2 inhibitor) with the additional requirement of 147 subjects on SU and 77 subjects on each of the other four background OAD medications. It is expected that maximum 20% of the subjects will discontinue trial product or withdrawal from the trial at week 52. Therefore, at least 100 completers in combination with SU and 50 completers in combination with each of other OAD monotherapies (glinide, TZD, α-GI or SGLT-2 inhibitor) on oral semaglutide (3, 7 or 14 mg) are expected. 17.2 Definition of analysis sets The following analysis sets will be defined: Full analysis set (FAS): Includes all randomised subjects. Subjects in the FAS will contribute to the evaluation “as randomised”. Safety analysis set (SAS): Includes all subjects exposed to at least one dose of trial product. Subjects in the SAS will contribute to the evaluation based on the trial product received for the majority of the period where they were on treatment. This will be referred to as contributing to the evaluation “as treated”. Data selections and observation periods Unless subjects withdraw their informed consent, data collection will continue for the full duration of the trial. The full duration of the trial is defined as up to and including: !the follow-up visit (V14) for subjects on trial product !the latest occurring visit of the end-of-treatment visit (V13) or the follow-up premature discontinuation visit (V14A), for subjects who have discontinued trial product prematurely Subjects and data to be used in an analysis will be selected in a two-step manner: !Firstly, subjects will be selected based on the specified analysis set !Secondly, data points on the selected subjects from first step will be selected based on the specified observation periodCONFIDENTIAL"

The in-trial observation period starts at randomisation (as registered in IWRS) and ends at the date of: !the last direct subject-site contact, which is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after planned last dose of trial product at a follow-up visit !withdrawal for subjects who withdraw their informed consent !the last subject-investigator contact as defined by the investigator for subjects who are lost to follow-up !death for subjects who dies before any of the above On-treatment: This observation period represents the time period where subjects are considered treated with trial product. The observation period is a subset of the in-trial observation period. It starts at the date of first dose of trial product. Two slightly different end dates will be needed to cover all assessments appropriately. For adjudicated events, ECGs and AEs including hypoglycaemic episodes, the observation period ends at the first date of any of the following: !the follow-up visit (V14) !the follow-up prematurely discontinuation visit (V14A) !the last date on trial product + 38 days !the end-date for the in-trial observation period The follow-up visit is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after the last date on trial product corresponding to approximately five half-lives of oral semaglutide. The visit window for the follow- up visit is +3 days. For efficacy and other safety assessments (laboratory assessments, physical examination and vital signs) the observation period ends at the last date on trial product +3 days. This will be used in order to ensure specificity to reversible effects of treatment. On-treatment without rescue: This observation period is a subset of the on-treatment observation period, where subjects are considered treated with trial product, but have not initiated any rescue medications. Specifically it starts at date of first dose of trial product and the observation period ends at the first date of: !the last dose of trial product + 3 days !initiation of rescue medication The in-trial observation period will be the primary observation period for estimating the primary estimand. The on-treatment without rescue medication observation period will be the primary observation period when estimating the secondary estimand. The on-treatment observation period will be considered supportive for evaluating efficacy. Safety will be evaluated based on the in-trial and the on-treatment observation periods.CONFIDENTIAL"

Baseline data will always be included in an observation period. For adjudicated events, the onset date will be the EAC adjudicated onset date. Before data are locked for statistical analysis and the randomisation code is broken, a review of all data will take place. Any decision to exclude either a subject or single observations from the statistical analysis is the joint responsibility of the members of the Novo Nordisk study group. Exclusion of data from analyses should be used restrictively, and normally no data should be excluded from the FAS. The subjects or observations to be excluded, and the reasons for their exclusion must be documented and signed by those responsible before database lock. The subjects and observations excluded from analysis sets, and the reason for this, will be described in the clinical trial report. 17.3 Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is number of TEAEs during exposure to trial product, assessed up to approximately 57 weeks All AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding. A treatment-emergent AE is defined as an AE with onset in the on-treatment observation period (see definition of observation periods in Section 17.2). The evaluation will be based on SAS. TEAEs will be summarised in terms of the number of subjects with at least one event (N), the percentage of subjects with at least one event (%), the number of events (E) and the event rate per 100 patient years of observation time (R) for the on-treatment observation period. Supportive summaries of AEs will be made for the in-trial observation period. The development over time in gastrointestinal AEs will be presented graphically.

Change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c The primary estimand will be estimated based on the FAS using week 26 measurements from the in-trial observation period. The primary statistical analysis will be a pattern mixture model using multiple imputation to handle missing data assuming that the missing data mechanism is missing at random (MAR) within the groups used for imputation. Imputation of missing data at week 26 will be done within 8 groups of subjects defined by randomised treatment arm, and whether subjects at week 26 (i) have discontinued treatment or initiated rescue medication or (ii) are still on treatment and have not initiated rescue medication. It is hereby assumed that the likely values of what the missing data would have been if available are best described by information from subjects who at week 26 are similar in terms of randomised treatment arm and treatment adherence/rescue status. Missing values for each group will be imputed as follows: !An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with stratification factor as a categorical fixed effect and baseline HbA 1cmeasurement as a covariate will be fitted to observed values of the change from baseline in HbA 1cat week 26. !The estimated parameters for location and dispersion will be used to impute 100 values for each subject with missing week 26 data based on stratification factor as categorical and baseline HbA 1c. Thus, 100 complete data sets will be generated including observed and imputed values. For each of the 100 (now complete) imputed data sets, the change from baseline to week 26 will be analysed using an ANCOVA with treatment and stratification factor as categorical fixed effects and baseline HbA 1cas a covariate. The results obtained from analysing the datasets will be combined using Rubin’s rule48to draw inference. The secondary estimand will be estimated based on the FAS using post-baseline measurements up to and including week 26 from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The secondary analysis will be a Mixed Model for Repeated Measurements (MMRM). A restricted maximum likelihood (REML) will be used. The model will include all post baseline HbA 1c measurements collected at scheduled visits up to and including week 26 as dependent variables.

The MMRM is a well-established method that accounts for the uncertainty pertaining to missing data. This analysis assumes that the missing data mechanism is MAR.

The sections below describe the important identified and potential risks and precautions associated with oral semaglutide treatment. These are based on findings in nonclinical studies and clinical trials with oral semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks and precautions, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported AEs in clinical trials with oral semaglutide have been gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and constipation). Clinical trials have indicated that a low starting dose and gradual dose escalation mitigates the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Consequently, a low starting dose and dose escalation with 4 week dose-escalation steps have been implemented in the trial. Potential risks Medullary thyroid cancer The human relevance of the proliferative C-cell changes found in rodents treated with GLP-1 RAs is unknown, but data suggest that rodents are more sensitive to the mode of action of GLP-1 RAs for induction of C-cell tumours. However, as a precaution, subjects with a family or personal history of MEN 2 or MTC will not be enrolled in the trial. During the trial, calcitonin will be measured on a regular basis, and the guidance for investigators on further evaluation and action on elevated calcitonin concentrations is included in appendix A. Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs including oral semaglutide. As a precaution, subjects with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. Also, subjects will be informed about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and serum levels of lipase and amylase will be monitored throughout the trial. Pancreatic cancer Patients with T2DM have an increased risk of certain types of cancer such as pancreatic cancer. There is currently no support from nonclinical studies or clinical trials or post-marketing data that CONFIDENTIAL"

However, pancreatic cancer has been included as a separate potential risk due to the scientific debate surrounding a potential association to GLP-1-based therapies and the unknown long-term effects of stimulation of β-cells and suppression of α-cells. Pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by EMA. Allergic reactions As in the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, treatment with oral semaglutide may evoke allergic reactions. These may include urticaria, rash, pruritus as well as anaphylactic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance if suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction to the trial product occurs. Hypoglycaemia Based on current knowledge about the GLP-1 RA drug class, there is a risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when a GLP-1 RA is combined with sulphonylurea or insulin. The risk for development of hypoglycaemia with oral semaglutide in combination with sulphonylurea and insulin is currently unknown. Acute renal impairment In subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs, including oral semaglutide, gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may lead to significant dehydration and secondary acute renal impairment. Subjects with gastrointestinal AEs are recommended to drink plenty of fluids to avoid volume depletion. Also, serum creatinine and other markers of kidney function will be monitored throughout the trial. SGLT-2 inhibitors, an allowed background OAD medication, have also been associated with volume depletion. It is recommended to monitor renal function and for signs and symptoms of fluid loss during therapy. Severe dehydration may be a risk factor for ketoacidosis. Impaired renal function may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis when GLP-1 RAs are co-administered with metformin. In case subject is treated with metformin as a rescue medication and experiences prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, the investigator should monitor serum creatinine, and if clinically indicated, withhold metformin until resolution of renal dysfunction. If a subject experiences persistent decline in renal function on background OAD medication and/or rescue medication, the background OAD medication and/or rescue medication should be adjusted/discontinued at invetigator’s discretion and in accordance with the current apporoved label or guideline.CONFIDENTIAL"

Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in blood glucose may be an additional aggravating factor. Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression4,53even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening51. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo. As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed before enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. Teratogenicity (embryo-foetal development toxicity) Semaglutide caused embryo-foetal malformations in the rat through a GLP-1 receptor mediated effect on the inverted yolk sac placenta leading to impaired nutrient supply to the developing embryo. Primates do not have an inverted yolk sac placenta which makes this mechanism unlikely to be of relevance to humans. However, as a precaution, females who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant or are of childbearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, pregnancy tests will be performed at all visits, including screening and follow-up and at any time during the trial if a menstrual period is missed. General precautions All subjects will be included after a thorough evaluation with regards to in- and exclusion criteria defined in order to ensure that subjects are eligible for trial treatment. There are also strict glyacemic rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial. If rescue medication is required, it should be in accordance with ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes29,30(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care according to clinical practice in Japan and/or the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes54. Further details with regards to safety of trial product are described in the current edition of the IB for oral semaglutide (NN9924 ) 25, or any updates theretof. 18.1.2 Risks and precautions with dulaglutideCONFIDENTIAL"

Please consult the EU SmPC26and the local prescribing information for dulaglutide for the following information on warnings and precautions/risks gathered under clinical trials and from post marketing data: thyroid C-cell tumours, acute pancreatitis, hypoglycaemia, hypersensitivity, severe gastrointestinal disease. Overdoses have been reported in clinical studies. Effects associated with these overdoses were primarily mild or moderate gastrointestinal events (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and nonsevere hypoglycaemia. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive care (including frequent plasma glucose monitoring) should be initiated according to the subject’s clinical signs and symptoms. 18.1.3 Benefits In this trial subjects will be randomised to one of four treatment arms involving an active add-on treatment regimen anticipated to be more efficacious than the treatment they receive at the time of trial entry (background OAD medication). Based on the results of the phase 2 dose finding trial, oral semaglutide is expected to provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight in subjects with T2DM. In addition, it is expected that all subjects will benefit from participation through close contact with the trial site, with close follow-up of their T2DM and a careful medical examination; all of which will most likely result in an intensified management of their T2DM. All subjects in this trial will receive trial products and auxiliary supplies free of charge. 18.1.4 Risk and benefit conclusion The safety profile for oral semaglutide generated from the clinical and nonclinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of oral semaglutide in accordance with the planned clinical trial. The phase 2 results indicate that oral semaglutide will provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight. Dulaglutide is already a marketed drug approved for the use in subjects with T2DM. Safety and efficacy will be monitored regularly and acceptable glycaemic control will be reinforced at all times during the trial. In conclusion, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and acceptable in view of the anticipated benefits oral semaglutide/dulaglutide would provide to subjects with T2DM. 18.2 Informed consent CONFIDENTIAL"

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (greater than 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !Renal dysfunction !Smoking !Autoimmune thyroiditis !Several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various co-morbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells.CONFIDENTIAL"

The subject should remain in the trial, however, all medications suspected to relate to this condition must be discontinued until diagnosis has been established. Background: These values were found in 9 (0.15%) of a population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1. All of these patients were diagnosed with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) resulting in a positive predictive value of 100 %. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !Thyroid ultrasound examination !Fine needle aspiration of any nodules > 1 cm !Potentially surgery with neck dissection In case a subject is diagnosed with MTC, it is common clinical practice to explore the family history of MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and perform a genetic test for RET (re-arranged during transfection) proto-oncogene mutation. 2.2 Calcitonin ≥ 50 and < 100 ng/L Action: The subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. The subject should remain in the trial and continuation on trial product should be based on the evaluation done by the thyroid specialist. Background: These values were found in 8 (0.14%) of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1. Two of these subjects were diagnosed with MTC and two were diagnosed with C-cell hyperplasia, resulting in a positive predictive value of a C-cell anomaly of 50%. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !Thyroid ultrasound examination !If available and there are no contraindication, a pentagastrin stimulation test should be done. For subjects with positive pentagastrin stimulation test, surgery should be considered !If pentagastrin stimulation test is not available, thyroid ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy may add important clinical information about the need for surgery 2.3 Calcitonin ≥ 10 and < 50 ng/L Action: The subject can continue in the trial on trial product.

The predictive value of a C-cell anomaly for this calcitonin level was 8.3%. However, the likelihood of having a medullary carcinoma > 1 cm with calcitonin in this range is extremely low. For calcitonin values between 10-20 ng/L Costante et al 1identified 216 (3.7%) patients. One patient out of the 216 had a subsequent basal (unstimulated) calcitonin of 33 ng/L, and had C-cell hyperplasia at surgery. Two other studies used a cut-off of calcitonin > 10 ng/L to screen for C-cell disease, but they do not provide sufficient information on patients with basal calcitonin > 10 and < 20 ng/L to allow conclusions2,3. 3 References 1 Costante G, Meringolo D, Durante C, Bianchi D, Nocera M, Tumino S et al.

The onset of the pain may be swift reaching maximum intensity within 30 min, it is frequently unbearable and characteristically persists for more than 24 hours without relief1. The pain is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination usually reveals severe upper abdominal tenderness at times associated with guarding. In general, both amylase and lipase are elevated during the course of acute pancreatitis. The serum lipase may remain elevated slightly longer than amylase. The level of the serum amylase and/or lipase does not correlate with the severity of acute pancreatitis1. In general, serum lipase is thought to be more sensitive and specific than serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis, the trial product should promptly be interrupted (no treatment discontinuation call should be made in the interactive web response system (IWRS) before diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed). Appropriate additional examinations must be performed, including local measurement of amylase and lipase. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features2: !abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back) !serum lipase activity (and/or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the UNL !characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging If acute pancreatitis is ruled out, trial product should be re-initiated.If acute pancreatitis is confirmed, appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated.

Change in allowance for eye examinations and additional data collection on diabetic retinopathy 2. Addition of bicarbonate as a part of the biochemistry laboratory assessment 3. Investigator’s responsibility in ensuring evaluation and management of certain risk factors and complications 4. Clarification of the criteria for completion, withdrawal and lost to follow-up 5. Other minor corrections and clarifications 1.1 Additional data collection on diabetic retinopathy Transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy is a recognised complication in selected patients with diabetes after initiation of intensive antidiabetic treatment1,2,3. Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in blood glucose may be an additional aggravating factor. In a recently completed cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo4.T h e majority of the related adverse events were moderate in severity and did not lead to premature discontinuation of trial product. To further understand this safety signal, additional information will be collected and for all diabetic retinopathy events reported during the trial. Furthermore, information to the investigators and subjects related to diabetic retinopathy has been added to the protocol (see Section 18). The timepoint of the Eye examination taken at end of trial (EoT) has been moved for subjects completing treatment to ensure the treatment period is completed as for other assessments performed at EoT. The Eye examination at the EoT must be performed at visit 13 or within 5 weeks thereafter for subjects completing treatment, and at visit 13A or within 5 weeks thereafter and again within 5 weeks prior to visit 13 for subjects who have prematurely discontinued trial product. This has been clarified as a footnote of the flowchart. 1Dahl-Jørgensen K, Brinchmann-Hansen O, Hanssen KF, Sandvik L, Aagenaes O.

In addition, text is added to highlight the investigator’s responsibility in ensuring evaluation and management cardiovascular risk factors and microvascular complications such as diabetic kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy. 1.4 Clarification of the criteria for completion, withdrawal and lost to follow-up The criteria for subject completion, -withdrawal and -lost to follow-up respectively is clarified and has been made consistent across sections. Lost to follow-up is considered a subcategory to withdrawal from trial. In addition, it is emphasised that as soon as contact to a subject is lost, efforts must be made to regain contact and the efforts must continue until the subjects last planned visit. Only if contact is not regained at that time point the subject can be considered lost to follow up. Since this trial is not an outcome trial the terminology ‘health status’ is replaced with “relevant safety information” - the purpose of which is to follow up on any adverse events or pregnancy, and not to determine if a subject completes the trial or not. 1.5 Other minor adjustments, clarifications and correction of typographical errors Statistical considerations For the pattern mixture model using multiple imputation, the number of imputations will be increased from 100 to 1000 data sets, to ensure a greater precision of the estimates. In addition, an error in the number of groups used for imputation is corrected. Explanation on Cox proportional hazards model has also been added.CONFIDENTIAL"

A completion call must be performed in the IWRS after completion of visit 13 (see Section 10). At visit 13 the subject should be reminded about the importance of attending the follow-up visit (visit 14). If the subject, nonetheless, does not attend visit 14, the site should make efforts to obtain contact with the subject within the visit window. A trial completer is defined as a subject who attends, or is in contact with the site, at the subject’s last scheduled visit. For subjects who complete treatment, the last scheduled visit is visit 14. (For subjects who discontinue trial product, see Section 8.1.6). In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled visit 13, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians and medical records to collect health status.

A subject who prematurely discontinued trial product is still considered a trial completer if the subject attends or is in contact with the site, at the subject’s last scheduled visit. For subjects who prematurely discontinue trial product, the last scheduled visit is visit 13 (or visit 14A if it is scheduled after visit 13). The site should in due time prepare for establishing contact with the subject within the visit window of the scheduled visit 9 and visit 13, respectively if the subject has agreed to attend these visits. In summary, subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule, missing assessments or trial product discontinuation for any reason. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial should be considered as having withdrawn consent from the trial (for withdrawal procedures, see Section 8.1.7). 2.6 Section 8.1.7.1 Lost to follow-up In case contact to the subject is lost during the trial, the site should immediately undertake efforts to re-establish contact. If the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) and the subject has consented to it, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians and medical records in an attempt to regain contact with the subject or to obtain relevant safety information from other sources. Efforts to regain contact should continue until the end of the subject’s last scheduled visit: visit 14 for subjects who have completed treatment, whereas for subjects who have discontinued trial product prematurely the last visit is visit 13 (or visit 14A if it is scheduled after visit 13). Only if contact with the subject is not regained by the end of the visit window of the last scheduled visit can the subject be considered lost to follow up (see Section 6.6). 2.7 Section 8.4.1.2 Adverse events requiring additional data collection For the following AEs additional data collection is required and specific event forms must be completed in the eCRF in addition to the AE form: !Acute coronary syndrome (MI or unstable angina pectoris requiring hospitalisation) !Cerebrovascular event (stroke or TIA) !Heart failure !Pancreatitis !Neoplasm (excluding thyroid neoplasm) !Thyroid disease (including thyroid neoplasm) !Renal event !Hypersensitivity reactionCONFIDENTIAL"

Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression4, 54even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening52. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo [ref-2]. As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopyperformed before enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. As part of good diabetes management the investigator is encouraged to ensure adequate monitoring and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in subjects enrolled into the trial [ref-3].

There are also strict glyacemic rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial. If rescue medication is required, it should be in accordance with ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes 29, 30(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care of the subject. This includes adequate glycaemic control, appropriate risk factor modification such as optimal treatment of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and other cardiovascular risk factors, as well as regular monitoring and treatment of diabetic kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy( Diabetes Care 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes )56. … 2.20 Section 27 References Existing reference #54 in protocol version 2.0 will be modified (and renumbered) as: American Diabetes Association.

A higher dose of semaglutide is a dose of at least one tablet more than the intended dose, and for dulaglutide a higher dose than 0.75 mg/day; however the administered dose must deviate from the intended dose to an extent where clinical consequences for the trial subject were likely to happen as judged by the investigator, although they did not necessarily occur. !Lactic acidosis !Creatine kinase (CK) > 10x upper normal limit (UNL) !Hepatic event defined as: oalanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 5x UNL and total bilirubin ≤ 2x UNL oALT or AST > 3x UNL and total bilirubin > 2x UNL* oHepatic event leading to trial product discontinuation !Diabetic retinopathy and related complications 2.23 Appendix B, Section 1.14 Diabetic retinopathy and related complications If an event of diabetic retinopathy (or related complications) is observed during the trial the following additional information must be reported, if available: !Signs and symptoms associated with the eventCONFIDENTIAL"
