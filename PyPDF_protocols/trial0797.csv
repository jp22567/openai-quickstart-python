Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 9 / Protocol MO39129 , Version 3 1.2.2 Clinical Experience Available experience with emi cizumab in humans includes data from one completed Phase I study (ACE001JP – Last Patient Last Visit on 17 April 2015) and its ongoing Phase I/II extension study (ACE002JP). Currently available experience with emicizumab in humans includes data from two co mpleted Phase I studies (ACE001JP and JP29574), one ongoing Phase I/II study (ACE002JP) extension in hemophilia A patients, and two ongoing Phase III studies in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors (adult patients - BH29884; pediatric patients – BH29992). The clinical development program in adult and pediatric patients with hemophilia A (both with and without FVIII inhibitors) is ongoing for emicizumab. Refer to the emicizumab Investigator's Brochure for details on the preclinical and clinical studies. 1.2.2.1 Studies ACE001JP and ACE002JP ACE001JP was a single study conducted in three parts, which included both healthy subjects (Part A and Part B) and patients with hemophilia A (Part C). The objective of Parts A and B in healthy subjects was to investigat e the tolerability, safety, PK, and PD response of SC -administered emicizumab in adult Japanese and Caucasian men and to evaluate for racial differences, if any, in their PK and PD response. Healthy male volunteers aged 20 44 were eligible for enrollment. A total of 64 healthy male volunteers were enrolled in Parts A and B from August 2012 to April 2013 . In Part C, the objective was to investigate the tolerability, safety, PK, and PD response of SC -administered emicizumab in patients 1259 years of age with congenital hemophilia A who . Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were 12 59 years of age, ≥ 40 kg in weight, had a diagnosis of congenital hemophilia A, and had previous documentation of bleeds and/or coagulation factor treatment in the last 6 months. For those with inhibitors, patients must have had 6 bleeds in the 6 months prior to enrollment, and for those without inhibitors, patients were required to have received 150 lifetime doses of FVIII replacement, including in the last 6 months. A total of 18 patients with hemophilia A were enrolled in Part C from May 2013 to June 2014 . Parts A and B of Study ACE001JP (completed) consisted of a randomized, placebo -controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) study, which was conducted in Japanese (n40; Part A) and Caucasian (n 24; Part B) healthy men. In total, 48 subjects received a single SC injection of 0.001 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg emicizumab and 16 subjects received a single SC injection of placebo. Part C of Study ACE001JP was an open -label, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in 18 Japanese patients with hemophilia A, both with and witho ut inhibitors. Of note, patients received concurrent coagulation factor products to control breakthrough bleeds. Of the 18 patients in Part C of Study ACE001JP, six patients were dosed with 0.3 mg/kg/week SC following a single loading dose of 1 mg/kg SC, s ix patients were dosed with 1 mg/kg/week SC following a single loading dose of 3 mg/kg SC, and six patients received 3 mg/kg/week emicizumab SC without a loading dose. Patients who participated in Part C of Study ACE001JP were offered the opportunity to continue in the extension study (ACE002JP). In order to be eligible for the extension study, patients must have completed 12 weeks of assigned treatment in Study ACE001JP and had bleeds prior to study entry. Seventeen of 18 patients in Part C of Study ACE001 JP"
10,page_10,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 10 / Protocol MO39129 , Version 3 completed the 12 week treatment period. One patient discontinued the treatment and moved to the post discontinuation follow up period. A total of 16 of the 17 patients who completed the 12 week treatment period subsequently enrolled into extension Study ACE002JP, and one patient moved to the post treatment observation period of Study ACE001JP. Thus, , which includes six patients from the 0.3 mg/kg/week group, five patients from the 1 mg/kg/week group, and five patients from the 3 mg/kg/week group of Stud y ACE001JP The duration of follow -up for the patients in the 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/week cohorts who enrolled in Study ACE002JP ranges from 140 to 145, 116 to 124, and 89 to 98 weeks, respectively (cut -off date 15th February 2016).For Studies ACE001JP and AC E002JP, the efficacy parameter of annualized bleeding rate (ABR) has been calculated by annualizing the number of bleeds that required treatment with coagulation factor products during the 6 months prior to study enrollment and during the treatment period after the first emicizumab administration. During the 6 months before study enrollment , the patients without inhibitors received FVIII prophylactic replacement therapy, while the patients with inhibitors received episodic therapy and/or prophylactic therap y with bypassing agents. After administration of emicizumab to patients with hemophilia A, annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) decreased in all patients in Studies ACE001JP and ACE002JP compared with the pre-treatment period, regardless of whether or not they had FVIII inhibitors, with the exception of one patient in the 3 mg/kg/week group who was previously treated with FVIII prophylaxis and had a baseline ABR of 0 (in this patient, the ABR was maintained at 0 while receiving emicizumab). Among all patients, percentage reduction in ABR ranged from 22.8% to 100% in the 0.3 mg/kg/week group, from 57.5% to 100% in the 1 mg/kg/week group, and from 90.1% to 100% in the 3 mg/kg/week group. The safety data from completed studies of healthy male volunteers (Japanese a nd Caucasian) in ACE001JP Parts A and B (n=48) showed that emicizumab was well tolerated and the incidence of adverse events was similar in the emicizumab dosing groups and the placebo group. Moreover, no racial differences or dose -dependent increases in t he incidence of adverse events were observed. There were no serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, or deaths in either study. From ACE001JP Part C and its ongoing extension ACE002JP (as of the cut -off date 15 February 2016), mo st adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, except for 2 severe adverse events (appendicitis and mesenteric hematoma). The majority of the adverse events were not considered related to emicizumab (see the Emicizumab Investigator’s Brochure). 1.2.2.2 JP29574 Completed Study JP29574 included 5 groups of 12 healthy Japanese volunteers. This study investigated the relative bioavailability between Phase I/II 80 mg/mL formulation and Phase III 150 mg/mL formulation materials and among three different s ites of injection, as well as the absolute bioavailability. Results showed no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events observed by formulation, injection site, or administration route. Emicizumab has been well tolerated in patients in the Phase I/II studies (cut -off date 15th February 2016; see the emicizumab Investigator's Brochure). The majority of adverse events have been mild in intensity, except for five moderate adverse events (upper respiratory tract"
11,page_11,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 11 / Protocol MO39129 , Version 3 infection, bipolar I disorder, h emophilia [left hip joint bleeding due to hemophilia], headache, and asthma) and two severe adverse events (appendicitis and mesenteric hematoma). Both severe events were considered to be serious adverse events and not related to emicizumab administration. A total of seven patients have reported injection -site reactions (including erythema, hematoma, rash, pain, discomfort, and pruritus). All injection -site reactions were mild in intensity. Besides injection -site reactions, the most frequently reported adve rse events (at least four patients) have been nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, dental caries, excoriation, and headache. There have not been any dose -dependent increases in adverse events, and the majority of the adverse events have not been considered to be related to emicizumab. Treatment was discontinued for one patient with injection -site erythema in the 1 mg/kg weekly group; the event was mild in intensity and resolved. The same patient also reported one non -related serious adverse event (hemophilia [left hip joint bleeding due to hemophilia]) approximately 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug. In the Phase I/II studies, no thromboembolic adverse events have been reported when emicizumab has been administered alone or concomitantly with FVIII product s or bypassing agents as episodic therapy. 1.2.2.3 Studies BH29884 and BH29992 The ongoing Phase III study (BH29884) is enrolling patients with hemophilia A aged 12 years or older who have inhibitors against FVIII and have received episodic or prophylacti c treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry . As of October 2016, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been observed in two patients receiving emicizumab and bypassing agents see Section 5.1.1.3 ) and two cases of thromboembolic events have been observed in two patients receiving the same regimen (see Section 5.1.1.2 ). The HAVEN 1 study (BH29884; NCT02622321) was a randomized, multicenter, open -label, clinical trial in 109 adult and adolescent males (aged 12 to 75 years and > 40 kg) with hemophil ia A with FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic (on -demand) or prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents. Patients received weekly emicizumab prophylaxis (Arms A, C, and D), 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by 1.5 mg /kg once weekly thereafter, or no prophylaxis (Arm B). Dose up -titration to 3 mg/kg once weekly was allowed after 24 weeks on emicizumab prophylaxis in case of suboptimal efficacy (i.e., ≥ 2 spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds). During the study, two patients underwent up -titration of their maintenance dose to 3 mg/kg once weekly. Fifty -three patients previously treated with episodic (on -demand) bypassing agents were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm A) or no prophylaxis (Arm B), with stratification by prior 24 -week bleed rate (< 9 or ≥ 9). Patients randomized to Arm B could switch to emicizumab prophylaxis after co mpleting at least 24 weeks without prophylaxis. Forty -nine patients previously treated with prophylactic bypassing agents were enrolled into Arm C to receive emicizumab prophylaxis. Seven patients previously treated with episodic (on -demand) bypassing agen ts who had participated in a non -interventional study (NIS) prior to enrollment, but"

17,page_17,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 17 / Protocol MO39129 , Version 3 The immunogenicity of emicizumab was evaluated using an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay. No patients tested positive for anti - emicizumab antibodies in HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2 (n = 171). Four patients tested positive for anti - emicizumab antibodies in the dose -finding tria l (n = 18). The anti -emicizumab antibody positive rate may be under -reported due to the limitation of the assay (US Prescribing Information). 1.2.2.6 Peri-Operative Management of Patients on Emicizumab The safety and efficacy of emicizumab has not been sp ecifically tested in patients undergoing procedures or surgeries. Limited data are available from pivotal clinical trials, where hemophilia A patients with inhibitors receiving emicizumab prophylaxis underwent procedures and surgeries, either with or witho ut the additional use of bypassing agents. The use of bypassing agents was at the investigator's discretion. Procedures/surgeries that were performed without peri -operative bypassing agent use and did not result in a bleed included skin biopsy, tooth extra ction or restoration, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, ultrasound fluid aspiration, and port or central line removal. Other procedures/surgeries which were performed with peri -operative bypassing agent use (preventive and/or treatment for bleeds) in cluded central line catheter placement, tooth extractions and appendectomy. One hip replacement was performed with peri-operative bypassing agent (rFVIIa) and FVIII use (preventive and treatment for bleed) as well as tranexamic acid. No emicizumab dose ad justments are recommended for patients undergoing procedures or surgeries. Thorough documentation of surgeries will be requested. The available data are insufficient to provide specific dosing guidance for the use of bypassing agents or FVIII in peri -opera tive settings. If bypassing agents or FVIII are required in the peri -operative period, please refer to the dosing guidance for those concomitant medications in Section 4.4 and in the emicizumab Investigator’s Brochure. Based on the Phase I/II data describe d above, a clinical development program in adult and pediatric patients with hemophilia A (both with and without FVIII inhibitors) has been developed for emicizumab. Refer to the emicizumab Investigator's Brochure for details on the preclinical and clinica l studies. 1.3 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT -RISK ASS ESSMENT … Emicizumab has been well tolerated in patients in the Phase I/II studies (cut -off date 15th February 2016). The majority of adverse events have been mild in intensity, with the most common being injection site reactions ISRs. The majority of the adverse events have not been considered to be related to emicizumab. In these studies, no thromboembolic or systemic hypersensitivity adverse events have been observed. However, as of April 2017 October 2 016, two three cases of TMA, and two three thromboembolic events in two patients, have been observed in the ongoing Phase III Study BH29884 in patients who received"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 19 / Protocol MO39129 , Version 3 and the EuroQoL Five -Dimension -Five Levels Questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L) will be completed prior to the first emicizumab administration (Week 1) , at the Month 3, 6, 12, and 18 month assessmen ts, and at study completion as outlined in the Schedule of Activities ( Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities ). Additional secondary endpoints include assessing patient preference for the emicizumab regimen compared with the p revious regimen using a questionnaire (EmiPref). … For the assessment of anti -FVIII antibodies, functional assays for FVIII inhibitors that utilize a clotting readout (classic Bethesda or Nijmegen assay) cannot be used for patients on emicizumab therapy as emicizumab drives clotting even in the presence of FVIII inhibitors, causing a false -negative test result. After the first dose, local measurement of FVIII inhibitors, if indicated, requires use of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay - (ELISA -) based test or a chromogenic Bethesda assay. At the discretion of the local investigator, any additional urgent request to assess FVIII inhibitors will need to be sent to a central laboratory (see Appendix 2 Schedule of Biomarker Samples for additional information). An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) composed of, at minimum, hemostasis/thrombosis experts and a statistician will be in place throughout the duration of the study and will monitor the study data at pre specifi ed intervals and ad hoc as needed throughout the study. The use of aPCC is to be avoided throughout the study. If bypassing agents are needed to treat breakthrough bleeds or additional treatment to prevent or treat bleeding during surgeries, recombinant ac tivated human Factor VII (rFVIIa) should be used at the lowest dose expected to achieve hemostasis. If rVIIa is not available or not an option for medical reasons, activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC, including Factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity [FEIBA]) may be used. If aPCC is used, 50 units/kg of aPCC should be administered as an initial dose and it is critical that the dose administered does not exceed the recommended dose (see the local prescribing information for the marketed bypassi ng agent in question). Drugs intended to control breakthrough bleeds (e.g. rFVII, FVIII, aPCC) or bleeds during surgeries should be used at the lowest dose expected to achieve hemostasis. Given that circulating emicizumab may increase the patient’s coagul ation potential, the doses required to achieve hemostasis may be lower than doses used prior to starting emicizumab. Investigators shall discuss at the start of the study with patients recommended doses of any additional coagulation factors used, following the guidance below. The use of aPCC for breakthrough bleed treatment for patients on emicizumab should be avoided if possible, and rFVIIa should be the first option used to treat, starting with no more than 90 µg/kg as an initial dose. If aPCC needs to b e used, no more than 50 IU/kg should be administered as an initial dose and doses of > 100 U/kg/24 hours or more should be avoided, as cases of TMA and thrombotic events were reported when on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U/kg/24 hours aPCC was"
20,page_20,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 20 / Protocol MO39129 , Version 3 admi nistered for 24 hours or more. Investigators should provide or remind patients of the exact dose and schedule of bypassing agents or FVIII required to treat any bleed. When a bleed has occurred, patients (or their legally authorized representative) will be required to report bleed information on an ePRO device where possible , including site of bleed, type of bleed, time of each individual bleed (day, start and stop time), and treatment for bleed (e.g., other than emicizumab in case of breakthrough bleeds). The reason for the use of rFVIIa will be documented (e.g., bleeding, preventative dose before activity). Thorough documentation of the treatments for bleeds and/or surgeries will be requested, including agent, start time, dose, route of administration, and number of infusions needed to treat the bleed. Local and central laboratory assessments are required to monitor the risk for thromboembolic events or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or TMA, as per the Schedule of Activities ( Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities ), if bypassing agents are used to treat a breakthrough bleed. … An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will be responsible for monitoring safety the duration of the study. 3.2 END OF STUDY AND LENGTH OF ST UDY The approximate length of the entire study from the first patient enrolled to the last patient, last visit (LPLV; see below ) is approximately 3 years. For each individual patient, the study is expected to last approximately 2 years (patients will recei ve 3 mg/kg/week emicizumab for the first 4 weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week emicizumab for the remainder of the 2 -year treatment period). Patients who discontinue emicizumab prior to the completion of the 2 -year treatment period will undergo a Safety Follo w-up Visit 24 weeks after the patient’s last emicizumab dose or at 2 years after emicizumab treatment start, whichever occurs first. … Completed the 24week Safety Follow -up Visit 24 weeks after discontinuing emicizumab 3.3 RATIONALE FOR ST UDY DESIGN The primary objective endpoint of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of prophylactic administration of emicizumab in patients with congenital hemophilia A who have persistent inhibitors against FVIII . This study is being conducted t o build on the safety data that have been obtained as part of the clinical program. The results from this study will be used to substantiate the safety database and provide long -term additional data in patients with hemophilia A who have inhibitors against FVIII. The specific focus will be to characterize any thromboembolic events, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or TMA, and systemic hypersensitivity reactions , anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid events that may occur in patients with hemophilia A treated with emicizumab."
21,page_21,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 21 / Protocol MO39129 , Version 3 3.3.1 Rationale for Emicizumab Dose and Schedule … The safety results from studies ACE001JP/ACE002JP and BH29884 have showed shown that emicizumab has been well tolerated in patients with hemophilia A. The maximum clinical dose of 3 mg/kg week ly is associated with a 10.3 -fold and 11.2 -fold safety margin based on Cmax and area under the curve during the dosage interval (AUC τ) results, respectively. No clear differences in the plasma concentrations of emicizumab have been observed between adolescent and adult patients. … In study BH29884, the ABR was 2.9 events (95% CI, 1.7 to 5.0) among participants who were randomly assigne d to emicizumab prophylaxis (Group A, 35 participants) versus 23.3 events (95% CI, 12.3 to 43.9) among those assigned to no prophylaxis (Group B, 18 participants), representing a significant difference of 87% in favor of emicizumab prophylaxis (p<0.001). A total of 22 participants in Group A (63%) had zero bleeding events, as compared with 1 participant (6%) in Group B. Among 24 participants in Group C who had participated in a NIS, emicizumab prophylaxis resulted in a bleeding rate that was significantly l ower by 79% than the rate with previous bypassing -agent prophylaxis (p<0.001) (Oldenburg et al. 2017 ). 3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population Patients with congenital hemophilia A who have persistent and documented inhibitors against FVIII at enrollment w ill comprise the primary population for this Phase IIIb study investigating the safety, tolerability, efficacy, immunogenicity, and PK of prophylactic administration of emicizumab. … Based on current treatment algorithms for patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors (Kempton and White II 2009; Srivastava et al. 2013 ), it is anticipated that the majority of adults and adolescents treated with emicizumab will have prev iously undergone ITI without success or are not candidates for ITI. As clinical safety data relating to the concomitant use of prophylactic emicizumab during ITI are not available at this time, patients currently receiving ITI will not be eligible for this study. Patients receiving ITI therapy will be eligible following the completion of a 72 -hour washout period prior to the first emicizumab administration. Owing to the fact that the presence or amount of FVIII inhibitors in their plasma does not impact t he efficacy of emicizumab, patients’ inhibitor titers at the time of study entry will not influence their study eligibility. 3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group This study involves the use of a single -arm study design and therefore a control group will not be used. The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and"
22,page_22,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 22 / Protocol MO39129 , Version 3 tolerability of prophylactic administration of emicizumab in patients with congenital hemophilia A who have persistent inhibitors against FVIII . As hemophilia A is a rare dis ease (Acharya 2013 ) and the study is designed to investigate the b road safety profile of emicizumab, approximately 200 patients will be enrolled. Given the size of the patient population, a single - arm study design without a control group is considered an appropriate method to capture the safety data that will be observed following the use of emicizumab. This type of study design has been used extensively in previous clinical studies involving patients with rare diseases (Bell and Tudur Smith 2014 ). 3.3.4 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments The identity of effective PD, safety, and bone and joint biomarkers has not been fully elucidated and further testing is required to determine which assays and technical conditions are most suitable for use with emicizumab treatment. Plasma and serum samples will be collected for PD, safety, and bone and joint biomarker assessments at specific clinic visi ts in order to obtain evidence of the biologic activity of emicizumab in patients and to support the selection of a recommended dose (see Appendix 2 Schedule of Biomarker Samples ). The PD biomarkers include, but are not lim ited to, coagulation assays such as aPTT and FVIII activity assays. The results of the Phase I/II study have showed shown that a dose - response relationship was apparent between aPTT and emicizumab concentration (for more information, see the Investigator’s Brochure). The aPTT assay will be run in a modified form to ensure that the assay range covers all levels of emicizumab exposure. In addition, clot waveform analysis (CWA) may be run as an exploratory PD coagulation assay. … Residual blood and/or, plasma, and serum from collected biomarker samples may be stored for up to 5 years after the final Clinical Study Report has been completed development of the final CSR and may be used for additional exploratory emicizumab -related research, to guide development o f potential in vitro diagnostic assay(s) related to emicizumab plasma concentration, FVIII inhibitor titre and/or coagulation activity. , or for the potential evaluation of germline genomic variation, including, but not limited to, genetic loci coding for FIX and FX. 3.3.5 Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Schedule PK samples will be collected throughout the 2-year study period in order to further investigate the PK of emicizumab over the 2 year study period (see the Schedule of Activities; Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities )."
23,page_23,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 23 / Protocol MO39129 , Version 3 3.3.6 Rationale for Immunogenicity Sample Collection Immunogenicity will be monitored by investigating the incidence and clinical significance of antibodies to emicizumab at specified time points (see the Schedule of Activities; Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities ). The emergence of anti-drug antibodies ( ADAs ) has been previously observed in clinical studies involving monoclonal antibodies of the IgG4 cl ass (Lundkvist et al. 2012; Vennegoor et al. 2013 ). 3.3.7 Rationale for Disease Response –based Endpoints The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of proph ylactic administration of emicizumab. This objective will be achieved by investigating the number of bleeds over time under emicizumab treatment, and assessing HRQoL, and assessments evaluating health status according to EQ -5D-5L and patient preference for the emicizumab regimen compared with the previous regimen . As mentioned in Section 3.1, this analysis will occur when all patients have completed 2 years of treatment or have withdrawn, whichever occurs sooner. In order to obtain comprehensive data on eac h bleed, patients will be asked to report bleed information on an ePRO device where possible , including site of bleed, type of bleed, time of each individual bleed (day, start and stop time), and treatment for bleed. 3.3.8 Rationale for Primary Endpoint S election As stated in Section 3.1, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of prophylactic administration of emicizumab. In order to achieve this objective, the incidence and severity of all adverse events, in cluding adverse events of special interest, will be captured on an ongoing basis, as they occur during the study. Physical examinations, vital signs, and laboratory values will be assessed as per the Schedule of Activities ( Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities ). 3.3.9 Rationale for Interim Analyses Owing to the long -term nature of this study, interim analyses will be conducted in order to obtain accurate information on the safety, efficacy, immunogenicity, and PK of prophyla ctic emicizumab at specific points throughout the study. The first interim analysis will be performed once approximately 100 patients have received treatment with emicizumab for at least 24 weeks. A second interim analysis will be performed when approximat ely 100 patients have received treatment with emicizumab for at least 52 weeks. Owing to the long term nature of this study, the interim analyses will be conducted in order to obtain accurate information on the safety, efficacy, immunogenicity, and PK of p rophylactic emicizumab at specific points throughout"

The data from these analyses will subsequently be presented to the iDMC in order to enable them to effectively monitor the study. 3.3.10 Rationale for Patient -reported Outcome (PRO) Assessment s During the study, electronic capture of HRQoL, health status (EQ -5D-5L), and preference data (EmiPref) will be obtained using an electronic patient reported outcome ( ePRO ) device. Patient preference data (EmiPref) will be collected on paper forms. … The goal of measuring HRQoL is to quantify any treatment benefits from the patient perspective. Previous studies that have used the Hemophilia Quality of Life questionnaire (Haemo -QoL), a measure of HRQoL parameters affected by hemophilia in children and adole scents, have reported improvements in physical health, feelings, view of self, family relations, friend relations, perceived support, relation with others, participation in sports, dealing with hemophilia, views of treatment, views of the future, and relat ionships (Santagostino et al. 2014 ). Improvements in physical health, feelings, view of self, and participation in work have also been observed on the adult version of the measure, the Haem -A-QoL (Stasyshyn et al. 2014 ). … The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized, preference -based measure of generic health status that is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments. It measure s five dimensions of health: mobility, ability to self -care, ability to undertake usual activities, pain /and discomfort, and anxiety / and depression. The EQ -5D-5L also assesses current overall health. The goal of measuring EQ -5D-5L is to assess the impac t of treatment with emicizumab over time on overall health and the different health dimensions. Data from the EQ-5D-5L can also be used to inform pharmacoeconomic evaluations. 4.1 PATIENTS This global study will enroll approximately 200 patients with con genital hemophilia A who have and documented persistent inhibitors against FVIII at enrollment.

The anticipated important safety risks for emicizumab are outl ined below. Please refer to the emicizumab Investigator's Brochure for a complete summary of safety information. 5.1.1.1 Injection -Site Reactions In the completed and ongoing Japanese studies, injection site reactions ISRs have been observed in some patie nts with hemophilia A. These local injection site reactions ISRs included injection -site erythema, injection -site hematoma, injection -site rash, injection -site discomfort, injection -site pain, and injection -site pruritus. All local injection site reactions ISRs were of mild intensity. Further details on the observed injection site reactions ISRs are available in the Investigator’s Brochure. To minimize the risk for injection site reactions ISRs, emicizumab should be injected subcutaneously using separate in jection sites as described in Sections 3.3.1 and 4.3.2.1 and the IFU document."

Treatment with emicizumab was interrupted , no further aPCC was administered, and the clot resolved without anticoagulation in after approximately 2.5 weeks. Emicizumab was restarted after approximately 10 days after the resoluti on of the serious adverse event without recurrence . • The second patient developed severe skin necrosis (both legs) and contemporaneous superficial vein thrombosis in the right leg after self -administering two consecutive doses of 100 units/kg/day of aPCC. The patient is recovering recovered on supportive therapy (no anticoagulation). For more details please refer to the emicizumab Investigator’s Brochure. All thromboembolic events should be reported as adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.2.3 ), and also as serious adverse events if it meets criteria as described in Section 5.2.2 . should be reported as serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest as described in Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 , respectively.

The patient restarted treatment with emicizumab approximately 10 days after resolution of the serious adverse event without recurrence of TMA . • The third patient presented at the hospital complaining of rectal bleeding, postural dizziness, and exertional dyspnea. Of note, . Multiple doses of rFVIIa were admini stered and various interventions (hemostatic powder application, absorbable hemostat packing, and embolization of rectal arteries) were used in an attempt to control bleeding. Despite these measures, the patient continued to have rectal hemorrhage. The pat ient’s bypassing agent treatment was then changed to aPCC and temporary cessation of bleeding was achieved. Subsequently, the patient developed a serious adverse event of TMA following concomitant bypassing agent treatment. Emicizumab prophylaxis and aPCC were discontinued and therapeutic plasma exchange with albumin was provided. Three days later, investigators assessed the patient’s TMA to be improving based on laboratory assessments (LDH and platelet count). However, the patient experienced recurrent rectal hemorrhage. Surgery and arterial embolization were no longer deemed to be feasible and the patient was placed on comfort care before passing away the same day. The investigator assessed the patient death as related to the serious adverse event of recta l hemorrhage and unrelated to emicizumab, and the TMA as related to emicizumab and aPCC. For more details please refer to the Emicizumab Investigator’s Brochure. These events should be reported as adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.2.3 ), and also as serious adverse events if it meets criteria as described in Section 5.2.2 . TMA events should be reported as serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest as described in Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 , respectively.

For each variable (continuous or categorical), the number of available observations will be reported. Medical history will be tabulated and previous concomitant medications will be summarized. 6.4 SAFETY ANALYSES The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of prophylactic administration of emicizumab in patients with congenital hemophilia A who have persistent inhibitors ag ainst FVIII at enrollment. Of primary interest in this study are the incidence and severity of all adverse events, including thromboembolic events , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or TMA, systemic hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and anaphylactoid events. All adverse events will be assessed according to the WHO toxicity grading scale. The incidence, type, and grade of adverse events will be summarized according to the primary system -organ class (SOC) and, within each SOC, by Medical Dictionary for Regulator y Activities (MedDRA) preferred term. For each adverse event, data will be provided on the timing (start and stop date, time of onset in comparison with last dose of emicizumab received, and doses of emicizumab received), severity, relationship to emicizum ab study drug , outcome, and effect on therapy. The data may be presented together with two -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson CIs if appropriate. In addition, as part of the safety evaluation, additional assessments will be summarized descriptively as follows: … • Laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry): o These parameters will be presented in shift tables of WHO toxicity grade at baseline versus worst grade during the treatment period. Selected laboratory parameters will"

Patients will be asked to record when they have bleeds or hemophilia medication u se, including emicizumab. Patients will be asked to record any hemophilia medication use (including emicizumab) and information regarding any bleeding events . The patients should record this information at least every week even if they do not experience a bleed. The number of bleeds will be compared with patients’ bleed rate prior to study entry and will be summarized descriptively. … As different HRQoL measures (Haem -A-QoL and the Haemo -QoL-SF) will be used for adult and adolescent patients, all calculatio ns and analyses will be conducted separately for each patient population. Scale scores for the Haem -A-QoL and Haemo -QoL-SF will be calculated and summarized descriptively. The HRQoL scale scores for all patients will be evaluated after 6 months of treatmen t, a timepoint which is consistent with other recent registrational studies in hemophilia (Lentz et al. 2013; Mahlangu et al. 2014; Powell et al. 2013 ) and analyses of this type of data (Santagostino et al. 2014; Wyrwich et al. 2015 ). Paired t -tests will be used to compare the on -treatment scores with the baseline scale scores for each HRQoL measure. Within -patient changes from baseline for the different HRQo L scale scores will also be calculated for each of the on -treatment timepoints. The proportion of patients who report changes in each group that exceed clinically meaningful thresholds will be reported. For each of the EQ -5D-5L assessments, the number and percentage of patients in each of the five categories for each question for each group will be evaluated. Changes in the EQ - 5D-5L index utility score from baseline will also be reported compared between groups . In addition, summary statistics including mea n, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be calculated according to the patients’ health state using the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ -VAS) both within and between groups .

Serum and plasma EDTA samples for bone and joint biomarkers must be collected after fasting (no food or drink other than water for at least 8 hours prior to the blood draw). Ideally these samples should be collected in the morning (before noon), in order to control for diurnal variation. Please consult the Central Laboratory Services Manual for details. The selection of exploratory bone and joint biomarkers to be tested will build on fin dings from biomar ker analyses in other emicizumab trials and may include CTX -1, OPG, P1NP, and soluble RANK -L (see Appendix 2 Schedule of Biomarker Samples aa. ). Samples will be analysed by the central laboratory. bb. Additional laboratory assessme nts: In the event of a breakthrough bleed that is treated with bypassing agents, it is recommended that the following laborator y tests will be performed within 24 48 hours of initial bypassing agent use (these tests will be conducted so that the investiga tor can monitor the patient for potential thromboembolic events and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or TMA). These tests include platelet count, serum creatinine, LD H and schistocytes. A plasma sample should also be provided for central laboratory monito ring of prothrombin fragment F1+2, fibrinogen and D -dimer. Samples for these tests should ideally be analysed at the central laboratory. Exceptionally in urgent situations where results are required quickly, local laboratory testing can be used, with resu lts recorded in the eCRF. For patients who require multiple doses of bypassing agents, laboratory monitoring should be performed every 24 48 hours until 24 48 hours after the last dose of bypassing agents is administered to treat a specific bleed. If appli cable, laboratory results should be recorded in the unscheduled visit eCRFs."

79,page_79,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 79 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 the Schedule of A ctivities (Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities ). Drugs intended to control breakthrough bleeds (e.g. rFVII, FVIII, activated prothrombin complex concentrate [aPCC]) or bleeds during surgeries should be used at the lowest do se expected to achieve hemostasis. Given that circulating emicizumab may increase the patient’s coagulation potential, the doses required to achieve hemostasis may be lower than doses used prior to starting emicizumab. Investigators shall discuss at the st art of the study with patients recommended doses of any additional coagulation factors used, following the guidance below. The use of aPCC for breakthrough bleed treatment for patients on emicizumab should be avoided if possible, and recombinant activated human Factor VII (rFVIIa) should be the first option used to treat, starting with no more than 90 µg/kg as an initial dose. If aPCC needs to be used, no more than 50 IU/kg should be administered as an initial dose and doses of > 100 U/kg/24 hours or more should be avoided, as cases of TMA and thrombotic events were reported when on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U/kg/24 hours aPCC was administered for 24 hours or more. Investigators should provide or remind patients of the exact dose and schedule of bypassing agents or FVIII required to treat any bleed. When a bleed has occurred, patients (or their legally authorized representative) will be required to report bleed information on an ePRO device where possible , including site of bleed, type of bleed, t ime of each individual bleed (day, start and stop time), and treatment for bleed (e.g., other than emicizumab in case of breakthrough bleeds). The reason for the use of rFVIIa will be documented (e.g., bleeding, preventative dose before activity). Thorough documentation of the treatments for bleeds and/or surgeries will be requested, including agent, start time, dose, route of administration, and number of infusions needed to treat the bleed. Local and central laboratory assessments are required to monitor the risk for thromboembolic events or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or TMA, as per the Schedule of Activities ( Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities ), if bypassing agents are used to treat a breakthrough bleed. Investigat ors will be asked to contact the Medical Monitor in the event of suspected lack or loss of efficacy of emicizumab in order to discuss a potential increase in emicizumab dose to 3 mg/kg/week and additional laboratory evaluations (e.g., coagulation tests), a s well as to re -evaluate the patient’s individual benefit -risk for continuing treatment. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will be responsible for monitoring safety throughout the duration of the study. Number of Patients This global study wi ll enroll approximately 200 patients with congenital hemophilia A who have persistent inhibitors against FVIII at enrollment. The patients are expected to be enrolled at approximately 85 sites globally. Target Population Inclusion Criteria Patients must me et the following criteria for study entry: 1.

Adequate hepatic function, defined as total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) (excluding Gilbert’s syndrome) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 ×ULN at the time of screening; no clinical signs or known laboratory/radiographic evidence consistent with cirrhosis 8. Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 × ULN and creatinine clearance by Cockcroft -Gault formula ≥ 30 mL/min 9. For wome n of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least five elimination half -lives (24 weeks) after the last dose of emicizumab: • A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she i s postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus) • Examples of highly effective cont raceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include proper use of combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. Alternati vely, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of < 1% per year. Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a non -lipid-based spermicide • The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptab le methods of contraception. Exclusion Criteria Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry: 1. Inherited or acquired bleeding disorder other than hemophilia A 2. Ongoing (or plan to receive during the study) immune toleranc e induction (ITI) therapy (prophylaxis regimens with FVIII and/or bypassing agents must be discontinued prior to enrollment).

Pregnancy or lactation, or intent to become pregnant during the study 13. Positive serum pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to initiation of emicizu mab (females only) End of Study and Length of Study The approximate length of the entire study from the first patient enrolled to the last patient, last visit (LPLV; see below) is approximately 3 years. For each individual patient, the study is expected to last approximately 2 years (patients will receive 3 mg/kg/week emicizumab for the first 4 weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week emicizumab for the remainder of the 2 -year treatment period). Patients who discontinue emicizumab prior to the completion of the 2 -year treatment period will undergo a Safety Follow -up Visit 24 weeks after the patient’s last emicizumab dose or at 2 years after emicizumab treatment start, whichever occurs first. The end of this study is defined as the date when the last remaining pati ent has completed the last visit (i.e., LPLV). The study will end when all patients have been treated with emicizumab for 2 years, or earlier, if one of the following is documented: Withdrawal of consent OR Completed the Safety Follow -up Visit 24 weeks aft er discontinuing emicizumab OR Lost to follow -up OR Death. Investigational Medicinal Products Test Product (Investigational Drug) Emicizumab will be administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg/week subcutaneously for 4 weeks when initiating treatment, followed by 1. 5 mg/kg/week subcutaneously for the remainder of the 2 -year treatment period. There will be an option to increase the dose to 3 mg/kg/week in cases of insufficient control of bleeds on the 1.5 mg/kg/week emicizumab dose. If the investigator believes that a specific patient warrants dose up -titration following the occurrence of, for example, at least two spontaneous bleeds, significant bleeds, or a traumatic bleed out of proportion to the degree of injury, they must discuss the case with the Medical Monitor for consideration and potential approval. To support home administration of the drug, patients/caregivers will be required to complete in -person, instructional training on how to administer emicizumab as a subcutaneous (SC) injection. Patients/caregivers w ill be taught to perform the injections utilizing the Instructions for Use document. In addition, the healthcare provider (HCP) is to inform the patient/caregiver of the volumetric dose to be administered and the dosing frequency. The patients/caregivers will observe at least one SC injection performed by a HCP and will need to successfully administer at least one SC injection under an HCP’s supervision prior to starting home administration. The patient/caregiver will also have the opportunity to ask any qu estions to the HCP before starting home administration. The first three weekly treatments will be administered in a monitored setting, such as an infusion center, clinic, or hospital, in conjunction with emicizumab PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments. Patients will be observed"
82,page_82,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 82 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 for a minimum of 60 minutes after the first three doses. Patients/caregivers will be instructed on how to recognize signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) and obtain emergency care in the event of such reaction s occurring. Each site will have the discretion to provide additional training or include additional observation (e.g., after the third or fifth doses), if deemed appropriate. If, despite additional training, the investigator determines that the patient/ca regiver is unable to inject emicizumab, a trained and proficient caregiver or HCP should be identified to administer the SC injections. Patients/caregivers will be provided with contact information for the clinic in case they have questions related to self -administration between visits. Compliance in the home setting is to be monitored at each site by reviewing reported hemophilia medication use and recording collected used and unused vials. Statistical Methods Primary Safety Analyses The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of prophylactic administration of emicizumab in patients with congenital hemophilia A who have persistent inhibitors against FVIII at enrollment. Of primary interest in this study are the inc idence and severity of all adverse events, including thromboembolic events , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or TMA, systemic hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and anaphylactoid events. All adverse events will be assessed according to the World Health Organi zation (WHO) toxicity grading scale. The incidence, type, and grade of adverse events will be summarized according to the primary system -organ class (SOC) and, within each SOC, by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term. For ea ch adverse event, data will be provided on the timing (start and stop date, time of onset in comparison with last dose of emicizumab received, and doses of emicizumab received), severity, relationship to emicizumab , outcome, and effect on therapy. The data may be presented together with two -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson confidence intervals (CIs) if appropriate. In addition, as part of the safety evaluation, additional assessments will be summarized descriptively as follows: 1. Cumulative emicizumab doses, dose mo difications (delays and interruptions), and duration of exposure 2. Compliance with respect to emicizumab intake (planned vs. received) 3. Changes from baseline in physical examination findings 4. Vital signs over time: • Vital signs will be analyzed using descriptiv e statistics for continuous variables and presented graphically over time with associated 95% CIs. 5. Laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry): • These parameters will be presented in shift tables of WHO toxicity grade at baseline versus worst grade dur ing the treatment period. Selected laboratory parameters will be summarized in terms of mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Laboratory parameters will also be presented graphically over time. All safety variables will be analyzed for the safety population. For each variable, the number of available observations will be reported. The safety population includes all patients who have received at least one dose of emicizumab . The primary safety analysis will occur at the end of the study. The iDMC w ill evaluate the study data, including the emerging safety results, at periodic reviews and recommend to the Sponsor whether the protocol should be amended or the study should be stopped early. All summaries and analyses will be prepared by the Study Manag ement Team (SMT ) statistician and presented for iDMC review. Members of the iDMC will be external to the Sponsor and will follow a charter that outlines their roles and responsibilities. A detailed description of the statistical methods that will be used f or the primary and secondary analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)."

BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON HEMOPH ILIA A WITH INHIBITO RS Hemophilia A is a rare bleeding disorder that is attributable to a congenital absence or hypofunctioning of Factor VIII (FVIII) (Acharya 2013 ; Witmer and Young 2013 ). The gene that encodes FVIII is loc ated on the X chromosome. Genetic defects are expressed through X-linked recessive inheritance or de novo FVIII mutations, and more than 99% of hemophilia patients are males. The prevalence of hemophilia A is approximately 1 in 5,000 live -born males or 1 o ut of every 10,000 live births (CDC 2016; Franchini and Mannucci 2013; NIH 2013 ). No racial differences have been reported, and the numbers of patients registered in 2014 in various regions included 4,870 in Japan, 21,052 in North America, and 11,029 in just two European nations (United Kin gdom and France) (World Federation of Hemophilia 2014 ). Hemophilia A is most commonly caused by an inherited FVIII gene mutation within the Xq28 region of the X chromosome. It occurs almost exclusively in males who have one defective copy of the relevant gene on their X chromosome. As an aff ected male will transmit a normal Y chromosome to all his sons and an abnormal X chromosome to all his daughters, his sons will not be affected and all of his daughters will be carriers. For female carriers, with each birth there is a 50% chance to transmi t the disorder to male infants and a 50% chance for female infants to be a carrier. Females who are carriers of hemophilia A may experience bleeding symptoms similar to those seen in men with mild hemophilia A, as approximately 10% of carriers have a FVIII activity that is less than 35% (Plug et al. 2006 ). Rarely, women have more severe bleeding symptoms requiring treatment and may develop FVIII inhib itors. Approximately 30% of patients with hemophilia A do not have a family history of the disorder; these cases arise from spontaneous FVIII gene mutations. The main bleeding sites are intra -articular, intramuscular, subcutaneous (SC), intraoral, intracra nial, gastrointestinal, and intranasal (Karaman et al. 2015; Srivastava et al. 2013 ). Repeated intra -articular bleeding is a major factor that decreases health -related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with hemophilia A, because it may progress to hemophilic arthropathy with walking difficulties, and joint replacement surgery may eventually be necessary. The absence or functional deficiency of FVIII leads to a lifelong bleeding tendency. Common clinical signs of hemophilia A include easy bruising; prolonged bleeding after trauma or surgery; spontaneous bleeding into joints, muscles, or soft tissues; and intracranial hemorrhage. The severity of hemophilia A is classified in accordance with endogenous FVIII activity in the blood. Patients with FVIII activity of less than 1% have severe disease, those with activity between 1% and 5% have moderate disease, and those with activity greater than 5% and less than 40% have mild disease. Patients who have severe hemophilia who do not initiate and/or comply with rigorous FVIII prophylaxis regimens, or do not have access to FVIII products, experience bleeding episodes several times a month, which is much mor e frequent than in patients with moderate or mild disease. In addition, patients with severe hemophilia have a high frequency of spontaneous bleeding. Hence, the maintenance of plasma FVIII activity at 1% or higher is important to prevent the onset of recu rrent bleeding episodes, reduce comorbidities such as arthropathy, and improve HRQoL in patients with severe hemophilia A (Srivastava et al. 2013 )."
89,page_89,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 89 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 The standard therapy for patients with hemophilia A is intravenous (IV) FVIII replacement therapy with recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) products or plasma -derived Factor VIII (pdFVIII) concentrates. FVIII replacement treatment regimens can be broadly categorized into two types: episodic or on -demand therapy (in which FVIII concentrates are administered in response to the occurrence of bleeding symptoms) and prophylactic (in which they are administered on a scheduled basis to prevent the onset of bleeding symptoms). Prophylaxis has been shown to markedly reduce the bleed rate in adult patients with severe hem ophilia A (Manco -Johnson et al. 2013; Valentino et al. 2012 ). Prophylactic therapy aims to maintain FVIII activity levels ab ove 1% or higher and effectively prevents the onset or progression of hemophilic arthropathy by providing a minimum concentration of FVIII to avert spontaneous bleeding, particularly in the case of repeated bleeding into joints. The treatment regimens used to achieve optimal prevention of bleeding events vary on an individual basis; some patients will need trough FVIII levels of 1%, whereas others require higher trough FVIII levels to achieve the desired therapeutic outcome (Ahnström et al. 2004; Collins et al. 2010 ). Current standard prophylactic regimens commonly use infusion therapy administered three times weekly; other regimens require every other day administration, depending on the patient ’s needs (Shapiro 2013 ). In developed countries, the availability and overall util ization of FVIII prophylaxis has increased in recent years due to the therapeutic advantages conferred by this type of therapy and expansion of the rFVIII concentrate supply (Geraghty et al. 200 6). In such countries, the current standard of care for children with severe hemophilia A is primary prophylaxis, which involves regular FVIII infusions that are started following their first bleed, or by 2 years of age, with the aim of avoiding the devel opment of any joint abnormality in the future (Astermark 2003; Manco -Johnson et al. 2007 ). The required adherence to demanding therapeutic regimens, that involve frequent morning infusions to achieve adequate hemostatic coverage during periods of highest activity, reduces patient compliance thereby makin g these regimens less effective and compromising their cost -benefit ratio (Thornburg 2010 ). Major issues with current regimens are the need for adequate venous access and patient/family compliance with regular prophylaxis, especially in the very young pediatric population. In this population, central v enous access devices (CVADs) have been used to overcome technical difficulties. Although CVADs make prophylaxis feasible in young children, they are associated with complications, including mechanical failure, dehiscence of the skin over the reservoir, inf ection, and thrombosis (Ewenstein et al. 2004 ). In addition, significant healthcare provider (HCP) e fforts are required to manage optimal treatment solutions and to overcome identified issues (Schrijvers et al. 2013 ). Thus, both the disease and potential therapeutic options have the potential to affect HRQoL, the latter through limitations on daily activities. The development of inhibitory alloantibodies (inhibitors) occu rs in approximately 20%−30% of patients with severe hemophilia A and in 3%−13% of those with moderate or mild disease (Franchini and Mannu cci 2013 ). Inhibitors neutralize the activity of endogenous FVIII as well as of FVIII administered as replacement therapy. For patients with a history of a high -titer inhibitor ( ≥ 5 Bethesda units [BU]/mL) following a re -challenge with FVIII administration (high -responding inhibitor), the only hemostatic options currently available are pro - thrombotic coagulation factors that augment other parts of the coagulation cascade (i.e., “bypassing agents”). Bypassing products include Factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity (FEIBA), an activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC; FEIBA will be referred to as"
90,page_90,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 90 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 aPCC throughout this document), and NovoSeven® (recombinant activated human Fa ctor VII [rFVIIa]; NovoSeven® will be referred to as rFVIIa throughout this document) (Srivastava et al. 2013 ). Both of these products have been used as prophylactic therapies to prevent bleeding in patients with inhibitors against FVIII. However, in most countries, the only available product for this indication is the aPCC FEIBA. aPCCs may be associated with side effects, such as thromboembolic events, hypersensitivity reactions, myocardial infarction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (Bui et al. 2002; Dentali et al. 2011; Tjønnfjord 2004; Wójcik et al. 2009 ). Both aPCC and rFVIIa are administered intravenously, with aPCC prophylaxis requiring every other day dosing and rFVIIa requiring daily (or more frequent) dosing. The development of effective prophylactic treatment options with less frequent dosing requirements is a high, unmet medical need in the population of patients with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors. Reducing the time and burden associated with frequent IV dosing and the im pact of the disease on aspects of physical health and other areas of functioning and well-being, while promoting increased efficacy, may further improve HRQoL. This hypothesis is supported by a study in which patients receiving a prophylactic treatment wit h FEIBA had improved HRQoL than those who received episodic therapy (i.e., administered following bleeds) with FEIBA ( Gringeri et al. 2013 ). Therefore, despite major therapeutic advances in the treatment of hemophilia A, opportunities still remain to optim ize and transform therapy, in particular for patients with inhibitors. 1.2 BACKGROUND ON EMICIZ UMAB Emicizumab (also known as ACE910, CH5534262, and RO5534262) is a recombinant, humanized, bispecific, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds wit h moderate affinity to activated Factor IX (FIXa) and Factor X (FX), thereby mimicking the co - factor function of FVIII. In patients with hemophilia A, hemostasis can be restored irrespective of the presence of FVIII inhibitors, as emicizumab shares no sequ ence homology with FVIII. Emicizumab therefore has no potential to induce or enhance the development of direct inhibitors to FVIII or other coagulation factors. In addition, emicizumab offers the possibility of SC administration, removing the need for veno us access. Finally, because of the expected pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of this antibody, markedly extending the dosing interval to once weekly or even more, this compound has the potential to improve the treatment of patients with hemophilia A with an d without FVIII inhibitors who are in need of effective, safe, and convenient prophylactic therapy. 1.2.1 Preclinical Experience As mentioned above, emicizumab binds with moderate affinity in the low μM range to FIXa and FX and mimics the co -factor activity of FVIII. Preclinical studies have shown that mimicking FVIII activity promotes the activation of FX by FIXa and subsequent act ivation of downstream coagulation factors, considerable increases in thrombin generation, and the achievement of hemostasis at the site of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A who have hypofunctional levels of, or entirely lack, FVIII, irrespective of th e presence of FVIII inhibitors (Sampei et al. 2013 ). Preclinical studies investigating emicizumab binding to cynomolgus monkey Factor IX (FIX) and FX found that similar affinities were observed in both humans and monkeys. Mechanistic in vitro studies were conducted in human and cynomol gus FVIII -"
91,page_91,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 91 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 neutralized plasma and in various coagulation factor -specific assay testing systems. These studies revealed that emicizumab shortened activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and promoted thrombin generation. Binding experiments of emicizumab to a panel of human Fcγ receptors (hFcγRs) and cynomolgus monkey Fcγ receptors (cyFcγRs) showed that comparable binding to hFcγR and to cyFcγR was observed with emicizumab and two commercial therapeutic antibodies, namely rituximab and natalizumab. Likewi se, binding of emicizumab to the human and cynomolgus monkey neonatal Fc receptor was comparable to that of natalizumab. In vivo pharmacology experiments were conducted using a hemophilia A cynomolgus monkey model where endogenous FVIII levels were neutral ized by a FVIII specific monoclonal antibody. This model mimics the essential characteristics of patients with hemophilia A and was used to test in vivo pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy of emicizumab. In a needle−induced trauma investigation, the SC and IV administration of emicizumab inhibited the decrease in hemoglobin level compared with the control group and also significantly reduced the area of br uising on the skin surface. SC administration of high dose (200 mg/kg) emicizumab demonstrated pro -coagulant activity, with a significant reduction in bleeding tendency. In addition, increased levels of aPTT (due to FVIII neutralization) were completely no rmalized by 200 mg/kg emicizumab compared to untreated controls. In a cynomolgus monkey FVIII−neutralized hemophilia A spontaneous−bleeding investigation, emicizumab prevented intra -articular bleeding and other bleeding symptoms characteristic of hemophili a A following repeated weekly SC doses of 1 mg/kg/week subsequent to a single SC starting dose of 3.97 mg/kg. Overall, no increased bleeding tendency has been observed in any of the cynomolgus monkey studies. Potential prothrombotic risks associated with e micizumab -induced FVIII mimetic activity were further explored in an in vivo cynomolgus monkey venous stasis model. In this model, thrombus formation was evaluated in the presence of emicizumab, FVIII, or bypass agents activated Factor VII (FVIIa). Emicizu mab did not induce more thrombus formation than that seen with FVIIa and FVIII. Overall, the preclinical pharmacology program is considered to have fully characterized the preclinical profile of emicizumab. The conducted in vitro and in vivo studies demons trated the mode of action of emicizumab and provided supportive data on efficacious dose levels, through the use of a relevant hemophilia A disease model, which were subsequently used for dose extrapolation to humans. The PK/toxicokinetics of emicizumab we re assessed in cynomolgus monkeys after single and multiple doses were administered IV and through the intended clinical SC route. After a single IV dose of 6 mg/kg emicizumab to male cynomolgus monkeys, the plasma clearance was 3.69 mL/day/kg and the term inal plasma half -life (t 1/2) of emicizumab was 19.4 days. The volume of distribution at steady state (V ss) was 98.1 mL/kg, which is approximately twice the plasma volume in monkeys, suggesting that emicizumab has low tissue penetration. A single SC adminis tration study (dose levels: 0.06, 0.6, and 6 mg/kg) indicated that emicizumab exhibited slow (time to maximum plasma concentration [t max]: 3.0−5.3 days) and complete absorption (bioavailability [BA]: 102% at 6 mg/kg). IV and SC multiple dosing studies (tox icokinetic monitoring) revealed a t 1/2 in the range of 14.9−30.8 days. Overall, exposures, in terms of maximum plasma concentration (C max) and area under the curve"
92,page_92,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 92 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 (AUC), increased in an approximately dose proportional manner. No differences in PK paramete rs were observed between sexes. The formation of anti -emicizumab antibodies (which is expected with humanized monoclonal antibodies) was observed in a subset of the cynomolgus monkeys treated with repeated doses of emicizumab. In addition, a few animals al so developed neutralizing antibodies. The formation of anti -emicizumab antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in cynomolgus monkeys is not thought to be predictive of the response observed in humans. Acute and repeat -dose toxicity, including local toleranc e assessments, were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys in 4 -, 13-, and 26 -week SC dose toxicity studies (doses up to 30 mg/kg weekly) and a 4 -week IV dose toxicity study (doses up to 100 mg/kg weekly). No toxicologically relevant changes attributable to the S C or IV administration of emicizumab were observed; the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was the highest tested dose in each toxicity study. Refer to the emicizumab Investigator's Brochure for additional details on the preclinical studies with emic izumab. 1.2.2 Clinical Experience Currently available experience with emicizumab in humans includes data from two completed Phase I studies (ACE001JP and JP29574), one ongoing Phase I/II study (ACE002JP) extension in hemophilia A patients, and two ongoing Phase III studies in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors (adult patients - BH29884; pediatric patients – BH29992). The clinical development program in adult and pediatric patients with hemophilia A (both with and without FVIII inhibitors) is ongoing for emiciz umab. Refer to the emicizumab Investigator's Brochure for details on the preclinical and clinical studies. 1.2.2.1 Studies ACE001JP and ACE002JP ACE001JP was a single study conducted in three parts, which included both healthy subjects (Part A and Part B) and pati ents with hemophilia A (Part C). The objective of Parts A and B in healthy subjects was to investigate the tolerability, safety, PK, and PD response of SC -administered emicizumab in adult Japanese and Caucasian men and to evaluate for racial differences, i f any, in their PK and PD response. A total of 64 healthy male volunteers were enrolled in Parts A and B. In Part C, the objective was to investigate the tolerability, safety, PK, and PD response of SC -administered emicizumab in patients 1259 years of age with congenital hemophilia A who had previous documentation of bleeds and/or coagulation factor treatment in the last 6 months. A total of 18 patients were enrolled in Part C . Patients who participated in Part C of Study ACE001JP were offered the opportun ity to continue in the extension study (ACE002JP). In order to be eligible for the extension study, patients must have completed 12 weeks of assigned treatment in Study ACE001JP and had bleeds prior to study entry. After administration of emicizumab to pa tients with hemophilia A, annualized bleeding rates ( ABRs) decreased in all patients in Studies ACE001JP and ACE002JP compared with the pre -treatment period, regardless of whether or not they had FVIII inhibitors, with the exception of one patient in the"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 93 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 3 mg/kg/week group who was previously treated with FVIII prophylaxis and had a baseline ABR of 0 (in this patient, the ABR was maintained at 0 while receiving emicizumab). Among all patients, percentage reduction in ABR ranged from 22.8% to 100% in the 0.3 mg/kg/week group, from 57.5% to 100% in the 1 mg/kg/week group, and from 90.1% to 100% in the 3 mg/kg/week group. The safety data from completed studies of healthy male volunteers (Japanese and Caucasian) in ACE001JP Parts A and B (n=48) showed that emiciz umab was well tolerated and the incidence of adverse events was similar in the emicizumab dosing groups and the placebo group. Moreover, no racial differences or dose -dependent increases in the incidence of adverse events were observed. There were no serio us adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, or deaths in either study. From ACE001JP Part C and its ongoing extension ACE002JP (as of the cut -off date 15 February 2016), most adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, except for 2 severe adverse events (appendicitis and mesenteric hematoma). The majority of the adverse events were not considered related to emicizumab (see the Emicizumab Investigator’s Brochure). 1.2.2.2 JP29574 Completed Study JP29574 included 5 groups of 12 healthy Japan ese volunteers. This study investigated the relative bioavailability between Phase I/II 80 mg/mL formulation and Phase III 150 mg/mL formulation materials and among three different sites of injection, as well as the absolute bioavailability. Results showed no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events observed by formulation, injection site, or administration route. 1.2.2.3 Studies BH29884 and BH29992 The HAVEN 1 study (BH29884; NCT02622321) was a randomized, multicenter, open -label, clinical trial in 109 adult and adolescent males (aged 12 to 75 years and > 40 kg) with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic (on -demand) or prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents. Patients received weekly emicizumab prophylaxis (Arms A, C, and D), 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg once weekly thereafter, or no prophylaxis (Arm B). Dose up -titration to 3 mg/kg once weekly was allowed after 24 weeks on emicizumab prophylaxis in case of suboptimal effi cacy (i.e., ≥ 2 spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds). During the study, two patients underwent up -titration of their maintenance dose to 3 mg/kg once weekly. Fifty -three patients previously treated with episodic (on -demand) bypassing agents were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm A) or no prophylaxis (Arm B), with stratification by prior 24 -week bleed rate (< 9 or ≥ 9). Patients randomized to Arm B could switch to emicizumab prophylaxis after completing at least 24 we eks without prophylaxis. Forty -nine patients previously treated with prophylactic bypassing agents were enrolled into Arm C to receive emicizumab prophylaxis. Seven patients previously treated with episodic (on -demand) bypassing agents who had participated in a non -interventional study (NIS) prior to enrollment, but were unable to enroll into HAVEN 1 prior to the closure of Arms A and B, were enrolled into Arm D to receive emicizumab prophylaxis. Efficacy was evaluated based on the ABR requiring treatment w ith coagulation factors (minimum of 24 weeks or date of discontinuation) among patients previously treated with episodic bypassing"

No patients tested positive for anti - emicizumab antibodies in HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2 (n = 171). Four patients tested positive for anti - emicizumab antibodies in the dose -finding trial (n = 18). The anti -emicizumab antibody positive rate may be under -reported due to the limitation of the assay (US Prescribing Information). 1.2.2.6 Peri-Operative Management of Patients on Emicizumab The safety and efficacy of emicizumab has not been specifically tested in patients undergoing procedures or surgeries. Limited data are available from pivotal clinical trials, where hemophilia A patients with inhibitors receiving emicizumab prophylaxis underwent procedures and surgeries, either w ith or without the additional use of bypassing agents. The use of bypassing agents was at the investigator's discretion. Procedures/surgeries that were performed without peri -operative bypassing agent use and did not result in a bleed included skin biopsy, tooth extraction or restoration, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, ultrasound fluid aspiration, and port or central line removal. Other procedures/surgeries which were performed with peri -operative bypassing agent use (preventive and/or treatment fo r bleeds) included central line catheter placement, tooth extractions and appendectomy. One hip replacement was performed with peri -operative bypassing agent (rFVIIa) and FVIII use (preventive and treatment for bleed) as well as tranexamic acid. No emiciz umab dose adjustments are recommended for patients undergoing procedures or surgeries. Thorough documentation of surgeries will be requested. The available data are insufficient to provide specific dosing guidance for the use of bypassing agents or FVIII i n peri -operative settings. If bypassing agents or FVIII are required in the peri -operative period, please refer to the dosing guidance for those concomitant medications in Section 4.4 and in the emicizumab Investigator’s Brochure. 1.3 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEF IT-RISK ASSESSMENT For patients with hemophilia A who are diagnosed with inhibitors, permanent eradication of these inhibitors is currently the ultimate aim of therapy. This can be achieved by means of intensive FVIII administration over many months with i mmune tolerance induction (ITI), which is successful in approximately 60%−80% of treated patients with inhibitors (Hay and DiMichele 2012 ; Santagostino et al. 2009 ). However, effective hemostatic management m ay be challenging during the time interval required to achieve ITI success. Furthermore, ITI is not viewed as a viable option for patients with inhibitors in many countries, owing to its high cost, the scarce local supply of FVIII concentrates, practical i ssues and potential complications associated with CVADs, and the psychological stress on patients and their families of this highly demanding therapeutic endeavor. Finally, even with successful implementation, ITI will fail to eradicate inhibitors in a siz eable proportion (21%−47%) of treated patients (Mariani et al. 2003 ). For those patients with in hibitors who are unable to eradicate their inhibitors or are not candidates for ITI, bypassing agents are required to treat or prevent bleeds. Unfortunately, the hemostatic effect of bypassing agents is unstable in comparison with that of FVIII concentrate s. In addition, as opposed to the 8−12 -hour t 1/2 and 15−20 -minute infusion time"
100,page_100,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 100 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 of FVIII, rFVIIa has a short t 1/2 of only 2−3 hours and aPCC requires a 25−50 -minute infusion (with a t 1/2 of 4−7 hours). rFVIIa therefore requires frequent and aPCC requires e xtended IV infusions. In practice, some patients with inhibitors will have bleeds that respond better to rFVIIa while other patients will respond better to aPCC. Several publications evaluating the efficacy of prophylactic therapy in adults and children wi th the bypassing agents rFVIIa (Konkle et al. 2007 ) and aPCC (Antunes et al. 2014 ; Ettingshausen and Kreuz 2010 ; Leissinger et al. 2011, 2007 ) indicated that these treatments decreased bleeding rates compared with episodic treatment. Follo wing the clinical results obtained, aPCC was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a prophylactic treatment in inhibitor patients in December 2013. Despite this, the use of prophylactic bypassing agents has yet to be established as the stan dard of care. Given the hemostatic management challenges in adults and children with inhibitors, there is a clinical need for therapeutics that have a lower treatment burden, more reliable efficacy, and an extended t 1/2 that can be used for preventing blee ding in patients with hemophilia A. In the Phase I/II study (ACE001JP) 18 Japanese patients with hemophilia A, either with or without inhibitors, were treated with emicizumab at three different dosing regimens (0.3 mg/kg/week, 1 mg/kg/week, or 3 mg/kg/wee k). During the course of emicizumab administration, the ABR significantly decreased in all patients compared with the ABR prior to study enrollment, regardless of whether or not the patient had inhibitors, with the exception of one patient without inhibito rs in the 3 mg/kg/week group (see Section 1.2.2 ). Emicizumab has been well tolerated in patients in the Phase I/II studies (cut -off date 15th February 2016). The majority of adverse events have been mild in inte nsity, with the most common being ISRs. The majority of the adverse events have not been considered to be related to emicizumab. In these studies, no thromboembolic or systemic hypersensitivity adverse events have been observed. However, as of April 2017 , three cases of TMA , and three thromboembolic events in two patients, have been observed in the ongoing Phase III Study BH29884 in patients who received emicizumab as well as bypassing agents for the treatment of breakthrough bleeds. Four of these patients have fully recovered and the fifth patient died (death due to serious adverse event of rectal haemorrhage unrelated to emicizumab, with the TMA related to emicizumab and aPCC) (see Sections 0 and 0). Given the unmet need to develop novel therapeutics for use in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors and the positive risk -benefit assessment observed, a Phase IIIb safety study with emicizumab is warranted in this patient population. 2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPO INTS This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of emicizumab in patients with congenital hemophilia A who have persistent inhibitors against FVIII at enrollment. Specific objectives and corresponding endpoints for the study are outlined below ( Table )."

The use of aPCC for breakthrough bleed treatment for patients on emicizumab should be avoided if possible, and rFVIIa should be the first option used to treat, starting with no more than 90 µg/kg as an initial dose. If aPCC needs to be used, no more than 50 IU/kg should be administered as an initial dose and doses of > 100 U/kg/24 hours or more should be avoided, as cases of TMA and thrombotic events were reported when on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U/kg/24 hours aPCC was administered for 24 hours or more.

When a bleed has occurred, patients (or their legally authorized representative) will be required to report bleed information on an ePRO device where possible , including site of bleed, type of bleed, time of each individual bleed (day, start and stop time), and treatment for bleed (e.g., other than emicizumab in case of breakthrough bleeds). The reason for the use of rFVIIa will be documented (e.g., bleeding, preventative dose before activity). Thorough documentation of the treatments for bleeds and/or surgeries will be requested, including agent, start time, dose, route of administration, and number of infusions needed to treat the bleed. Local and central laboratory assessments are required to monitor the risk for thromboembolic events or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or TMA, as per the Schedule of Activities (Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities ), if bypassing agents are used to treat a breakthrough bleed. Investigators will be asked to contact the Medical Monitor in the event of suspected lack or loss of efficacy of emicizumab in order to discuss a potential increase in emicizumab dose to 3 mg/kg/week and additional laboratory evaluations (e.g., coagulation t ests), as well as to re - evaluate the patient’s individual benefit -risk for continuing treatment. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will be responsible for monitoring safety the duration of the study. 3.2 END OF STUDY AND LEN GTH OF STUDY The appro ximate length of the entire study from the first patient enrolled to the last patient, last visit (LPLV; see below ) is approximately 3 years. For each individual patient, the study is expected to last approximately 2 years (patients will receive 3 mg/kg/we ek emicizumab for the first 4 weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week emicizumab for the remainder of the 2 -year treatment period). Patients who discontinue emicizumab prior to the completion of the 2 -year treatment period will undergo a Safety Follow -up Visit 24 weeks after the patient’s last emicizumab dose or at 2 years after emicizumab treatment start, whichever occurs first. The end of this study is defined as the date when the last remaining patient has completed the last visit (i.e., LPLV). The study will e nd when all patients have been treated with emicizumab for 2 years, or earlier, if one of the following is documented: Withdrawal of consent OR"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 105 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 In study BH29884, the ABR was 2.9 events (95% CI, 1.7 to 5.0) among participants who were randomly assigned to emicizumab prophylaxis (Group A, 35 participants) versus 23.3 events (95% CI, 12.3 to 43.9) among those assigned to no prophylaxis (Group B, 18 participants), representing a significant difference of 87% in favor of emicizumab prophylaxis (p<0.001). A total of 22 participants in Group A (63%) had zero bleeding events, as compared with 1 participant (6%) in Group B. Among 24 participants in Gro up C who had participated in a NIS, emicizumab prophylaxis resulted in a bleeding rate that was significantly lower by 79% than the rate with previous bypassing -agent prophylaxis (p<0.001) ( Oldenburg et al. 2017 ). The exposure -response relationship for emi cizumab was quantitatively characterized and simulations suggested that the trough concentration of emicizumab needed for almost complete inhibition of bleeding onset is ≥ 45 µg/mL. On the basis of population PK modeling, a median trough plasma concentrati on of 45 μg/mL is predicted to be achieved after treatment with 4 weekly doses of 3 mg/kg and maintained, thereafter, with weekly doses of 1.5 mg/kg. In light of this finding, the loading dose of 3 mg/kg emicizumab per week for 4 weeks was chosen in order to rapidly achieve the effective trough concentration of 45 μg/mL without exceeding the maximum dose of 3 mg/kg weekly investigated in the Phase I/II studies. Thereafter, a dose and schedule of 1.5 mg/kg weekly was chosen in order to reduce the peak -trough fluctuations and to maintain emicizumab plasma concentrations above 45 μg/mL over the entire dosing interval. This dosing regimen (i.e., 3 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg weekly) will, therefore, be investigated in this study. A study durat ion of approximately 2 years for each individual patient has been chosen in order to thoroughly assess the long -term safety of prophylactic use of emicizumab. 3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population Patients with congenital hemophilia A who have persistent inhibi tors against FVIII at enrollment will comprise the primary population for this Phase IIIb study investigating the safety, tolerability, efficacy, immunogenicity, and PK of prophylactic administration of emicizumab. Patients may have received episodic or pr ophylactic treatment before enrollment; at least one documented treatment with bypassing agents or FVIII concentrates is required within the last 6 months to indicate the need for prophylactic emicizumab treatment. Based on current treatment algorithms for patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors (Kempton and White II 2009; Srivastava et al. 2013 ), it is anticipated that the majority of adults and adolescents treate d with emicizumab will have previously undergone ITI without success or are not candidates for ITI. As clinical safety data relating to the concomitant use of prophylactic emicizumab during ITI are not available at this time, patients currently receiving I TI will not be eligible for this study. Patients receiving ITI therapy will be eligible following the completion of a 72 -hour washout period prior to the first emicizumab administration. Owing to the fact that the presence or amount of FVIII inhibitors i n their plasma does not impact the efficacy of emicizumab, patients’ inhibitor titers at the time of study entry will not influence their study eligibility."
106,page_106,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 106 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group This study involves the use of a single -arm study design and therefore a control group will not be used. The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of prophylactic administration of emicizumab in patients with congenital hemophilia A who have persistent inhibitors against FVIII . As hemophilia A is a rare disease (Acharya 2013 ) and the study is desi gned to investigate the broad safety profile of emicizumab , approximately 200 patients will be enrolled. Given the size of the patient population, a single - arm study design without a control group is considered an appropriate method to capture the safety d ata that will be observed following the use of emicizumab. This type of study design has been used extensively in previous clinical studies involving patients with rare diseases (Bell and Tudur Smith 2014 ). 3.3.4 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments The identity of effective PD, safety, and bone and joint biomarkers has not been fu lly elucidated and further testing is required to determine which assays and technical conditions are most suitable for use with emicizumab treatment. Plasma and serum samples will be collected for PD, safety, and bone and joint biomarker assessments at sp ecific clinic visits in order to obtain evidence of the biologic activity of emicizumab in patients (see Appendix 2 Schedule of Biomarker Samples ). The PD biomarkers include, but are not limited to, coagulation assays such as aPTT and FVIII activity assays. The results of the Phase I/II study have shown that a dose -response relationship was apparent between aPTT and emicizumab concentration (for more information, see the Investigator’s Brochure). The aPTT assay will be run i n a modified form to ensure that the assay range covers all levels of emicizumab exposure. In addition, clot waveform analysis (CWA) may be run as an exploratory PD coagulation assay. The safety biomarkers will be used to monitor patient safety throughout the study and may include, but are not limited to, D -dimer. Exploratory safety coagulation system biomarkers will include Factor VIII antigen (FVIII:Ag), Factor IX antigen (FIX:Ag), and Factor X antigen (FX:Ag) to assess whether drug treatment causes alter ations in the circulating levels of the coagulation factors that are the binding targets for emicizumab. Measurement of other coagulation or hemophilia -related factors may also be conducted. The bone and joint biomarkers will include exploratory biomarkers of bone turnover and joint health. The selection of bone and joint biomarkers that will be tested will be based on findings from biomarker analyses in other emicizumab trials (see Appendix 2 Schedule of Biomarker Samples ). Residual blood and/or, plasma, and serum from collected biomarker samples may be stored for up to 5 years after the final Clinical Study Report has been completed and may be used for additional exploratory emicizumab -related research, to guide development of potential in"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 107 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 vitro diagnostic assay(s) related to emicizumab plasma concentration, FVIII inhibitor titre and/or coagulation activity . 3.3.5 Rationale for P harmacokinetic Sample Collection Schedule PK samples will be collected throughout the 2-year study period in order to further investigate the PK of emicizumab (see the Schedule of Activities ; Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities ). 3.3.6 Rationale for Immunogenicity Sample Collection Immunogenicity will be monitored by investigati ng the incidence and clinical significance of antibodies to emicizumab at specified time points (see the Schedule of Activities ; Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities ). The emergence of anti-drug antibodies ( ADAs ) has been pr eviously observed in clinical studies involving monoclonal antibodies of the IgG4 class (Lundkvist et al. 2012; Vennegoor et al. 2013 ). 3.3.7 Rationale for Disease Response –based Endpoin ts The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic administration of emicizumab. This objective will be achieved by investigating the number of bleeds over time under emicizumab treatment , assessing HRQoL , and evaluating h ealth status according to EQ -5D-5L and patient preference for the emicizumab regimen compared with the previous regimen . As mentioned in Section 0, this analysis will occur when all patients have completed 2 years of treatment or have withdrawn, whichever occurs sooner. In order to obtain comprehensive data on each bleed, patients will be asked to report bleed information on an ePRO device where possible , including site of bleed, type of bleed, time of each indiv idual bleed (day, start and stop time), and treatment for bleed. Conducting the efficacy analysis after 2 years of therapy is supported by the results of previous clinical studies that have demonstrated the benefits of long -term prophylactic therapy in pat ients with hemophilia (Gringeri et al. 2011; Khawaji et al. 2012; Manco - Johnson et al. 2007 ). The results of thes e studies showed that prophylactic treatment could effectively prevent joint damage, decrease the frequency of joint and other hemorrhages, and lead to improvements in the patients’ HRQoL. 3.3.8 Rationale for Primary Endpoint Selection As stated in Section 0, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of prophylactic administration of emicizumab. In order to achieve this objective, the incidence and severity of all adverse ev ents, including adverse events of special interest, will be captured on an ongoing basis, as they occur during the study. Physical examinations, vital signs, and laboratory values will be assessed as per the Schedule of Activities (Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities"
108,page_108,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 108 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 ). The bypassing agents that are currently used for treating patients with hemophilia A are associated with specific side effects, such as thromboembolic events, hypersensitivity reactions, myocardial infarction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (Bui et al. 2002; Dentali et al. 2011; Tjønnfjord 2004; Wójcik et al. 2009 ). In addition, these agents are administered according to a frequent dosing schedule, which may reduce patient compliance thereby making these regimens less effective and compromising their cost -benefit ratio (Thornburg 2010 ). Therefore, there currently exists an unmet need to develop novel therapeutics for use in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors. This study will provide long -term safety data on the prophylactic use of emicizumab. 3.3.9 Rationale for Interim Analyses Owing to the long -term nature of this study, interim analyses will be conducted in order to obtain accurate information on the safety, efficacy, immunogenicity, and PK of prophylactic emicizumab at specific points throughout the study. The first interim analysis will be performed once approximately 100 patients have received treatment with emicizumab for at least 24 weeks. A second interim analysis will be performed when approximately 100 patients have received treatment with emicizumab for at lea st 52 weeks. The data from these analyses will subsequently be presented to the iDMC in order to enable them to effectively monitor the study. 3.3.10 Rationale for Patient -reported Outcome (PRO) Assessments During the study, electronic capture of HRQoL, health st atus (EQ -5D-5L) will be obtained using an ePRO device. Patient preference data (EmiPref) will be collected on paper forms. HRQoL is an important outcome in the care of patients with hemophilia (Brown et al. 2009 ). HRQoL in hemophili c patients is multifaceted and is affected by disease symptoms (e.g., pain, bleeding), treatment (prophylactic, on demand, side effects), limitations on daily functioning, anxiety / depression, and time spent in hospital. The goal of measuring HRQoL is to quantify any treatment benefits from the patient perspective. Previous studies that have used the Hemophilia Quality of Life questionnaire (Haemo -QoL), a measure of HRQoL parameters affected by hemophilia in children and adolescents, have reported improvem ents in physical health, feelings, view of self, family relations, friend relations, perceived support, relation with others, participation in sports, dealing with hemophilia, views of treatment, views of the future, and relationships (Santagostino et al. 2014 ). Improvements in physical health, feelings, view of self, and participation in work have also been observed on the adult version of the measure, the Haem -A-QoL (Stasyshyn et al. 2014 ). The HRQoL measures employed in the current study will be used to investigate the impact of prophylactic administration of emicizumab in adolescents and adults with hemophilia A. In addition, the m easures will be used to evaluate the longitudinal changes in HRQoL with emicizumab compared with the previous treatment regimen that the patients received. The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized, preference -based measure of generic health status that is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments. It measures five dimensions"
109,page_109,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 109 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 of health: mobility, ability to self -care, ability to undertake usual activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety / depression. The EQ -5D-5L also assesses current overall heal th. The goal of measuring EQ -5D-5L is to assess the impact of treatment with emicizumab over time on overall hea lth and the different health dimensions. Data from the EQ -5D-5L can also be used to inform pharmacoeconomic evaluations. The study will also ev aluate patient preference for treatment (EmiPref). Previous studies have noted that patients express preference for treatments that do not have negative effects (e.g., pain that results from infusions), are not time -consuming, are not associated with high treatment burden, and have a goal of achieving a “normal life” (Cimino et al. 2014 ). The inclusion of a f it-for-purpose preference survey after the completion of 3 months of emicizumab treatment will provide information on whether SC emicizumab is preferred to the previous treatment and explore the potential underlying reasons for any findings. This assessmen t will be performed after 3 months as the patients will have gained sufficient experience with emicizumab and SC injection, while still being reliably able to recall their experience with their prior therapy. 4. MATERIALS AND METHOD S 4.1 PATIENTS This global stud y will enroll approximately 200 patients with congenital hemophilia A who have persistent inhibitors against FVIII at enrollment.

For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least five elimination half - lives (24 weeks) after the last dose of emicizu mab: • A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (r emoval of ovaries and/or uterus) • Examples of highly effective contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include proper use of combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormone -releasin g intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of < 1% per year. Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a non -lipid-based spermicide • The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto thermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 4.1.2 Exclusion Criteria Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry: 1.

Concurrent disease, treatment, or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that could interfere with the conduct of the study or that would, in the opinion of the investigator or Sponsor, preclude the patient’s safe participatio n in and completion of the study or interpretation of the study results 11. Receipt of: • Emicizumab in a prior investigational study • An investigational drug to treat or reduce the risk of hemophilic bleeds within five half-lives of last drug administration • A no n-hemophilia -related investigational drug within last 30 days or five half -lives, whichever is shorter • Any concurrent investigational drug. 12. Pregnancy or lactation, or intent to become pregnant during the study 13. Positive serum pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to initiation of emicizumab (females only) 4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLIND ING Study MO39129 is a single -arm, open -label study and therefore no treatment blinding will occur during this study. 4.3 STUDY TREATMENT The investigational medici nal product (IMP) for this study is emicizumab . 4.3.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Handling 4.3.1.1 Emicizumab Emicizumab drug product will be supplied by the Sponsor as a sterile colourless to pale yellow liquid for SC injection in a single -dose 3 -mL glass vial containi ng 1 mL of emicizumab . The recommended storage condition for emicizumab drug product is between 2°C and 8°C (36°F to 46°F), and protected from light. Vials should not be frozen or shaken. Each single -use vial contains 150 mg/mL emicizumab in a histidine -aspartic acid buffered solution (approximately pH 6.0), which contains arginine and Poloxamer 188. For information on the formulation and handling of emicizumab, see the Investigator's Brochure. 4.3.2 Dosage, Administration, and Compliance 4.3.2.1 Emicizumab Emicizumab wi ll be administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg/week subcutaneously for 4 weeks when initiating treatment, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week subcutaneously for the remainder of the 2 -year treatment period. There will be an option to increase the dose to 3 mg/kg/week in cases of insufficient control of bleeds on the 1.5 mg/kg/week emicizumab dose. If the investigator believes that a specific patient warrants dose up -titration following the occurrence of, for example, at least two spontaneous bleeds, significant bleeds, or a"
112,page_112,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 112 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 traumatic bleed out of proportion to the degree of injury, they must discuss the case with the Medical Monitor for consideration and potential approval. Recommended injection sites include the front of middle of the patient’s thighs, or the lower part of the patient’s abdomen below the navel. Avoid injecting within a 2” radius around the navel. If a caregiver is giving the injection, the outer area of the upper arms may also be used. For additional information re the administration of emicizumab, refer t o the Instructions for Use (IFU) document. If a patient has a systemic hypersensitivity reaction or a severe adverse reaction that may be attributable to emicizumab, subsequent doses should be withheld until the situation is discussed with the Medical Moni tor and approval to resume dosing is provided. Should certain, unanticipated events occur during the study that require treatment with multiple daily administrations of bypassing agents or FVIII concentrates for multiple days (e.g., non - elective surgery or severe/life -threatening bleeds), the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor immediately to discuss such cases and the management of future emicizumab doses. In order to be eligible for inclusion in the study, prophylaxis regimens with FVIII and/o r bypassing agents must be discontinued prior to enrollment . Any other emicizumab dose adjustment request will require discussion of the clinical case with, and approval from, the Medical Monitor. Study site HCPs will be initially trained on how to properl y prepare emicizumab and administer the correct calculated dose subcutaneously as described in the IFU document. To support home administration of the drug, patients/caregivers will be required to complete in-person, instructional training on how to admini ster emicizumab as a SC injection. Patients/caregivers will also be taught how to perform the injections through the use of the IFU document. In addition, the HCP is to inform the patient/caregiver of the volumetric dose to be administered and the dosing f requency. The patients/caregivers will observe at least one SC injection performed by a HCP and will need to successfully administer at least one SC injection under an HCP’s supervision prior to starting home administration. The patient/caregiver will also have the opportunity to ask any questions to the HCP before starting home administration. The first three weekly treatments will be administered in a monitored setting, such as an infusion center, clinic, or hospital, in conjunction with emicizumab PK and PD assessments. Patients will be observed for a minimum of 60 minutes after the first three doses. Patients/caregivers will be instructed on how to recognize signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) and obtain emergency care in the event of such reactions occurring. Each site will have the discretion to provide additional training or include additional observation (e.g., after the third or fifth doses), if deemed appropriate. If, despite additional training, the investigator determines th at the patient/caregiver is unable to inject emicizumab, a trained and proficient caregiver or HCP should be identified to administer the SC injections. Patients/caregivers will be provided with contact information for the clinic in case they have question s related to self -administration between visits. In order to minimize the number of injections for patients in certain weight categories, the administration of a single injection of up to 2 mL drug product solution may be permitted. This administration wil l require the combination of emicizumab drug product solution from up to two 1 -mL vials (i.e., vial pooling) aseptically into a single syringe, using a new transfer"
113,page_113,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 113 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 needle for each vial. The detailed procedure for vial pooling will be described in the IFU document. If the patient’s dose is > 2 mL, a second injection will be required. Medication administration error s during training will be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). If necessary, patients or their HCP may choose to continue admin istration of emicizumab within the clinic. Compliance in the home setting is to be monitored at each site by reviewing reported hemophilia medication use and recording collected used and unused vials. If the patient forgets or cannot administer emicizumab on the scheduled dosing day, emicizumab should be administered as soon as possible before the day of the next scheduled dose, and then the patient should resume the usual weekly dosing schedule. Do not double doses to make up for a missed dose. All four l oading doses of 3 mg/kg should be taken, even if this is done over a period or more than four weeks. Any overdose or incorrect administration of emicizumab should be noted on the Study Drug Administration eCRF. Adverse events associated with an overdose o r incorrect administration of emicizumab should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Section 0 summarizes available safety data related to overdosing of emicizumab. Patients and/or caregivers will be provided with alert cards, which they will be requested to carry at all times. These will include guidance on recognizing the signs/symptoms of thromboembolic events or allergic/anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions and how to obtain emergency care. In addition, ale rt cards are designed to notify non -study HCPs that emicizumab will interfere with certain coagulation laboratory tests (see the Investigator’s Brochure for more information) and that the investigator should be contacted for assistance in interpreting the test results. Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are provided in Section 5.1.1 . 4.3.3 Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability Emicizumab, the only IMP in the stud y, will be provided by the Sponsor . Accountability for each vial is required and the study site will acknowledge the receipt of IMP using the interactive voice or web -based response system (IxRS) to confirm shipment condition and content. Any damaged shipm ents will be replaced. Used and unused emicizumab vials will be returned by the patients to the study site and appropriately accounted for. Used emicizumab vials will then be disposed of at the study site according to institutional standard operating proce dures. Instructions regarding how to handle unused vials should be obtained from the Sponsor. If the investigator prefers to destroy the IMP at his or her site , the site's method of IMP destruction must be agreed to by the Sponsor. The site must obtain wri tten authorization from the Sponsor before any IMP is destroyed, and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form . Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of by the study site should be recorded on the Drug Inventory Log."

Given that circulating emicizumab may increase the patient’s coagulation potential, the doses required to achieve hemostasis may be lower than doses used prior to starting emicizumab. At the start of the study, Investigators shall discuss with patients the recommended doses of any additional coagulation factors used, given the guidance below. • The use of aPCC for breakthrough bleed treatment for patients on emicizumab should be avoided if possible, and rFVIIa should be the first option used to treat, starting with no more than 90 µg/kg as an initial dose. If aPCC needs to be used, no more than 50 IU/kg should be administered as an initial dose and doses of > 100 U/kg/24 hours or more should be avoided, as cases of TMA and thrombotic events were reported when on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U/kg/24 hours aPCC was administered for 24 hours or more. Investigators should provide or remind patients of the exact dose and schedule of bypassing agents or FVIII required to treat any bleed. o Caution should be taken if anti -fibrinolytics are used in conjunction with rFVIIa in patients receiving emicizumab • Other bypassing agents : other bypassing agents (e.g., Byclot®) should be avoided. In cases where such agents are the only available bypassing agent, the lowest dose expected to achieve hemostasis should be prescribed, with no more than the lowest dose described in the prescribing information to be administered as an initial dose (e.g., no more than 60 mg/kg of Byclot®). For patients receiving Byclot® prior to study entry, a washout period of 72 hours prior to the first emicizumab dose is required The exact dose and schedule of FVIII or bypassing agents should be discussed with the patient at study entry and throughout the study. Repeated dosing of FVII I, rFVIIa, aPCC, or other bypassing agents should be performed only under medical supervision and consideration should be given to verifying the bleeds prior to repeated dosing. For rFVIIa, aPCC, and other bypassing agents, laboratory monitoring by additio nal local and central laboratory assessments should be performed as per the Schedule of Activities (see Section 4.5.6.9 Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities • )."

FEIBA can not be used prophylactically. • Use of anti -fibrinolytics in conjunctio n with aPCC or Byclot® If prohibited therapy is administered for any reason, it should be recorded on the eCRF. If prohibited treatment is prescribed or considered medically necessary, the Medical Monitor should be consulted to discuss any changes in the b enefit -risk profile and determine whether the patient should continue on the study. 4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS Please see Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities for the Schedule of Activities to be performed during the study. 4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study -specific screening tests or evaluations. Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequ ently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. For adolescents (i.e., patients who are 12−17 years of age), an Informed Assent Form will be completed instead. Parents or caregivers of adolescents will also complete an Informed Consent Form. The enrollment form will be completed after informed consent and/ or assent is obtained . All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria before enrollment. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confi rm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 4.5.2 Medical History and Demographic Data Medical history includes hemophilia -related history, clinically significant diseases, procedures (including prior surgeries) , use of alcohol and d rugs of abuse within the past year, and medication allergies. In particular, sites should record whether the patient has any history of prior ITI, anaphylaxis, or known thrombophilia. It should also include all medication taken in the 4 weeks prior to scre ening (including prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, and herbal/homeopathic remedies and therapies)."

As t his patient population is at high risk for HIV, hepatitis A, B and C, sites should consider testing for these. While the specific serological tests used is at the discretion of the Investigator, this is with the understanding that the status of that partic ipants’ hepatitis or HIV is confidently known at time at enrollment. HIV and hepatitis serology tests will be conducted at the local laboratory. 4.5.6.4 Anti -FVIII Antibodies For the assessment of anti -FVIII antibodies (inhibitors), functional assays that utilize a clotting readout (classic Bethesda or Nijmegen assay) cannot be used for patients on emicizumab therapy as emicizumab drives clotting even in the presence of FVIII inhibitors, causing a false -negative test result (see Section 5.1.3 ). After the first dos e, local measurement of FVIII inhibitors, if indicated, requires use of an ELISA -based test or a chromogenic Bethesda assay. At the discretion of the local investigator, any additional urgent requests to assess FVIII inhibitors will need to be sent to the central laboratory (see Appendix 2 Schedule of Biomarker Samples for additional information). Plasma samples for anti -FVIII antibodies will be analysed at the central laboratory. 4.5.6.5 Anti -emicizumab Antibodies Plasma samples are required for immunogenicity assessments to detect anti -emicizumab antibodies . Additional samples to detect anti -emicizumab antibodies may also be drawn at the time of hypersensitivity events or following suspected loss of efficacy. Samples will be ana lysed at the central laboratory. 4.5.6.6 Pharmacokinetics Plasma samples are required for PK assessments. On days where PK samples are to be collected, the emicizumab injection will be performed in the clinical unit. One single pre -dose sample is required on the applicable visits. Samples will be analysed by the central laboratory. 4.5.6.7 Biomarkers 4.5.6.7.1 Safety Biomarkers Plasma samples for safety biomarker assessment must be citrate plasma. Tests may include, but are not limited to, D -dimer. Samples will be analysed by the central laboratory. See Appendix 2. 4.5.6.7.2 Safety Coagulation System Biomarkers Plasma samples for safety coagulation system biomarker assessment must be citrate plasma. Tests include FVIII:Ag, FIX:Ag and FX:Ag.

Ideally these samples should be collected in the morning (before noon), in order to control for diurnal variation. Please consult the Central Laboratory Services Manual for details. The selection of exploratory bone and joint biomarkers to be tested will build on findings from biomarker analyses in other emicizumab trials and may include C -terminal telopeptide of collagen 1 (CTX -1), osteoprotege rin (OPG), procollagen type 1 amino -terminal propeptide (P1NP), and soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa -B ligand (RANK -L) (see Appendix 2 Schedule of Biomarker Samples ). Samples will be analysed by the centra l laboratory. 4.5.6.8 Extra Testing with Use of Bypass Agents In the event of a breakthrough bleed that is treated with bypassing agents, it is recommended that the following laboratory tests will be performed within 24 48 hours of initial bypassing agent use (t hese tests will be conducted so that the investigator can monitor the patient for potential thromboembolic events and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or TMA). These tests include: • Platelet count • Serum creatinine • LDH • Schistocytes • A plasma sample should a lso be provided for central laboratory monitoring of prothrombin fragment F1+2, fibrinogen and D -dimer. Ideally, samples for these tests should be analysed at the central laboratory. Exceptionally in urgent situations where results are required quickly, l ocal laboratory testing can be used, with results recorded in the eCRF. For patients who require multiple doses of bypassing agents, laboratory monitoring should be performed every 24 48 hours until 24 48 hours after the last dose of bypassing agents is administered to treat a specific bleed. All laboratory results which are required as part of the patient’s safety assessment should be recorded in the unscheduled visit eCRFs. 4.5.6.9 Sampling Procedures and Sample Storage, Shipment and Destruction For sampling proc edures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the Central Laboratory Services Manual."

When a patient withdraws from the study, samples collected prior to the date of withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the patient specifically requests that the samples be destroyed or local laws require destruction of the s amples. Data arising from sample analysis will be subject to the confidentiality standards described in Section 8.4. 4.5.7 Bleed Assessments Patients will be trained on how to record their bleeds and hemophilia medica tion use using an ePRO device where possible. When bleeds occur, patients will need to record the site of bleed, type of bleed, time of each individual bleed (day, start and stop time), and treatment for bleed. At least once a week, patients will need to r ecord any hemophilia medication use (including emicizumab) and information regarding any bleeding events . Investigator review of patient -reported bleed/medication records with the patient/caregiver will occur for completeness and accuracy throughout the st udy. 4.5.7.1 Definition of a Bleed For the purposes of the efficacy analyses, a standardized definition of bleed, adapted from the standard criteria defined by the FVIII and FIX Subcommittee of the Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC) of the Internation al Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), that is similar to the definition used in a recent clinical investigation, will be utilized in this study (Blanchette et al. 2014; Mahlangu et al . 2014 ): • An event is considered a bleed if coagulation factors are administered to treat signs or symptoms of bleeding (pain, swelling, etc.). An additional definition of all reported bleeds (irrespective of treatment with coagulation factors) will be app lied for a separate analysis. • Bleeds starting from the first sign of a bleed and ending 72 hours after the last treatment for the bleed, which have any symptoms of bleeding at the same location or injections are ≤ 72 hours apart, are considered the same bl eed. • Any injection to treat the bleed, taken > 72 hours after the preceding injection, is considered the first injection to treat a new bleed at the same location. • In case of trauma with multiple different locations of bleed, this will be considered as one bleed for the analyses. However, all data will be collected, including the various locations of the different bleeds. • Any bleed with a different etiology is considered a separate bleed regardless of time from last injection."
122,page_122,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 122 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 4.5.7.2 Definition of a Target Joint A target joint is defined as: • A major joint (e.g., hip, elbow, wrist, shoulder, knee, and ankle) into which repeated bleeds occur (frequency of at least three bleeds into the same joint over the last 24 weeks prior to study entry). 4.5.7.3 Bleed Sites The bleed sit es are defined as follows: • Joint bleeds, which are defined as having an unusual sensation (“aura”) in the joint in combination with any of the following: o Increasing swelling or warmth of the skin over the joint o Increasing pain o Progressive loss of range of motion or difficulty in using the limb as compared with baseline. • Muscle bleeds • Other bleeds. 4.5.7.4 Definitions of Bleed Types Bleed assessments will be separated into spontaneous bleeds, traumatic bleeds, and bleeds related to procedure s. Both spontaneous bleed s (i.e., the occurrence of hemorrhage where neither the patient nor a caregiver can identify a reason) and traumatic bleeds (i.e., hemorrhage occurring secondary to an event such as trauma, “strenuous” activity, or “overuse”) will be collected. The definit ions for the different type of bleeds are as follows: • Spontaneous bleeds . Bleeds will be classified as spontaneous if a patient records a bleed when there is no known contributing factor such as definite trauma, antecedent “strenuous” activity, “overuse”, or procedure/surgery. The determination of what constitutes “strenuous” or “overuse” will be at the discretion of the patient. For example, light jogging may be considered “non -strenuous” while sprinting may be considered “strenuous”; lifting of weights fo r a short period of time may be considered “moderate use” while repetitive weightlifting may be considered “overuse” • Traumatic bleeds . Bleeds should be classified as traumatic if a patient records a bleed when there is a known or believed reason for the bl eed. For example, if a patient were to exercise “strenuously” and then have a bleed in the absence of any obvious injury, the bleed would be recorded as a traumatic bleed because, although no injury occurred, there was antecedent “strenuous” activity. Blee ds with preceding injuries would certainly be classified as traumatic. In addition, bleeds related to surgery, such as hematomas resulting from any surgeries, will also be classified as traumatic bleeds. Bleeds related to surgeries will not be associated w ith any trauma except surgery -induced trauma • Bleeds related to procedures . This category would include hematomas resulting from any invasive procedure (e.g., tooth extractions, venepuncture, or SC drug administrations) or invasive diagnostic procedures (e. g., lumbar puncture, arterial blood gas determination, or any endoscopy with biopsy, etc.) or surgeries. Any instances of these bleeds would not be counted as bleeds in the context of the study, but the relevant"
123,page_123,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 123 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 data will be collected. Bleeds related to pr ocedures will not be associated with any trauma except procedure -induced trauma. 4.5.8 Surgical Events Thorough documentation on surgical events will be requested, including type of surgery or procedures , treatments, outcomes, etc. 4.5.9 Patient -Reported Outcomes The PRO data that will be collected during this study include bleed/medication assessments (see Section 4.5.7 ) and HRQoL, health status (EQ -5D-5L), and treatment preference (EmiPref) questionnaires. The PRO questionnaire data will be collected to document the treatment benefit of emicizumab. The questionnaires, translated into the local language as required, will be completed in their entirety at specified timepoints during the study. To ensure instrument validity and that data standards meet health authority requirements, questionnaires will be self-administered before the patient /caregiver receives any information on disease status, prior to the performance of non -PRO assessments, and prior to the administration of emicizumab , unless otherwise specified. 4.5.9.1 HRQo L Assessments The Haem -A-QoL (version AU 3.0; UK English) and the Hemophilia Quality of Life Short Form (Haemo -QoL-SF) (version AU 2.0; UK English) will be completed electronically and used to measure HRQoL in adults and adolescents, respectively. Paper ve rsions of the questionnaires are also available in case of ePRO outage or if an ePRO device is otherwise unavailable. The Haem -A-QoL was designed for adult patients with hemophilia. It consists of 46 items comprising 10 dimensions (physical health, feelin gs, view of yourself, sports and leisure, work and school, dealing with hemophilia, treatment, future, family planning, and partnerships and sexuality) and a scale representing total score. Items are rated according to five response options, although for s ome items there is also a ‘not applicable’ option (Mackensen and Gringeri 2010; Wyrwich et al. 2015 ). The Haemo -QoL has been developed as a series of age -related questionnaires to measure HRQoL in children and adolescents with hemophilia (Bullinger et al. 2002; Pollak et al. 2006; Von Mackensen and Bullinger 2004 ). These questionnaires include a 77 -item long form, a 35-item short form, and an 8 -item index form. Long versions for three different age groups contain 21 −77 items and cover 8 −12 dimensions of HRQoL. Furthermore, two age -specific short form measures containing 16 and 35 items have been developed. The short version for older children (8 −16 years) containing 35 items was selected for this study. This version covers nine dimensions considered relevant for the children’s HRQoL (physical health, feelings, view of yourself, family, friends, other people, sports, dealing with hemophilia, and treatment). Items are rated with respect to five response options: never, rarely, sometimes, often, and all the time."
124,page_124,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 124 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 4.5.9.2 Health Status Assessments (EQ -5D-5L) The EQ -5D-5L (version 2; UK English) is a generic, self -report, preferen ce-based health utility measure that consists of six questions that are completed electronically and is used to assess health status and inform pharmacoeconomic evaluations. Paper versions of the questionnaires are also available in case of ePRO outage or if an ePRO device is otherwise unavailable. The EQ -5D- 5L consists of two components. The first part, health state classification, contains five dimensions of health: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety / depression (Herdman et al. 2011; Janssen et al. 2013 ). Published weights are available that permit the creation of a single summary score. Overall scores range from 0 to 1, with low scores repres enting a higher level of dysfunction. The second part is a 0 to 100 -point visual analog scale (VAS), which assesses current health status and higher scores are reflective of better health. 4.5.9.3 Treatment Preference Questionnaire Patient preference will be asses sed through a paper version of the EmiPref questionnaire (Appendix 3), which asks patients to specify the treatment they would prefer to continue to receive after receiving treatment with their previ ous episodic or prophylactic regimen and SC emicizumab. Patients who express a preference are then asked to identify the reasons which may have influenced their decision and indicate the top three reasons for their choice. Patients will complete this quest ionnaire after 3 months of treatment with emicizumab. 4.6 PATIENT, TREATMENT, STUDY AND SITE DISCO NTINUATION Patients who discontinue emicizumab prior to the completion of the 2 -year treatment period will undergo a Safety Follow -up Visit 24 weeks after the pat ient’s last emicizumab dose or at 2 years after emicizumab treatment start, whichever occurs first (see Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities ). 4.6.1 Patient Discontinuation Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: • Patient withdrawal of consent at any t ime • Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study • Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient • Patient’s inability or unwillingness to comply with protocol requirements • Non-compliance despite appropriate education measures taken by the clinical site. Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who withdraw from the study. The primary reason for withdrawal from the stu dy should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. However, patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn. Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced."

Patients who discontinue emicizumab prematurely will not be replaced. P atients who become pregnant should immediately discontinue treatment and be managed according to local guidelines. 4.6.3 Study and Site Discontinuation The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: • The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to patients • Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory. The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the Sponsor decide s to discontinue the study. The Sponsor has the right to close a site at any time. Reasons for closing a site may include, but are not limited to, the following: • Excessively slow recruitment • Poor protocol adherence (e.g., bleed/medication data not checked by investigator/co - investigator for > 8 weeks) • Inaccurate or incomplete data recording • Non-compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice • No study activity (i.e., all patients have completed the stu dy and all obligations have been fulfilled). 5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 5.1 SAFETY PLAN Emicizumab is not approved in all countries , and clinical development is still ongoing. The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with emicizuma b in completed and ongoing studies. The anticipated important safety risks for emicizumab are outlined below. Please refer to the emicizumab Investigator's Brochure for a complete summary of safety information. Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study. Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at high risk for toxicities. Patients"
126,page_126,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 126 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including assessment of the nature, frequency, and grade of a dverse events. In addition, guidelines for managing adverse events, including criteria for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation, are provided below. 5.1.1 Risks Associated with Emicizumab 5.1.1.1 Injection -Site Reactions In the completed and ongoing Japanese studies, ISRs have been observed in some patients with hemophilia A. These local ISRs included injection -site erythema, injection -site hematoma, injection -site rash, injection -site discomfort, injection -site pain, and injection -site pruritus. All local ISRs were of mild intensity. Further details on the observed ISRs are available in the Investigator’s Brochure. To minimize the risk for ISRs, emicizumab should be injected subcutaneously using separate injection sites as described in Sectio ns 0 and 0 and the IFU document. 5.1.1.2 Hypercoagulation and Thromboembolic Events As of April 2017 , there have been two serious thrombo tic events reported in two patients who were treated with bypassing agents while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis in Study BH29884. • One patient self -administered greater than 200 units/kg/day of aPCC for two consecutive days and developed cavernous sinus thrombosis. Treatment with emicizumab was interrupted , no further aPCC was administered, and the clot resolved without anticoagulation in approximately 2.5 weeks. Emicizumab was restarted after approximately 10 days after the resolution of the serious adverse event without recurrence . • The se cond patient developed severe skin necrosis (both legs) and contemporaneous superficial vein thrombosis in the right leg after self -administering two consecutive doses of 100 units/kg/day of aPCC. The patient recovered on supportive therapy (no anticoagula tion). For more details please refer to the emicizumab Investigator’s Brochure. All thromboembolic events should be reported as adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.2.3 ), and also as serious adverse events if it meets criteria as described in Section 5.2.2 . HCPs should educate patients/caregivers to recognize signs and symptoms of potential thromboembolism or thrombosis (i.e., dyspnea, chest pain, leg pai n or swelling ; or if in the head, headache, numbness in the face, eye pain or swelling, or vision impairment; or if in the skin, blackening and associated pain ) and ensure that they understand the importance of seeking appropriate medical attention. Patien ts and/or caregivers will also receive two alert cards to remind them of this information should thromboembolism be suspected. 5.1.1.3 Thrombotic Microangiopathy TMA is used to describe a group of disorders with clinical features of microangiopathic hemolytic anem ia, thrombocytopenia, and organ damage that can include the kidneys, gastrointestinal system, central nervous system. As of April 2017 , three cases of TMA were observed in Study BH29884 involving patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors who were treated with bypassing agents while receiving emicizumab ."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 127 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 • The first patient self -administered two doses of aPCC 94 units/kg in 2 days to treat his left knee hemarthrosis. The next day, he started experiencing icterus and severe back pain and the patient self -admi nistered two doses of rFVIIa 85 µg/kg and two doses of aPCC 94 units/kg. The n the patient presented with thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and acute renal failure with schistocytes on peripheral blood smears. The patient was diagnosed with TMA and trea ted with plasmapheresis, hemodialysis, and supportive care and his condition improved and resolved after 16 days. The patient discontinued treatment with emicizumab • The second patient self -administered five doses of aPCC 74 units/kg over three consecutive days before the serious adverse event onset . The patient had abdominal pain and emesis, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, and a low haptoglobin with schistocytes on peripheral blood smears. The patient was diagnosed with TMA and recovere d without plasmapheresis or hemodialysis after 18 days. The patient restarted treatment with emicizumab after resolution of the serious adverse event without recurrence of TMA . • The third patient presented at the hospital complaining of rectal bleeding, pos tural dizziness, and exertional dyspnea. Of note, . Multiple doses of rFVIIa were administered and various interventions (hemostatic powder application, absorbable hemos tat packing, and embolization of rectal arteries) were used in an attempt to control bleeding. Despite these measures, the patient continued to have rectal hemorrhage. The patient’s bypassing agent treatment was then changed to aPCC and temporary cessation of bleeding was achieved. Subsequently, the patient developed a serious adverse event of TMA following concomitant bypassing agent treatment. Emicizumab prophylaxis and aPCC were discontinued and therapeutic plasma exchange with albumin was provided. Thre e days later, investigators assessed the patient’s TMA to be improving based on laboratory assessments (LDH and platelet count). However, the patient experienced recurrent rectal hemorrhage. Surgery and arterial embolization were no longer deemed to be fea sible and the patient was placed on comfort care before passing away the same day. The investigator assessed the patient death as related to the serious adverse event of rectal hemorrhage and unrelated to emicizumab, and the TMA as related to emicizumab an d aPCC. For more details please refer to the Emicizumab Investigator’s Brochure. These events should be reported as adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.2.3 ), and also as serious adverse events if i t meets criteria as described in Section 5.2.2 . HCPs should educate patients/caregivers to recognize signs and symptoms of potential TMA (i.e., confusion, weakness, swelling of arms and legs, yellowing of skin a nd eyes, vague abdominal or back pain, nausea, vomiting, or decreased urination, etc.) and ensure that they understand the importance of seeking appropriate medical attention. Patients and/or caregivers will also receive two alert cards to remind them of t his information and these instructions should TMA be suspected. 5.1.1.4 Hypersensitivity Since emicizumab is a biological product, acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic /anaphylactoid reactions, may occur. In Study ACE001JP, no severe hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have been observed."

131,page_131,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 131 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 5.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence i n a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: • Any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product • Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition ), except as described in Section 5.3.5.10 • Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline • Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., electroca rdiogram [ECG], X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug • Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prio r to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies). Bleeds considered as serious adverse events should be reported on the appropriate adverse event eCRF page, regardless of whether the bleeds are consistent with the p atient’s pre - study disease state (the bleed will also be recorded in the patient’s bleed/medication records). New, non -serious bleeds consistent with patients’ pre -study disease state will not be considered adverse events and will not be recorded on the eC RF but will be captured in the patient’s bleed/medication records. 5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: • Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actua lly causes or leads to death) • Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. • Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.11 ) • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study drug • Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). The terms ""severe"" and ""serious"" are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (e.g., rated as Grade 1 –4, according to the World He alth Organization [WHO] toxicity grading scale for determining the severity of adverse events; see Section 5.3.3 ); the"
132,page_132,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 132 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as Grade 3 headache witho ut any further findings). Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF. Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) Adverse events of special interest are required to be repor ted by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: • Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s law (see Section 5.3.5.7 ) • Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below • Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an inf ectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a contamination of the study drug is sus pected. • Systemic hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions (see Sampson’s Criteria in Appendix 4) • Thromboembolic events • Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or TMA (e.g. hemol ytic uremic syndrome). 5.3 METHODS AND TIMING F OR CAPTURING AND ASS ESSING SAFETY PARAMETERS The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 05.6. For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 0). 5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact. All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF."
133,page_133,
134,page_134,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 134 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 • Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as a pplicable) • Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments • Known association of the event with the disease under study • Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event • Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the occurrence of the event. 5.3.5 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.1 Injection Reactions An adverse event that occurs during or within 24 hours after emicizumab adminis tration and in the investigator’s opinion is judged to be related to emicizumab injection should be captured as an “injection -site reaction” on the Adverse Event eCRF. An injection -site reaction that is localized should be marked as a “local injection -site reaction.” Associated signs and symptoms (e.g., injection -site erythema or injection -site rash) should be recorded on the dedicated Injection -Site Reaction eCRF. Systemic reactions should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. The dedicated Inj ection -Site Reaction eCRF should only be used to capture the individual signs/symptoms for local injection -site reactions. 5.3.5.2 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms For adverse events other than injection reactions (see Section 0), a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constella tion of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously repor ted adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis."
135,page_135,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 135 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 5.3.5.3 Adverse Ev ents That Are Secondary to Other Events In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. A medic ally significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: • If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a health y adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF • If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF • If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF • If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF • If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated. 5.3.5.4 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation tim epoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extrem e severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from ""non -serious"" to ""serious,"" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.5 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: • Is accompanied by clinical symptoms • Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modific ation, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) • Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy"
136,page_136,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 136 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 • Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment. It is the investig ator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5  ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is n ot a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., ""elevated potassium,"" as opposed to ""abnormal pota ssium""). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as ""h yperkalemia."" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on recording persi stent adverse events). 5.3.5.6 Abnormal Vital Sign Values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: • Is accompanied by clinical symptoms • Result s in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) • Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy • Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment. It is the inve stigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant vital sign abnorma lity is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.7 Abnormal Liver Function Tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (> 3  baseline value) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( > 2  ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as"
137,page_137,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 137 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 defined by Hy's law). Therefore, investig ators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: • Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 x baseline value in combination with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN (of which ≥ 35% is direct bilirubin) • Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 x basel ine value in combination with clinical jaundice. The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.2 ) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.3.5.8 Deaths All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to emicizumab , must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reporte d to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ). This includes death attributed to progression of hemophilia A. Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contribu ted to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, ""unexplained death"" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death"" should be replaced by the established cause of death. The term ""sudden death"" should not be used unless combined with th e presumed cause of death (e.g., ""sudden cardiac death""). If the death is attributed to progression of hemophilia A , ""hemophilia A progression"" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6. 5.3.5.9 Pre-existing Medical Conditions A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present during the study Screening Period . Such conditions should be recorded on the Gener al Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. A pre -existing medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on the Adverse Even t eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the pre - existing condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., ""more frequent headaches""). 5.3.5.10 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Hemophilia A Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of hemophilia A should be recorded as an adverse event if judged by the investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity or frequency or changed in nature at any time during the study. When"
138,page_138,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 138 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 recording an unanticipated wor sening of hemophilia A on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., ""accelerated hemophilia A""). 5.3.5.11 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization Any adverse event th at results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined below. An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event: • Hospitalization for respite care • Planned hospitalization required by th e protocol (e.g., for study drug administration) • Hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met: o The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the study when elective surgery b ecame necessary because of the expected normal progression of the disease o The patient has not experienced an adverse event. The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be serious adverse events, but should be reported as adverse events in stead: • Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours. 5.3.5.12 Adverse Events Associated with an Overdose or Error in Drug Administration An overdose is the accidental or in tentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the dose being studied. An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event. All adverse events associated with an overdose or inc orrect administration of emicizumab should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the even t; see Section 5.4.2 ). No information about overdose is currently available. Accidental overdose may result in enhanced procoagulant effects of emicizumab. As with any medication overdose, patients may be more s usceptible to both known and unknown risks and should be closely monitored as appropriate by the investigator. 5.3.5.13 Patient -Reported Outcome Data The PRO measurements are described in Section 4.5.8 . The methods for collecting and analyzing PRO data are different from those used for observed or volunteered adverse events. Owing to these differences, PRO data will not be reported as adverse events and no attempt will be made to resolve any noticeable discrepancies betw een PRO data and observed or volunteered adverse events. All adverse events will be reported by the"
139,page_139,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 139 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 investigator on the Adverse Event eCRF. The PRO data will be presented in separate tables, figures, and data listings from the adverse event data, and will be included in the appropriate section of the final study report. 5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM IN VESTIGATOR TO SPONSOR Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial. The investigator must report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event. The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to emicizumab : • Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) • Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) • Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details). The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for t hese events to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information). New significant information includes the following: • New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis • Significant new diagnostic test results • Change in causality based on new information • Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery • Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event. Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the local health authority and Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC). 5.4.1 Emergency Medical Contacts To ensure the safety of study patients, an Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will access the Roche Medical Emergency List, escalate emerg ency medical calls, provide medical translation service (if necessary), connect the investigator with a Roche Medical Responsible individual, and track all calls. The Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per we ek. Toll -free numbers for the Help Desk, as well as Medical Monitor and Medical Responsible individual contact information, will be distributed to all investigators. 5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events of Special Interest 5.4.2.1 Events That Occur prior to Study Drug Initiation After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of emicizumab , only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported. The Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Eve nt of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately"
140,page_140,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 140 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form us ing the fax number or email address provided to investigators. 5.4.2.2 Events That Occur after Study Drug Initiation After initiation of emicizumab , serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be reported until the last scheduled study visit (see Section 5.3.1 ). Investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the ele ctronic data capture (EDC) system. A report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management by the EDC system. In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided t o investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system. Instructions for reporting serious adverse events that occur after the patient has completed the 2 -year treatment period are provided in Section 5.6. 5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies 5.4.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 24 weeks after the last dose of emicizumab . A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), eit her by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. The investigator should discontinue emicizumab and counsel the patient, discussi ng the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available. 5.4.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients Although embryo -fetal development studies are not available, condom use will not be required in male patients enrolled in the study, as the margin between the minim al anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) plasma concentration (7 ng/mL) and the estimated maternal C max (for both the 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg per week dosing regimens) is greater than 10 -fold (Banholzer et al. 2012 ). At this time, very little emicizumab is thought to transfer into semen, an d there are no known reproductive risks to female partners of male patients treated with emicizumab. Therefore, contraception use by male patients is not"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 141 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 required for participation in the study, and to be consistent with this, no proactive collection of pr egnancy information for female partners of male patients treated with emicizumab will be required. 5.4.3.3 Abortions Any abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adve rse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.4.3.4 Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a c hild born to a female patient exposed to emicizumab should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PATIENT S AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 5.5.1 Investigator Follow -Up The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent. Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification. All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until p regnancy outcome. At the time of pregnancy outcome, reporting instructions provided in Section 0 should be followed. 5.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnanc ies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE ADVE RSE EVENT REPORTING PERIOD The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that occurs after the end of th e adverse event reporting period (defined as the end of the 2 -year treatment period), if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment. These events should be reported through use of the Adverse Event eCRF. However, if the EDC system is not available, the investigator should report these events"
142,page_142,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 142 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form using the fax number or email addre ss provided to investigators. 5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIE S, INVESTIGATORS, INSTI TUTIONAL REVIEW BOAR DS, AND ETHICS COMMITTEES The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest against cumulati ve product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference document: • Emicizumab Investigator's Brochure. The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the sev erity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed. 6. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AN D ANALYSIS PLAN The primary analysis population is all patients who have received at least one dose of emicizumab (safety population). The intent -to-treat (ITT) population includes all enrolled patients. No formal statistical hypothesis tests will be perf ormed and all analyses are considered descriptive. 6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE A sample size of approximately 200 patients is planned for this study. For the purpose of the sample size calculation, the incidence of adverse events was chosen as the safety endpoint of primary interest. If the observed incidence of adverse events is between 2.5% and 15%, the precision for the estimated incidence rate is presented below according to the 95% Clopper -Pearson confidence intervals (CIs) ( Table 14)."

The data may be presented together with two -sided 95% Clopper - Pearson CIs if appropriate. In addition, as part of the safety evaluation, additional assessments will be summarized descriptively as follows: • Cumulative study medication doses, dose modifications (delays and interruptions), and duration of exposure • Compliance with respect to emicizumab intake (planned vs. received) • Changes from baseline in physical examination findings • Vital signs over time: o Vital signs will be analyzed using descriptive statistics for continuous variables and presented gra phically over time with associated 95% CIs. • Laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry): o These parameters will be presented in shift tables of WHO toxicity grade at baseline versus worst grade during the treatment period. Selected laboratory parameter s will be summarized in terms of mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Laboratory parameters will also be presented graphically over time , if appropriate . All safety variables will be analyzed for the safety population. For each variable, the num ber of available observations will be reported. The safety population includes all patients who have received at least one dose of emicizumab . The primary safety analysis will occur at the end of the study. The iDMC (see Section 0) will evaluate the study data, including the emerging safety results, at periodic reviews and recommend to the Sponsor whether the protocol should be amended or the study should be stopped early. All summaries and analyses will be prepa red by the Study Management Team ( SMT ) statistician and presented for iDMC review. Members of the iDMC will be external to the Sponsor and will follow a charter that outlines their roles and responsibilities. A detailed description of the statistical metho ds that will be used for the primary analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 6.5 EFFICACY ANALYSES The efficacy analyses will involve evaluating the number of bleeds over time, the HRQoL of patients, the health status of patients acco rding to EQ -5D-5L scores, and assessing patient preference for the emicizumab regimen compared with the previous regimen used. The definition of a bleed is described in Section 4.5.7.1 . Patients will be asked to record any hemophilia medication use (including emicizumab) and information regarding any bleeding events . The patients should record this information at least every week even if they do not experience a bleed. The number of bleeds will be compared with p atients’ bleed rate prior to study entry and will be summarized descriptively. HRQoL (using the Haem -A-QoL or the Haemo -QoL-SF), health status (using the EQ -5D-5L), and patient treatment preference will be assessed as per the Schedule of Activities (Appendix 1 Schedule of Activities"
145,page_145,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 145 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 ). Adherence with the HRQoL, health status, and patient treatment preference measures will be summarized. As different HRQoL measures (Haem -A-QoL and the Haemo -QoL-SF) will be used for adult and adolescent patients, all calculations and analyses will be conducted separately for each patient population. Scale scores for the Haem -A-QoL and Haemo -QoL-SF will be calculated and summarized descriptively. The HRQoL scale scores for all patients will be evaluated after 6 months of treatment, a timepoint which is consistent with other recent registrational studies in hemophilia (Lentz et al. 2013; Mahlangu et al. 2014; Powell et al. 2013 ) and analyses of this type of data (Santagostino et al. 2014; Wyrwich et al. 2015 ). Paired t -tests will be used to compare the on -treatmen t scores with the baseline scale scores for each HRQoL measure. Within -patient changes from baseline for the different HRQoL scale scores will also be calculated for each of the on -treatment timepoints. The proportion of patients who report changes that ex ceed clinically meaningful thresholds will be reported. For each of the EQ -5D-5L assessments, the number and percentage of patients in each of the five categories for each question will be evaluated. Changes in the EQ -5D-5L index utility score from baselin e will also be reported . In addition, summary statistics including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be calculated according to the patients’ health state using the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ -VAS). The proportion of patient s who report changes that exceed the clinically meaningful threshold on the EQ -5D- 5L index and the EQ -VAS scores will be reported. Summary statistics on patient preference for the emicizumab regimen compared with the previous regimen used will be presented . A detailed description of the statistical methods that will be used for the secondary analyses will be provided in the SAP. 6.6 IMMUNOGENICITY ANALY SES Data on the impact of immunogenicity (anti -emicizumab antibodies) on safety, efficacy, and/or PK will be s ummarized using standard language/terminology (Shankar et al. 2014 ). The immunogenicity analyses will include patients with at least one pre -dose and one post - dose anti -emicizumab antibody assessment. The numbers and proportions of antibody - positive patients and antibody -negative patients during the treatment period will be summarized. Patients are considered to be antibody -positive if they are negative at baseline but develop an a nti-emicizumab antibody response following emicizumab administration (treatment -induced antibody response), or if they are positive at baseline and the titer of one or more post -baseline samples is at least 4 -fold greater (i.e., ≥ 0.60 titer units) than th e titer of the baseline sample (treatment -enhanced antibody response). Patients are considered to be antibody -negative if they are negative at baseline and all post -baseline samples are negative, or if they are positive at baseline but do not have any post -baseline samples with a titer that is at least 4 -fold greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment unaffected). The relationship between anti-emicizumab antibody status and safety, efficacy, and PK endpoints will be analyzed and reported descr iptively via subgroup analyses."

Data presented will include arithmetic and geometric means, median, range, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation. Nonlinear mixed effects model ing will be used to analyze the dose -concentration -time data for emicizumab following SC administration. Population PK parameters, such as clearance and volume of distribution, will be estimated, and the influence of various covariates, such as age, gender , and body weight, on these parameters will be investigated graphically. Secondary PK parameters, such as AUC, will be derived from individual post -hoc predictions. Results may be pooled with data from previous Phase I -III studies. If conducted, these anal yses will be presented in a dedicated report. 6.8 BIOMARKER ANALYSES Data from PD, safety biomarker, safety coagulation system biomarker, and bone and joint biomarker assessments will be presented using summary statistics, including arithmetic and geometric me ans, median, range, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation. 6.9 INTERIM ANALYSES 6.9.1 Planned Interim Analyses The first interim analysis will be performed once approximately 100 patients have received treatment with emicizumab for at least 24 weeks. A second interim analysis will be performed when approximately 100 patients have received treatment with emicizumab for at least 52 weeks. The data from these analyses will subsequently be presented to the iDMC in order to enable them to effectively monitor the study (see Section 0). Details regarding the planned interim analyses will be provided in the SAP and iDMC charter. 6.9.2 Optional Interim Analysis Given the hypothesis -generating nature of this study, the Sponsor may choose to conduct up to two additional interim efficacy analyses (i.e., beyond what is specified in Section 0). The decision to conduct an optional interim analysis and the timing of the analysis will be documented in the Sponsor’s trial master file prior to the conduct of the interim analysis. Any interim analyses will be performed and interpreted by members of the Sponsor study team and appropriate senior management personnel. 7.

147,page_147,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 147 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 the data. Data entered manually will be collect ed using EDC through use of eCRFs. Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system. In the event of discrepant data, the CRO will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. The CRO will produce a Data Quality Plan that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data. Central laboratory data and e PRO data will be sent directly to the either the Sponsor or the vendor using the Sponsor's standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data . The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including approval of the CRO’s data management plans and specifications. Data will be periodically transferred electronically from the CRO to the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail. System backups for data stored at the CR O and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the CRO’s standard procedures. 7.2 ELECTRONIC CASE REPO RT FORMS eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system. Sites will receive training and have access to a manua l for appropriate eCRF completion. eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the Sponsor. All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. eCRFs should be reviewed and e lectronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of re ceipt of the compact disc is required. 7.3 ELECTRONIC PATIENT -REPORTED OUTCOME DATA PRO data will be collected electronically through the use of electronic devices provided by an ePRO vendor (HRQoL and EQ -5D-5L) or using a paper questionnaire (EmiPref) . Paper versions of the questionnaires are also available in case of ePRO outage or if an ePRO device is otherwise unavailable. The electronic device is designed for entry of data in a manner that is attributable, secure, and accurate, in compliance with electroni c records : 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 11. The PRO data from the device will be transmitted electronically to the eCRF in real time . Only identified and trained users may view the data, and their actions (if any) will become part of the audit trai l. The Sponsor will have view -only access to PRO data . The Sponsor will receive all data (including requested meta -data) entered by the patients on the ePRO devices and all relevant study documentation. Once the study is complete, the ePRO data, audit trai l, and trial and system documentation will be archived. The investigator will receive patient data for the site in both human - and machine -readable formats on an archival -quality compact disc that must be kept with the study records as source data. Acknowl edgement of receipt of the compact disc is required."
148,page_148,"Emicizumab — F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 148 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 In addition, the Sponsor will receive all patient data in a machine -readable format on a compact disc. 7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENT ATION Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm th at critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and document ed for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PROs, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcript ions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico -technical departments involved in a clinical trial. Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electroni c record of the data) and considered source data. Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records de scribed in Section 0. To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial -related monitoring, Sp onsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu o f original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the chan ge, and date of the change. 7.6 RETENTION OF RECORDS Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, ePRO data, Informed Consent Forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer. After that period of time, the docume nts may be destroyed, subject to local regulations."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 161 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 4 weeks prior to screening (including prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, and herbal/homeopathic remedies and therapies ). Any hemostatic medications (e.g. bypassing agents) and other medications used to treat or prevent bleeds in the 6 -month period prior to starting emicizumab treatment will also be collected. Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race and ethnicity. f.A complete physical examination will be performed during Screening and should include, but not necessarily be limited to, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respir atory, gastrointestinal and neurological systems. Any abnormality identified during screening should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. Targeted physical examinations (i.e., joints for bleeds, evidence of arthropathy ; skin for bruises, hematomas and ISRs; other organ systems as clinically indicated) should be conducted at subsequent visits or as clinically indicated. New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities from screening should be recorded as adverse event s, if appropriate, on the Adverse Event eCRF. g.Vital signs include measurement of body temperature (oral, rectal, axillary, or tympanic), heart and respiratory rates, blood pressure and weight . On treatment days, measurement should occur prior to emicizuma b administration . Height will be measured and recorded only during Screening and 6 and 12 months after starting emicizumab. Additional vital signs assessments may also be taken anytime as unscheduled assessments as judged by the investigator. In add ition, vital signs may be taken to help monitor for hypersensitivity reactions during or after injections at the investigator's discretion, although these data should not be entered into the eCRF. h.The definition of concomitant medications , as well as permitted a nd prohibited medications is described in Section 4.4 . Concomitant medications used by a patient from 4 weeks prior to initiation of emicizumab to the Study Completion/Early Termination Visit (or to the Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable) should be rep orted to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. Treatments for bleeds (i.e., bypassing agents and other medic ations to treat bleeds), will be collected in the bleed records. i.Hematology and blood chemistry assessments will inclu de a complete blood count with differential and serum chemistries (see Section 4.5.6.1 ). Laboratory assessments completed during Screening do not have to be repeated at Week 1, if the period between Screening and Week 1 is ≤ 5 days and there has been no ch ange in the patient’s health status as assessed by the investigator. Samples will be sent to the central laboratory for analysis. j.Pregnancy tests: Female patients of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will be required t o have a negative serum pregnancy test result during Screening and again within 7 days prior to the first dose of emicizumab . Urine pregnancy tests will be performed throughout the study treatment period. Pregnancy testing will be conducted at the local la boratory. k.The specific tests utilized for hepatitis and HIV serology testing are per local standard of care. As this patient population is at high risk for HIV, hepatitis A, B and C, sites should consider testing for these. While the specific serological t ests used is at the discretion of the Investigator, this is with the understanding that the status of that participants’ hepatitis or HIV is confidently known at time at enrollment. HIV and hepatitis serology tests will be conducted at the local laboratory . l.For the assessment of anti-FVIII antibodies (inhibitors), functional assays that utilize a clotting readout (classic Bethesda or Nijmegen assay) cannot be used for patients on emicizumab therapy as emicizumab drives clotting even in the presence of FVIII inhibitors, causing a false -negative test result (see Section 5.1.3 ). After the first dose, local measurement of FVIII inhibitors, if indicated, requires use of an ELISA -based test or a chromogenic Bethesda assay. At the discretion of the local investiga tor, any additional urgent request to assess FVIII inhibitors will need to be sent to the central laboratory (see Appendix 2 for additional information). Plasma samples for anti -FVIII antibodies will be analysed at the central laboratory m.Plasma samples are required for immunogenicity assessments to detect anti-emicizumab antibodies . Additional samples to detect anti -emicizumab antibodies may also be drawn at the time of hypersensitivity events or following suspected loss of efficacy. Samples will be analys ed at the central laboratory ."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 162 / Protocol M O39129, Version 3 n.ePRO bleed / medication recording : At the Week 1 visit, patients will be trained on how to record their bleeds and hemophilia medication use on the ePRO device where possible . Data that need to be recorded will include the si te of bleed, type of bleed, time of each individual bleed (day, start and stop time), and treatment for bleed. At least once a week, patients will need to record any hemophilia medication use (including emicizumab) and information regar ding any bleeding events. Investigator review of patient -reported bleed/medication records with the patient/caregiver will occur for completeness and accuracy at all of the visits during the treatment period, at study completion, at any unscheduled visits (if required), and a t the Early Termination Visit (if required). o.Thorough documentation on surgical events will be requested, including type of surgery or procedures , treatments, outcomes, etc. p.Adverse events : After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of emicizumab, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported. Injection -site reaction adverse events will be collected on the injection site reaction form. q.Management of emicizumab : Drug dispensation will not o ccur at the Study Completion Visit or the Early Termination Visit (if required). Patients will only receive emicizumab during an unscheduled visit if drug dispensation is required at this time. r.HRQoL and EQ -5D-5L: Patients will be requested to complete Hae m-A-QoL (adults age: ≥ 18 years) or the Haemo -QoL-SF (adolescents ages: 12−17 years) questionnaire and the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire . Questionnaires will be self -administered electronically before the patient/caregiver receives any information on disease stat us, prior to the performance of non -PRO assessments, and prior to emicizumab administration (if on a treatment day). Paper versions of the questionnaires are also available in case of ePRO outage or if an ePRO device is otherwise unavailable . s.EmiPref : At the 3 -month assessment , patients will be prompted to complete a paper version of the EmiPref questionnaire (Appendix 3 ). The questionnaire will be self -administered before the patient/caregiver receives any information on disease status, prior to the perf ormance of non -PRO assessments, and prior to emicizumab administration (if on a treatment day ). t.On treatment days, blood collection should occur within 2 hours prior to emicizumab administration unless otherwise specified. Unless otherwise specified, addit ional analysis will be performed at a local laboratory, as per the investigator’s discretion. Any additional laboratory results which are required as part of the patient’s safety assessment should be recorded in the unscheduled visit eCRFs. Central labs are part of the non -eCRF data which will be sent to the Sponsor directly by the central lab vendor. u.Plasma samples are required for PK assessments. On days where samples are to be collected, the emicizumab injection will be performed in the clinical unit. One single pre -dose sample is required on the applicable visits. Samples will be analysed by the central laboratory . v.Plasma samples for safety biomarkers must be citrate plasma. Tests may include, but are not limited to, D -dimer. Samples will be analyse d by the central laboratory. See Appendix 2 . w.Plasma samples for safety coagulation system biomarker assessments must be citrate plasma. Tests include FVIII:Ag, FIX:Ag and FX:Ag . Samples will be analysed by the central laboratory. See Appendix 2 . x.Plasma samples for PD biomarker assessments must be citrate plasma. Tests will include, but are not limited to, FVIII activity and modified aPTT (one stage) . Time windows for sample collection are specified in Appendix 2 Schedule of Biomarker Samples y.. Additional plasma samples will be collected for future exploratory research, which may include tests such as clot waveform an alysis (CWA) and others (see Appendix 2 Schedule of Biomarker Samples z.).

Serum and plasma EDTA samples for bone and joint biomarkers must be collected after fasting (no food or drink other than water for at least 8 hours prior to the blood draw). Ideally these samples should be collected in the morning (before noon), in order to control for diurnal variation. Please consult the Central Laboratory Services Manual for details. The selection of exploratory bone and joint biomarkers to be tested will build on findings from biomarker analyses in other emicizumab trials and may include CTX -1, OPG, P1NP, and soluble RANK -L (see Appendix 2 Schedule of Biomarker Samples bb. ). Samples will be analysed by the central laboratory. cc.Additional laboratory assessments : In the event of a breakthrough bleed that is treated with bypassing agents, it is recommended that the following laboratory t ests will be performed within 24 48 hours of initial bypassing agent use (these tests will be conducted so that the investigator can monitor the patient for potential thromboembolic events and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or TMA). These tests include platelet count, serum creatinine, LD H and schistocytes. A plasma sample should also be provided for central laboratory monitoring of prothrombin fragment F1+2, fibrinogen and D -dimer. Samples for these tests should ideally be analysed at the central laboratory . Exceptionally in urgent situations where results are required quickly, local laboratory testing can be used, with results recorded in the eCRF. For patients who require multiple doses of bypassing agents, laboratory monitoring should be performed every 24 48 hours until 24 48 hours after the last dose of bypassing agents is administered to treat a specific bleed. If applicabl e, laboratory results should be recorded in the unscheduled visit eCRFs."
