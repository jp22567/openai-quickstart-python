Background Information of Clinical Trial 4.1 Introduction to the Condition and Investigational Products Thyroid surgery is a very common type of wound cleaning surgery and with the development of surgical techniques and continuous improvement in people ’s pursuit of beauty, patients pay more and more attention to the appearance of incision after thyroid surgery. Surgeons have to choose appropriate surgical incision and approach, suture technique and material, minimize damage at different anatomical layers, reduce incision scar, decrease penetrance of scar and improve patients ’ quality of life, on the condition that the quality of thyroid surgery is guaranteed. At present, from the perspective of surgical approach, thyroid surgery is mainly done via open and endoscopic approaches and if an open surgery is done, an anterior cervical curved incision (Kocher ’s incision) is mainly adopted, while other incisions are not as commonly used as before. Since open thyroid surgery has a big base, there has been certain consensus on the use of intradermal continuous suture to reduce penetrance of scar clinically, and therefor e the anterior cervical curved incision is selected for the thyroid surgery in this study. In this study, the investigational products are two types of absorbable surgical sutures , and compared to traditional sutures, these two sutures are both knotless, surgical sutures containing an antibacterial agent (triclosan), except one of them consists of poly(p-dioxanone) and another is prepared from a copolymer of glycolide and ε-caprolactone. The knotless function of the investigational products is realized by forming barbs via cutting the suture body, and such a design has been extensively applied in knotless sutures and has been demonstrated to be qualified for wound stitching (including high tensile tissues) and to reduce surgery (suture) time by lots of clinical studies and literature [1-5]. Besides, the decrease in surgery time is also related to the reduction of wound complications, especially SSI [6]."
14,page_14,"LLC， ESC-201702 [PR OTOCOL VERISON AND DATE] V2.0 /2019-09-30 CONFIDENTIAL 15 In addition, the investigational product also contains an antibacterial agent to resist SSI (nonantibacterial launched products have been marketed in China). The antibacterial agent contained is triclosan, which, at a low concentration, can interact with the acryl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (FabI) of sensitive bacteria and subsequently inhibit the formation of sensitive bacterial fatty acids to achieve an antibacterial effect [7]. It has been confirmed both in in vivo and in vitro experiments that, triclosan -containing sutures can effectively resist colonization of sensitive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus , Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli [8-10]. In the meantime, it has also been shown by clinical studies that, such an effect also works in human body to reduce about 30% of SSIs [11-12]. Based on the great clinical efficacy and safety in clinical application of such sutures, World Health Organization (WHO), American College of Surgeons and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) all recommend the application of knotless sutures in surgeries to prevent SSI in their guidelines [13-15]. To sum up, the investigational products will be new products wit h two kinds of relatively mature suture processes applied in the same type of suture. This study will demonstrate the investigational products ’ efficacy in wound closure in thyroid surgery and safety in clinical application, to support the marketing of the products in China. 4.2 Application of Investigational Products and Control Products The investigational products have been granted with 510K clearance by the country of origin USA in 2015. Currently the products have been marketed in many countries, however, due to the short marketing time, they have not been reported in literature yet. Both the control products and are non-barbed, triclosan- coated sutures. Such sutures have been marketed in China since 2014. As mentioned above, the efficacy and safety of such sutures have been sufficiently validated [11-12, 16]. 4.3 Product Registration and Reason for Clinical Trial Registration in China The investigational products were granted with 510K marketing clearance by the country of origin USA in 2015 and was granted with EU marketing authorization ( CE certificate) in 2016 . To support the marketing of the investigational products in China and according to the requirements of China’s Guidelines for Medical Evaluation of Medical Devices , the study selects non -barbed and as launched products. The difference between the investigational products and launched products lies in whether they contain barbs or not. Therefore, the clinical trial design is to demonstrate that the barbed nature of the suture does not have any adverse impact on the safety and efficacy of the products. 5. Features, Structural Composition, Operation Principle, Mechanism of Action, and Study Population 5.1 Features Type Name of device Design Features Characteristics of Material Investigational Product 1 This product is an antibacterial monofilament absorbable suture consisting of barbed suture material. Its barbs allow tissue approximation without the need to tie surgical knots. The suture contains triclosan, an antibacterial agent, which is only used to inhibit colonization of bacteria on sutures. The suture material is polyester, i.e. poly(p-dioxanone), the empirical molecular formula of which is (C4H6O3)x."
15,page_15,"LLC， ESC-201702 [PROTOC OL VERISON AND DATE] V2.0 /2019-09-30 CONFIDENTIAL 16 Investigational Product 2 This product is an antibacterial monofilament absorbable suture prepared from barbed suture material. Its barbs allow tissue approximation without the need to tie surgical knots. The suture contains triclosan, an antibacterial agent, which is only used to inhibit colonization of bacteria on sutures. The suture material is prepared from Poliglecaprone 25 (i.e. a copolymer of glycolide and ε- caprolactone). 5.2. Structural Composition, Operation Principle, Mechanism of Action The study products are both absorbable surgical sutures armed with a surgical needle to suture soft tissues. The study products contain a fixation loop and barbs to anchor tissues and do not require knots to secure the device. The sutures contain triclosan, am antibacterial substance that is only used to inhibit colonization of bacteria on sutures. Using the suture in sizes 3 -0 or larger, approximately 80% of its original strength remains after at two weeks and four weeks of implantation. At six weeks post implantation, approximately 40% to 70% of its original strength is retained. For size 4 -0, approximately 67% of its original strength remains after two weeks, and approximately 50% at four weeks of implantation. At six weeks post implantation, approximately 37% of its original strength is retained. Data obtained from implantation studies show the absorption of suture is essentially complete within 210 days. Using the suture, approximately 62% of its original tensile strength remains after 7 days implantation; and approximately 27% of its original tensile strength at 14 days post implantation. All of the original tensile strength is lost by 21 days post implantation. The absolute strength remaining 14 days post implantation meets or exceeds that historically observed with plain or chromic surgical gut devices. Data obtained from implantation studies show that absorption of suture is essentially complete by 91 days. The product schematic diagram is as follows: Unidire ctional barbs Bidirectional barbs Artificial synthetic absorbable sutures are used to temporarily align edges of wound, until it is fully healed and able to withstand normal stress. It design is armed with predictable degradation and absorption rates. 5.3 Study Population This clinical study will include subjects who undergo thyroid surgery via an anterior cervical arch incision (Kocher ’s incision). 6. Indications and Contraindications, Precautions 6.1 : [Indication ]: It is indicated for use in soft tissue approximation where the use of absorbable sutures is appropriate. [Contraindications]: It is not to be used where prolonged (beyond six weeks) approximation of tissues under stress is required and is not be used for fixation of or in conjunction with prosthetic"
16,page_16,"LLC， ESC-201702 [PR OTOCOL VERISON AND DATE] V2.0 /2019-09-30 CONFIDENTIAL 17 devices (e.g. heart valves or synthetic grafts) that are nonabsorbable in nature. This device, being absorbable, should not be used where extended approximation of tissue under stress is required, such as in fascia. The device should not be us ed in patients with known allergic reactions to IRGACARE®* MP (triclosan). [Precautions] : The device contains a fixation loop and barbs to anchor tissues and do not require knots to secure the device. Tying of knots on the barbed section of the device will damage the barbs and potentially reduce their efficacy. For the device to function properly, the device must first be anchored in robust tissue using the fixation loop. Then subsequently engage the barbs into the tissue in a standard closure pattern. When completing placement of the barbed segment in subcuticular tissue, take at least one additional pass in the reverse direction to lock the device in place. In all other tissue layers, take at least two passes in the reverse reaction to lock the device in place. Avoid contacting the device with other materials (e.g. surgical gauze, drapes, etc.) in the surgical field to prevent ensnaring on the barbs. If the barbs catch, carefully pull the material in the opposite direction of the needle to disengage it from barbs. When using the device subcutaneously, the device should be placed as deeply as possible in order to minimize erythema and induration normally associated with absorption. Care should be taken to avoid damage when handling the device. Avoid crushing or crimping the suture material with surgical instruments (e.g. needle holders or forceps). Do not attempt to remove memory in the polymer by running fingers down the suture material as this can damage the barbs. Infections, erythema, foreign body reactions, transient inflammatory reactions and in rare instances wound separation are typical or foreseeable risks associated with any suture and hence are also potential complications associated with the device. Acceptable surgical practice should be followed with respect to drainage and closure of infected wounds. To avoid damaging needle points and swage areas, grasp the needle in an area one - third (1/3) to one -half (1/2) of the distance from the swaged end to the point. Reshaping needles may cause them to lose strength and be less resistant to bending and breaking. Users should exercise caution when handling surgical needles to avoid inadvertent needle sticks. Discard used needles in designated biohazard “sharps” containers. Store at or below 30℃. 6.2 : [Indication ]: It is indicated for use in soft tissue approximation where the use of absorbable sutures is appropriate. [Contraindications]: It is not to be used where prolonged approximation of tissues under stress is required and is not be used for fixation of or in conjunction with prosthetic devices (e.g. heart valves or synthetic grafts) that are nonabsorbable in nature. This device, bein g absorbable, should not be used where extended approximation of tissue under stress is required, such as in fascia.

If the barbs catch, carefully pull the material in the opposite direction of the needle to disengage it from barbs. Skin devices that remain in place longer than 7 days may cause localized irritation and should be snipped off or removed if in dicated. Subc uticular devices should be placed as deeply as possible to minimize the erythema and induration normally associated with absorption Under some circumstances, notably orthopedic procedures, immobilization of joints by external support may be employed at the discretion of the surgeon. Consideration should be taken in the use of absorbable devices in tissue with poor blood supply as device extrusion and delayed absorption may occur. In handling this or any other device material, care should be taken to avoid damage from handling. Avoid crushing or crimping damage due to application of surgical instruments (e.g. forceps or needle holders). Do not attempt to remove memory in the polymer by running fingers down the suture material as this can damage the barbs.

Discard used needles in “sharps” containers. Store at or below 30℃. 7. Overall Design 7.1 Trial Design 7.1.1. Tria l Objective The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the of or in thyroid surgery to suture surgical incision. 7.1.2 Trial Method Selection and Its Rationale According to the regulatory requirements of the Guidelines for Technical Review of Absorbable Surgical Suture Registration, a prospective, randomized controlled design should be adopted to compare the investigational device with launched product. Therefore, this study adopts a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial design. 7.1.3 Measures to Reduce and Avoid Bias In the study, central randomization will be adopted to randomly assign eligible subjects to one of the three groups: investigational group 1, investigational group 2 or control group according to the same inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the impact caused by unknown confounding factors and avoid selection bias. Study blinding is as follows: o Subject: Subjects are inform ed prior to surgery that they will be randomized to any of the study groups with equal probability, and during the surgery, a blind ing method will be adopted for them. o Investigator responsible for incision suture: Considering the investigational groups and"

See Section 8.2 Calculation of Sample Size for the basis for selecting this sample size. 7.1.6 Efficacy Evaluation Method 1) Description of efficacy parameters The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving Grade A healing (success) of surgical incision in each group. According to clinical routine practice, wound healing status should be assessed during removal of stitches of incision and generally, stitches at the incision of head, face and neck are taken out on Day 4 -5 post-surgery; however, if energy devices are used (e.g. electro tome), the removal of stitches should be delayed by 1-2 days. In this study, all the skin layers can be performed with intradermal continuous suture using absorbable sutures, thus it is unnecessary to take out stitches at the incision. Theref ore, the time of wound healing assessment in this study is set as Day 5-7 post-surgery. Wound healing status is classified into three grades: • Grade A healing: Good healing with no adverse reaction; • Grade B healing: Inflammatory reaction(s) at the healing, such as red swelling, induration, hematoma, effusion, etc., but without suppuration; • Grade C healing: Suppuration of incision, requiring incision and drainage and other treatments. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints include: 1. Incision sutur ing time, defined as the time required from the first needle insertion for stitching ribbon muscles to the completion of intradermal suture (min); 2. Modified Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale (see Annex 3) , assessed by Imaging Center evaluators using pictures, includi ng: a picture of complete neck anterior view containing full length of the incision, a picture taken parallel to the incision plane, a picture taken at a 45° angle to the incision plane, and incision lateral view pictures of both sides (one for each); 3. Postoperative incision pain score (VAS scale, see Annex 4-1 ); 4. Health related quality of life scale (EQ -5D-5L): Subjects are required to select the most appropriate levels in 5 aspects to determine their health status (see Annex 5): • Motility • Self care • Daily activities • Pain/discomfort • Anxiety/depression 2) Selection of method and time to evaluate, record and analyze the efficacy parameters The primary efficacy endpoint (wound healing grade) will be assessed by independent, blinded Imaging Center according to the picture (a picture of complete neck anterior view, containing full length of the incision) on Day 5-7 post -surgery and documented in the e -CRF. The secondary efficacy endpoints will be documented in the e -CRF according to the investigator ’s records, Imaging Center evaluator’ s assessment records (modified Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale) and questionnaires completed by the subject (postoperative incision pain score, EQ-5D -5L) and will be collected at V3, V4 and V5.

Incidence of postoperative SSI, which is defined as follows according the standard of US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control [16]: 1) Superficial incisional SSI: Involves skin or subcutaneous tissue, occurs within 30 days postoperatively, and must fulfill one of the following additional criteria: • Purulent drainage from the superficial incision with or without diagnostic laboratory testing; • Microorganisms isolated from aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial incision; • At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: pain or tenderness, localized swelling, redness or heat, and the superficial incision is deliberately opened by a surgeon (unless culture of incision is negative); • Diagnosis of a superficial incisional SSI by a surgeon or attending physician. Do not report the following conditions as SSI: • Stitch abscess (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of suture penetration); • Infection of an episiotomy or newborn circumcision site; • Infected burn wound; • Incisional SSI that extends into the fascial and muscle layers (see deep incisional SSI). Note: Specific criteria are used for ident ifying episiotomy and newborn circumcision sites and infected burn wounds. 2) Deep incisional SSI: Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation if no implant is left in place or within 1 year if implant is in place and the infection appears to be relat ed to the operation, infection involves deep soft tissues (e.g., fascial and muscle layers of the incision ) and at least one of the followings: • Purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space component of the surgical site; • A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when the patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38°C), localized pain, or tenderness, except that the incision is culture- negative; • An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by histopathologic or radiologic examination; • Diagnosis of a deep incisional SSI by a surgeon or attending physician. Note: • Report infection that involves both superficial and deep incision sites as deep incisional SSI; • Report an organ/space SSI that drains through the incision as a deep incisional SSI. 3) Organ/space SSI: Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation if no implant is left in place or within 1 year if implant is in place and the infection appears to be related to the operation, and infection"

It is unnecessary to conduct any confirmatory culture, unless the physician considers it necessary to provide subjects with appropriate treatment according to the local standard of care. 2. ASEPSIS score (only assessed in subjects with confirmed SSI): The severity of incision infection is assessed by numeric scores (determining the presence or absence of SSI and types relative to CDC standard). The ASEPSIS incision score is used to evaluate the visual characteristics of incision and if additional treatment can be an incentive of infection or not when the subject leave s the hospital. The predictors include: serous discharge, erythema, purulent exudate, separation of deep tissues, antibiotics, drainage of pus, debridement of wound, isolation of bacteria, and requirement of inpatient care. Surgeons should assess each parameter and provide a numeric score based on the objective standard of incision appearance and the clinical outcome of infection. The following additional points are added: antibiotic treatment of SSI (10 points), drainage of pus under local anesthesia (5 points), debridement of wound under general anesthesia (10 points), isolation of bacteria from incision (10 points), and stay in hospital over 14 days (5 points). The total score, ranged from 0 to 100, is calculated to define the severity of incision according to the percentage of each characteristic ’s impact on incision [18,19]. Please refer to Annex 6. 3.

To remove the entire Device: Cut the Device at the end anchored with the loop, and then pull the distal end to remove the device. 3) Warning and Precautions • Warning The fixation loop of the Device should be deployed by users familiar with surgical procedures, techniques and tissues and the use of absorbable devices before employing the Device for wound closure, as risk of wound separation may vary with the site of application and the suture material used. Surgeons should consider the quantity and quality of tissue in which the loop will be anchored. The use of this device may be inappropriate in highly vascularized tissue or fragile tissue that cannot withstand potential further tightening/constriction within the loop. Surgeons should consider the in vivo performance when selecting a device for use in patients. The use of this device may be inappropriate in elderly, malnourished or debilitated patients, or in patients suffering from conditions which may delay wound healing. As with any foreign matter, prolonged contact of any device with salt solutions, such as those found in the urinary or biliary tracts may result in calculus formation. As an absorbable device, may act transiently as a foreign matter. Acceptable surgical practice should be followed for the management of contaminated or infected wounds. As this is an absorbable device material, the use of supplemental nonabsorbable sutures should be considered by the surgeon in the closure of the sites which may undergo expansion, stretching or distention or which may require additional support. The safety and efficacy of the Device have not been established for use in fascial closures (including abdominal wall, thoracic and extremity fascial closures), gastrointestinal anastomoses, cardiovascular tissue, neural tissue, osseous tissue, tendinous tissue, ophthalmic surgery or for use in microsurgery. Do not re -sterilize/reuse. Reuse of this device (or portions of this device) may create a risk of product degradation, which may result in device failure and/or contamination, which may lead to infection or transmission of blood-borne pathogens to patients and users. Discard open packages and unused devices. Discard packaging that is damaged or opened. Do not use after expiration date. Precautions The Device contains a loop end and barbs to anchor tissues and does not require knots to secure the device. Tying of knots on the barbed section of the device will damage the"
27,page_27,"LLC ESC-201702 [PROTOC OL VERISON AND DATE] V2.0 /2019-09-30 CONFIDENTIAL 28 barbs and potentially reduce their efficacy. For the device to function properly, the Device must first be anchored in robust tissue using the fixation loop. Then subsequently engage the barbs into the tissue in a standard closure pattern. When completing placement of the barbed segment in subcuticular tissue, take at least one additional pass in the reverse direction to lock the Device in place. In all other tissue layers, take at least two passes in the reverse direction to lock the Device in place. Avoid contacting the Device with other materials (e.g., surgical gauze, drapes, etc.) in the surgical field to prevent ensnaring on the barbs. If the barbs catch, carefully pull the material in the opposite direction of the needle to disenga ge it from the barbs. When using the Device subcutaneously, the device should be placed as deeply as possible in order to minimize erythema and induration normally associated with absorption. Care should be taken to avoid damage when handling the device. Avoid crushing or crimping the suture material with surgical instruments (e.g. needle holders or forceps). Do not attempt to remove memory in the polymer by running fingers down the suture material as this can damage the barbs. Infections, erythema, foreign body reactions, transient inflammatory reactions and in rare instances wound separation are typical or foreseeable risks associated with any suture and hence are also potential complications associated with the device. Acceptable surgical practice should be followed with respect to drainage and closure of infected wounds. To avoid damaging needle points and swage areas, grasp the needle in an area one - third (1/3) to one -half (1/2) of the distance from the swaged end to the point. Reshaping needles may cause them to lose strength and be less resistant to bending and breaking. Users should exercise caution when handling surgical needles to avoid inadvertent needle sticks. Discard used needles in designated biohazard “sharps” containers. Store at or below 30℃.

If the barbs catch, carefully pull the material in the opposite direction of the needle to disengage it from the barbs. Skin devices that remain in place longer than 7 days may cause localized irritation and should be snipped off or removed if indicated. Subcuticular devices should be placed as deeply as possible to minimize the erythema and induration normally associated with absorption. Under some circumstances, notably orthopedic procedures, immobilization of joints by external support may be employed at the discretion of the surgeon. Consideration should be taken in the use of absorbable devices in tissue with poor blood supply as device extrusion and delayed absorption may occur. In handling this or any other device material, care should be taken to avoid damage from handling. Avoid crushing or crimping damage due to application of surgical instruments such as forceps or needle holders. Do not attempt to remove memory in the polymer by running fingers down the suture material as this can damage the barbs.

For subjects who are determined to be screen failures, only the following data will be collected : • Informed consent date ; • Demographic informati on (age, race, gender, and ethnicity) ; • Reason for screening failure. 2) Visit 2 -Randomization The following information must be obtained during randomization: • Confirmation of inclusion / exclusion criteria; • Update of medical/surgical history (prior to random ization); • Randomization: Central randomization prior to the surgical procedure; • Concomitant medications ; • Adverse event (AE) (collected since randomization). Randomization will occur if the patient meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria. The central randomization system will be used in this study, so that subjects will not know their treatment group allocation . Each subject will be randomized to one of the three treatment groups according to the allocation ratio of 1:1: 1, and the only difference between the investigational groups and control group lies in the suture material. Each group will include approximately 167 subjects. 3) Visit 3-Surgery The following information must be obtained during the surgical procedure: • Surgical data, including:"

Surgical p rocedures a. Open thyroid surgical procedure via the anterior cervical curved incision (Kocher’ s incision): It is recommended that, the surgery, including the incision closure procedure be performed by not more than three groups of surgeons in each study site, to minimize bias and variation. Open thyroid surgery should be performed according to the diagnosis and treatment practice or specific guidelines of each institution. As required by the expert consensus, the method to make an anterior cervical curved incision (Kocher ’s incision): Make a collar -like, curved incision about 1-2 cm above the suprasternal notch along a pre -existing skin crease, and parallel to t he skin crease. Pay attention to avoiding incision unparallel to local skin grease and subsequently formed a cross. After surgical healing, the incision should be hidden by skin crease of the neck and hence covert. It should be noted that, when making an a nterior cervical transverse curved incision, the cervical incision should be made as symmetrical as possible according to the principles of human body aesthetics, to avoid deviation and inclination, disproportion or poor arc of the incision. The postoperative drainage tube (if any) should be placed in another incision made, other than the incision above, and cannot be placed in full length of the incision. b. Incision closure procedure using study products: All the subjects must have their incision closed sutu res according to the treatment group to which they are assigned. The specific suture materials and methods are as follows: Investigational group 1: Use the study device ) for continuous suture of the ribbon muscles, ) for interrupted suture of the platysma, and ) for continuous subcuticular suture; Investigational group 1 Level Suture Material Suture Technique Product Code Ribbon muscles Continuo us Platysma Interrupted Intradermal Continuous"

The method of use of the investigational devices is as follows: 1. Secure the fixation loop portion to robust tis sue by taking a bite in the designated tissue, passing the needle through the loop and pulling tautly around the anchoring tissue. 2. After the device is anchored into the tissue, grasp the strand and approximate tissue to the desired tension. Bites, or pa sses through the tissue, can be taken in a continuous suturing technique to approximate the wound. Care should be taken to utilize the device on the barbed segments only. Do not attempt to approximate wounds using the non- barbed segment near the needle, as the barbs are required for successful wound approximation with the device. 3. (1) To complete the closure in subcuticular closure, take at least one pass in the reverse direction. Then pass the needle across the incision and take a split thickness bite perpendicular to the incision and exit the skin. (2) To complete the closure in all other tissue layers, take at least two passes in the reverse direction to complete the closure 4. Then gently pull on the free end of the device and cut flush with the surface of the tissue. To remove the entire device: Cut the device at the end anchored with the loop, and then pull the distal end to remove the device. Other sutures used in the trial should be used as per surgical procedure. Do not use skin adhesive at the incision site after the suture is done. Postoperative care: Postoperative care should be given according to the routine practice of the study site or the"

33,page_33,"LLC， ESC-201702 [PR OTOCOL VERISON AND DATE] V2.0 /2019-09-30 CONFIDENTIAL 34 The monitor should comply with the related laws and regulations and the standard operating procedure (SOP) established by the Sponsor to monitor each study phase. The monitor should contact and visit the investigators at a regular basis and make the on-site visit/monitoring during the study. The monitor should visit each site right after the first subject is enrolled, and regular site visits during the duration of the study. The monitoring will include visits to the clinical trial institution, verification of source data, communication with investigators and clinical trial institution, ensuring that this study will be performed strictly in compliance with the protocol and the requirements of regulations and Good Clinical Practice, etc. The on-site monitoring includes verifying the source document and checking whether source data is true, accurate, complete and clear, the original document of each subject is complete. This study might be audited by the Sponsor or inspected by Regulatory Authority. If such audit/inspection is performed, the Investigator and the site must agree the auditor to look up the records of subjects. The Investigator agrees the Sponsor or its appointed representative and Regulatory Authority to monitor all project -related study documents on site by signing on the signature page of this trial protocol. See the Monitoring Plan for details. 8 Statistical Considerations 8.1 Statistical Design, Method and Analysis Procedure This study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study to evaluate the of and used in thyroid surgery to suture surgical incision. Prior to surgery subjects will be randomize d to the investigational group 1 ), investigational group 2 ( ) or the control group according to the allocation ratio of 1:1:1 . The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving Grade A wound healing (success) of surgical incision in each group. A blind assessment will be performed on the wound healing status by independent Central Imaging evaluators on Day 5 -7 post-surgery using the imaging data (a picture of complete neck anterior view, covering full length of the incision). This is a non-inferiority trial with two treatment group comparisons, investigational group 1 versus control group, and investigational group 2 versu s control group. The overall family -wise error rate is controlled at 0.025 level using the Holm ’s multiple comparisons procedure. The expected success rate is 98% for all the three groups. For each of the two comparisons, the statistical hypotheses for testing the non-inferiority of the investigational group to control is presented as follows: • H0: PT - PC ≤ -0.05 tested against the alternative hypothesis • Ha: PT - PC> -0.05 PC is the proportion of successes ( Grade A healing) in the control group and P T is the proportion of successes in each of the investigational groups (1 and 2). The proportion of subjects with Grade A healing will be summarized for each treatment group and will be calculated as the number of subjects with Grade A healing divided by the total number of subjects randomized to that treatment who had the surgical wound closed using the randomized suture. Within-treatment group, two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the proportions of successes will be provided using the Clopper -Pearson method. For the primary endpoint analysis, the Holm ’s step-down procedure will be used. For each of"
34,page_34,"LLC， ESC-201702 [PROT OCOL VERISON AND DATE] V2.0 /2019-09-30 CONFIDENTIAL 35 the two group comparisons, the p-value associated with the non -inferiority test will be calculated using the Normal approximation Z (pooled) statistic . If the smaller p-value is smaller than 0.0125, then the null hypothesis associated wit h this p-value will be rejected and it will be concluded that the associated Test product is non -inferior to Control; subsequently, the larger p-value will be compared to 0.025 in order to test the non-inferiority of the other Test product to Control. If t he smaller p -value is larger than 0.0125, then neither of the null hypotheses can be rejected and it will be concluded that, for both investigational devices, the study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to Control. The primary endpoint will be anal yzed using the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and Per -Protocol (PP) sets. The PP analysis will be considered the primary analysis, while the FAS analysis will be considered supportive. The analysis sets for this study are defined in section 8.8. The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively by treatment group for the FAS: 1. Incision sutur ing time, defined as the time required from the first needle insertion for stitching ribbon muscles to the completion of intradermal suture (min); 2. Modified Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale; 3. Postoperative incision pain score (VAS Scale); 4. Health related quality of life scale (EQ -5D-5L). In addition, the following safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively t by treatment group for the Safety analysis set : 1. Incidence of postoperative SSI; 2. ASEPSIS score (only assessed in subjects with confirmed SSI); 3. Incidence of incisional wound separation or wound dehiscence requiring intervention; 4. Incidence of delayed incisional wound healing events; 5. Incidence of other AEs; 6. Product complaint s. The incidence of AEs will be assessed according to the classification of event and summarized descriptively by treatment groups. Incidence of AEs will also be assessed by onset time (intraoperative or postoperative), relationship to study surgical procedure, relationship to the study product, severity, and seriousness. All continuous variables will be summarized by number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. All categorica l data will be summarized by frequencies and associated percentages. No inferential statistics will be generated for secondary efficacy and safety endpoints. 8.2 Calculation of Sample Size 8.2.1 Total Sample size This clinical study will enroll approximate ly 501 subjects, 167 for each treatment group. One hundred fifty (150) evaluable subjects per study arm will achieve 80% power to detect a non-inferiority margin difference in group proportions of -0.05 for each of the two comparisons using a Pearson Chi -square test with a one-sided significance level of 0.0125. The proportion of successes in the Control group is assumed to be 0.98. The proportion of successes in Test group ( or ) is assumed to be 0.93 under the null hypot hesis of inferiority. The power was computed for the case when the actual proportion of successes in the Test group is 0.98. In order to account for a potential 10% dropout rate, approximately 167 subjects per arm will be enrolled, for a total of approxim ately 501 subjects. 8.2.2 Number of Subjects for Clinical Trial of Each Disease Entity and Reasons for"
35,page_35,"LLC， ESC-201702 [PR OTOCOL VERISON AND DATE] V2.0 /2019-09-30 CONFIDENTIAL 36 Determination A total of approximately 501 Chinese subjects who undergo thyroid surgery will be included in the study. With consideration to the angle of incision, subjects with stage IV thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer are excluded, but there are no restrictions on other disease. 8.2.3 Minimum and Maximum Number of Subjects in Each Clinical Trial Institution and Reasons for Determinati on In China, total of approximately 501 subjects undergoing thyroid surgery in approximately 10 study sites will be enrolled into the study. Each site should enroll more than 125 subjects (25% of the total number). During the implementation of the study, the Sponsor will try to ensure the consistency of number of subjects among sites in order to reduce the variation of the primary endpoint (and subject safety indicators) among sites. 8.3 Significance Level and Power of Clinical Trial Determination of the sample size was performed assuming 80% power and a significance level of 0.0125 for each comparison. To control the overall Type I error rate at a 0.025 level for the two hypotheses being tested, Holm ’s stepdown multiple comparison procedure is being utilized.8.4 Expected Dropout Rate The expected dropout rate in this study is 10% . 8.5 Criterion of Acceptability/Unacceptability of Clinical Trial Result For the primary endpoint analysis, the Holm ’s step-down procedure will be used. For each of the two group comparisons, the p-value associated with the non -inferiority test will be calculated. If the smaller p-value is smaller than 0.0125, then the null hypothesis associated with this p-value will be rejected and it will be concluded that the associated Test product is non-inferior to Control; subsequently, the larger p-value will be compared to 0.025 in order to test the non -inferiority of the other Test product to Control. If the smaller p -value is larger than 0.0125, then neither of the null hypotheses can be rejected and it will be concluded that, for both test devices, the study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to Control. 8.6 Criteria and Reason for Termin ating the Trial Based on the Statistical Results No interim analysis and corresponding early termination criteria, are planned for this trial; therefore this section does not apply. All the statistical analyses will be done after all the data are collected, and after study database lock. A Statistical Analysis Plan will be finalized prior to database lock and the performing of any final analyses. 8.7 Statistical Method of All Data, together with the Handling Method of Missing, Unused and Error Data (including Termination and Withdrawal Halfway) and Unreasonable Data All study endpoints will be analyzed using the available data. There will be no missing data imputation in this study . 8.8 Selection Criteria and Reason of Subjects Included in the Analysis All subjects that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are considered to meet the requirements for recruitment . Three analysis sets in the study are defined for this study, as follows: o FAS consists of all the enrolled subjects who were randomized and for whom the randomized suture materials were used for incision closure. o PP (evaluable) Set contains all the subjects in the FAS who have no major protocol"
36,page_36,"LLC， ESC-201702 [PR OTOCOL VERISON AND DATE] V2.0 /2019-09-30 CONFIDENTIAL 37 deviation, have data available for primary efficacy endpoint and do not meet any of the following criteria: o Subject undergoes any of the following procedures , in addition to thyroidectomy： 1、 Any surgical procedure which require additional neck incisions or extend the original incision; 2、 Cervical lymph node dissection (except the dissection of lymph nodes in the VI area); 3、Other unplanned surgical procedures (except the procedure that the i nvestigator doesn’t think it will affect the original incision ’s healing) o Subject’s intraoperative frozen pathology or postoperative paraffin section pathology suggests anaplastic thyroid cancer ; o Subject receives any surgical procedures that lead to re-opening of the cervical incision during the period from the wound closure to the completion of study, except for surgeries related to surgical incision complication or study device . o Safety Set contains all the enrolled subjects who receive surgery. Major protocol deviations are deviations that have an impact on the primary endpoint assessment or randomization. These will be determined prior to database lock. The analysis of primary efficacy endpoint will be performed using FAS and PP Set s. However, while the primary analysis is based on the PP Set, FAS analysis will only be used as supplemental analysis. The secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the FAS, while the safety endpoints will be analyzed using the Safety Set. 8.9 Special Information Excluded during Hypothesis Testing and Justification (If Applicable) Not applicable. 9. Data Management Data management will be done by the Sponsor or the delegated Contract Research Organization (CRO) according to the SOP of data management. The data management process includes the establishment of capture/management system, design of CRF and database, data receiving and entry, data check and query, medical coding, external data management, B lind Review, Database Lock, data export and transmission, filing of data and data management documents, etc. The data management plan should specify the database locking process, person in charge and SOP document executed. Unlocking and re -locking after da tabase lock should be pre -defined with the conditions and processes specified. The data management plan should specify trial data to be archived, management file, media, and way and time limit of archiving. 10. Feasibility Analysis 10.1 Feasibility analysi s of success As stated above, the devices in the control group are surgical sutures that have been extensively applied in clinical practice, while the investigational products are suture devices that have brand new designs and have only been marketed in the US for one year; however, their main design elements, cutting knotless [1-5] and antimicrobial (triclosan) -coating [11,12] are mature and validated techniques. In the meantime, thyroid surgery incision is a clean incision, for which intradermic continuous suture is already a standard closure pattern. Therefore, it is likely to"
37,page_37,"LLC， ESC-201702 [PR OTOCOL VERISON AND DATE] V2.0 /2019-09-30 CONFIDENTIAL 38 achieve the noninferiority goal in the protocol and appropriate to expect success rates of 98% in all treatment groups . In addition, according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria in the protocol, a large number of subjects can be included while the devices used in the study are supplied free of charge and hence will not increase the subjects’ burden, making it less difficult to enroll and screen subjects. To sum up, the likelihood of success in this study is relatively high. 10.2 Feasibility analysis of failure As stated above, the investigational products are the combination of two mature techniques, but they have only been marketed in the US for one year and have not been reported in any related clinical literature yet. There may be some undiscovered problems that can cause some unforeseen problems in this study. In addition, in this study, subjects are required to go back to hospital for follow -up visits 1 -2 times at most after their surgery and discharged, which may make some subjects lost to follow - up. This may not be completely avoided under the condition that subjects are fully informed. According to the requirements of this study, lost -to-follow up and withdrawn subjects should be controlled within 10% of all the subjects. To sum up, although the study may fail for some reasons, the overall likelihood is relatively small. 11. Quality Control of Clinical Trials During the clinical study, the Sponsor and Investigator should execute their respective responsibilities according to the Good Clinical Practice for Medical Device Trials and applicable related Chinese and international regulations. They should also strictly follow the clinical trial protocol to ensure the quality of clinical trial. The Sponsor will ensure proper training on the clinical trial protocol and the use and maintenance of investigational medical device for all investigators participating in the trial, to ensure the consistency in the implementation of clinical trial protocol, the use of investigational medical device. During the implementation of study, the Sponsor is responsible for monitoring each phase of the clinical trial. The clinical monitor employed by the Sponsor or appointed representative should comply with the related standard operating procedure (SOP) and clinical trial protocol that are established by the Sponsor to monitor the clinical trial, to ensure the complete, accurate, true and reliable data. To ensure the quality of study, the Sponsor may authorize the eligible auditor to audit the clinical trial, as needed. The Investigator should allow the auditors to review the original data and documents related to this study after receiving the notification. When the Food and Drug Administration, Health Planning Department or other regulatory agencies send the inspection personnel to carry out the inspection, the clini cal trial institution and Investigator should cooperate and immediately notify the Sponsor. 12.

Device Management In this study, the Sponsor will prove all the study products and control products. The packages of the products should be clearly specified with “For Clinical Trial Only”. 13.1 Accountability of investigational devices All the study involved devices received must be counted, of which the quantity should be checked continuously throughout the study: the investigator and/trained designated person should record the receipt, use, dispensing and return of devices during the study properly. These investigational devices must be kept in a secure location with restricted access and stored according to the conditions outlined in the IFU. In all circumstances, the investigational device is intended for use by the investigator or sub-investigator for subjects consented for participation in this clinical study only. An accountability log will be used by each site to acknowledge receipt of all investigational devices and to record the disposition of all investigational devices on an ongoing basis throughout the course of the study. The process of device accountability and checking should be thoroughly explained during the study site initiation period. The responsible monitor will review the investigational device accountability at each monitoring visit. In addition, the following but not limited paper study documents must be maintained as well: • Each subject’ s product accountability tables of implanted device (this may include the original document and/or packaging label of the investigational/control product used); • All forms documenting the investigational devices return process; • All forms related to transport and receipt of investigational devices. 13.2 Return of investigational devices All unopened and unused (e.g., expired), opened and unused, damaged, mislabeled or malfunctioning investigational devices must be returned to the Sponsor with related form . During the study site initiation visit, the Sponsor should train the investigator thoroughly. 14. Regulations of Adverse Event and Device Complaint Reporting 14.1 Adverse Event AE is an untoward medical occurrence during the clinical study and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study medical device. Ever since the randomization of subjects, the investigator must confirm if any AE occurs, and if any, determine the relationship between AE and investigational device or surgical procedure, when evaluating subjects enrolled by clinical study each time. Postoperative fever , postoperative pain , incisional s car formation and laboratory abnormalities are expected to occur after surgery and will not be recorded as AE in this study, unless the investigator believes the degree of pain or fever exceeds the subject ’s normal expected range after surgery or related to study devices. Other AEs, investigational device failure and oth er product problems must record in the medical record and entered the e-CRF."
40,page_40,"LLC， ESC-201702 [PR OTOCOL VERISON AND DATE] V2.0 /2019-09-30 CONFIDENTIAL 41 The severity of AE will be separated into the following grades: Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject ’s usual activity or is transient, resolved without treatment and with no sequelae, Moderate: Interferes, but does not hinder, the subject’ s usual activity and may require treatment; Severe: Causes severe discomforts, results in major impact on the subject ’s activities of daily living and requir es treatment or intervention. The causal relationship should be assessed as follows: Unrelated There is no correlation between the AE and the use of medical device Possibly unrelated The occurrence of AE is more likely to be associated with other factors, e.g.: concomitant medication or concomitant disease, or the occurrence time of the event does not suggest a causal relationship with the use of study -related device. Possible: The occurrence of AE may be caused by study -related device. Other fact ors may have contributed to the event, e.g.: concomitant medication or concomitant disease. The event occurs within a reasonable time after the use of study -related device and the causal relationship between the event and the use of study -related device cannot be ruled out. Probable The occurrence of AE is probably caused by the use of study -related device. The event occurs within a reasonable time after the use of study -related device, e.g.: it is confirmed after the medical device is taken out. It is unlikely to have another explanation for the event (e.g. concomitant medication or concomitant disease). Definitely Related: The occurrence of AE has been confirmed as a definite side effect of the medical device and cannot be explained by other reasons (e.g. concomitant medication and concomitant disease). The occurrence time of the event highly suggest a causal relationship (e.g. reaction after removal of medical device and replantation of medical device). 14.2 Serious Adverse Event SAE refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial that results in death or serious deterioration of health status, including life -threatening conditions or damage, permanent defect of body structure or body function, events requiring inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, those requiring medical or surgical intervention to avoid permanent defect of body structure or body function; and those resulting in fetal distress, fetal death or congenital anomaly/birth defect, etc. A planned hospitalization and/or medical intervention for pre -existing conditions, or a procedure required by the protocol, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be a serious adverse event. 14.3 Device Complaints A product c omplaint is defined as any written, electronic or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, labelling, quality, durability, reliability, safety, efficacy, or performance of a device after it is released for distribution . In the event of any device complaint, the study site must inform the monitor and track and report it according to the process stipulated by the Sponsor. The study site must inform the study monitor of all device complaints of the study groups and control group. T he monitor will track and report device complaints according to the method and time limit stipulated by the Sponsor and China ’s laws and regulations and return related products to the quality department of J upon the request of the Sponsor. 14.4 Device Defects Device defects refer to unreasonable risks of medical device existing during the clinical trial"

The Sponsor will notify other clinical trial institutions and investigators participating in the trial and notify the EC of the clinical trial institution involved in a timely manner via its medical device clinical trial management department. The investigator should record all AEs occurring and device deficiencies found in the process of clinical trial, work with the Sponsor to analyze the causes of the events, generate the written analysis report, present the comments on the continuation, discontin uation or termination of the trial, and report to the Ethics Committee by the administrative department for clinical trial of medical device of clinical trial institution for review. 14.5 Reporting Procedure and Contact Person Information The investigator should ensure sufficient treatment is given for any AE experienced by a subject, including clinically significant laboratory test values related to this study. Once a subject is randomized , his/her AE should be followed up, until they are resolved or stabilized and the clinical outcome has been determined, or until his/her last follow -up visit (the earliest one shall prevail). If the investigator considers the AE is related to the study product, the subject must be followed up until the event i s resolved and stabilized. The investigator must report the AE to the Sponsor via e -CRF within 2 weeks after its awareness.
