Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 arms: Arm 1: KdD Arm 2: Kd Randomization will be performed using an interactive voice/web response system (IxRS) and subjects will be stratified based on the following criteria: Original International Staging System (ISS) stage ( variables: albumin and beta 2 microglobulin; strata: Stage 1 or 2 vs Stage 3) at screening , prior proteasome inhibitor exposure (yes vsno), number of prior lines of therapy (1vs≥ 2), and prior cluster differentiation antigen 38 ( CD38) antibody therapy (yes vs no). Subjects will receive the treat ment determined by randomization for a maximum of 4years or until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death (whichev er occurs first). No crossov er between the treatment arms will be allowed. All subjects will be assessed for multiple myeloma disease response according to the IMWG-URC using central laboratory test results ev ery 28 ± 7 days. Disease response assessments will be performed every 28 ± 7 days until confirmed progressive disease (PD). Following progr ession or discontinuation of study drug (s), subjects will have 2 follow -up visits (30days [+ 3] and 8 weeks [ ±7 days] after last dose of all study drug [s]) and then remain in long-term follow -up (LTFU) where data on survival status and subsequent antimye loma therapy will be gathered ev ery 12 weeks ± 2weeks. For subjects in arm 1 (KdD), local hepatitis B testing will be performed at the next scheduled visit for all subjects being actively treated with daratumumab that do not already have a prior medical history of hepatitis B. In addition, subjects with a clinical history of hepatitis B infection or who test positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) serologies will be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hepatitis B and will have local HBV DNA testing performed at their next visit and then every 12 weeks while on treatment with daratumumab and until 6 months after ending treatment. Sample Size: Approximately 450 subjects will be enrolled ( 300 in arm 1 and 150 in arm 2 ).

Investigational Product Amgen Investigatio nal Product Dosage and Administration: Carfilzomib will be administered as an intravenous ( IV)infusion. On days when more than 1investigational product is administered, the required order of administration is as follows: dexamethasone, pre - infusion med ications for daratumumab, carfilzomib, daratumumab, and post-infusio n medications for dar atumu mab. Carfilzomib will be dosed twice weekly ov er 30 ± 5 minutes, on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each 28-day cycle. The administration may be within ± 2 days f or each scheduled dose. The dose will be 20 mg/m2on cycle 1 days 1 and 2 and 56 mg/m2beginning on cycle 1 day 8and ther eafter. Each subject’s first dose of carfilzomib will be calculated based upon baseline body surface area (BSA) using the Mosteller f ormula. In subjects with BSA of greater than 2.2 m2, the dose should be capped based on a BSA of 2.2 m2. The dose for each subject should not be revised unless the subject experiences a change in body weight of ≥ 20% in which case the BSA and dose should be recalculated . The dose can also be modified in response to toxicity following the dose modification guideline tables. Non-Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration: Daratumumab wil l be administered as an IV infusion. On days 1 and 2 of cycle 1, d aratumumab will be administered at 8 mg/kg in 500 mL normal saline each day . The dose of 16mg/kg in 500mLnormal saline will be giv en once weekly as a single infusion for the remaining d oses of the first 2 cycles ( ie, days 8, 15 ,and 22 of cycle 1 ;and days 1, 8, 15 ,and 22 of cycle 2 ), then every 2 weeks for 4 cycles (cycles 3 to 6), and then every 4 weeks for the remaining cycles or until disease progression. The administration may be within ± 2 days for each scheduled dose ."

The IV administration of dexamethasone must be gi ven on cycle 1 day s 1and 2 . Dexamethasone IVor PO will be given on successiv e days at 20 mg each treatment dayon weeks with carfilzomib and/ or daratumumab infusions. All subjects regardless of age will be required to receive 20 mg of dexamethasone on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 (as apreinfusion medication for daratumumab infusion) followed by 20mg of methylprednisolone or equiv alent on the third day. For subjects >75 years of age orsubjects whose weekly dexamethasone dose has been reduced to 20mg/week, 20 mg of dexamethasone will be given as a preinfusion medication for daratum umab infusion, followed by 8 mg of dexamethasone prior to carfilzomib infusion on days 9 and 16 of cycle 1 . Starting with cycle 2, 20 mg dexamethasone must be given on days da ratumumab is administered (without 8 mg dose on subsequent carfilzomib dosing day), otherwise the 20 mg dose can be split across carfilzomib dosing days. For days when dexamethasone is given in the absence of other IV infusion (neither carfilzomib nor dara tumumab is scheduled), it may be given within ± 2days for each scheduled dose. Dexamethasone will be administered at least 30 minutes (but no more than 4 hours) prior to carfilzomib and within 1 to 3 hours from the daratumumab dose . When carfilzomib is p ermanently discontinued, dexamethasone may be omitted on days when given in the absence of daratumumab based on their assessment of the subject’s steroid tolerance . For s ubjects in arm 1 on cycles 7+ without previous infusion -related reaction ( IRR), dexam ethasone premedication may be decreased or omitted , if the subject cannot tolerate 20mg of dexamethasone or equivalent. Procedures: Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects or legally acceptable representativ es before any study specifi c screening procedures are performed. The following procedures will occur per the Schedule of Assessments: medical history, complete physical examination, physical measurements, vital signs, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( ECOG PS) , ECG , echocardiogram (ECHO), pulmonary function tests (PFTs) , recording of concomitant medica tions, review of adverse ev ents and serious adv erse events. Electronic c linical outcome assessments will be measured using 3questionnaires. Imaging studies for bone lesions (all subjects) and sof t tissue plasmacytoma evaluation (if clinically indicated ). Central l aboratory testing will be performed to confirm disease and stage including b one marrow with samples for MRD and fluorescence in -situ hybridization ( FISH). Additional central laboratory testing will include hematology, serum chemistry, hepatic and renal function. Local laboratory testing will include coagulation factors , pregnancy testing, blood typing with indirect antiglobulin test (IAT), HBV serolog ies, and HBV DNA testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) . Samples will also be taken to perform pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PDn), biomarker studies , and anti -daratum umab antibody assessments . Subjects will be assessed for survival status and subsequent antimyeloma therapies will be collected during LTFU . For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section 7and the Schedule of Assessments (Table 10). Statistical Considerations: The efficacy analyses of PFS and key secondary endpoints will be conducted on the full analysis set. Treatment effects in efficacy endpoints will be ev aluated and compared KdD v s Kd. For PFS, response and disease progression will be determined by an IRC in a blinded manner. In addition, response and disease progression outcomes will be determined locally by investigators in an unblinded manner and centrally by the sponsor using a v alidated computer algorithm (Onyx Response Computer Algorithm [ORCA ]) in a blinded manner. The primary analysis of PFS will be based on IRC assessed outcomes ;the timing will be ev ent driv en and will happen when"

Incubation of hematologic tumor cell lines with carfilzomib for as little as 1 hour led to rapid inhibition of proteasome activity followed by accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and induction of apoptotic cell death ( Suzuki et al, 2011 ; Kuhn et al, 2007 ). Carfilzomib has also been administe red to rats and monkeys for 6 and 9 months, respectively (twice weekly for 3 weeks on a 28 -day cycle). Carfilzomib was well tolerated at doses resulting in more than 80% proteasome inhibition, with no behavioral or histological evidence of peripheral neur opathy (PN) and no neutropenia (Onyx data on file and Carfilzomib Investigator's Brochure [IB]). 2.3.2 Carfilzomib Background (C linical) Carfilzomib entered clinical studies in September 2005. On 20 July 2012, Kyprolis® (Carfilzomib for Injection) was approved under the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (US FDA) accelerated approval program for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 2 prior therapies, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), and hav e demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. The initial accelerated approval was based on the results of the phase 2 PX -171-003-A1 study in the United States . Subsequent full approval in the United States and globally were based on two phase 3trials: PX 171-009 ASPIRE and 2011 -003 ENDEAVOR. Following these approvals , Kyprolis in combination with either lenalidomide and dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone is indicated for treatment of relapsed or refractor y multiple myeloma ( RRMM ). The exact indication wording varies by region. Additional data is summarized in the IB. As of 1 9July 2016, an estimated 3373 subjects (2711 subject -years )have been exposed to carfilzomib in company -sponsored clinical trials s ince the beginning of the development program. Refer to Section 4of the Carfilzomib IB for additional information related to the physical, chemical ,and pharmaceutical properties and formulation(s) . 2.4 Non-Amgen Medicinal Product Background 2.4.1 Daratumumab Backg round (Non -Amgen Investigational Product) Daratumumab is a first in class human anti -cluster differentiation antigen 38 ( CD38 ) immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 (kappa) monoclonal antibody. CD38 is differentially expressed during B -cell development with greatest exp ression on terminally differentiated B -cells."
22,page_22,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20160275 Date: 17 May 2019 Page 23of 136 CONFIDENTIALCD38 is an enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of cyclic adenine dinucleotide phosphate ribose and nicotinic acid to adenine dinucleotide phosphate which functions in regulation of intracellular calcium store s. Various preclinical experiments with multiple myeloma cell lines, purified multiple myeloma cells, and mononuclear cell suspensions have demonstrated that daratumumab triggers lysis of multiple myeloma cells by a variety of mechanisms. The binding of the antibody to CD38 positions of the Fc receptor (FcR) in a way that optimizes interaction with complement resulting in strong complement dependent lysis ( de Weers et al, 2011 ). Antibody dependent lysis with daratumumab has been demonstrated in complement free cell suspensions of multiple myeloma cells and cell lines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) enriched for natural killer (NK) cells using both normal and patient PBMCs. Other mechanisms of action (MoA) including antibody -dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and apoptosis triggered by FcR -crosslinking have been demonstrated with daratumumab ( van der Veer et al, 2011b ). Analysis from clinical trials of daratumumab revealed an immunomodulatory role of daratumumab that leads to the induct ion of clonal T cell expansion and reduction of immune suppressive cell populations CD38+myeloid -derived suppressor cells ( MDSC ), CD38+TReg, and CD38+ BReg cells ( Krejcik et al, 2016 ). Clinical activity of daratumumab was first studied in phase 1/2 Gen 5 01 and phase 2 SIRIUS trials. A recent summary of the pooled results of these trials was reported (Usmani et al, 2016 ). The patient population was RRMM with 2 or more prior lines of therapy, 76% of patients received more than 3 lines of therapy (median 5 , range 2 to 14lines). A total of 148 patients were treated at the 16 mg/kg dose, 86.5% of patients were double refractory to both IMiD and proteasome inhibitors. The ORR was 31% and DOR 7.6 months with a median PFS of 4 months. Only 4% of patients dis continued therapy due to adverse events. Most adverse events were due to infusion reactions with approximately 50% with reactions to first infusion dropping to approximately 10% with second infusion and rare with subsequent infusions. Of interest, patien ts achieving only stable disease/minimal response (SD/MR) also appeared to benefit with a median OS of 18 months compared to 20 months for responders and 3 months for those with not evaluable/progressive disease (NE/PD). The highly significant activity of daratumumab in RRMM, novel non -overlapping mechanism or toxicity wi th regard to bortezomib and lenalidomide predict high tolerability and efficacy of KdD combination therapy in treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma ."
23,page_23,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20160275 Date: 17 May 2019 Page 24of 136 CONFIDENTIAL2.4.2 Daratumumab Mechanism of Action Daratu mumab is a targeted immunotherapy that binds to CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in multiple myeloma plasma cells. Multiple MoA have been observed for daratumumab, including complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody- depende nt cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), induction of apoptosis by Fc gamma receptor mediated crosslinking of tumor bound monoclonal antibodies, and ADCP. Translational biomarker studies of samples from patients treated in daratumumab phase 1 and phase 2 studies ( Studies GEN501 and MMY2002, respectively) have revealed previously unknown immunomodulatory effects of daratumumab (Krejcik etal,2016 ). Detailed analysis by flow cytometry ( FC)of changes in circulating immune cells demonstrated that daratumumab was abl e to induce large increases in CD8+T numbers. Next generation T-cell receptor ( TCR)sequencing was ut ilized to evaluate changes in T cell clonality. Interestingly, in patients who responded to daratumumab, both the maximal individual increase in a T cell clone, as well as the sum of expanded T cell clones, were significantly increased suggesting that T cell expansion may have a role in eliminating the myeloma cells. In order to assess the potential mechanism by which daratumumab could lead to these incr eases in T cell clones, additional analysis revealed that there was a rapid and sustained elimination of highly immunosuppressive subsets of CD38+Tregs, CD38+MDSCs, and CD38+Bregs in patients treated with daratumumab. The CD38+Tregs identified is a no vel population of Tregs that are more immunosuppressive than CD38-Tregs. In addition, it has also been shown that daratumumab can modulate the enzymatic activity of CD38 and potentially lead to a reduction in immunosuppressive adenosine levels in the tum or microenvironment ( Horenstein et al, 2013 ). Some of daratumumab’s most differentiating attributes are the depth of response achieved in responders and the drug’s multifaceted MoA. Based upon these new findings, it is hypothesized that daratumumab’s deep and durable responses in patients with multiple myeloma are induced, in part, by the immunomodulatory activity that removes immune suppressive functions of CD38+MDSC, CD38+TReg, and CD38+BReg cells and increases T cell clonality. A figure summarizing daratumumab’s novel, converging MoA is presented in Figure 1."

Daratumumab Mechanisms of Action ADCC = antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; ADCP = antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis; ADPR = adenosine diphosphate ribose; AMP = adenosine monophosphate; Ca2+=calcium ion; cADP R = cyclic adenosine dip hospho ribose; CD38 = cluster differentiation antigen 38; CD8+= cluster of differentiation 8; CDC =complement -dependent cytotoxicity; DARA = daratumumab; MM = multiple myeloma; MDSC = myeloid -derived suppressor cell; NAADP =nicotinic acid adenine dinucle otide phosphate; NAD = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NK = natural killer. Previously reported to kill tumor cells by immune -mediated mechanisms, such as ADCC, ADCP, and CDC, as well as by programmed cell death via cross linking of the antibody on the cell surface, it is now known that daratumumab also induces immunomodulatory effects via several different pathways that contribute to killing of CD38+immune cells that modulate T cell activity, namely MDSC, TReg, and BReg. This is a novel mechanism prev iously unreported that is hypothesized to drive development of multiple opportunities for daratumumab beyond CD38+myeloma and other heme malignancies. 2.4.3 Dexamethasone (Non- Amgen Non -investigational Product) Dexamethasone is commercially available.

ASPIRE was the first phase 3 randomized study demonstrating that a triplet using non-conventional chemotherapy agents had signific ant improvement in outcomes when compared with a duplet. In this study, KRd reduced the risk of progression by 31% when compared to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69, P <0.0001; Stewart et al, 2015 ) which translated in a median PFS of 26.3 months in the KRd arm with consistent benefit in subgroup analyses. These positive results were despite limiting carfilzomib treatment to the first 18 cycles of therapy. Soon after, the concept of superior outcomes with novel agent -based triplet s as treatment of early relapsed multiple myeloma (1 to 3 prior lines) was confirmed with other combinations (Table 1). More recently, interim data from two phase 3 trials with daratumumab has shown improvement of outcomes when added to either bortezomib and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone backbones. Compared to lenalidomide and dexamethasone for patients with RRMM with a median of 1 prior line of therapy, the addition of daratumumab reduced the risk of progression by 63% (HR = 0.37, P <0.0001; Dimopoulos et al, 2016 ). Compared to bortezomib and dexamethasone, the addition of da ratumumab reduced the risk of progression by 61% in patients with RRMM with a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (HR = 0.39, P < 0.0001; Palumbo et al, 2016 ). Among the phase 3 studies in relapsed multiple myeloma, the results achieved with carfilzomib and daratumumab based combinations suggest that these 2 agents are likely the most potent in their respective class es. They both have demonstrated high rates of overall responses and significant increment of CRRs (Table 1). Moreover, pre -clinical and clinical studies combining daratumumab to proteasome inhibitors have demonstrated synergy ( Palumbo et al, 2016 ; van der Veer et al, 2011a ). Therefore, it is expected that the combination of both agents, carfilzomib and daratumumab, would provide a highly efficacious treatment option for patients with relapsed disease. Anumber of ongoing phase 3 studie s in newly diagnosed transplant ineligible patients are evaluating lenalidomide -based triplets with planned treatment to continue until progression (NCT01335399, NCT01850524, NCT02252172, and NCT02579863). Moreover, a recent meta -analysis has demonstrated OS advantage on the use of lenalidomide maintenance after autologous stem cell transplant ( McCarthy et al, 2016 ). This information points to an increase in the number of subjects that have been exposed"

Developing lenalidom ide-sparing options is expected to address a significant unmet need in the near future for the treatment of relapsed myeloma. Table 1.

The dose selection was based on an acceptable safety profile, maximal clinical activity, and PKs consistent with saturation of the target. The data supporting the selection of a 16mg/kg dose for the treatment of multiple myeloma are as follows: Safety: Clinical safety data demonstrated that daratumumab is well -tolerated, with clinically manageable side effects, highlighted by the fact that no subject treated with 16mg/kg daratumumab monotherapy discontinued treatment as a result of a daratumumab related adverse event. For doses above 4 mg/kg, there was no dose dependent toxicity pattern observed."
27,page_27,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20160275 Date: 17 May 2019 Page 28of 136 CONFIDENTIALClinical efficacy: Clinical response data derived from Study GEN501 and Study MMY2002 show robust ac tivity among subjects treated at 16 mg/kg with ORRs of 36% and 29%, respectively. The response rates were consistently and significantly higher and deeper at the 16 mg/kg dose level as compared to various schedules at the 8 mg/kg dose level. Pharmacokineti cs: Daratumumab exhibits target -mediated drug disposition. Daratumumab binds to CD38 receptors in the body and the complex with daratumumab is rapidly cleared. As the dose is increased or after repeated administration, CD38 becomes saturated, and the im pact of target binding clearance is minimized and PK data can indicate target saturation. Population PK and exposure -response analyses suggested that 16mg/kg is the lowest tested dose at which the majority (approximately 80%) of subjects achieved serum co ncentrations above the model -predicted 99% target saturation threshold and 90% of the maximum effect on ORR threshold. Lowering the dose would likely result in reduced efficacy, whereas increasing the dose may not provide further improvement of the benefit -risk profile. The initial weekly dosing schedule rapidly established efficacious concentrations. The every 2 week and every 4 week dosing frequencies were sufficient to produce serum concentration levels that maintained target saturation; thus reducing t he risk of disease progression. 2.5.3 Rationale for the Combination The rationale for combining daratumumab with a proteasome inhibitor is supported by the results obtained in the CASTOR study as described above. This study was conducted with bortezomib, a reve rsible inhibitor of the proteasome which was also evaluated head -to-head against carfilzomib and dexamethasone in the ENDEAVOR study with a similar patient population. The results of this comparison suggest superior outcomes with carfilzomib with a 47% reduction in the risk of progression or death (HR=0.53, P < 0.0001; Dimopoulos et al, 2016 ) and are the basis for the labeled dose in RRMM. Given the orthogonal MoA of daratumumab, the addition to the carfilzomib and dexamethasone regimen is hypothesized to be highly efficacious and possibly result in a longer duration of PFS compared to the experimental arm in the CASTOR study. An ongoing phase 1b study is evaluating the safety of the addition of daratumumab to carfilzomib and dexamethasone (NCT01998971) . As of 30 June 2016, 20 subjects have been treated with KdD in the ongoing Study MMY1001. The most frequently reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events were laboratory- related and included thrombocytopenia (35%), neutropenia (25%), and anemia (15%). Cardiac disorders were reported in 4subjects and were grade 1 and 2 tachycardia (2 subjects), atrial fibrillation (1 subject), and cardiac failure (1 subject). No grade 3 cardiac disorder adverse events were reported. The subject with grade 2 cardiac failure recovered from the event and"
28,page_28,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20160275 Date: 17 May 2019 Page 29of 136 CONFIDENTIALcontinued on investigational product, receiving a reduced dose of carfilzomib. Based on these preliminary data, the combination of KdD is well tolerated with a safety profile that is consistent with the known safety profile o f daratumumab or Kd. For the combination of these 2 agents, the initial daratumumab infusion and any subsequent infusions that would otherwise require a large volume (eg, 1 liter); will be divided in 2 days to minimize the risk of volume overload given tha t new or worsening cardiac failure has occurred following the administration of carfilzomib. 2.5.4 Rationale for the Carfilzomib Dose Schedule The dose schedule in the KdD arm is based on the objective of evaluating the effect of the addition of daratumumab to a well characterized carfilzomib dexamethasone regimen. The safety and efficacy of 20/56 mg/m2twice -a-week carfilzomib combined with dexamethasone has been defined in a randomized phase 3 trial ( ENDEAVOR; Dimopoulos et al, 2016 ). In ENDEAVOR , Kdwas comp ared to bortezomib with dexamethasone (Vd) in a similar patient population proposed in this phase 3 trial (Study 20160275) .The carfilzomib arm proved superior at the first interim analysis for efficacy reducing the risk of progression or death by 47% (me dian PFS [Kd vs Vd] : 18.7 months vs 9.4 months). The median follow up for the Kd arm was 11.9 months at the time of the first interim analysis. A pre -planned interim analysis for OS demonstrated a 21% reduction in the risk of death (median OS [Kd vs Vd] 47.6 vs 40 months). The median number of weeks of carfilzomib received per subject was 48.0 in the Kd group (Dimopoulos et al, 2017 ). At the time of this analysis, there were 212 subjects who have received over 1 year of therapy, 89 with more than 2 yea rs, and 31with more than 3years. The incidence of grade 3 treatment -emergent adverse events has decreased over the years, from 74.1% in the first 12 months, to 52.8%between 12 and 24 months, 44.9% between 24 and 36 months, and 29.0% in subjects with mo re than 36 months. Similarly, the rate of serious adverse events shows a decrease from 47. 9% in the first 12months, 32.5% between 12 to 24 months, 24.7%between 24 to 36 months, and 3.2% in subjects exposed more than 36 months ( data on file ). The data t o-date are supportive of at least 3yearsexposure of carfilzomib and lo w-dose dexamethasone as done in the ENDEAVOR trial. Daratumumab has been successfully combined with a range of anti -myeloma therapies, including recently released data on successful combination with a proteasome inhibitor in the CASTOR study in a similar patient population. An ongoing phase 1b study evaluating the addition of daratumumab to several standards of care includes an arm of"
29,page_29,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20160275 Date: 17 May 2019 Page 30of 136 CONFIDENTIALcarfilzomib dosed at 20/70 mg/m2weekly in combin ation with daratumumab. As of 30June 2016 ,there have been 20 subjects treated with KdD in this study with the observed adverse events were consistent with the known individual safety profile sfor carfilzomib and daratumumab. The safety profile of carfi lzomib dosed at 20/70 mg/m2 weekly in combination with dexamethasone and daratumumab is consistent with the known safety profiles of carfilzomib and daratumumab independently. Carfilzomib PKs with the 20/70 mg/m2weekly dose showed higher C max(maximum concentration) than that with the 20/56 mg/m2 twice -a-week dose (2390 ng/mL vs 2079 ng/mL, respectively). Although the area under the curve is higher with 20/56 mg/m2twice a week (1896 ng •hr/mL vs 1030 ng •hr/mL per week), it is unlikely that these parameter s would be modified by the addition of daratumumab. This assumption is based on the short half -life of carfilzomib (< 1 hour) leading to no accumulation. Additionally, no drug -drug interaction is expected due to the orthogonal MoA of these agents and the ir different metabolism and elimination routes . Given these data, this study will evaluat ethe 20/56 mg/m2twice -a-week dose schedule for carfilzomib in combination with daratumumab and low -dose dexamethasone in this phase 3 study to develop a highly effic acious regimen for RRMM patients. 2.6 Clinical Hypothesis The KdD regimen will provide significant improvement in PFS over the Kdregimen . 3. EXPERIMENT AL PLAN 3.1 Study Design This is a phase 3 multicenter, open -label, randomized study in subjects with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 prior therapies. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 arms: Arm1: KdD using 20/56 mg/m2carfilzomib and 16 mg/kg daratumumab Arm2: Kd using 20/56 mg/m2carfilzomib Randomization will be performed using an interactive vo ice/web response system (IxRS) and subjects will be stratified based on the following criteria: 1. Original International Staging System (ISS) stage ( variables: albumin and beta 2microglobulin; strata: Stage 1 or 2 vs Stage 3) at screening 2. Prior prote asome inhibitor exposure (yes vs no)"

Prior CD38 antibody therapy (yes vs no) Subjects will receive the treatment determined by randomization for a maximum of 4years or until confirmed disease progression, unacceptabl e toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death (whichever occurs first). No crossover between the treatment arms will be allowed. All subjects will be assessed for multiple myeloma disease response according to the International Myeloma Working Group -Unifor m Response Criteria (IMWG-URC) (Appendix M) using central laboratory test results every 28 ± 7days. Disease response assessments will be performed every 28 ±7 days until confirmed PD irrespective of cycle duration including dose delays or treatment discontinuation . The disease assessment schedule is independent of treatment schedules. Following progression or discontinuation of study drug (s), subjects will have 2 follow -up visits (30 days [+ 3] and 8 weeks [± 7 days] after last dose of all study drug (s) and then remain inlong-term follow -up (LTFU )where data on survival and subsequent antimyeloma therapy will be gathered every 12 weeks ± 2 weeks. Subjects in arm 1 (KdD) with a known history of HBV infectio n or those who test positive for HBV serologies will be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hepatitis B. In addition, for subjects with a known history of HBV infection or those who test positive for HBV serologies, local HBV DNA testing will be performed at the next scheduled visit and then every 12 weeks during daratumumab treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of daratumumab. The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the protocol synopsis section. The stud y endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1 . 3.2 Number of Sites Approximately 120 sites in North America, Australia, Europe, and Asia will participate in this global study . During the conduct of the study, additional sites may be added as necessary. Sites that do not enroll subjects within 5 months of site initiation may be closed."

In subjects with BSA of greater than 2.2m2, the dose should be capped based on a BSA of 2.2m2. The dose for each subject should not be revised unless the subject experiences a c hange in body weight of ≥20% in which case the BSA and dose should be recalculated . The dose can also be modified in response to toxicity following the dose modification guideline tables. The planned dose (mg/m2), dose (mg), total volume of preparation ( mL), total volume administered (mL), start date/time, stop date/time , reason for change in planned dose, reason for dose change/withheld, reason for dose delay, reason for dose interruption and package lot number of carfilzomib isto be recorded on each su bject's electronic case report form (eCRF). 6.2.1.1.1 Intravenous Prehydration Subjects in arm 2 will receive IV prehydration prior to each carfilzomib infusion during cycle 1. For subjects in arm 1, n o pre hydration for carfilzomib will be required on days of darat umumab administration. Prehydration will consist of 250 mL normal saline or other appropriate IV fluid. Thereafter, carfilzomib prehydration should only be administered if the subject’s condition and/or risk factors require it. The total volume of prehydr ation and the reason for prehydration after cycle 1 will be recorded. 6.2.1.2 Carfilzomib: Dosage A djustments ,Delays , Rules for Withholding or Restarting , Permanent Discontinuation Carfilzomib may be discontinued, temporarily delayed, or dosage temporarily redu ced, in the event of a treatment -related toxicity that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants the discontinuation, temporary delay or dose reduction , as indicated in Table 3and Table 4. The subject will be considered on protocol treatment while receiving either carfilzomib or daratumumab (ie,if either carfilzomib or daratumumab are discontinued or interrupted, the subject is still considered on treatment if still taking the othe r investigational product) . If day 1 of a cycle is delayed , all subsequent doses within the cycle and also day 1 of subsequent cycles should be adjusted accordingly to maintain the 28 -day cycle duration. However, if a within -cycle dose is delayed, then the dates of the subsequent within -cycle doses should not be adjusted.

If both carfilzomib and daratumumab are considered likely to be involved, then recommended actions for both should be instituted. 6.2.2 Non-Amgen Investigational Product : Daratumumab 6.2.2.1 Daratumumab: Dosage, A dministration, and Schedule Daratumumab will be administered as an IV infusion. On days when more than 1investigational products are administered, the requir ed administration is as fol lows: dexamethasone, other pre-infusion medication sfor daratumumab, carfilzomib, daratumumab, and post -infusion medications for daratumumab. On days 1 and 2 of cycle 1, d aratumumab will be administered at 8 mg/kg in 500 mL normal saline each day . If the subject’s first 2 infusions of 8 mg/kg daratumumab are well-tolerated (defined as an absence of infusion -related r eaction [ IRR] >grade 1), the first infusion of 16 mg/kg in 500 mL normal saline will be given once weekly as a single infusion for the remai ning doses of the first 2 cycles ,ie, days 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1 ; and days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 2 , then every 2 weeks for 4 cycles (cycles 3 to 6), and then every 4 weeks for the remaining cycles or until disease progression . If the 8 mg/kg infusi ons are not well- tolerated (defined as IRR > grade 1), the dilution will be in 1000 mL of normal saline until the subject completes an infusion without > grade 1 IRR . For any infusions that would require a large volume (eg, 1000 mL); the daratumumab dose may be divided in 2 days. The administration may be within ± 2 days for each scheduled dose .

Forthe prevention of delayed IRR, all subjects will receive long -or intermediate -acting corticosteroid (see Section 6.2.2.1.1 ). In theabsence of infusion -related adverse events after the first 3 infusions, post -infusion corticosteroids should be administered per investigator discretion. For subjects with a higher risk of respiratory complications (eg, subjects with mild asthma or subjects with COPD who have an FEV1 <80% at screening or developed FEV1 <80% during the study without any medical history) the following post -infusion medications must be administered : antihistamine (diphenhydramine or equivalent) leukotriene inhibitor (montelukast or equivalent) short -acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist such as salbutamol aerosol control medications for lung disease (eg, inhaled c orticosteroids ± long -acting β2adrenergic receptor agonists for subjects with asthma; long -acting bronchodilators such as tiotropium or salmeterol ± inhaled corticosteroids for subjects with COPD) In addition, these at -risk subjects may be hospitalized for monitoring for up to 2 nights after an infusion. If subjects are hospitalized, then their spirometry test (FEV1) should be perform ed and documented before discharge. If these subjects are not hospitalized, then a follow -up telephone call should be made to mo nitor their condition within 48 hours after all infusions. If the subject has no texperienced a significant medical event but is hospitalized overnight only for observation, the hospitalization should not be reported as a serious adverse event. Investigators may prescribe bronchodilators, H1-antihistamines, and corticosteroids that are deemed necessary to provide adequate suppor tive care in the event a bronchospasm occurs after subjects are released from the hospital/clinic. If an at -risk subject experiences no major IRRs , then these post -infusion medications may be waived after 4 doses at the inv estigator’s discretion. Any post -infusion medication will be administered after the infusion has completed. 6.2.2.2 Daratumumab: Dosage A djustments, Delays, Rules for Withholding or Restarting, Permanent Discontinuation Individual dose modification of daratumumab is not permitted, but dose dela y is the primary method for managing daratumumab -related toxicities."

If day 1 of a cycle is delayed, day 1 of subsequent cycles should be adj usted accordingly to maintain the 28 -day cycle duration. However, if a within -cycle dose is delayed, then the dates of the subsequent within -cycle doses should not be adjusted. Any adverse event deemed to be related to daratumumab that requires a dose ho ld of more than 4 weeks (cycles 1 to 6) or more than 8weeks (cycle 7 and beyond) will result in permanent discontinuation of daratumumab. If a dose delay"

Daratumumab can be discontinued in the event of a treatment -related toxicity that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants discontinuation. The subject will be considered on protocol treatment wh ile receiving either carfilzomib or daratumumab (ie, if either carfilzomib or daratumumab are discontinued or interrupted, the subject is still considered on treatment if still taking the other investigational product). For subjects who are diagnosed with HBV reactivation while on daratumumab treatment, study treatment should be interrupted until the infection is adequately controlled (See Section 6.7.1 ). 6.2.2.3 Daratumumab: Management of Infusion -related Reactions Subjects should be carefully observed during daratumumab infusions. Trained study staff at the clinic should be prepared to intervene in case of any infusion reactions occurring, and resources necessary for resuscitation (eg, agents such as epinephrine and ae rosolized bronchodilator, also medical equipment such as oxygen tanks, tracheostomy equipment, and a defibrillator) must be available at the bedside. Attention to staffing should be considered when multiple subjects will be dosed at the same time. If an IRRdevelops, then the infusion should be temporarily interrupted. Subjects who experience adverse events during the infusion must be treated according to the investigator’s judgment and best clinical practice. Subjects should be treated with acetaminophe n, antihistamine, or corticosteroids, as needed. Intravenous saline may be indicated. For bronchospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, subjects may require antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids, or bronchodilators. For hypotension, subjects may require vasopr essors. In the event of a life -threatening IRR (which may include pulmonary or cardiac events) or anaphylactic reaction, daratumumab should be discontinued and no additional daratumumab should be administered to the subject. Infusion -related Reactions of Grade 1 or Grade 2 If the investigator assesses a grade 1 to 2 IRR adverse event to be related to administration of study drug, then the daratumumab administration should be paused. When the subject's condition is stable, daratumumab administration may be restarted at the investigator's discretion. If the subject experiences a grade 2or higher event of laryngeal edema, or a grade 2 or higher event of bronchospasm that does not respond to systemic therapy and does not"

Infusion -related Reactions of Grade 3 or Higher For IRR adverse events (other than laryngeal edema or bronchospasm) that are grade 3, the daratumumab administration must be stopped and the subject must be observed carefully until resolution of the adverse event or until the intensity of the event decreases to grade 1, at which point the daratumumab administration may be restarted at the investigator’s discretion. If the intensity of the adverse ev ent returns to g rade 3 after restart of the daratumumab administration, then the subject must be withdrawn from daratumumab treatment. For IRR adverse events that are grade 4, the daratumumab administration must be stopped and the subject withdrawn from da ratumumab treatment. Recurrent Infusion -related Reactions If a grade 3 IRR (or grade 2 or higher event of laryngeal edema, or a grade 2 or higher event of bronchospasm) recurs during or within 24 hours after a subsequent daratumumab administration, the dar atumumab treatment must be discontinued. 6.3 Non-Amgen Non-investigational Produc t: Dexamethason e 6.3.1 Dexamethasone: Dosage, A dministration, and Schedule Dexamethasone, a n on-Amge n non -investigational product, will also be used in this study. On days when more than 1 investigational product is administered, the requir ed order of administration is as follows : dexamethasone, pre -infusion medication sfor daratumumab, carfilzomib, daratumumab, and post -infusion medications for daratum umab. Dexamethasone 40 mg will be taken orally or by IV infusion weekly. Dexamethasone must be given intravenously on cycle 1 days 1 and 2 . See Table 12and Table 13to review the arm1 and arm 2, dosing schedules, respectively.

Dexamethasone will be administered at least 30 minutes (but no more than 4 hours) prior to carfilzomib and within 1 to 3 hours from the daratumumab dose . Additional details regarding dexamethasone is provided in the Investigational Product Information Manual . 6.3.2 Dexamethasone: Dosage A djustments, Delays, Rules for Withholding or Restarting, Pe rmanent Discontinuation All dexamethasone administrations must be within the 2 days of the scheduled administration ; however, it must be given on days carfilzomib and/or daratumumab will be administered . The dose , date, and time areto be recorded on each subject’s eCRF. The reason for dose change of dexamethasone is also to be recorded on each subject’s eCRF. For conditions that do not require dexamethasone dose reduction, refer to Section 6.4. For subjects > 75 years of age or subjects whose weekly dexamethasone dose has been reduced to 20 mg/week, 20 mg of dexamethasone will be given a s a preinfusion medication for daratumumab infusion, followed by 8 mg of dexamethasone prior to carfilzomib infusion on days 9 and 16 of cycle 1. Starting with cycle 2, 20 mg dexamethasone must be given on days daratumumab is administered (without 8 mg dose on subsequent carfilzomib dosing day), otherwise the 20 -mg dose can be split across carfilzomib dosing days (eg, 12/8, 10/10, etc , as shown in Table 12and Table 13). When carfilzomib is permanently discontinued, investigators may at their discretion omit dexamethasone on days when given in the absence of daratumumab based on their assessment of the subject’s steroid tolerance . Subjects in arm 1 on cycles 7+ without previous IRR, may d ecrease or omit dexamethasone premedication, if the subject cannot tolerate 20 mg of dexamethasone or equivalent . 6.3.2.1 Dexamethasone: Dose Reduction Levels Three dose reduction levels are defined for dexamethasone based on the age of subjects, as shown in Table 7.

Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. Female in the following categories are not considered of child bearing potential: 1.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: a. Documented hysterectomy b. Documented bilateral salpingectomy c. Documented bilateral oophorectomy Note: Site personnel documentation from the following sources is acceptable: 1)review of subject medical records, 2) subject medical examination, or 3 ) subject medical history interview. 2.Premenarchal female"

A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal rang e may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. b.Females on HRT and whose meno pausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the non- hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 6.10.1 Female Subjects Females of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with carfilzomib. Given that carfilzomib was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in peripheral blood l ymphocytes, as a precaution, FCBP and/or their male partners should use highly effective contraception methods or abstain from sexual activity during treatment and for 30 days a fter treatment with carfilzomib and for 3 months after cessation of daratumumab treatment. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use 1highly effective method of contraception (as described in Table 9). It cannot be excluded that the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced during carfilzomib treatment. In addition, due to an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events associated with carfilzomib ,females should avoid the use of hormonal contraceptives that are associated with a risk of thrombosis during treatment with carfilzomib. Female subjects of childbearing potential who are using oral contraceptives or a hormonal method of contraception th at is associated with a risk of thrombosis should switch to an alternative non-hormonal method of highly effective contraception."

Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods for Female Subjects Failure rate of < 1% per year whe n used consistently and correctly Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal [vaginal ring ], or transdermal) Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable) Intrauterine device (IUD) Intrauterine hormonal -releasing system (IUS) Bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has receiv ed medical assessment of the surgical success) Sexual abstinence: Defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliab ility of sexual abstinence must be ev aluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. If a female subject is suspected of being pregnant, the protocol -required therapies must be stopped immediately and may not be resumed until absence of pregnancy has been medically confirmed. Lactation It is not known if carfilzomib is transferred into breast milk. If the subject is breastfeeding and wishes to be in this study, they will be required to discontinue nur sing during study treatment and for an additional 30 days after stopping carfilzomib. There is no information regarding the presence of daratumumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG is known t o be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breast -feeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for daratumumab and any potential adverse effects on the breast -fed child from daratumumab or from the underlying maternal condition. 6.10.2 Male Subjects If the male’s sole sexual partner is of non -childbearing potential or has had a bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, he is not required to use additional forms of contraception during the study. The definition of non -childbearing potential is provided above.

The female partner is to use an acceptable method of effective contraception such as: hormonal, intrauterine device ( IUD), intrauterine hormonal -releasing system ( IUS), female barrier method (diaphragm, cervical cap, contraceptive sponge [a female condom is not an option because there is a risk of tearing when both partners use a condom]). Male subjects must not donate sperm during treatment of carfilzomib and/or daratumumab and for an additional 90 days after the last dose of carfilzomib and/or daratumuma b. Male subjects with a pregnant partner must practice sexual abstinence or wear a condom to prevent exposure of the unborn child to carfilzomib through semen. 6.10.3 Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for Male and Female Subjects Birth control methods that ar e considered unacceptable in clinical trials include: periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method.

Subjects must fast for at least 9 hours before screening hematology and serum chemistries. If central lab oratory results for lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH), bilirubin , AST, and potassium arenot reported/available at screening, local lab oratory results may be utilized if completed within the screening window . Screening coagulat ion tests will be done at local laboratories . Post-enrol lment, laboratory samples may be collected and analyzed by local laboratories if immediate results are necessary for management of treatment -emergent adverse events or dosing determination . Evaluati on of lab results for dose determination as required per Schedule of Assessments must be documented prior to dosing in each cycle. Any local lab values that lead to dose modification decisions must be recorded in the eCRF. Any local lab results that fulf ill≥ grade 3 values per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE )must be recorded in the eCRF. For cycle 1 day 1, hematology and serum chemistry panel from screening may be used if within 14 days of day 1. For subsequent visits in cycle 1, hematology and chemistry may be completed up to 72hours prior to scheduled dose weekly for cycle 1. Starting in cycle 2, only day 1 is required.

In addition to the pregnancy test conducted for eligibility, a urine or serum pregnancy test must be locally confirmed negative on day 1 of each cycle prior to dosing and at end of treatment . More frequent pregna ncy tests may be conducted if required per local regulations. 7.3.18 Blood Typing and IA T Blood type, Rh, and IAT should be done before the first dose of daratumumab. Subject RBC phenotyping (standard or extended) is an alternative option to the IAT test, if loc ally required. Either method must be completed prior to first daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab interferes with the IAT, which is a routine pre -transfusion test performed to identify a patient’s antibodies to minor antigens so that suitable donor blood ca n be given for transfusion. Daratumumab does not interfere with ABO/RhD typing. CD38 is expressed at very low levels on erythrocytes. Daratumumab binds to the CD38 on erythrocytes, which results in a positive IAT (Indirect Coombs Test). This positive r esult masks the detection of antibodies to minor antigens and may prevent or delay blood banks from issuing donor blood for transfusion. This effect occurs during daratumumab treatment and for up to 6 months after treatment ends. Subjects will receive a patient identification wallet card for the study that includes the blood profile (ABO, Rh, and IAT or phenotyping) determined before the first infusion of daratumumab along with information on the IAT interference for healthcare providers/blood banks. Sub jects are to carry this card throughout the treatment period and for at least 6 months after treatment ends. Blood banks can eliminate the daratumumab IAT interference with IAT by treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT; Chapuy et al, 2015 ). Possib le methods for blood banks to provide safe RBCs for transfusion to subjects receiving daratumumab include: Providing ABO/RhD compatible, phenotypically (standard or extended phenotyping) or genotypically matched units Providing ABO/RhD compatible, K -negati ve units after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT- treated reagent RBCs"

The subjects who test positive for anti -drug antibody will be followed until anti -drug antibody levels return to baseline; antibody titers and neutralizing antibodies will be measured for these subj ects. Serum samples will be screened for antibodies binding to daratumumab and serum titer will also be determined from confirmed positive samples using validated immunoassay methods. Other immunogenicity analyses (eg, assessment of neutralizing capabili ties) may be performed to further characterize the immune responses that are generated. Daratumumab concentration will be evaluated at all immunogenicity time points to ensure appropriate interpretation of immunogenicity data. When both daratumumab serum concentration and immunogenicity analyses are specified, they will be performed on aliquots from the same blood draw and no additional sampling is required. Procedures for sample collection, preparation, identification, storage, and shipment will be prov ided in the Laboratory Manual or equivalent document. 7.3.22 Tumor Response and Multiple Myeloma Disease A ssessment Disease assessments will be based on central laboratory data obtained every 28± 7days until confirmed PD (Section 7.3.22.5 ) irrespective of cycle duration including dose delays and treatment discontinuation. For subjects who do not progress during treatment, disease assessments will continue to be measured (by the central laboratory) until PD. Disease response and progression assessments include: SPEP, UPEP, SFLC , serum and urine immunofixation (SIFE, UIFE, respectively) ( Sectio n 7.3.22.1 ), bone marrow sample evaluation ( Section 7.3.22.2 ), serum calcium, bone lesion evaluation (Section 7.3.22.3 ), and plasmacytoma evaluation ( Section 7.3.22.4 ). 7.3.22.1 SPEP, UPEP, SFLC, SIFE, and UIFE Serum protein electrophoresis, UPEP, SIFE, UIFE , and SFLC will all be conducted at the central laboratory every 28 ± 7 days (starting from cycle 1 day 1) irrespective of cycle duration including dose delays and treatment discontinuation. Blood will be obtained for SFLC, SPEP, and SIFE. Twenty -four hour urine samples will be obtained for UPEP and"

Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), UPEP, and SFLC will be repeated on cycle 1 day 1 (unless screening values are within 14 days of cycle 1 day 1). Post cycle 1 day 1 ,UPEP and UIFE will be measur ed every disease assessment as well as SPEP. Subjects will be evaluated for disease response and progression according to the IM WG response criteria in Appendix M. Disease status categories include sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR, SD, and PD. Investigator evaluation of disease response is to be based solely on the central laboratory results, not on local laboratory results for laboratory -based parameters. The following confirmation assessments are required for all response categories (sCR, CR, VGPR, PR , and MR; refer to definitions in Appendix M): All response categories require 2 consecutive assessments made at any time before initiation of any new therapy All categories also require no known evidence of progression including new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed Confirmation of CR or sCR requires bone marrow assessment (aspirate or biopsy) Extramedullary plasmacytoma evaluation (if present at screening) For subjects with darat umumab interference on SIFE, a second reflex assay using the anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody will be used to label daratumumab migration on the IFE(Kumar et al, 2016 ). Subjects that meet all other IM WG criteria ( Appendix M) for CR, and whose positive IFE is confirmed to be daratumumab, will be considered complete responders. For subjects with light chain multiple myeloma, both serum and urine IFE test and SFLC assay will be performed every disease assessment. As daratumumab is a monoclonal IgG kappa antibody, additional serum samples may be utilized to monitor for potential daratumumab interf erence with the IFEfor subjects in arm 1 (KdD) . 7.3.22.2 Bone Marrow Sample Evaluation Including FISH and MRD[ -]CR Assessment A baseline bone marrow sample (aspirate slides and/or biopsy) will be collected prior to first dose and will be used to confirm the diagno sis and quantify the percent (%) of myeloma cell involvement.

All other bone marrow aspirate assessments include MRD NGS, cytomorphology, andpharmacogenetics. Additional bone marrow biopsy or aspirate slides will be obtained as clinically indicated to confirm a response of CR or sCR . In addition, a bone marrow aspirate will be obtained for MRD assessment at all of the following time points : at a fixed, landmark analysis at12 months (4weeks ) 12 months calculated from baseline (cycle 1 day 1) this sample is collected from subjects who have not had confirmed disease progression if subject reached CRprior to the 12 month landmark and the CRsample was taken within 4 months, no additional sample is required, unless clinically indicated when a subject reaches CR and did not have a bone marrow aspirate sample taken for MRD analysis within the past 4months ,unless there is a clinical reason to repeat the assessment this sample may be collected/saved at the same time when the cytomorphology sample is collected for the confirmation of CR (per IMWG -URC criteria described in protocol Appendix M) at 12 months after confirmed CR (per IMWG -URC criteria described in protocol Appendix M) and subject did not have an MRD analysis within the past 4months, unless there is a clinical reason to repeat the assessment at 24 months (4 weeks )for all subjects that have reached a CR and have not have an MRD assessment within the pa st 4 months ,unless there is a clinical reason to repeat the assessment 24 months is calculated from baseline (cycle 1 day 1) this sample is collected from all subjects who reached CR at any point during the study participation and are still receiving trea tment or have not progressed and still attend site for disease assessment visits Samples for MRD analysis are not collected from subjects who ha vePDconfirmed orhave withdrawn consent related to this study assessment . 7.3.22.3 Bone Lesion A ssessment (Skeletal Sur vey, CT, or PET/CT) Skeletal survey will include lateral radiograph of the skull, anteroposterior and lateral views of the spine, and anteroposterior views of the pelvis, ribs, femora, and humeri. Low-dose whole body computed tomography (LD W BCT) or fluorodeoxyglucose -positron emission tomography /computed tomography (FDG -PET/CT) may be used in place of skeletal survey.

The same method of assessment used at baseline will be used throughout the study. These imaging studies will be read locally. 7.3.22.4 Extramedullary Plasmacytoma Extramedullary plasmacytoma ev aluation will be conducted at screening only if a lesion is suspected clinically. The evaluation may be done within 30 days prior to randomization ,if performed as a part of standard of care. If an extramedullary plasmacytoma is detected, evaluation will be repeated during treatment only to confirm a response of PR or better, or to confirm PD or as clinically indicated. Assessment of measurable sites of extramedullary disease will be performed and evaluated locally every 28 days (for physical examination ) for subjects with a history of plasmacytomas or as clinically indicated during treatment for other subjects until confirmed CR or confirmed disease progression. If assessment can only be performed radiologically, then evaluation of extramedullary plasma cytomas may be done every 12 weeks. The same technique (which may include clinical evaluation by palpation, ultrasound, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , or PET/CT should be employed for each measurement of plasmacytoma dimensions as clinically a ppropriate (refer to Appendix M). Bidimensional lesion measurements must be performed and re corded in the designated eCRF. 7.3.22.5 Progressive Disease Assessment Progressive disease (including PD due to development of hypercalcemia attributed solely to recurrence/progression of multiple myeloma) must be based on central laboratory evaluation. Confirma tion of PD (using 2 consecutive assessments) will be require d only when it is determined by central laboratory evaluations and not if identified via imaging asper IM WG-URC criteria ,if progression is defined by such lab evaluations . Local laboratory eval uation will not be accepted. The assessments outlined in Appendix Mare required for PD. Patients will be considered to have progressive disease if they meet the criteria for progression by a variable that was not considered measurable at baseline; however, for patients who had a measurable serum or urine M-spike at baseline , progression cannot be defined by increases in SFLC alone (Kumar etal, 2016 ). 7.4 Biomarker Development Minimal residual disease in bone marrow is a mandatory biomarker measurement in this study.

The bone marrow aspirates will be processed and stored according to a protocol that is provided to the central lab. The samples will be analyz ed centrally by the NGS -based MRD assay. See Section 7.3.22.2 for details on priori ty of samples for bone marrow aspirate testing. Whole blood will be collected from participating subjects at screening , cycle 1 day 15, cycle 3 day 1 ,and cycle 6 day 1 toexplore the relationship between serum -and plasma - based biomarkers and subject resp onse to treatment. Plasma collected at study start, cycle 13 day 1 , and upon achievement of CR,will be used for isolation and analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). ctDNA will be analyzed by DNA -sequencing for the determination of biomarkers, includ ing but not limited to, disease progression, treatment resistance, and patient -specific DNA mutations associated with MRD . Serum collected at study start will be analyzed by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA )for the determination of biomarkers inc luding, but not limited to, soluble CD38 (sCD38) protein. 7.5 Pharmacogenetic Studies If the subject consents to the optional pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA analyses may be performed. These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on inherited gene tic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or responsiveness to the therapies used in this study. The goals of the optional studies include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of multiple myeloma and/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative response to protocol -required therapies . Saliva samples (collected predose on cycle 1 day 1 , specifically for this optional test ) and bone marrow aspirates (collected predose on cycle 1 day 1 and the firstfollow -up visit , as part of required protocol assessments ) are collect ed for this part of the study . For subjects who consent to this/these analysis/analyses, DNA may be extracted. Bone marrow aspirate collected will be subjected to CD138+enrichment to isolate malignant plasma cells and these malignant cells will then be used for both RNA -and DNA -sequencing to identify genomic alterations that may be associated with prognosis or prediction of drug response (see Section 7.3.22.2 for details on priority of samples for bone marrow aspirate testing) . Saliva will be used to isolate geno mic DNA (gDNA) for use in DNA sequencing, to assist in the identification of tumor -specific mutations in the bone marrow ."

This includes testing to ensure analytical methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study . This can also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample r eanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability. All samples and associated results will be coded with a unique identification number prior to being shipped from the site for analysis or storage. Samples will be tracked using a unique identi fier that is assigned to the samples for the study. Test results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality.

Results from these analyses are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study. Samples can be retained for up to 20 years. Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetic , biomarker , or other exploratory studies are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties , except as specified in the in formed consent. The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by contacting the investigator . Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to provide the sponsor with the required study and subject identific ation number so that any remaining blood, urine, saliva , or bone marrow samples and any other components from the cell s can be located and destroyed. Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedure s are completed. However, information colle cted from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by Amgen. The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the investigator ,at the end of the storage period ,or as"

WITHDRAWAL FROM TREA TMENT, PROCEDURES, A ND STUDY 8.1 Subject s’Decision to Withdraw Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution. Subjects (or a legally acceptable representativ e) can decline to continue receiving investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapies or procedures at any time during the study but continue participation in the study . If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the a ppropriate processes for discontinuation from investigational product , device or other protocol -required therapies and must discuss with the subject t he options for continuation of the S chedule of Assessments (Table 10) including different options of follow -up (eg, in person, by phone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication w ith other treating physicians, from the review of medical records) and collection of data, including endpoints ,adverse events , as applicable .Subjects who have discontinued investigational product and/or protocol required therapies or procedures should n ot be automatically removed from the study. Whenever safe and feasible it is imperative that subjects remain on -study to ensure safety surveillance and/or collection of outcome data. The investigator must document the level of follow -up that is agreed to by the subject . Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further protocol -required therapies or procedures ,and the subject does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation . Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study ,and where permitted, publically available data can be included after withdrawal of consent. The investigator is to discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study."

SAFETY DA TA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING 9.1 Definition of Safety Events 9.1.1 Adverse Events An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject. The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record."
88,page_88,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20160275 Date: 17May 2019 Page 89of 136 CONFIDENTIALThe definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre -existing medical condition. Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg,diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration more than would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome than expected . A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , is not considered an adverse event. If the severity of a n adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of resolution, record as a single event with the highest grade (grade 1 to 4) on the Events eCRF. Record a grade 5 advers e event as a separate event with a 1day duration. For situations when an a dverse event or serious adverse event is due to multiple myeloma report all known signs and symptoms. Death due to disease progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor type (eg,multiple myeloma ). Note: The te rm “disease progression” should not be used to describe the disease -related event or adverse event. The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from treatment due to an adverse event. In the event a subje ct, or subject’s legally acceptable representative request sto withdraw from protocol -required therapies or the study due to an adverse event ,refer to Section 8.1for additional instructions on the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or the study. 9.1.2 Serious A dverse Events A serious adverse event is d efined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria : fatal life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (exceptions: hospita lized due to long infusion time of study drugs or if hospitalized overnight only for observation as described in Section 6.2.2.1.2 ) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity congenital anomaly/birth defect other medically important serious event"
89,page_89,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20160275 Date: 17May 2019 Page 90of 136 CONFIDENTIALAn adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if t he event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay). If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”. Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug-induced liver injury, or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery , or urgent intervention. 9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures 9.2.1 Adverse Events 9.2.1.1 Reporting Procedures for A dverse Events That Do Not Meet Serious Criteria The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the investigator or repor ted by the subject that occur after signing of ICF through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or the follow -up visit (whichever is later) are reported using the Event CRF. The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes: adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) , severity (and/or toxicity per protocol) , assessment of relatedness to investigational product (s)or other protocol -required therap ies,and action taken. The adverse event grading scale used will be the Amgen adverse event standard grading score; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) .The grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix A. The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the investigational product (s). This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product (s)? The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any study -mandated activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol -required therapies, use of medical device (s)and/or procedure (including any screening procedure(s) ). This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to th e question:"

The Investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or reversibility. 9.2.1.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious A dverse Events The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject t hat occur after the subject signing of the informed consent through 30 days after the last dose of the investigational product are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen . All serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen w ithin 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event CRF. If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an elec tronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. SeeAppendix Bfor a sample of the electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form. For EDC studies where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system whe n the system is again available. The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to the investigational product(s) . This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the inves tigational product(s) ? Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship between investigational product and the event. The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization or reversibility. New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be submitted to Amgen . All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information. If specifically requeste d, the investigator may need to provide additional follow -up information, such as discharge summar ies, medical records, or extracts from the medical record s."

If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen. 9.2.1.3 Reporting Serious A dverse Events A fter the Protocol -required Reporting Period There is no re quirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study. However, these serious adverse events can be reported to Amgen. In some countries (eg, European Union [EU] member state s), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of after end of study. If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator has to report them to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of th e event. Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period willbe captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting. 9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting If a female subject b ecomes pregnant, or a male subject fathers a child, while the subject is taking carfilzomib report the pregnancy to Amgen Global Patient Safety as specified below. In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should reportpregnancies that occur 30 days after the last dose of carfilzomib or 3 months after the cessation of daratumumab treatment . For male subjects, investigators should report pregnancies that occur during treatment and for an additional 90 days after the last dose of carfilzomib and/or daratumumab (whichever was given last) . Thepregnancy should be reported to Amgen Global P atient Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy. Report a pregnancy on the Pregnancy Notif ication Worksheet ( Appendix C). Amgen Global Patient Safety will follow -up with the investig ator regarding additional informat ionthat may be requested. If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study or within 30 days after the last dose of carfilzomib or within 3 months after the last dose of daratumumab , the investigator should attempt to obtain information regarding the birth outcome and health of the infant."

Amgen reserves the right to terminate the study at any time. Both Amgen and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the investigator ’s participation in the study according to the Clinical Trial Agreement . The investigator is to notify the IRB/IEC in writing of the study’s completion or early termination and send a copy of the notification to Amgen . Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amgen investigational product (s) by an extension protocol or as provid ed for by the local country’s regulatory mechanism. However, Amgen reserves the unilateral right, at its sole discretion, to determine whether to supply Amgen investigational product (s)and by what mechanism, after termination of the study and before the product(s) is/areavailable commercially. 12.2 Study Documentation and A rchive The investigator is to maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated study duties. All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on eCRFs will be included on the Amgen Delegation of Authority Form. Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s eCRF data are obtained. These include but are not limited to hospital records, clinical and office charts, l aboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, and correspondence. Electronic CRF entries may be considered source data if the eCRF is the site of the original recording (ie, there is no other written or electronic record of data). The investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and centralized filing system of all study- related (essential) documentation, suitable for inspection at any time by representatives from Amgen and/or applicable regulatory author ities.

For subjects who withdraw prior to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unabl e or unwilling to continue the Schedule of Assessments (Table 10),the investigator can search publically available records (where permitted) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the data set(s) produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible. 12.5 Language Electronic CRFs must be completed in English. TRADENAMES®(if used) for concomitant medicat ions may be entered in the local language. Consult the country- specific language requirements. All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood. 12.6 Public ation Policy To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, Amgen may facilitate the formation of a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate Amgen staff, the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter . The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to collaborate with authors and Amgen staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication Charter . Membership on the committee (both for investiga tors and Amgen staff) does not guarantee authorship . The criteria described below are to be met for every publication. Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the International Committee of Medical Journ al Editors (ICMJE )Recommendations for"

Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, 3,and 4. When a large, multi center group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript. These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above. Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justif y authorship. All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed. Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review. The Clinical Trial Agreement among the institution, investigator , and Amgen will detail the procedures for, and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications. 12.7 Compensation Any arrangements for compensation to subjects for injury or illness that arises in the study are described in the Compensation for Injury section of the Informed Consent that is available as a sepa rate document. If permitted under applicable regional laws or regulatory guidelines, study subjects may be reimbursed for reasonable travel costs and other expenses directly related to participation in this clinical trial ."

Guidelines for Documenting Prior Treatment Patients must have documented relapse after at least 1, but no more than 3 prior treatment regimens or lines of therapy for multiple myeloma. When documenting prior treatments for multiple myeloma, t he following guidelines should be used: A new line of therapy is considered to start when a planned course of therapy is modified to include other treatment agents (alone or in combination) as a result of lack of adequate response, progressive disease ( PD)(even if the level of progression has not yet met International Myeloma Working Group -Uniform Response Criteria [ IMWG-URC] for PD), relapse, or toxicity. An increase in dose of therapy, with the intention of recapturing response in a patient who has evide nce of progression on that therapy, is considered a new therapy. A new line of therapy is also considered to start when a planned period of observation off therapy is interrupted by a need for additional treatment for the disease. Examples of 1 line of the rapy include: Induction therapy and stem cell transplant followed by planned maintenance therapy (provided there is no intervening PD) Induction therapy followed by maintenance therapy (provided there is no intervening PD) Documentation of at least partial response ( PR)to at least 1 prior therapy For patients with prior carfilzomib therapy, documentation of response ( ≥PR) must be available for the most recent previous carfilzomib therapy as well as stop date. Documentation that the patient was not removed from carfilzomib therapy due to toxicity must also be available. For patients with prior therapy with either carfilzomib, the start of the 6 -month treatment -free interval is when either carfilzomib is discontinued even if other portions of the regimen are continued."

All response categories (CR, sCR, VGPR, PR) require 2 consecutive assessments made at any time before the initiation of any new therapy as well as no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements. Bone marrow, plasmacytoma, and skeletal survey assessments are not required to be confirmed by repeat testing . For sCR: presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the kappa lambda ra tio. A n abnormal kappa lambda ratio by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis . Response criteria for all categories and subcategories of response, except CR and VGPR are applicable only to patien ts that have measurable disease, defined by at least 1 of: Immunoglobulin (I g) G multiple myeloma: serum monoclonal paraprotein (M -prote in) level ≥1.0g/dL,"

Determination of PD while on study requires 2 consecutive assessments made at any time (no minim al interval is required , it can be done the same day; however, to confirm response or PD, 2 discrete samples are required) before classification of PD and/or the institution of new therapy . Confirmative samples for PD after new therapy can be used. Serum M-component increases of ≥1 g/dL from nadir are sufficient to define progression if nadir M-component is ≥ 5 g/dL. Plasmacytomas: A definite increase in the size is defined as a ≥ 50% increase from nadir as measured serially by the sum of the products o f the maximal perpendicular diameter (SPD) of the measurable lesion or a ≥50% increase in the longest diameter of a previous lesion with ≥ 1cm short axis . A plasmacytoma is considered measurable if the longest diameter is at least 1 cm and the product o f the cross diameters is at least 1 cm2. Plasmacytomas of lesser size will be considered non -measurable. The requirement for bi -directional measurements applies only to plasmacytomas. The plasmacytoma specifications for PD are based on the sponsor’s int erpretation of the IMWG-URC and practical considerations for study execution. For defining nadir, in the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician/ Independent Review Committee ( IRC)discretion (eg, a possible laboratory error), that value will not be considered when determining the lowest value.
