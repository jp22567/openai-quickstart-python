Patients will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups: Group A (experimental group) to receive pracinostat plus AZA and Group B (contro l group) to receive placebo plus AZA. Rando mization will be stratified by cytogeneti c risk category (intermediate vs. unfavorable risk, according to SWOG Cytogeneti c Risk Category Definit ions, Appendix B) and ECOG performance status (0 -1 vs. 2, Appendix C ). Treatment will be adminis tered based on 28 -day cycles, with pracinostat/placebo administered orally once every other day , 3 times a week for 3 weeks, followed by one week of no treatment and AZA administered for 7 days of each cycle. Study treatm ent should continue until there is docum ented disease progressi on, relapse from complete remissio n (CR), or non-manageable toxicity. A minimum of 6 cy cles may be requi red to achieve a com plete remissio n. Once permanent ly discontinued from study treatment, patients will enter the Long-term Follow-up p hase of the study and will be followed for assessment of disease progressi on, if applicable, and survival every 3months (±1 month) until death . The end of this study is defined when 390 events (deaths) have occurred.

The Post-Study Observation Period is defined as the period starting from the end of the study for a m aximum of 24months. Background and Study RationaleApproximately about 21,380 new cases and 10,590 deaths from AML are expected to occur in the United States (US) in 2017, with the disease most commo nly diagnosed in older peopl e [American Cancer Society, 2017]. The average age of patients with AML is 67 years [American Cancer Society , 2017 ]. According to the Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe (RARECARE) project, the incidence of AML in Europe is 3.7 per 100,000 [Visser, 2012 ], similar to an incidence of 4.1 per 100,000 in the US [SEER , 2016 ]. Popul ation-based studi es have reported 3-year survival rates of 9-10% in patients 60 years of age, compared with 5-year survival rates of up to 50% for patients < 60 years [Luger , 2010 ]. Poor overall survival (OS) in elderly patients with AML is due to tw o main factors: 1) high-risk disease characterist ics (e.g., secondary AML, poor cy togenet ic features) that respond poorly to standard induction chem otherapy , and 2) co-morbidities that precl ude the use of intensive (curative) chemotherapy regimens. In addition, a much smaller but not trivial proporti on of younger patients with AML are not able to receive standard induction chem otherapy due to comorbidities. Commo n approaches for patients with AML unfitto receive standard induct ion therapy regimens consist of low intensit y therapies such as hypo methylat ing agents (HMA), low dose cytarabine, cloforabine, or supportive care measures, but their benefit is limited.New treatm ent approache s are needed. Pracinostat ,a potent, oral, pan-Histone DeAC etylase (HDAC )(including Class I, II, and IV isoforms) inhibitor with favorable pharmacokinet ic (PK) properties , has been administered to more than 400 pati ents with solid tum ors or hematologic cancers in multiple Phase Iand Phase IIclinical studi es, and has shown efficacy in myelo id malignancies. A Phase II, open -label, single -arm, multicenter study evaluated pracinostat in combinat ion with AZA in 50 patients aged≥ 65 years with newly diagnos ed AML not eligible for induct ion chemotherapy (Study MEI -004). The primar y objective was to estimate the composite complete remissio n (cCR) rate, composed of morphologic complete remissio n(CR) + morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) + morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS). The CR rate was 42%, the CRi rate was 4% and the MLFS rate was 6%, fora cCR rate of 52%. The median OS was estimated at 19.1 months (95% confidence interval ( CI): 10.0 -26.5 m onths ). These results indicate that pracinostat plus AZA may be an effect ive regimen in patients with AML unfit for induct ion therapy . Azacit idine is approved in the EU [Vidaza®,SmPC 2017 ] and in other countri es for the subset of patients with AML with 20-30% of blasts"
10,page_10,"PRAN -16-52 Final (v5.0) /16Dec 2019 Clinical Study Protocol Page 11of 120 CONFIDENTIAL [Fenaux , 2009 ] and in pat ients ≥ 65 years of age wi th AML and > 30% blasts who are not eligible for hematopoiet ic stem cell transpl antati on [Dombret , 2015 ]. Based on data generated from these and other AZA studi es in older patients wi th newly diagnosed AML [reviewed in Cruijsen , 2014 ], AZA is to be consi dered an acceptable agent for the background therapy in this Phase 3 study . Based on the favorable Phase IIdata in olderpatients with AML (Study MEI- 004), pracinostat in combinat ion with azaciti dine was selected as the experimental treatm ent group in this Phase IIIstudy PRAN-16-52 .In order to optimize the interpretati on of the final resul ts and to avoid bias in both safet y and efficacy reporting, the control group treatm ent consists of placebo in combinat ion with azaci tidine. Objectives Primary Objective : To show superi ority in terms of overall survival (OS) of treatment with pracinostat (Group A –experimental group) versus placebo (Group B – control group) in patients treated with AZA as background therapy . Secondary Objectives: To describe the efficacy of pracinostat evaluat ingadditional efficacy variables To assess the safet y and tol erabilit y To evaluate the pharmacokinet ics of pracinostat and its main metabo lites To assess the possible drug interacti on of Pracinostat on the PK of Azacit idine Toperform a health-econo mic evaluat ion of treatment and control group Study TreatmentsGroup A (experimental): pracinostat + background therapy Pracinostat :one 60 mg capsule orally , once a day, 3 ti mes a week (e.g., Monday , Wednesday, and Friday) for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest during each 28 -day cycle . Group B (control): placebo + background therapy Placebo : 1 capsule orally , once a day, 3 times a week (e.g., Monday , Wednesday, and Friday) for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest during each 28 -day cycle . As background therapy azacitidine (AZA) will be administered to both treatm ent groups at a dose of 75 mg/m2by SC or IV injection daily for 7 days of each 28 -day cycle. Pracinostat/placebo oral administration is to be taken before injection of azacit idine. Dose reduction of pracinostat/pl acebo, AZA, or both, are allowed in patients who develop drug- related toxicit ies."

The underlying AML pathophysio logy involves a maturational arrest of bone marrow cells in the earliest stages of development of the myelo id-cell lineage. The mechanism of this arrest is poorly understood and involves in many cases the act ivation of abnorm al genes through chrom osom al transl ocati ons and other genet ic abnormalit ies. Approximately about 21,380 new cases and 10,590 deaths from AML are expected to occur in the United States (US) in 2017, with the disease most commonly diagnosed in older peopl e [American Cancer Societ y, 2017]. According to the Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe (RARECARE) project, the incidence of AML in Europe is 3.7 per 100,000 [Visser , 2012] ,similar toan incidence in the US of 4.1 per 100,000 based on 2009 -2013 cases [SEER 2016] The average age of patients with AML is 67 years [American Cancer Society, 2017]. AML is a rapidly progressi ngdisease, often fatal, and survival among elderly patients is typically short. Popul ation-based studies have reported 3-year survival rates of 9% to 10% in patients 60years of age, compared with 5-year survival rates of up to 50% for patients <60 years[Luger , 2010 ].This poor surviva l expectancy applies to approximately half of adult pati ents with AML, in that the median age at onset is 65 to 70 y ears [Estey , 2014]. Curative therapy for AML, excluding acute promyelocy tic leuk emia, consists of intensive anthracycline -based remissio n induct ion therapy , followed by post remissio n treatm ent intensificat ion, including myelo ablative therapy and hematopoiet ic stem cell transplant (HSCT). As AML is a disease of olderpeopl e, many patients diagnosed with AML are unable to un dergo intensive (curat ive) therapi es due to co-morbid condi tions and/or poor perform ance status [Estey , 2002]. In addi tion, a small proporti on of younger pati ents wi th AML are unable to receive intensive chemotherapy regimens because of their medical history or concurrent comorbidities that expose them to an increased risk of fatal complicat ions following induct ion chemot herapy. In the US, there are currently no drugs approved to treat AML in patients who are unfit for intensive induct ionchem otherapy . Therefore , participat ion in clinical studi es investigat ingless toxic and potenti ally effect ivetherapeut ic agents isimportant for these patients. In the EU, hypo methylat ing agents (HMAs) (Dacogen®-decitabine , Vidaza®- azacit idine) are approved for the treatm ent of adult patients who are not candidates for intensive induct ion chem otherapy or for hematopoi etic stem cell transplant. The efficacy of HMAs al one in this patient populati on, however, i s modest and further improvement is needed. Other approaches for treatm ent ofmedically unfit patients with AML include low dose cy tarabine (LDAC), cl ofarabine, and supportive care. As a result, new treatment approaches are needed for this patient populat ion."

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes involved in the rem odeling of chrom atin and therefore have a key role in the epigenet ic regul ation of gene expressi on.Abnormal epigenet ic silencing of important regulatory genes has been described in cancer, including myelodysplasti c syndrom e (MDS) and AML. Histone deacet ylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been extensive ly studied in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.In the US, four HDACi have been approved, all for the treatm ent oflympho id malignancies such as cutaneous T -cell lympho ma (vorinostat and romidepsin), peri pheral T cell lympho ma (belino stat), or multip le myeloma (panobinostat). No HDACi has been approved in th e treatm ent of myeloid malignancies. Studi es have shown that AML cells demonstrate widespread hypermethylat ion of DNA prom oter regions and that such hypermethylat ion leads to select ive gene silencing. These observat ions led to th e development of HMAs, such as azaci tidine and decitabine, which were designed to reverse the hypermethylat ion and norm alize gene expressio n, particularly in hematol ogic malignancies. Both of these agents have demo nstrated clinical benefit in MDS , but have failed to provide sufficient clinical benefit in AML. The therapeuti c potential of combining HDACi ’sand HMAs has been studi ed extensively in pre-clinical models,and synergistic interact ions have been described [Cameron, 1999 ]. 1.3 Background on Pracinostat Pracinostat is a rationally designed, potent, oral, pan-HDAC (including Class I, II, and IV isoforms) inhibitor with favorable pharm acokinet ic (PK) properti es. In preclinical studies, the activit y of pracinostat has been shown in xenograft tumor models of AML and synergistic interacti ons have been observed with multiple cytotoxic and targeted anti- cancer therapeuti cs,including azacit idine (Investigator’s Brochure ).More specifically, the IC50of pracinostat across a broad range of human cancers in in-vitro cytotoxi city assays ranged from 0.05 to 2.2μM, with the lowest values noted in leukemia and lympho ma cell lines. Notably, the combinat ion index with azacitidine (AZA) ranged from 0.44 to 0.55. Pracinostat has been administered tomore than 400 patients , with both solid tumors and hematol ogic cancers, in multiple Phase I and Phase II clinical studies . The initial safety data for pracinostat monotherapy , which established the single- agent maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose level of 60 mg was derived from Study SB939 -2006 -001. SB939-2006 -001 was a Phase 1 open -label dose-escalat ion cohort study of pracinostat in subjects with advanced solid tumors (Arm A) and advanced hematol ogic malignancies including MDS, AML, lympho ma and myeloproliferat ive disorders (Arm B). The objectives of the trial included determining the DLTs and MTD of this drug when administered as a single agent, orally , once daily , every other day 3 times a week, for 3"
25,page_25,"PRAN -16-52 Final (v5.0) /16Dec 2019 Clinical Study Protocol Page 26of 120 CONFIDENTIAL consecut ive weeks followed by 1 week rest, for a 28-day treatm ent cycle. The MTD of pracinostat in Arm A (solid tumors) was established, and the recommended dose is 60 mg/d. In Arm B (hematologic malignancies), the protocol defined MTD was not reached. Dose reductions in subjects at the 120 mg/d level prom pted the decision to end the dose escalat ion phase, designate the 120 mg/d level as the MTD, and ident ify the recommended dose to be 100 mg/d. However, long-term exposure at 100 mg/d was not well tolerated and the recommended dose in subsequent hematologic malignancy studi es was determined to be 60 mg/d . SB939 -2006 -001 Arm C invest igated the safet y and tol erabili ty at the recommended dose of pracinostat (SB939) (60mg/d) combined with standard azacitidine therapy in subjects with intermediate -or high-risk MDS. Pracinostat was administered orally oncedaily every other day 3 times a week for 3consecutive weeks followed by a 1 week rest, for a 28 day treatm ent cycle. Azacitidine 75mg/m2was administered SC on days 1‒5 every 3‒6 weeks. Ten subjects (7 female, 3 male) were enrolled with a median age of65 years (range, 18 to 73 y ears). There were no DLTs in this study [Quintás -Cardama , 2012 ]. The most commo n adverse events (all grades) from the Phase I and Phase II clinical studi esof single -agent pracinostat included thrombocy topeni a (44%), fatigue (42%), nausea (32%), anemia (30%), and neutropeni a (29%) . While the most commo n clinically important (Grade 3) adverse events (AEs) included thrombocy topenia (13%), fatigue (9%), neutropeni a (9%), and QT prol ongat ion (5%) (Invest igator’s Brochure ).These data collect ively support a single -agent dose and schedule of 60mg, orally ,given 3 times a week ,every other day for 3 consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of rest and repeated in 28-day cycles . Two of 15 patients with AML treated in Arm B achieved a CR lasting 206 and 362 day s. These patients were enrolled at the 80 mg/d ay and 120 mg/day dose levels , respectively . One responder requi red 2 dose reductions due to Grade 3 fatigue, but went on to complete 11 cycles before his death from chroni c obstructive pulmo nary disease unrelated to pracinostat. The second responder susta ined a cytogeneti c complete remission (CRc) from Cycle 4 onward and was judged as no longer requi ring treatm ent after completing Cycle 8.These data suggest that single- agent pracinostat provides modest clinical act ivity in AML. On the basis of these SB939 -2006 -001 data, an open -label Phase II study (Protocol MEI 004) has been conducted to evaluate the safet y and efficacy of pracino stat plus AZA in patients ≥ 65 y earswith newly diagnosed AML who were not eligible to receive intensive induct ion chem otherapy [Garcia -Manero , 2019 ]. Pracinostat and AZA administrati on regimen was the sam e selected in the SB939 -2006- 001. Pracinostat was administered at a dose of 60 mg every other day, 3 days a week for 3 weeks of every 28-day cycle. AZA was administered according to the approved prescribing informat ion. Between December 2013 and November 2014, a total of 50 patients were enrolled at 15 academic centers in the US. Median age was 75 y ears (range, 66 -84), wi th 26 patients (52%) age d≥ 75 years. CR was achieved in 21 pati ents (42%), a CRi in 2 (4%) and MLFS in 3 (6%), resul ting in a composite complete remissio n (cCR) rate, the study primary endpo int, of 52%. As of October 2016the median overall survival was estimated at 19.1 months (95% CI: 10.0 - 26.5 months). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs) reported in >10% of patients were"

There have been twodeaths on study considered related to both pracinostat and azaci tidine (neutropeni c sepsis and febrile neutropenia) . See the pracinostat Invest igator’s Brochure for addit ional details on nonclinical and clinical studies. 1.4 Background on Azacitidine in AML Azacit idinewas approved by the Food and Drug Administrati on(FDA) in 2004 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2008 for the treatm ent ofpatients with MDS of all French -American -British classification (FAB) subtypes [Vidaza®SmPC, 2017].Of note, patients with the FAB classificat ion of RAEB-T are considered to meet criteria for AML under the newer World Health Organizat ion (WHO) classificat ion,when the bone marrow blast count is 20% or more [Vardiman , 200 9]. Azacit idine is approved in the EU [Vidaza®SmPC, 2017 ] for a subset of patients with AML, based on two studi es. In a retrospecti ve analysis of a study of 358 patients with higher ri sk MDS which included 113 pati ents wi th bone marrow bl asts between 20% and 30% [Fenaux , 2009], azacit idine was compared to best supportive care (BSC), BSC + LDAC, or intensive chem otherapy . This study demonstrated an improvement in overall survival (OS) (HR=0.47, p=0.005) in the subset of 113 patients with baseline blasts between 20% and 30%. Another Phase 3 study was conducted exclusively in patients aged ≥ 65 years with AML (>30% marrow blasts) who were not candidates for HSCT [Dombret , 2015 ]. This study compared azacit idine to BSC, BSC + LDAC, or intensive chemotherapy. The resul ts showed no difference in response rates (CR+CRi: 28% vs. 23%, p=NS) and a trend toward improved overall survival (10.4 vs. 6.5 months; HR=0.85, p=0.1009 for Azacit idine group vs. the composite group). Based on these resul ts, azacit idine is considered as a standard of carein elderly patients with AML, also in countri es where azaci tidine has not been approved for this indicat ion [National comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines Acute Mye loid Leukemia. Versi on 1. 2016. ]. It should be noted that 18% of the patient population in the azacitidine study in elderly AML [Dombret , 2015 ] were assigned to receive intensive chemotherapy (not delineated by age groups) such that the overall prognosi s of this study population (both the control and experime ntal groups) may be superi or to other studi es of AML in the elderly popul ation that did not permi t intensive chem otherapy as a control treatm ent opti on [e.g., Kantarjian , 2012 ;Thepot , 2014] . 1.5 Benefit -Risk Assessment Popul ation-based studi es of patients aged 60years and older have shown 3-year survival rates between 9% and 10% and 5-year survival rates from 3% to 8%[Luger , 2010]. Despite treatm ent advances in the last decade, the progn osis for older patients remains dismal, and there are only a fewapproved agents for patients who are unable to tol erate intensive chem otherapy .Thus, there is a great need to explore combinat ions of novel agents to improve outcomes in this populat ion."

Amaximum of 500patients are pl anned to be enrolled over a peri od of approximately 30 months at approximately 130study centers. Patients who meet the eligibilit y criteria and consent to participate will be rando mized 1:1 to Group A(experimental group) orGroup B(control group) .Rando mizat ion will be stratified by cytogeneti c risk category (intermediate vs. unfavorable risk)and ECOG Perform ance Status (0-1 vs. 2). Study treatm ent, defined as the treatm ent with pracinostat/placebo (study drug) in addition to the background therapy (AZA), will continue until there is documented disease progressi onor relapse from CR while receiving study treatm ent, ornon- manageable toxicity. There is no upper limit to the number of treatment cycles administered, and study treatm ent shoul d be continued as long as patients derive a clinical benefit. In the Phase II study MEI-004, 6 patients (12%) required more than 6 cycles of pracinostat + AZA to achieve a CR. It i s recommended, therefore, that pati ents who have no evidence of disease progression shoul d receive a minimum of 6 c ycles of study treatm ent to allow adequate exposure to study drug and background therapy before considering a switch to other therapies. Once permanent ly discontinued from study treatment, patientswill be followed for AEs (for 30 days) and then they will enter theLong-term Follow-up p hase of the study (Secti on 5.2). Patients in the Long -term Follow-up phase of the study will be followed every 3 months (±1 month) for documentation of disease progression, if applicable, and overall survival . Patients will be followed until death or until end of this study (refer to Secti on 3.2for end of this study defini tion). Based on data from previous studies, it is ant icipated that pati ent parti cipati on in the main part of this study will be for an average of 9.5 months, including 28 days for screening procedures, 8 months for study treatment, and 4 weeks for safet y follow-up after perm anent study treatm ent discont inuat ion. In the Phase III study of azaci tidine in elderly AML, patients received a median of 6 cycles of azacitidine, with a range from 1 to 28 cycles (Dombret , 2015 ). In the Phase II study of pracinostat in el derly AML (Study MEI - 004), patients received a median of 6.5 cycles, with a range from 1 to 24 cycles. It is anticipated that patient participat ion in the Long -term Follow-up phase will be for an average o f 6 months, but m ay exceed 12 m onths in som e patients. This is an event -driven study with an interim analysis for both fut ility and superiori ty."

Figure 1: Study Schema 3.2 End of Study The end of this study is defined when 390events (deaths) have occurred. Patients who are receiving study treatm ent at the end of the study will continue to receive the study drug to which they were rando mized to(Post -Study Observat ion Period, Section 5.3), until the Sponsor informs the Invest igators of the appropriate course of action,based on the study resul ts. The study may be ended earlier, based on the resul ts of the interim analysis (Secti on 9.12).In this case the patients still on study will continue unchanged until the Sponsor informs the Invest igators of the appropriate course of action ,based on th e study resul ts. 3.3 Study Rationale The higher com plete remissio n (CR) rate and longer OS observed in the open -label Phase II study of pracinostat plus AZA in patients ≥ 65 years with newly diagnosed AML compared to historical controls treated with AZA alone, as well as the aggregate safet y data from over 150 patients treated with pracinostat plus azacit idine in 4 studi es support the evaluat ion of this combination regimen in a double -blind, placebo controlled, rando mized Phase III trial in AML. 3.3.1 Rationale for Patient Population ThisPhase IIIstudy will enroll patients≥18 years of age with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML who are unfit to receive standard induct ion chem otherapy due to advanced age and/or comorbidities. Secondary AML is defined as secondary to antecedent hematologic disorders such as myelodysplast ic or myeloproliferat ive disorders, or occurring in a patient who has received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for a prior malignancy. It is anticipated that the median age of the study popul ation will be approximately 75 years and that few pati ents under 65 y ears of age will be enrolled. T his popul ation is considered appropri ate for this Phase IIIstudy , given the limited treatment Group A: Pracinostat + background therapy (AZA) N ~ 250 Group B: Placebo + background therapy (AZA) N ~250Randomization N ~ 500Long -term Follow -up Long -term Follow -up"

However, general principles that define ineligibilit y for intensive therapy regimens can be delineated in the context of clinical trials. An expert panel has develo ped a consensus -based definit ion of patient unfitness to intensive AML induct ion chem otherapy [Ferrara , 2013]. Factors considered relevant to defining unf itness to intensive induct ion chemotherapy include severe cardiac, pulmonary, renal or hepatic comorbidity, cogni tive impairment, poor performance status, and any other comorbidity that the physician judges to be incompat ible with chemotherapy . Another group has developed a hematopoiet ic cell transplant specific comorbidi ty index (HCT -CI) to define patient unfit ness to receive myeloablat ive therapy for AML [Sorror , 2005 ]. The HCT -CI was evaluated retrospectively in a cohort of ol der pati ents wi th AML [Giles , 2007] and validated in a large cohort of patients with myelodysplast ic syndrome [Della Porta , 2011 ]. Another retrospective analysis of a cohort of 5’480 patients with AML treated between 2000 and 2007 in the US identified age and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) as significant ly associ ated with early death after leukemia therapy [Oran B, 2012 ]. This protocol uses a co mpilation of these previously published criteria to characterize pat ient unfit ness for intensive induct ion chemotherapy . Several studi es have shown a high rate of early death due to toxi city, ranging from 6% to 18%, in elderly patients with AML treated with standard intensive induct ion chemotherapy [reviewed in Luger , 2010]. Age ≥ 75 years is associ ated with particularly high risk of toxicity and has been used as prognosti c scoring factor in AML [Kantarjian , 2006; Appelbaum , 2006 ;Malfuson , 2008]. In this protocol ,age ≥ 75 years with or without addi tional com orbidities is a sufficient cri terion to characterize a pati ent as being unfit for intensive chemotherapy . For fit patients < 75 years of age, intensive induction chem otherapy is the standard of care. Therefore, only patients who are considered unable to receive intensive induct ion chemotherapy due to comorbidities that preceded the diagnosis of AML will be eligible to be enrolled in the study . This includes poor perform ance status, si gnificant impai rment of cardiac function (a contraindicat ion to anthracycli ne-based therapy ), significant impairment of pulmo nary function (a risk factor for respi ratory failure in the presence of infect ion), or a chronic comorbidi ty with clinically significant functional impairment or end organ damage. The study excludes patients with acute promyelocyt ic leukemia, and AML patients with favorable cytogeneti c risks, because they can be effect ively managed with alternative standard therapies [ Schiller , 2005 ]."
31,page_31,"PRAN -16-52 Final (v5.0) /16Dec 2019 Clinical Study Protocol Page 32of 120 CONFIDENTIAL 3.3.3 Clinical Rationale The combinat ion of pracinostat plus AZA was evaluated in a Phase II open -label, single- arm, two-stage, m ulticenter study in patients aged65 years with newly diagnosed AML (Study MEI-004). The favorable efficacy results of this study , with a CR rate of 42%, a composite complete remissio n (cCR) rate of 52%, and a median overall survival of 19.1 months, indicate that pracinostat plus AZA warrants further evaluat ion in a Phase III study in AML . Data from the recent Phase IIIstudy of azacitidine versus convent ional care regimens in 488 elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML revealed the following Grade 3 to Grade 4 treatm ent emergent AEs with azacitidine: febrile neutropeni a (28%) , neutrope nia (26.3%), thrombocy topeni a (23.7 %),pneumonia (19.1%), anemia (15.7 %)leukopenia (6.8%), and hypokal emia (5.1%) [Dombret , 2015 ].Thus, when compar ing safet y data from studi es of single- agent AZA, single -agent pracinostat , and pracinostat + AZA in combinat ion, the safet y profiles appear to be similar .Importantly , no new events of special interest were ident ified in the combinat ion as compared to single- agent AZA or pracinostat studi es, suggest ing that the combinat ion is notmore toxic than single -agent therapi es. The observat ions of strong pre-clinical synergy between AZA and pracinostat, and the improved efficacy results from the P hase II study in AML co mpared to historical controls treated with AZA alone, suggest the combinat ion may provi de important clinical benefit in the defined patient popul ation. The combina tion dose and schedule selected for Phase IIdevelopment waspracinostat 60 mg orally , given 3 times a week ,every other day for 3consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of rest and repeated in 28-day cycles and azacit idine 75 mg/m2IV or subcutaneous ( SC) for 7 days of each 28 -day cycle. The same regimen will be evaluated in this Phase III study . Collect ively ,these safet y, tolerabilit y, and clinical activi ty data support the testing of this combinat iondose and schedule ina pivotal , fully powered P hase IIIstudy inpatients who are newly diagnosed with AML and who are not currently candidates for intensive induct ion chemotherapy . 3.3.4 Rationale for the Control Arm Based on data from the azacit idine Phase III study in newly diagnosed patients with AML aged ≥ 65 years who are unfit for stem cell transplant therapy [Dombret , 2015 ]and in patients wi th AML wi th 20-30% bl asts [Fenaux , 2009 ], azaci tidine [Vidaza® SmPC ,2017] was approv edin the EU for a subset of patients with AML. Retrospective studies of azacit idine in patients with AML unfi t for intensive chem otherapy [Thepot , 2014 ;Pleyer , 2015 ] justifytheuse of azacit idine as the background therapy and therefore its combinat ion with pracinostat. In order to optimize the interpretation of the final resul ts and to avoid bias in both safet y and efficacy reporti ng, placebo in combinat ion with azacit idine will be used as the control group."

The unique patient ident ification number, the study kit number assigned to the patient, the patient randomizat ion number as well as the other patient characteristics, are stored in the system . The rando mizat ion procedure is possible only if study kits of both treatm ents are available at site . The hospital pharm acist or desi gnated responsible person will select the appropriate study kitbased on the number supplied by the IWRS. Relevant peel-off label from the selected study kit will be attached on the drug accountabilit y logby the pharmacist or designated person to document the correct kit’s assignment. On Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, the Investigator will get connected to the eCRF/IWRS to access thestudy kit number to be assigned to the patient (i.e., astudy kit containing the same treatment as assig ned in the first cycle will be automatically selected) . For patients requiring a pracinostat dose reduction, this is to be selected during the eCRF/IWRS study drug allocat ion procedure. The IWRS will then allocate a new study kit from the same treatm ent group (pracinostat active vs. pracinostat placebo) and communicate the selected study kit number for the new cycle. Due to th e blinded study design, neither the pharmacist, nor the Invest igator, the patient or the CRO will know which treatm ent is administere d. The monitor who will check the drug accountabilit y forms will also be blinded wi th regard to the treatment administered. 4.2.1.5 Study drug intake Pracinostat /placebo capsules will be self-administered orally , once a day, 3 days a week with approximately 48 hou rs(+/-2 hours) between each dose (e.g., Monday , Wednesday, and Fri day) for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest to complete a 28 -day cycle. OnDay 1, Day 3, and Day 15of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of Cycle 2, pracinostat /placebo capsule must be administered by the study personnel at the study siteto allow ECG recording and pharm acokinetic (PK) blood sample collect ion in relation to pracinostat time of administrati on (see Sections 6.2.3 and 6.3).On all other days, pracinostat or placebo m ay be self -administered at home. Pracinostat /placebo capsule shoul d be taken with water in either a fed or fasted state, at approximately the same time on each of the schedul ed dosing days. Capsule shoul d not be chewed or crushed, it should be swallowed whole.If vomit ing occurs, no attempt shoul d be made to replac e the vo mited dose. Pracinostat or placebo should not be taken with grapefruit orSeville orange. Refer to Section 4.7for information on precaut ionary concomi tant medications to be taken with pracinostat. If a dose (pracinostat or placebo) is missed , then that dose shoul d be wi thheld for that day . Patients shoul d not take the missed dose later on the same day.For example, if a patient does not take a dose on Monday , then the dose shoul d be started on Tuesday , and the subsequent doses shoul d be taken on Thursday and Saturday . Also, if a patient takes a dose on Monday but not on Wednesday, then the next doses should be on Thursday and"

The doses for the following week can be taken on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as long as they are taken 48 hours from each other. Refer to Section 8.2.6.2 for the handling of overdose or incorrect study drug administration. 4.2.1.6 Study drug accountability Once thestudy kits are received at the study site, the pharmacist or designated responsible person will sign the drug receipt form and notify via IWRS the clinical supplies receipt. Adequate records of the recei pt, dispensation and return of study kits must be maintained throughout the study . Used study kits will be retained until the drug accountabilit y forms have been checked by a designated monitor. Unused study kits remaining at invest igational sites at the end of the study will be either destroy ed locally, orreturned to the depots where they will be destroyed. At the end of the study , delivery records will have to be reconciled with those of used and returned stocks. Any discrepancy will have to be accounted for. Destruction of unused study kitwill be docum ented in writ ing,according to FDA IND regulat ion 21CFR312.59 , ICH Good Clinical Practi ce (GCP) and the drug depot Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Any destructi on of remaining study medicati on material is to be fi rst approved in writing by the study Sponsor. 4.2.2 Precautions and Risks Associated with Pracinostat 4.2.2.1 General Signs and Symptoms The most commo n related treatm ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (occurring in ≥10% of subjects) by SOC are gastrointestinal disorders (68%), general disorders and administration site condi tions (56%), blood and lymphat ic system disorders (46%), investiga tions (28%) and m etabo lism and nutri tion disorders (24%).

In the Phase II study of pracinostat + AZA in AML, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting were among the most frequent ly reported manifestations of GI toxicity, with most cases graded as 1 or 2. Standard antiemetic and antidiarrheal medicat ions and appropri ate supporti ve care shoul d be used per norm al clinical practice. Pre-existing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea shoul d be adequately controlled before starting study drug administration . 4.2.2.4 QTc Prolongation/Cardiac Events The cardiac safety of pracinostat compared to placebo on the QTcF or the individually corrected QT interval (QTcI) was assessed in 43 healt hy subjects in study MEI-010. Following single oral doses of 60 and 120 mg pracinostat, there were dose-proporti onal increases in HR and QTcF, with peak increases that did not correlate with Cmax(6 and 24hours postdose for HR and QTcF, respectively). No clinically meaningful effect on PR or QRS intervals or on T -wave morpho logies was noted. Patients with a prolonged QTcFinterval > 450 ms at Screening will not be permitted to participate in the study . Prior to pracinostat administration, hypokal emia, hypophosphatemia and hypo magnesaemia shoul d be corrected and considerati on shoul d be given to monitoring potassi um and magnesium in symptom atic patients (e.g., patients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fluid imbalance, or cardiac symptoms). Concomitant medicat ions with a known riskof prolonging the QT interval and/or causing Torsades de Pointes are prohibited. In addition, cauti onshoul d be taken when using concomi tant medicati ons with a possible or condi tional riskof prolonging the QT interval and/or causing Torsades de Pointes . Medicat ions with a possible or conditional risk may be used at the discretion of the Invest igator (Appendix I ). Subjects requiring any medicat ions that have the potenti al to al ter serum electroly tes (e.g., diuretics) shou ld be monitored closely for electroly te abnormalit ies as these can contribute to the risk of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhyt hmias. 4.2.2.5 Procreation Amo ng the observed adverse effects of pracinostat in 28-day repeated oral dose toxicity studi es conducted in CD1 mice, also testicular effects were reported (Invest igator’s Brochure ).

The Azacit idine 100 mg vial has to be considered as patient-specific, i.e., its content (even if partially used) is to be considered for treatm ent of a single patient only (cannot be shared between two or more patients). Commercial Azac itidine packs may be purchased by the sponsor from different markets, depending on the local regul ation in the country the drug is used. All the commercia l packs supplied by Helsinn to the sites will be clearly ident ified with a label reporting reference to the PRAN -16-52 study and all the necessary information. Each label applied on the pack carries a peel-off porti onwith reference inform ation tobe attached on the drug accoun tabilit y logby the pharmacist or designated person in order to document the vial’s assignment and the global site accountability . This procedure does not apply for Azacit idine direct ly procured by site,according to local regulat ion for procurement ;in this case the drug accountabilit y log needs anyway to be completed with informat ion regarding the product used for treatm ent of the patient, i.e., number of vials used, batch number and expiry date. In case Azacit idine is procured by study sponsor, supply management will be performed by means of IWRS as done for the pracinostat kits. Anappropri ate amount of vials will be supplied to the designated person at the investigat ional sites at the beginning of the study ,with further autom atic re-supplies scheduled once the number of available vials decreases to a pre -set thresho ld at each site . Adequate records of the recei pt, dispensat ion and return of the vials must be maintained throughout the study . Used packs will be retained until the drug accountabilit y forms have been checked by a designated monitor. Unused vials remaining at invest igational sites at the end of the study will be either destroy ed locally or returned to the drug depots where they will be destroy ed. At the end of the study , delivery records will have to be reconciled with those of used and returned stocks. Any discrepancy will have to be accounted for."

Azacit idine will be administered via SC inject ionor as an IV infusio n.The IVinfusio ns are generally administered over a period of 10-40 minutes. Azacit idine must be administered on Days 1 through 7 (Schedule 1)of each cycle .If the site is unable to accommodate this schedule, azacit idine may be given as a ‘5-2-2 schedule’ wherein patients receive AZA for 5 consecut ive weekdays (Days 1 through 5; Monday -Friday) and resume azacit idine dosing the first 2 weekday s of the next week (Day s 8 and 9) of each 28-day cycle (Schedule 2).Switch between Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 during the study period is acceptable. The daily AZAdose will be calculated based on the patient’s weight and height atDay 1 of Cycle 1 (or up to 3 days before). The dose shoul d be recal culated if the patient’s weight changes by ≥10% during the study .Sites may follow their institutional guidance for assessing the BSA used for dosing. The Invest igator must ensure azacit idine administration informat ion is collected for the study , including dose changes and administration route. Azacit idine is to be prepared in accord ance with the terms of its regional market ing authori zationby reconst itution of the lyophilized powder . Detailed information on how to prepare AZA is provided in the Package Insert, Prescribing Inform ation, Summary of Product Characteristics (S mPC) or Cou ntry-specific azacit idine label, as appropriate. Please note, all the details regarding the use of azacit idine will be reported (in local language) in the Study Drug Manual supplied to each clinical site before the study start. 4.3.2 Warnings and Precautions for Azacitidine Prior to the initial AZA administrati on and at subsequent cycles, complete blood count (CBC), liver chemistries and serum creatinine shoul d be monitored. Detailed inform ation on the risks associ ated with the use of AZA is provi ded in the country-specific product labeling . The following are the relevant Warnings and Precauti ons listed in azacit idine [Vidaza® SmPC, 2017 ]product labeling informat ion. 4.3.2.1 Azacitidine Most Frequent Adverse Reactions Based on the Vidaza®SmPC, 2017 , the m ost frequent non -hematol ogic adverse rea ctions reported with AZA included injection site reacti ons (usually Grade 1-2), gastrointestinal disorders (consti pation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, usually Grade 1-2), and pyrexia (usually Grade 1 -2). There may be overlapping adverse events between AZA and pracinostat related to myelosuppressio n, fat igue and gastrointestinal toxicit ies."

Complete blood counts fortoxicityshoul d be frequently monitored, at a minimum prior to each dosing cycle. After administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, dosage adjustmentfor subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematol ogic response shoul d be done . Refer t o Secti on 4.5for guidance on dose m odificati ons in the presence of toxicit y. 4.3.2.3 Toxicity in Patients with Severe Pre -existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacit idine is potenti ally hepatotoxi c in patients with severe pre-exist ing hepat ic impairment, cauti on is needed in patients with liver disease. Safety and effect iveness of azacit idine in patients with MDS and hepat ic impai rment have not been studi ed as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Azacit idine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors. 4.3.2.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death has been reported in patients treated with IV AZA in combinat ion with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS condi tions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to < 20 mEq/L in associ ation with an alkaline urine and hypokal emia (serum potassi um < 3 mEq/L) were observed in 5 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with AZA and etoposi de. If unexplained reducti ons in serum bicarbonate < 20 mEq/L or elevat ions of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creat inine occur, the dosage should be reduced or hel d. Patients wi th renal impairment m ay be at increased ri sk for renal toxicity. Also, AZA and its metabo lites are primarily excreted by the kidney . Therefore, these patients shoul d be closely monitored f or toxi city. 4.4 Duration of Therapy Because diseas e response to low intensity chem otherapy regimens such as AZA requi res prolonged exposure, patients shoul d receive a minimum of 6 cycles of therapy as long as there is no evidence o f disease progressi on or non- manageable toxicity. There is no upper limi t to the number of study treatm ent cy cles that m ay be administered. Because there are no data on optimal length of therapy with low intensity chemotherapy, patients who achieve stable disease or an objective response shoul d remain on study treatm ent as l ong as they derive a clinical benefi t. Prophylactic therapi es and/or study treatm ent (pracinostat/placebo and azacit idine) dose adjustm ents (Secti on 4.5) may be needed to manage treatm ent-related toxi cities and keep patients on therapy as long as they derive clinical benefi t."

Dose modificat ions in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 are discouraged to maximize exposure to study treatm ent and increase the likelihood of achieving an objectiv e response. Dose reduction is not allowed within each 28 -day cycle, but only between cycles. The Medical Moni tor will review with the Investigator any decisio n to reduce, interrupt, or permanent ly discont inue either of the two components of the study treatment (pracinostat/placebo or azacitidine). If a dose modificat ion is requi red, a dose reduction shoul d be implemented first, as described in the tables below. One pracinostat dose reduction is allowed as shown in table below: Table 1: Pracinostat Dose Reduction Dose Level Pracinostat /Placebo Starti ng Dose One 60 m gcapsule /3 days per week/ 3 weeks in every 28-day cycle Dose Level -1One 45 m gcapsule /3 days per week/ 3 weeks in every 28-day cycle Up to two AZA dose reductions are allowed as shown in the table below: Table 2: AZA Dose Reductions Dose Level Azacit idine Starti ng Dose 75 m g/m2 for 7 day s of each 28- day cycle Dose Level -137.5 m g/m2(50%) for 7 day s of each 28 -day cycle Dose Level -225 m g/m2(33%) for 7 days of each 28- day cycle Prior to dose reducti on, the Investi gator m ust assess if the toxi city is thought to be due to pracinostat, based on the safet y informat ion provided in the Invest igator Brochur e, or AZA, based on the safet y informat ion provi ded in the AZA product labeling. Severe fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, vomiting and QT prolongat ion are adverse reacti ons likely related to pracinostat, whereas pyrexia, inject ion site reacti on, constipation and renal toxicity are adverse reactions likely related to AZA. Myel osuppressi on (i.e., thrombocy topeni a, anemia, leukopenia, and neutropenia) has been reported with similar frequency wit h pracinostat and AZA therapy . If toxicity is judged by the Investi gator as likely related to pracinostat, then the pracinostat/placebo dose should be reduced first (Table 1). If the toxi city is judged by the Invest igator as likely related to AZA, then the AZA dose shoul d be reduced first (Table 2). If the Invest igator is not able to ascertain the relationship of an adverse react ion to pracinostat or AZA, then dose reduction will begin with AZA, since AZA is administered to all patients whereas pracinostat is administered to only 50% of patients (i.e., those rando mized to Group A). If azacit idine dose is reduced first, and it is determined that further dose modificat ions are still required after two AZA dose reducti ons, then pracinostat dose should be reduced."

Lists of 3A4 and 2C8 inhibitors and 1A2, 2C8 and 3A4 inducers are provi ded in Appendix G . Patients shoul d avoid grapefruit juice and Seville oranges during the study since they are known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4. Smoking resul ts in CYP1A2 induct ion and has been shown to decrease pracinostat Cmax and AUC by ~60% . This effect is known to be caused by substances created by tobacco smoke, such as polycyclic aromat ic hydrocarbons (potent inducers of CYP1A2, a primar y CYP450 isoform responsible for pracinostat m etabo lism).Therefore,current smokers are excluded from the study but the use of patches, chewing gums or vaping nicotine containing fluids is permi tted.Patients who stopped smoking at least 8 days prior to fi rst pracinostat dosing can be enrolled, provided they refrain from smoking during the entire study . 4.7.2 Possible Effects of P racinostat on Other Drugs via Cytochrome P450 In hepatocy tes pracinostat is an inducer of CYP1A2 and CY2B6, while is a suppressor of CYP3A4 mRNA expressio n and enzymat ic activit y (see Investi gator Brochure and PRAN -17-04). Pracinostat shoul d be used with caution in patients receiving conco mitant medications that are primarily metabo lized through CYP3A4. The plasma concentrati ons of CYP3A4 substrates can increase when co-administered with pracinost at.Lists of CYP3A4 substrates are provided in Appendix H . Pracinostat shoul d be used with caution in patients receiving conco mitant medications that are primarily metabo lized through CYP1A2 and CY2B6.

The planned biomarker analyses involve the analysis of protein and nucleic acids (i.e., RNA and/or DNA ). Biomarkers deemed relevant to gain further knowledge about the pathom echanism of the disease or about the drug (i.e.,mode of action or safet y of the drug) m ay be measured, based on newly emerging data from other ongoing tri als of these investigat ional drugs and/or literature data. However, the study sponsor reserve sthe right not to conduct all or part of the biomarker analysis. Data from this biomarker analysis may be correlated with various other data obtained in this study (e.g., clinical efficacy , pharmacokinet ics, toxicit y). Peripheral blood samples and/or aspirate bone marrow samples will be collected and stored for potential molecular studi es at screening, between day 21 and day 26 of every even cycle and at End of Treatment visit. Specimens to study AML -related mole cular mutations will be collected from patients who give specific consent to participate in this optional research. The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participat ion in the molecular mutati on assessm ents. The Invest igator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the objectives, methods and potenti al hazards of participation in this research. Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any time for any reason during the storage period. A separate, specific signature will be requi red to docum ent a pati ent’s agreement for this purpose. Dates of consent shoul d be recorded in the associ ate page of eCRF. For sampling procedures, storage co nditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual . Collect ion and submissi on of these samples is contingent upon the review and approval of the exploratory research porti on of the Inform ed Consent Form by each site’s Institutional Review Board or Ethi cs Committee and, if applicable, appropriate regulatory body . If a site is not granted approval for these assessments, this section of the protoco l will not be applicable at that site. 6.5 Efficacy Endpoints 6.5.1 Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpo int is the overall survival (OS) measured as the time from rando mizat ion unt il death from any cause."

An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), sympt om, or di sease tem porally associated wi th the use of a drug, and does not imply any judgment about causalit y.An AE can ari se wi th any use of adrug (e .g., off-label use, use in combinat ion with another drug) and with any route of administrati on, formulation, or dose, including an overdose . Adverse reacti ons are defined as asubset of all adverse events for which there is reason able possibilit ythat the drug caused the event. A preexist ing medical condi tion shoul d be recorded as an AEonly if the frequ ency , severit y, or character of the condi tion worsens during the study . 8.1.1.1 Suspected Adverse Reaction Suspected adverse react ionsare the subset of allAEsfor which there is a reasonable possibilit y that the drug caused the event. For the purposes of USInvest igational New Drug (IND) safet y reporting, ‘‘reasonable possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relati onsh ip between the drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reacti on implies a lesser degree of certaint y about causalit y than adverse react ion, which means any AE caused by a drug . 8.1.1.2 Life-threatening AE or Life -Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction An AE or suspected adverse reacti on is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reacti on that, had it occurred in a more severe form , might have caused death . 8.1.1.3 Serious AE or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction An AE or suspected adverse reacti on is considered ‘‘serious’’ ifany of the following criteria i s met : Death , including death that appear unrelated to the study treatm ent Life-threatening AE Inpat ient hospitalizat ion or prolongat ion of an existing hospi talizati on, excluding the following scenarios: i.Emergency room visit or hospital visit without official admission"

Examples of such medical events include allergi c bronchospasm requi ring intensive treatm ent in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpat ient hospitalizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse . 8.1.1.4 Unexpected AE or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction An AE or suspected adverse reacti on is considered “unexpected ” if it is not reported in nature, severit y or incidence in the current versio n of the pracinostat IB (Section 7. Appendix). 8.1.1.5 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event A TEAE is an adverse event that em erges, or a pre -exist ing adverse event that worsens in severit y, any time after the patientreceives Dose 1 of study drug (pracinostat/placebo) through the end of the AE reporting period.AEs with onset before the patient receives Dose 1 of study drug are considered as pre-treatment AEs. AEs with onset after the end of the reporting period (if any ) are considered as post -treatm ent AEs. Laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG abnormalit ies will be reported as AEs only if the event is considered clinically significant or leads to medical intervent ion (e.g., addit ional concomitant medication or procedures, discont inuation of study drug).

Changes over time in toxi city grade shoul d be recorded as follow up of the init ial event . 8.2.5.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnormalit y qualifies as an AE. Laboratory testresult s (including cytopeni as) which are expected by the Invest igator should not be reported as an AE unless: The event is accom panied by clinical ly significant symptom s which are new or worsened from baseline. Result in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modificat ion, treatm ent interrupti on, or treatm ent discont inuat ion). Result in a medical intervent ion (e.g., blood transfusio n for anemia, potassi um supplementati on for hy pokal emia) or a change in concomitant therapy ."

No specific reporting timelines or other activit ies are requi red bythe Invest igator in addition to the normal AEreporting practices as described in the above sectionsfor the followings AE of special interest: Supraventricular arrhyt hmias Sepsis, septic shock, grade ≥3 lung infect ion (pneumonia) Any infection leading to death Grade ≥3 anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropeni a and thrombocy topeni a Grade ≥3 haemorrhage 8.2.6.1 QTc prolongation Any QTc prol ongat ion ≥ 500 ms and/or > 60 m s change from baseline , irrespective of the relationship to study treatm ent,must be al ways reported as an AE. The Invest igator or the Invest igator’s designee must complete the AE pages of eCRF with all necessar y inform ationand a ny accompanying source documents (h ospital records, ECG report, etc.) shoul d be f axed or e -mailed (as PDFs) at the following contacts: Email: Helsinn.safet y@clinipace.com Fax: +49 6196 7709 112 8.2.6.2 Adverse Even tsAssociated with an Overdose An overdose is any dose of study treatment given to a patient or taken by a patient that exceeds the dose described in the protocol . An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the dose being studi ed.An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatm ent is not itself an AE, but it may result in an AE. All overdoses should be recorded, independent ly from an associ ation with AEs. All AEs associ ated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study treatm ent should be recorded . If an overdose resul ts in an SAE, it must be reported to the Sponsor as an SAE within 24 hours of identifying the event. Currently, there are no safet y data related to pracinostat overdose. If overdose is suspected, administration of study drug shoul d be stopped and general supportive measures inst ituted."

For any study treatm ent unblinding, the reason must be docum ented in the patient’s medicalrecord. Treatment ident ificat ion informat ion shoul d be kept confidential. 8.2.7.1 Unblinding Procedure The Investigator has the possibilit y to unblind the study treatm ent in case of an emergency situation, when he/she considers essenti al to know what treatm ent the patient is receiving. To proceed with the unblinding procedure, he/she is allowed to access TEMPOTMsystem (available 24 hours 7 days coverage), select the patient ident ifier and choose the “Unblinding of study treatment” Form in the “Subject management ” section. After confi rmation of the request, the treatm ent regimen assigned to pati ent at the time of rando mizat ion will be shown together with the list of identifiers of the kits assigned. A notification email informing that the code has been broken, butnot reporting the treatm ent assigned, is sent to the person performing the unblinding and to the Sponsor. If the code is broken by Invest igator, the patient shoul d be discont inued permanent ly from treatm ent and he/she will enter the long -term follow-up pe riod. When an event might be a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse React ion (SUSAR ) the blind shoul d be broken by the Sponsor for pharmacovigilance reporting purposes only for that specific subject. Unblinding inform ation shoul d only be accessible to th ose who need to be involved in the safet y reporti ng to Regulatory Authorit ies, while the blind shoul d be maintained for all other persons responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study . The patient will not be withdrawn from the study in case of unblinding by the Sponsor’s Drug Safety Depart ment for pharm acovigilance reporting purposes. 8.3 Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) An Independent Data Moni toring Committee (IDMC) will be established for this study to serve in an advisory capaci ty to th e Spons or. The IDMC will be primarily responsible for assessing emerging safet y data on an ongoing basis as well as a one -time evaluat ion of an interim efficacy analysis and will recommend whether the study should be stopped based on 1) reaching the pre-specified criterion for superi ority or th e pre-specified criterion for futilit y and 2) the overall risk -to-benefit assessment. The IDMC will consist of at l east two AML disease experts and a bi ostati stician (none of them being employees of the Sponsor or of the CRO or invest igators in the study ). The IDMC will regul arly review cumulativesafet ydata and make recommendat ions, if necessary , to the Sponsor relating to the selection, recruit ment, and retention of patients; patient management; improving adherence to protocol-specified treatm ents and assessments; and the procedures for data managem ent and qualit y control . The IDMC may be unblinded for some or all patients according to the condi tions established in the IDMC charter ."

This is an event -driven study and an interim analysis for both futilit y and superi ority will be performed at 2/3 of inform ation (260/390 events) . The primary efficacy endpo int is overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) patient set using the log-rank test stratified by cytogeneti c risk and ECOG . The null and alternat ive hypotheses to be tested for OS distribut ion, assuming proporti onal hazards, are: H0: HR ≥1 H1: HR < 1 where HR is the hazard ratio of the pracinostat group over the placebo grou p. Hazard Ratio equal to 1 is used as H0for sam ple size cal culat ions. Secondary endpoints will be tested according to a fixed sequence method. If the primar y endpo int is statistically significant, then the first secondary endpo int (according to the predef ined list) will be tested, and so on for the other three secondary endpo ints. When the sequence stops for a non-significant test the following tests will be downgraded to exploratory . 9.2 Randomization and Stratification This study will empl oy a 1 :1 randomiza tion.Patients will be stratified based on the following factors: Cytogenetic ri sk category (interm ediate vs. unfavorable -risk) ECOG 0/1 vs. 2 Inform ation on pracinostat + AZA (Phase 2 study MEI- 004) suggests some factors as influencing the OS. This inform ation was combined wi th information provided by current literature on AZA [Dombret , 2015 ] and the most influencing factors emerged as candidates chosen as stratificat ion factors at randomizat ion to guarantee a proper balance between treatm ents. In particular ECOG was selected as grade 2 is generally much less frequent than grades 0/1, while Cytogenet ic risk was included as showing a large difference between intermediate and unfavorable risk. If available , the central cytogenet ic test result will be used to assess the cytogeneti c risk category at rando mizat ion.Ifthe central result isnot available, the local result will be used. Randomization will be conducted centrally via an IWRS. 9.3 Analys isSets The definit ions of analysis sets are as fo llows:"

OS time for patients alive or lost to follow-up at the time of analysis will be censored at the date when they were l ast known to be alive . OS will not be censored at the time of subsequent AML therapy . Both interim and final OS analyses will be performed on the ITT set. Final analysis will take place after the requi red number of events (390 deaths) has occurred. The primary OS analysis will be based on the log-rank test stratified by the factors used for rando mizat ion (cytogenet ic risk and ECOG) at the overall one-sided alpha = 0.025 level of significance (specific alpha levels will be used for interim and final analysis). Log-rank stratified by cytogenetic risk obtained by central laboratory (when available ) and ECOG at Day 1 Cycle 1, unstratified log-rank test and Cox PH model including factors used for randomizat ionwill be used as sensi tivity analys es to support evidence of efficacy . Kaplan -Meier estimates of OS in each treatm ent group will be reported, both overall and within strata of patients. Estimates of median survival will be provi ded with two-sided 95% confidence intervals, along with the 25th and 75th percent iles, together with the HR estimates. The number of surviving patients, the number of deaths and the number of patients wi th censored val ues will be displayed as well. Checks on the proportionalit y of hazards will be performed. Censoring patterns will be examined between treatm ent groups. The effect of subsequent therapy on OS will be analyzed, including an analysis that compares OS in the treatm ent groups with censoring at the start date of the new regimen subsequent AML therapy . Other sensit ivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of OS resul ts, if relevant. The primary OS analysis ( stratifi ed log-rank test ) will be repeated for the PP set. Further explorat ion of baseline/demographic factors of interest will be done by means of Cox PH model. 9.7.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy outcom e measures for this study are the following (the order is relevant to the sequence procedure for testing endpoints): CR rate Transfusion independence CR MRD -rate CRc rate"

Addit ional details on the PK/PD methods and analysis will be provided in a dedicated SAP. 9.10 Health Economics Analysis The analy tical approach will be a cost efficacy analysis. The healt h economics analysis will be managed and conducted separately. Relevant patient data and an alyses resul ts will be presented in a separate report. Further details will be outlined in the Heal th Economics analysis plan . 9.11 Power and Sample Size Determination This is an event -driven study . Sam ple size was computed for a group -sequential design with stopping rules for both futility and superi ority (study -wise one-sided alpha level=0.025, power 0.90) with one interim analysis at 67% (2/3) of inform ation and a final analysis. The error spending function is from the Gamma Family ,using γ=-3.6 (similar to O’Brien Fleming) for superi ority and γ=-5.5 (more conservat ive than O’Bri en Fleming ) for futility (non-binding) . Proporti onalit y of hazards is assumed. Assuming that median OS is 10.0 months in the Group B(placebo + AZA) the aim is to detect, by means of the log-rank test or equivalent, an increase to 14.0 months in Group A (pracinostat + AZA), i.e., a HR of 0.714. A total of 390events (deaths) allows to meet a power requirement of at least 90% (actually 90.78%) at a study-wise one-sided significance l evel of 0.025."
89,page_89,"PRAN -16-52 Final (v5.0) /16Dec 2019 Clinical Study Protocol Page 90of 120 CONFIDENTIAL Patient accrual is assumed to occur over a 30-month period. Assuming a non-constant accrual rate (100 patients during the first year and the remain patients during the following 1.5 years) and a 3% y early drop -out rate, and considering that 500 patients will be recrui ted, it is expected that the post-recruit ment follow-up period will take about 18 additional months to reach 390events for final OS analysis. Sample size calculat ions were made using SAS 9.2. The overall event rate (blinded) will be constant ly monitored. Before the expected recrui tment end, the observed placebo hazard rate will be derived from the (blinded) overall observed hazard rate at that time, assuming a hazard ratio of 0.714. Based on the computed value the decisio n to adapt the sample size to enable study end within a reasonable amount of time from the end of recruit ment might be taken . This procedure does not introduce bias and no statistical adjustments to preserve the study -wise alpha error are required. A group -sequentia l procedure will be applied also to the secondary endpo ints, adopting as the error spending funct ion for superiorit y the Gamma Family, using γ=- 3.6. Details on the procedure and power calculat ion for the secondary endpo ints will be provi ded in the SAP. 9.12 Interim Analysis One formal interim analysis on the primary endpoint, OS,is planned and will be assessed by the IDMC. The interim analysis is to be perform ed when 2/3of the total number of events (260/390 deaths due to any cause) have occurred in the study ,according to the group sequent ial testing design described in Section 9.11. Events shoul d be reported to sponsor as soon as they beco me known to investigators andentered in the eCRF in a short time. As soon as the 260thevent is reported to the sponsor, the set of 260 events will be considered as complete. This set of events will be submi tted to final validat ion before analysis. Data emerged on a later time point (including events occurred earlier than the 260thevent) will not be consi dered for the interim analysis. The same rul e will be applied at the time of final analysis, if relevant. Further data will be considered in an addendu m to the CSR. Further details will be provided in the SAP and DMC Charter pri or to the implemen tation of this interim analysis."
