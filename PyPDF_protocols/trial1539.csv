The booster vaccination will be administered in the open-label phase of the study. The combination of homologous or heterologous prime/boost vaccination will not be randomized, but depend on what participants received during the double-blind phase of the study as described in this protocol. Booster vaccination should occur preferably 6 months but at least 3 months after the primary vaccination regimen. Participants in the study who have already received an additional COVID-19 vaccination after the primary regimen outside the study with any vaccine as described above will also be eligible for the Ad26.COV2.S booster in this study preferably 6 months but at least 3 months after their last COVID-19 vaccination. Participants are free to choose when to receive the booster vaccination within the window of the booster vaccination visit, to receive booster vaccination outside the study, or not to receive booster vaccination. Participants who choose to receive a booster vaccination with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (if recommended and available) or another authorized COVID-19 vaccine outside the study or choose not to receive a booster vaccination will not be withdrawn from the study and will be encouraged to remain in the study. All participants who received a booster vaccination within the study or received a booster vaccination outside the study and remained inthe study will be monitoredfor safety,immunogenicity,and efficacy. Immunogenicity will be assessed with blood draws on the day of booster vaccination (prior to booster vaccination, if feasible) , and 28 days, 72 days, and 6 months post booster vaccination. In addition, immunogenicity subsets with more extensive blood draws for immunogenicity assessments will be included. Safety blood draws will include a platelet count at Baseline (prior to booster vaccination, if feasible) , and 28 days after booster vaccination and extra blood, aside from that required for immunogenicity and N serology for determination of infection, to assess relevant parameters in case of an adverse event of interest. With implementation of this amendment, the start date of the first crossover unblinding visit (implemented with Amendment 4) and the date of first booster vaccine administration until 1-year follow-up of the last booster vaccination define the open-label booster vaccination phase of the study. This phase will be utilized to describe safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy during the time participants have and have not been boosted."

Despite this durability, signs of waning immunity in terms of the numbers of participants with undetectable antibody have been observed, especially in the older population, where as many as 28% have no detectable neutralizing antibody at 6 months post vaccination. Furthermore, while protection against variants of concern such as the Beta variant, the Gamma variant, and the B.1.621 variant in this study24 and the Delta variant in the Sisonke study remains high against serious disease, hospitalization, and death, this protection is somewhat lower against, for example, the Delta variant compared to the reference Wuhan strain.38 Protection against mild to moderate disease against the Delta variant is very low at the late time points when measured in the Sisonke study, although it is unknown if this is due to waning immunity or biologic factors related to the Delta variant. Waning immune responses and less protection against moderate to severe disease against the Delta variant has also been observed for mRNA vaccines. Based on these findings, regulatory and advisory bodies including the FDA are planning to recommend booster doses for vaccines when data supports such recommendations. Therefore, based on this recommendation for a booster vaccination and the availability of booster vaccinations outside the study, this amendment will permit boosting of all ongoing participants in this study who have previously received any COVID-19 vaccine(s) (either as part of a primary regimen or as an additional dose administered after the primary regimen) . All participants who received vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, an mRNA vaccine and/or another COVID-19 vaccine authorized for primary vaccination, if the last vaccination was preferably 6 months but at least 3 months ago, and who subsequently remained in the study will be eligible to receive the booster. These and other changes made to the clinical protocol of study VAC31518COV3001 are listed below, including the rationale for each change and a list of all applicable sections."

PROTOCOL SUMMARY Synopsis A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 3 Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Ad26.COV2.S for the Prevention of SARS-CoV-2-mediated COVID-19 in Adults Aged 18 Years and Older With protocol Amendment 4, an unblinding visit was introduced at which participants who initially received placebo in the double-blind phase,and consent,receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Following the unblinding, the study is conducted in an open-label fashion. With protocol Amendment 6, the open-label phase of the study is extended to include an open-label booster vaccination with a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. This study is being conducted under the sponsorship of Janssen (Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V) in collaboration with the COVID-19 Response Team (formerly known as Operation Warp Speed [OWS]) , which also encompasses the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) , the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ,and the COVID-19 Prevention Trials Network (COVPN) . Ad26.COV2.S (previously known as Ad26COVS1) is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector, constructed to encode the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein. Information about the disease, correlates of immunity, and safety issues concerning this new pandemic-causing virus are rapidly evolving. Therefore, it is critical to recognize that the approach outlined in this document might or will change as insights and discussions evolve.

Depending on the operational implementation of the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, as well as the stage of the pandemic, this analysis may be conducted when a minimum of 90% of the study population has been unblinded. All participants will be invited for an on-site Month 6/Unblinding Visit and participants who initially received placebo in the double-blind phase will be offered a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Initial immunogenicity and safety data (28 days post-Dose 1 data from Cohort 1a and available data from Cohort 3) from study VAC31518COV1001 have demonstrated that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5×1010 vp and 1×1011 vp induces an immune response that meets prespecified minimum criteria and had an acceptable safety profile. The sponsor has therefore decided to proceed with the single dose regimen at a 5×1010 virus particles (vp)dose level in this Phase 3 study. With protocol Amendment 6, the open-label phase of the study is extended to include an open-label booster vaccination with a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at the Year 1/Booster Visit (see also below) . The combination of homologous or heterologous prime/boost vaccination will not be randomized, but depends on what participants received during the double-blind phase of the study as described in this protocol. The start date of the first crossover unblinding visit (implemented with Amendment 4) and the date of first booster vaccine administration until 1-year follow-up of the last booster vaccination define the open-label booster vaccination phase of the study. This phase will be utilized to describe safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy during the time participants have and have not been boosted. The observational open-label booster vaccination phase of the study will be analyzed separately and analysis of the data is planned to be performed 6 months and 1 year after all participants were offered the booster vaccination. Participants will be randomized in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive Ad26.COV2.S or placebo intramuscularly (IM) as shown in the table below. Ad26.COV2.S will be administered at a dose level of 5×1010 vp. At the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, participants who initially received placebo and signed an amended ICF will be offered a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. vaccine at a dose level of 5×1010 vp. At the Year 1/Booster Visit, all ongoing participants in the study who have previously received any COVID-19 vaccination(s) (as primary regimen or additional dose) with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, and/or an mRNA vaccine or another COVID-19 vaccine authorized for primary vaccination including protein, inactivated, and adenovector-based vaccines,will be offered a single booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (5×1010 vp) if the last vaccination was preferably 6 months but at least 3 months ago.

The end-of-study is considered as the completion of the last visit for the last participant in the study. Key efficacy assessments include the surveillance for COVID-19-like signs and symptoms, recording of COVID-19-related hospitalizations and complications, and the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a molecular assay (based on RT-PCR) and by anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology. Immunogenicity assessments, and especially assessments of the humoral immune responses with emphasis on neutralizing and binding antibodies will also be performed. Key safety assessments during the double-blind phase will include the monitoring of solicited and unsolicited AEs in the Safety Subset only. All participants who received booster vaccination at the Year 1/Booster Visit will record solicited signs and symptoms in an e-Diary, if feasible. For a subset of participants, the e-Diary will be reviewed by the study personnel at the aC enters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .

Unsolicited AEs will be recorded for all participants who received booster vaccination at the Year 1/Booster Visit. In addition, key safety assessments throughout the study include the collection of SAEs and MAAEs in all participants. The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 will be assessed in confirmed COVID-19 cases. Biomarkers correlating with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity will also be studied. Medical resource utilization (MRU) following vaccination will be recorded for all participants with molecularly confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19. Additional characteristics related to current work situation, living situation, and community interactions will be collected for risk factor analysis, if allowed per local regulations. Participants who consent to this will be interviewed on these aspects prior to vaccination on Day 1 and, at other timepoints, on changes compared to Day 1. For consenting participants in the US, medical data (electronic health records, claims and laboratory data from other care settings) from 5 years prior to study enrollment until 5 years after study completion may be accessed utilizing tokenization and matching procedures (ie, the generation of anonymous identifiers or “tokens” [hashed and encrypted combinations of identifying elements] to allow linking of participant data from different sources without compromising the participant’s confidentiality) . These data together with data collected as part of the study as specified in the Schedules of Activities, may be used for exploratory analyses to enhance our understanding of the impact of prior medical history on the response to immunization and the impact of immunization on efficacy and duration of efficacy as well as adverse events that may occur during and after completion of the study. The statistical analyses will be described in detail in a Statistical Analysis Plan. Until 1 year afterthe Month 6/Unblinding Visit, each participant will be asked at least twice a week, through the electronic clinical outcome assessment (eCOA) ,if they have experienced any new symptoms or health concerns that could be related to infection with SARS-CoV-2. As of1-year after the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, until the end of the 2-yearfollow-up period, the frequency of this (suspected) COVID-19 surveillance (symptom check)through the eCOA may decrease to once every 2 weeks depending on epidemiology. All participants will be monitored for safety (including enhanced disease) for approximately 1 year after the Year 1/Booster Visit, ie, until the last study visit. Every effort will be made to document the status of all participants that are lost to follow-up due to not completing the eCOA and for whom hospitalization has not been recorded. Enrolled participants will be counselled on SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention each time that they have a contact with site staff, in line with local guidelines. At the time of study entry, each participant will need to indicate to the study site, in case they would get infected with SARS-CoV-2, the identity and location of their routine medical care physician and/or facility and the identity and location of where they would obtain emergency care and hospitalization if necessary. If this information is not available, a plan for where such care could be obtained should be developed. If a participant should have COVID-19 and their symptoms deteriorate, they will be instructed to go to the health care professional (HCP) or hospital that has been identified in advance. Any positive RT-PCR test result regardless if it is obtained outside the study or at a study visit will be considered a trigger to start COVID-19 procedures. All participants with COVID-19-like signs or symptoms meeting the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19a and all participants with at least 1 positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on COVID-19 Day 1-2 or Day 3-5 visits, should undertake the COVID-19 procedures until 14 days after symptom onset (COVID-19 Day 15) or until resolution of the COVID-19 episode,whichever comes last. However, participants with COVID-19-like signs or symptoms meeting the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19a should stop the COVID-19 procedures as soon as it is confirmed that both nasal swabs collected on COVID-19 Day 1-2 and Day 3-5 are negative for SARS-CoV-2. Resolution of the COVID-19 episode is defined as having 2 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 negative nasal swabs and 2 consecutive days with no COVID-19-related signs or symptoms. At the time of a A s several of the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19 overlap with vaccine-related reactogenicity, investigator’s clinical judgement is required to exclude vaccine-related events when assessing suspected COVID-19."

In the event of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the participant and participant’s medical care provider will be notified,and the participant will be asked to adhere to the appropriate measures and restrictions as defined by local regulations. A DSMB will be commissioned for this study. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS Overall, a target ofapproximately 40, 000 adult participants (≥18- to <60-year-old and ≥60-year-old, with and without relevant comorbidities) will be randomly assigned in this study. Efforts will be made to ensure good representation in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender. It is intended that a minimum ofapproximately 30% of recruited participants will be ≥60 years of age and approximately 20% of recruited participants will be ≥18 to <40 years of age. INTERVENTION GROUPS AND DURATION Participants will be vaccinated at the study site according to the schedules detailed above:  Ad26.COV2.S supplied at a concentration of 1×1011 vp/mL in single-use vials, with an extractable volume of 0.5 mL, and dosed at 5×1010 vp  Placebo: 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution For blinding purposes, all participants will receive Ad26.COV2.S or placebo at Day 1 of the double-blind phase,using the same volume (ie, 0.5 mL) . At the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, all placebo participants who have signed a new ICF will receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, using the same dose level and the same volume (ie, 5×1010 vp per 0.5 mL) . At the Year 1/Booster Visit, all participants who are eligible for booster vaccination, desire to receive a booster vaccination, and have signed a new ICF will receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, using the same dose level and the same volume (ie, 5×1010 vp per 0.5 mL) as used for the primary regimen. EFFICACY EVALUATIONS Identification and molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic COVID-19 will be performed throughout the study. The occurrence of COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related complications (such as but not limited to hyperinflammatory syndrome, pneumonia, neurological or vascular complications, severe neurological or vascular events, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal complications, sepsis, septic shock, death)a will be monitored throughout the study. For the primary objective, all moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 cases will be considered. As a secondary objective, VE in the prevention of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild COVID-19 will be analyzed.

For a total of approximately 400 participants in the Immunogenicity Subset (ie, 400 participants at sites with access to appropriate processing facilities) , blood will be collected for analysis of humoral immune responses at Day 1 (pre-vaccination) , Day 29, Day 71, Month 6/Unblinding Visit, Year 1, Month 18, and Year 2 visit after double-blind vaccination, and additionally 28 days and 72 days after booster vaccination, if applicable. Note: Those participants in the Immunogenicity Subset that transfer to the Homologous Booster Subset at the Year 1/Booster Visit (see below) will from that visit onwards follow the humoral immunogenicity sample schedule of the Homologous Booster Subset and discontinue the schedule of the Immunogenicity Subset. For participants with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (ie, meeting prespecified criteria on COVID-19 Day 1-2 and Day 3-5 and/or a SARS-CoV-2 positive sample on COVID-19 Day 1-2 or Day 3-5) , blood will be collected on COVID-19 Day 3-5 and on COVID-19 Day 29 for immunogenicity assessments, including the assays summarized in the table below. Booster Vaccination Blood will be collected from all non-Subset participants who received booster vaccination for humoral immunogenicity assessments at the Year 1/Booster Visit and 28 days, 72 days, and 6 months after booster vaccination. A blood sample for transcriptomics will be collected from all participants 28 days after booster vaccination. Homologous Booster Subset: The Homologous Booster Subset will include approximately 200 participants. T his subset will include participants from the Immunogenicity Subset, who received Ad26.COV2.S in the double-blind phase or after crossover, and subsequently received an Ad26.COV2.S booster vaccination in the study. This group may be augmented by other participants to replace participants who are not available. Participants in the Homologous Booster Subset will have a blood sample collected pre-booster vaccination, and 28 days, 72 days, 6 months, and 1 year post booster vaccination for humoral immunogenicity assessment. Heterologous Booster Subset: The Heterologous Booster Subset will include approximately 4 00 participants. This subset will include participants in the study who received placebo in the double-blind phase and have received primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine or another authorized COVID-19 vaccine including protein, inactivated, and adenovector based vaccines outside the study, who subsequently remained in the study and subsequently received an Ad26.COV2.S booster vaccination in the study. Participants who already received an additional COVID-19 vaccination after the primary regimen outside the study will not be included in the Heterologous Booster Subset. Participants will be selected out of countries where these vaccines were authorized for emergency use or are licensed. Participants in the Heterologous Booster Subset will have blood collected pre-booster vaccination, and 28 days, 72 days, 6 months, and 1 year post booster vaccination for humoral immunogenicity assessment. Additionally, approximately the first 60eligibleparticipants once operationally feasible of the Homologous Booster Subset and approximately the first 60 eligible participants once operationally feasible of the Heterologous Booster Subset will have blood collected pre-booster and 1 day and 28 days post booster vaccination for transcriptomics and cytokine/chemokine assessment."

STATISTICAL METHODS Note: The below is only applicable to the double-blind phase of the study unless mentioned otherwise. Sample Size Calculation Ef f icacy (Total Sample Size) The study target number of events (TNE) is determined using the following assumptions:  a VE for molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe/critical SARS-CoV-2 infection of 60%.  approximately 90% power to reject a null hypothesis of H0: VE≤30%.  type 1 error rate α = 2.5% to evaluate VE of the vaccine regimen (employing the sequential probability ratio test [SPRT] to perform a fully sequential design analysis; detailed in the methods section) .  a randomization ratio of1:1 for active versus placebo. Events for the co-primary endpoints are defined as first occurrence of molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 according to the case definition (see above) in the Per-protocol Efficacy population at least 14 days after double-blind vaccination (Day 15) and at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination (Day 29) with study vaccine. Under the assumptions above, the total TNE to compare the active vaccine versus placebo equals 154, based on events in each active vaccination and placebo group, according to the primary endpoints case definition of moderate to severe/critical COVID-19. If the primary hypotheses testing is successful, secondary objectives will be evaluated against a null hypothesis employing a lower limit VE>0%. The method to perform hypothesis testing of primary and secondary objectives preserving the FWER will be specified in the SAP. The FWER will be controlled at 2.5%. Further details on the sample size calculation are provided in the body of the protocol. The operating characteristics of the study design, statistical methods, study monitoring rules and efficacy evaluation specified in this protocol with the chosen event and sample sizes will be described in a separate modeling and simulation report and will be added to the SAP before the first participant is vaccinated. No additional participants will be recruited for the open-label phase. Immunogenicity Correlates (Correlates Subset) Correlates will be assessed in a subset where immune responses and transcriptome modifications are measured in all vaccine recipients who experience a SARS-CoV-2 event, and in random samples of vaccine recipients who have not been infected, in a 1:5 ratio. The goal of this case– control study is to assess correlates of risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (and potential other secondary endpoints) in the vaccine group by comparing vaccine-induced immune responses and transcriptome modifications associated with COVID-19. Also, placebo participants will be included in this subset (placebo infected, seropositive [based on N protein] non-infected and seronegative non-infected) , if feasible."

Populations for Analysis Sets For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined:  Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomized participants with a documented study vaccine administration, regardless of the occurrence of protocol deviations and serostatus at enrollment. Analyses of safety will be performed on the FAS. Vaccine efficacy analyses can be repeated using the FAS.  Safety Subset : subset of the FAS for the analysis of solicited and unsolicited AEs.  Per-protocol Efficacy (PP) population: Participants in the FAS who receive study vaccine and who are seronegative at the time of vaccination and who have no other major protocol deviations that were judged to possibly impact the efficacy of the vaccine. Participants who became aware of their study vaccine allocation will cease to be part of the PP population. The PA of VE will be based on the PP population. The PP will be the main analysis population for efficacy analyses.  Per-protocol Immunogenicity (PPI) population: All randomized and vaccinated participants, including those who are part of the Immunogenicity Subset and for whom immunogenicity data are available, excluding participants with major protocol deviations expected to impact the immunogenicity outcomes. In addition, for participants who experience a SARS-CoV-2 event (molecularly confirmed) , samples taken after the event and samples taken outside protocol windows will not be taken into account in the assessment of the immunogenicity. The PPI population is the primary immunogenicity population. For key tables, sensitivity immunogenicity analyses will also be performed on the FAS, including participants who are part of the Immunogenicity Subset for whom immunogenicity measures are available. Excluded samples might be taken into account as well in the sensitivity analysis. Analyses of vaccine immunogenicity and immune correlates of risk will be based on PPI.  Open-Label (OL) population : The OL population consists of all participants who have been treated with Ad26.COV2.S vaccination during the study. Participants will be described in 2 groups, those who were treated with Ad26.COV2.S in the double-blind phase and those who were treated in the open- label phase. The list of major protocol deviations to be excluded from the efficacy and/or immunogenicity analyses will be specified in the SAP and/or this list will be reported into the protocol deviation dataset of the clinical database before unblinding. Efficacy Analyses The study will have the following timepoints for efficacy analyses: 1. The evaluation of the primary objective will be performed as soon as the TNE has been reached in the double-blind phase for both co-primary endpoints, or earlier based on sequential monitoring of both co-primary endpoints. Sponsor unblinding will occur but investigator and participants remain blinded until implementation of Amendment 4. 2. If an efficacy signal is triggered before the required 8-week follow-up after double-blind vaccination of 50% of participants is reached, an additional analysis will be performed when that follow-up timepoint is reached (8-week median follow-up timepoint) .

The analysis at the time of the 8-week median follow-up is considered the primary analysis. 3. After the primary analysis, additional analyses to support health authority interactions will be planned, as deemed appropriate. 4. A final analysis of the double-blind phase of the study, including all double-blind data, will be performed when all participants have completed the Month 6/Unblinding Visit or discontinued earlier. Depending on the operational implementation of the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, as well as the stage of the pandemic, this analysis may be conducted when a minimum of 90% of the study population has been unblinded. 5. The final analysis will be performed when the last participant completes the 18 months visit which corresponds to approximately 12 months visit after the Month 6/Unblinding Visit or discontinued earlier. 6. The end-of-study analysis will be performed when all participants have completed the Year 2 visit of the study or discontinued earlier. Primary Endpoints The study is designed to test the co-primary hypotheses of VE in the PP population. For both co-primary endpoints, the following hypothesis will be tested: H0: VE ≤30% versus H1: VE >30%. The co-primary endpoints will evaluate the first occurrence of molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 according to the case definition with onset at least 14 days after double-blind vaccination (Day 15) and with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination (Day 29) with Ad26.COV2.S versus placebo, separately, in the PP population, including all events from both age groups, with and without comorbidities. Participants included in the seronegative analysis set are those participants with a negative SARS-CoV-2 serology test result at baseline. Evaluation of the Primary Endpoints A fully sequential design with early stopping boundaries for efficacy based on the SPRT30 will be used on the PP. The SPRT will control the type I error adjusting for the fully sequential approach. The decision rules for harm and non-efficacy are detailed in the protocol. To that end, the boundaries are derived to achieve approximately 90% power to detect VE=60% using an alpha level of 2.5% against H0:VE≤30%. To allow for durability assessment, sites and participants will continue the study and remain blinded until the final analysis. A successful primary efficacy conclusion will require: 1. Establishing the hypothesis H1: VE>30% for each co-primary endpoint AND 2. A favorable split vaccine: placebo for the subset of primary endpoints meeting the severe/critical COVID-19 case definition (expressed as a VE point estimate against severe/critical COVID-19 molecularly confirmed endpoints ≥50%) and a minimum of 5 events in the placebo group. This requirement needs to be met for severe/critical events with onset at least 14 days after double-blind vaccination and for severe/critical events with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination AND 3. A VE of at least 50% for each co-primary endpoint."

The efficacy analysis will be triggered by either: 1. a) An interim evaluation if all prespecified efficacy boundaries have been met OR if 154 cases meeting the primary endpoint definition of moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 are observed for events with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination. AND b) The above 3 conditions are met. OR, alternatively, 2. If the prespecified non-efficacy boundary has been met (evaluating events with start 28 days after double-blind vaccination) or when the harm boundary has been crossed. The decision rules for harm and non-efficacy are detailed in Section 9.5.1.1 . 3. If an efficacy signal is triggered before the required 8-week follow-up after double-blind vaccination of 50% of participants is reached (8-week median follow-up timepoint) , an additional analysis will be performed when that follow-up timepoint is reached. If the time between the efficacy signal and the required 8-weekmedian follow-up is too short to make a difference in terms of preparing two analyses, then a single analysis will take place at the time of the 8-week median follow-up. The analysis at the time of the 8-week median follow-up is considered the primary analysis. If more than 154 primary endpoints are observed for events with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination before the 3 conditions above are met, a single analysis will take place as soon as the conditions are met, using the full 2.5% one-sided significance level. If the prespecified boundaries and above criteria are met, the SSG will inform the DSMB and if deemed appropriate by the DSMB, a meeting with the DSMB and Oversight Group will be set up to discuss the efficacy signal. Upon this meeting the sponsor representative on the Oversight Group can trigger internal decision procedures to initiate health authority interactions based on the outcome of the study. The primary efficacy analysis will pool data across populations (both age groups with and without comorbidities) to evaluate the primary and secondary objectives. In addition, these will be supplemented with a subgroup analysis for age group (18 to <60 years, ≥60 years) and comorbidities employing a descriptive summary, including 95% confidence intervals to describe the VE in each subpopulation."

In addition, to assess potential time-effects of VE, the Kaplan-Meier method will be used to plot the estimated cumulative incidence rates over time for the vaccine and placebo groups. This method will be used to estimate cumulative VE over time, defined as [(1 minus ratio (vaccine/placebo) of cumulative incidence by time t)×100%]. Secondary Endpoints All secondary endpoint analyses will occur in the PP analysis set, in seronegative participants unless otherwise indicated. The multiple testing strategy and the timing of the hypothesis testing to evaluate the secondary objectives will be detailed in the SAP separately. Immunogenicity Analyses No formal statistical testing of the immunogenicity data is planned. All immunogenicity analyses will be performed on the PPI set. Key tables might be repeated for the FAS (including samples that are excluded from the PPI analysis) . Safety Analyses No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data by vaccination group and based on the FAS will be analyzed descriptively. The analysis of solicited and unsolicited AEs will be restricted to a subset of the FAS (ie, the Safety Subset) . For SAEs, AESIs,and MAAEs,the full FAS is considered. New onset of chronic disease will be collected as part of the MAAEs. Analysis of the Open-label Booster Vaccination Phase Safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy endpoints following booster vaccination will be descriptively summarized by homologous or heterologous prime/boost combination (mRNA, adenovector, protein, or inactivated vaccine) . The analysis of the data is planned to be performed 6 months and 1 year after all participants have been offered the booster vaccination. Additional analyses may be conducted to support health authority interactions and/or based on public health demand in case of emerging variants. If deemed feasible, efficacy of the booster vaccination may be explored by comparing efficacy data after boosting to data in the absence of booster, on the same primary regimen. Feasibility will be assessed based on data availability as well as adjustments for potential confounding in the statistical analysis. The following data sources will be explored: 1. If available, data of participants in the study who did not receive a booster and/or available data prior to boosting. 2. Data of individuals outside the study who received a similar primary regimen but did not receive a booster. It will be explored if external data (eg, real world evidence data, and/or published literature data) is available to that end for the countries enrolled in this trial. For the statistical analysis, it will be explored if adjustment for potential confounding factors is feasible (based on risk factors identified in the analysis of the double-blind phase/and or literature) in each"

This may include, but not limitto age, presence of co-morbidities as well as the spatiotemporal evolution of variants and the epidemic. It is anticipated that comparative evaluation of efficacy against asymptomatic infections using real world evidence of data of individuals outside the study will not be feasible due to the difficulty of detecting asymptomatic infections in real world evidence. Efficacy data may be compared following homologous versus heterologous booster vaccination. Details will be provided in the SAP. Interim Analyses and Committees The study will be formally monitored by a DSMB (also known as an IDMC) . In general, the DSMB will monitor safety data on a regular basis to ensure the continuing safety of the participants. The DSMB will review unblinded data. The DSMB will review Day 3 safety data (ie, from Day 1 to Day 3; including safety data from the ongoing clinical studies) from participants enrolled in Stage 1a and Stage 2a, before enrollment of participants in Stage 1b and Stage 2b, respectively. Vaccination of participants in the respective age groups will be paused during these safety reviews. Enrollment will not be paused during other safety reviews. The DSMB responsibilities, authorities, and procedures will be documented in the DSMB Charter. Continuous monitoring for vaccine-associated enhanced disease will be performed through the SSG who will look at each of the diagnosed FAS COVID-19 events. Vaccine harm monitoring will be performed for severe/critical COVID-19/death endpoint based on the FAS. As these events will be monitored in real-time, and, after each confirmed respective case, the SSG will assess if a stopping boundary is reached. Specifically, monitoring for a higher rate of severe/critical disease or death in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group starts at the 5th event and at each additional event until the harm boundary is reached or until the efficacyanalysis is triggered. If the stopping boundary is met, then the SSG immediately informs the Chair of the DSMB through secure communication procedures. At this point the DSMB will convene and provide a recommendation to the Oversight Group, which includes a sponsor representative as a core member. As such, the potential harm monitoring is in real-time, resulting in the earliest indication of harm possible as soon as data come in. In addition, the DSMB will formally monitor the SARS-CoV-2 events to conclude both non-efficacy and efficacy. The DSMB will evaluate in an unblinded fashion whether superiority is established for the co-primary endpoints or whether non-efficacy is shown based on a report provided by the SSG, when the prespecified boundaries have been crossed. The study will also be monitored for operational non-efficacyto evaluate whether enough events to perform the PA can be collected within reasonable time. For that purpose, a monitoring rule will be set up to assess the probability that the minimal needed target number of primary endpoints events to be able to perform the PA in the PP set will be reached. For the double-blind phase of the study, two versions of the non- efficacymonitoring report will be generated. A report provided to the DSMB will contain unblinded events and a report provided to the sponsor will contain blinded events. While it is the primary responsibility of the sponsor to make decisions regarding study operations and modifications based on monitoring of study vaccine-blinded primary events from the study, the DSMB can evaluate the progress towards primary endpoints targets in the context of the study vaccine-unblinded data, and based on this review may recommend to the OversightGroup, which includes a sponsor representative as a core member,to complete the study early due to reaching a boundary for efficacy or non-efficacy to assess VE. During the open-label phase, the DSMB will continue to monitor safety. The monitoring rules will be detailed in the DSMB Charter, with the statistical details in the SAP. A final analysis of the double-blind phase will be performed when all participants have completed the Month 6/Unblinding Visit or discontinued earlier. Depending on the operational implementation of the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, as well as the stage of the pandemic, this analysis may be conducted when a minimum of 90% of the study population has been unblinded. This will provide an analysis of all endpoints"

This analysis will also incorporate data collected after the EUA submission to the FDA. All data generated after the unblinding will be considered as part of an analytic plan devoted to the open-label phase. More details will be provided in the SAP. This analysis may be supplemented by independent measures of incidence and efficacy with real world data obtained in separate studies, to be described in a separate protocol. The SAP will describe the planned analyses in greater detail. Unblinding due to availability of an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine In the double-blind-phase of the study,investigators may receive requests to unblind study participants who become eligible to receive an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine if/when these become available. In these cases, the investigator will discuss with the participant available options and ramifications. If the participant is eligible for an authorized/licensed vaccine according to local immunization guidelines or recommendation and if the participant wishes to proceed with the unblinding, the investigator will follow the unblinding procedures. The reason for the unblinding request should be documented. The name and date(s) of administration of the other COVID-19 vaccine should be recorded (see body of the protocol for more details) . When unblinding, if it is determined that the participant received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (and not placebo) , the participant will be informed that there are no data on the safety of receiving two different COVID-19 vaccines. Unblinded participants, both in the double-blind and open-label phase, will be asked to continue to be followed in this study in line with the Schedule of Activities to the extent that they permit. Safety, efficacy, and immunogenicityevaluations will be identical for all participants,including participants that are unblinded to obtain an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine and who remain in the study, including participants in the Safety Subset, if applicable and feasible. All data will be analyzed separately from the point of unblinding, for safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity analysis, as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Prior to EUA, conditional licensure or approval in any country, participants who opt for enrollment in an Expanded Access Program or a Phase 3b study (eg, Sisonke/TOGETHER in South Africa) may be unblinded upon their request and will be encouraged to continue in study VAC31518COV3001. Study investigators should query participants to elicit and document such participation in other studies in the VAC31518COV3001 study record."

Participants who are pregnant may receive booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, if allowed by local regulations and if the investigator considers that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and fetus (see Section 6.5) . n. Diagnostic molecular RT-PCR or other molecular diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 infection (from nasal swab collected prior to vaccination on Day 1) will be performed at a central laboratory on a retrospective basis. These baseline results will not be available in real time, and thus cannot be used to inform participants at time of enrollment. o. Blood sample for exploration of biomarkers correlating with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. p. In areas where seroprevalence is predicted to be high, a screening serologic test for past or current infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be performed (in a local laboratory) ,at the discretion of the sponsor, to restrict the proportion of seropositive participants in the study. This does not apply to the open-label phase of the study. q. MRU over the last 3 months before vaccination will be collected by interview with the participant and recorded in the eCRF. r. Investigator must check for acute illness or body temperature ≥38.0°C/100.4°F at the time of each vaccination. If any of these events occur within 24 hours prior to the planned vaccination in the double-blind phase, the vaccination can be rescheduled as long as this is within the allowed window. If the vaccination visit cannot be rescheduled within the allowed window or the contraindications to vaccination persist, the sponsor should be contacted for further guidance. If, at the start of the open-label phase, any of the above listed events occur at the scheduled time for the vaccination, the Month 6/Unblinding Visit with active vaccine can be delayed up to 28 days following unblinding. If any of the above listed events occur at the scheduled time for the booster vaccination, the Year 1/Booster Visit with active vaccine can be delayed within the preferred visit window. s. Participants will complete the eCOA using an application on their own eDevice (smartphone or tablet) if their device is compatible with the application or using the web portal. All eCOA assessments should be conducted/completed before any tests, procedures, or other consultations to prevent influencing participant responses. If a participant is unable to complete the eCOA, a study staff member or the participant’s caregiver can collect information on the participant’s behalf as detailed in Section 8.1.2. t. All participants will be provided a pulse oximeter at baseline to measure blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate during a COVID-19 episode (see Section 1.3.2) . u. The Medically-attended COVID-19 form ( Appendix 8 ) will be provided to the participant at the vaccination visit and should be completed by the medical care provider or the study site personnel during medical visits for COVID-19 or COVID-19 complications. v.

Until 1 year after the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, each participant will be asked at least twice a week, through the eCOA, if they have experienced any new symptoms or health concerns that could be related to infection with SARS-CoV-2. As of 1-year after the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, through the end of the 2-year follow-up period, the frequency of this (suspected) COVID-19 surveillance (symptom check) through the eCOA may decrease to once every 2 weeks depending on epidemiology. Sites should reach out to a participant if the participant fails to complete the surveillance question upon any of these reminders. The questionnaire will be accessible on the eCOA platform in between scheduled reminders and participants will be encouraged to answer the surveillance question in the eCOA as soon as possible after the onset of COVID-19-like symptoms. Every effort will be made to document the status ofall participants that are lost to follow-up due to not completing the eCOA and for whom hospitalization has not been recorded. If a participant develops COVID-19-like signs and symptoms, refer to Section 1.3.2and Section 8.1.2. Enrolled participants will be counselled on SARS-COV-2 infection prevention each time that they have a contact with site staff, in line with local guidelines. At the time of study entry, each participant will need to indicate to the study site, in case they would get infected with SARS-CoV-2,the identity and location of their routine medical care physician and/or facility and the identity and location of where they would obtain emergency care and hospitalization if necessary. If this information is not available, a plan for where such care could be obtained should be developed. If a participant should have COVID-19 and their symptoms deteriorate, they will be instructed to go to the HCP or hospital that has been identified in advance. y. MAAEs are to be reported for all participants from the moment of each vaccination until 6 months after the vaccination (applicable for both the double-blind and open-label phases of the study) ,except for MAAEs leading to study discontinuation which are to be reported during the entire study.

Participants should be encouraged by the site to collect nasal swabs and saliva samples as indicated in the Schedule of Activities. Ifthe participant is unable or unwilling to collect all samples as requested, the participant should still complete the other COVID-19 assessments, including the visit at COVID-19 Day 29. d. As soon as it is confirmed that both nasal swabs (collected on COVID-19 Day 1-2 and COVID-19 Day 3-5) are negative for SARS-CoV-2, the participant will not undertake any further COVID-19 procedures and will fall back to the default Schedule of Activities, until the end of the study/early withdrawal. e. Participants should undertake the COVID-19 procedures until 14 days after symptom onset (COVID-19 Day 15) or until resolution of the COVID-19 episode, whichever comes last. Resolution of a COVID-19 episode is defined as having 2 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 negative nasal swabs and 2 consecutive days with no COVID-19-related signs or symptoms. Once past COVID-19 Day 15, participants should stop the collection of nasal swabs and saliva samples as soon as 2 consecutive nasal samples are SARS-CoV-2 negative, but (ifstill symptomatic at that time) should continue completing the ePROs (including SIC, body temperature, and pulse oximetry) in the eCOA until 2 consecutive days with no COVID-19-related signs or symptoms (Section 8.1.1) . f. Only applicable for participants that have at least 1 SARS-CoV-2 positive nasal swab collected on COVID-19 Day 1-2 or Day 3-5. COVID-19 Day 29 should still be performed even if the nasal swabs results are still pending. g. The visit on COVID-19 Day 29 can be combined with a regular study visit if within the applicable visit windows. h. The COVID-19 Day 1-2 nasal swab can be collected at the study site (or hospital or other location, if needed) , if preferred by the participant. i. All COVID-19 Day 3-5 and Day 29 assessments may be performed by a trained HCP at the participant’s home, if allowed per local and/or institutional regulations. j. If a participant has a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or depending on the medical status of the participant, the participant may be requested to remain at home and not visit the study site. If necessary, study-site personnel or a trained HCP will visit the participant at home (or at the hospital or other location, if needed) , if allowed by local regulations. Under these circumstances, the participant will be contacted by the site at least once per week and the participant’s medical care provider will be notified. k. In case of COVID-19 like symptoms,based on the information collected through the SIC, the site will reach out to the participant at the latest on COVID-19 Day 2 (the day after the day of symptom onset) to assess whether the reported signs and symptoms qualify as a suspected COVID-19 episode using prespecified criteria (Section 8.1.1) . As several of the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19 overlap with vaccine-related reactogenicity, investigators’ clinical judgement is required to exclude vaccine-related events. In case the participant would actively reach out to the site already on COVID-19 Day 1, the site should already make a first assessment on COVID-19 Day 1 to check whether the reported signs and symptoms qualify as a suspected COVID-19 episode using prespecified criteria (Section 8.1.1) . l. In case of COVID-19 like symptoms, the site will interview the participant to assess whether the reported signs and symptoms still qualify as a suspected COVID- 19 episode using prespecified criteria (Section 8.1.1) . m. A nasal swab should be collected from the participant at home (using available material for home swabs provided by the study staff) as soon as the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19 are met and, in case of COVID-19 like symptoms,preferably on the day of symptom onset or the day thereafter (COVID-19 Day 1-2) . The sample collected on COVID-19 Day 1-2 should be transferred to the study site, as arranged by the study site, as soon as possible after collection, preferably within 24 hours. Nasal swabs should also be collected once every 2 days until 14 days after symptoms onset (COVID-19 Day 15) or until resolution of the COVID-19 episode, whichever comes last. These samples should be transferred to the study site, as arranged by the study site, within 3 days after collection. Details are provided in the laboratory manual. If the participant requires assistance, a trained HCP can help the participant to collect the nasal swabs. If 2 consecutive nasal swabs negative for SARS-CoV-2 are not available due to operational reasons (eg, delays in results availability) , participants may cease collection of nasal swabs and saliva samples after COVID-19 Day 29, provided they have 2 consecutive days with no COVID-19-related signs and symptoms. In these cases, participants may be asked to resume sample collection if nasal sample results—once available—do not present with 2 consecutive negative swabs for SARS-CoV-2. n. The nasal swab should be collected and pulse oximetry should be started as soon as possible after it has been confirmed that the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19 (Section 8.1.1) are met. o. For participants with suspected COVID-19, confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR or other molecular diagnostic test performed at a central laboratory will be used for the analysis of the case definition.

Participants with a Suspected AESI The medical management of thrombotic events with thrombocytopenia is different from the management of isolated thromboembolic diseases. Study site personnel and/or treating physicians should follow available guidelines for treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenia (eg, from the American Society of Hematology2, British Society of Haematology –Expert Haematology Panel10, and the CDC15) . The use of heparin may be harmful and alternative treatments may be needed. Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Management of the participant should not be delayed by decision-making of the AESI Adjudication Committee. In the event of a suspected thrombotic event or TTS, laboratory assessments (to be performed locally) are required to facilitate diagnosis and determine treatment options, including but not limited to platelet count and anti- platelet factor 4 (PF4)tests.

INTRODUCTION Ad26.COV2.S (previously known as Ad26COVS1) is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector, constructed to encode the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein. Unless clearly specified otherwise, this section presents information available at the time of the writing of the initial protocol, dated 22 July 2020. At that time, the Ad26.COV2.S Investigator’s Brochure (IB) Edition 1.0 and its Addendum 1 were in place.41,42 Information about the disease, correlates of immunity, and safety issues concerning this new pandemic-causing virus are rapidly evolving. Therefore, it is critical to recognize that the approach outlined in this document might or will change as insights and discussions evolve. For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding Ad26.COV2.S, refer to the latest version of the IB and its addenda (if applicable) for Ad26.COV2.S. The term “study vaccine” throughout the protocol, refers to Ad26.COV2.S or placebo as defined in Section 6.1. The term “sponsor” used throughout this document refers to the entities listed in the Contact Information page(s) , which will be provided as a separate document. The term “participant”throughout the protocol refers to the common term “subject.”The “unblinding visit” refers to the Month 6 visit that starts the open-label phase of the study, as described in Section 2.1. Study VAC31518COV3001 is being conducted under the sponsorship of Janssen (Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V) in collaboration with the COVID-19 Response Team (formerly known as OWS) , which also encompasses the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) , the National Institutes of Health (NIH) , and the COVID-19 Prevention Trials Network (COVPN) . COVID-19 Vaccine and Considerations Currently, there are no available vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) . The development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is considered critical to contain the current outbreak and help prevent future outbreaks. Although the quantitative correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been identified, neutralizing antibody responses against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) S protein have been associated with protection against experimental SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection in nonclinical models.22,78 Recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has several similarities to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage.48,50,79 Therefore, a neutralizing antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may also have a protective effect."

The adenoviral genome is well characterized and comparatively easy to manipulate. Adenoviruses exhibit broad tropism, infecting a variety of dividing and non-dividing cells. The adenoviral vaccine (AdVac®) vector platform, developed by Crucell Holland B.V. (now Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V.) allows for high-yield production of replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors, eg, Ad26, with desired inserts. The adenovirus E1 region is deleted to render the vector replication-incompetent and create space for transgenes, with viral replication taking place in cells that complement for the E1 deletion in the virus genome. Ad26 has been selected as a potential vaccine vector because there is substantial nonclinical and clinical experience with Ad26-based vaccines that demonstrate their capacity to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses and their acceptable safety profile, irrespective of the antigen transgene (see also Section 2.3.1) . The immunogenicity profile of adenoviral vectors is illustrated by data obtained following the immunization of adults with Ad26-vectored human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines (Ad26.ENVA.01, Ad26.Mos.HIV, and Ad26.Mos4.HIV) , an Ad26-vectored Ebola virus vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV) , Ad26-vectored respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines (Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad26.RSV.preF) , an Ad26-vectored Zika virus vaccine (Ad26.ZIKV.001) ,and an Ad26-vectored malaria vaccine (Ad26.CS.01) . Antigen-specific antibody responses are observed in almost all participants after 1 dose, in both naïve and pre-immune individuals (RSV) . These antibodies may persist for a year or more (RSV) after a single-dose in pre-immune participants. They have functional properties of neutralization (RSV, Zika) , crystallizable fragment (Fc) -mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (HIV, malaria) . Furthermore, these data support an immunogenicity profile with emphasis on T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) responses and demonstrate predominantly interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production in CD4+and CD8+T cells.4,43,53 Ad26.COV2.S Candidate Vaccine The aim of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical development program is to develop a safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19. The initial effort will be to rapidly demonstrate safety and immunogenicity in adults aged ≤55 years in study VAC31518COV1001, in order to initiate the efficacy study VAC31518COV3001 in this age group as soon as possible, and to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in older adults aged ≥65 years. The candidate vaccine to be assessed in this study is Ad26.COV2.S, which is a recombinant, replication-incompetent Ad26 encoding a prefusion stabilized variant of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The parental S protein sequence was derived from a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate (Wuhan, 2019; whole genome sequence NC_045512) . The selection of antigen was based on previous work on the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV candidate vaccines.22,33,54 The S protein is the major surface protein on coronaviruses and is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and mediating the fusion of host and viral membranes, thereby facilitating virus entry into the cell.81"

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on 11 March 2020.71,72 As of 1 June 2020, approximately 6, 680, 000 cases of COVID-19 and approximately 375, 000 COVID- 19-related deaths have been reported.44 Symptoms of infection may appear from 2 to 14 days following exposure, with the clinical manifestations ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness or death.11 Severe clinical presentations have been reported in as many as 20% to 25% of laboratory-confirmed cases.32 In a study of 99 patients in a single center in Wuhan with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) , the most commonly reported clinical manifestations were fever (83%) , cough (82%) , shortness of breath (31%) , and muscle aches (11%) .21 In chest X-rays and computed tomographic (CT) scans, 75% of patients showed bilateral pneumonia and 14% of patients showed diffuse mottling and ground-glass opacities. In a further study of 138 patients with novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia in a single center in Wuhan, common symptoms included fever (98.6%) , fatigue (69.6%) , and dry cough (59.4%) .64 Lymphopenia occurred in 70.3% of patients, and chest CT scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities in the lungs of all patients. Thirty-six patients (26%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, and shock. Subsequent United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) descriptions of COVID-19 clinical case definitions11 and Janssen-sponsored interviews with COVID-19-experienced clinicians have included signs and symptoms of respiratory distress such as blue lips, extreme shortness of breath and dyspnea, persistent cough, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) , Kawasaki-like disease, discoloration of feet and toes, chills, shaking chills, loss of sense of taste and smell, signs of stroke, disorientation, inability to respond or understand verbal communication, among others. At present, it appears that individuals aged ≥65 years, especially those with comorbid diseases, are subject to the highest incidence of morbidity and mortality.36In contrast, a study of 2, 143 children aged <18 years in China with laboratory-confirmed (34.1%) or suspected (65.9%) COVID-19"

A study of 149, 082 COVID-19 cases reported in the US was consistent with these findings.18 Only 1.7% of these cases occurred in persons aged <18 years although this age group accounts for 22% of the US population. Furthermore, relatively few pediatric COVID-19 cases were hospitalized, indicating that COVID-19 might have a mild course among younger patients. Hospitalization was most common among pediatric patients aged <1 year and those with underlying conditions. Recent (April-May 2020) reports describe several cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children with Kawasaki disease-like features (ie, fever, laboratory markers of inflammation, severe illness requiring hospitalization, multisystem organ involvement) . Most of these children had tested positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or were linked to a COVID-19 case. It is currently unknown if MIS is specific to children or if it may also occur in adults.13,69 The identification of SARS-CoV-2 follows the emergence of 2 other novel betacoronaviruses capable of causing severe human disease over the past 18 years: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 of approximately 79% and 50%, respectively.50 The first known cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Southern China in November 2002.73 The etiological agent, SARS-CoV, is believed to be an animal virus that crossed the species barrier to humans followed by human-to-human transmission, leading to SARS cases in >25 countries. The MERS-CoV was isolated from a patient in Saudi Arabia who died of severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure in June 2012.81 MERS-CoV is considered to be a zoonotic virus capable of nonsustained human-to-human transmission. Since 2012, sporadic cases and community and health-care-associated clusters of infected individuals have been reported in the Middle East. Patients with SARS or MERS present with various clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness to fulminant severe acute respiratory disease with extrapulmonary manifestations.20,81 Both diseases have predominantly respiratory manifestations, but extrapulmonary features may occur in severe cases. By July 2003, the international spread of SARS-CoV resulted in 8, 098 SARS cases and 774 deaths (case- fatality rate: 10%) with substantial social, economic and health service disruption in some affected countries.20,73 The case-fatality rate of MERS-CoV infections is estimated to be 35%.20 It is not known if SARS-CoV-2 will remain as a worldwide pandemic. It is also not known if immunity is acquired after symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and how long it might last. Currently, the only preventive measures that have been employed with some success have been social distancing and quarantine after contact tracing and testing. Test and treat approaches await an effective proven safe therapy that can be implemented on a mass scale. It is generally believed that an effective vaccine will be 1 of the most important tools to help control this highly contagious respiratory virus."

The S protein is the major surface protein of coronaviruses. Different animal models have been used for the evaluation of candidate coronavirus vaccines against SARS-CoV (2003 outbreak) , and the common conclusion that has emerged from the evaluation of several different vaccines is that the viral S protein is the only significant target for neutralizing antibodies11,61,77,80 and the only viral protein that can elicit protective immunity in animal models.6,7,12,60,75 Based on these findings, the S protein was selected as the sponsor’s candidate vaccine antigen. At the time of protocol Amendment 1 writing, initial immunogenicity and safety data (28 days post-Dose 1 data from Cohort 1a and available data from Cohort 3) from study VAC31518COV1001 have become available and demonstrate that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5×1010 virus particles (vp) and 1×1011 vp induces an immune response that meets prespecified minimum criteria and had an acceptable safety profile. These data support the sponsor’s decision to proceed with the single dose regimen at a 5×1010 vp dose level in this Phase 3 study. Vaccine-associated enhanced disease has been described in some animal models for SARS and MERS in which candidate vaccines induced a Th2 biased immune response,1,8,28,39,40 but proof of human SARS- or MERS-vaccine-associated enhanced disease does not exist as these candidate vaccines were never tested for efficacy nor used in outbreak situations. The Ad26 vector was chosen due to its ability to induce humoral and strong cellular responses with a Th1 immune phenotype.3,5,25,53,56,57,59,68,70,76 This type 1 polarity of the immune response is thought to minimize the risk of enhanced disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study VAC31518COV3001 will include ≥18- to <60-year-old participants and participants ≥60 years of age. Study VAC31518COV3001 will start with enrollment in Stage 1 (≥18- to <60-year-old participants) based on all available safety and reactogenicity data, and all relevant and available immunogenicity data from Cohort 1a (adults ≥18 to ≤55 years) of the first-in-human (FIH) study with the vaccine candidate (Ad26.COV2.S; study VAC31518COV1001; see Section 2.2) , immunogenicity data (including Th1 responses) from non-human primates (NHPs) , and efficacy in hamsters and NHPs and all other relevant data. Immunogenicity data from Cohort 1a of study VAC31518COV1001 will include virus neutralization assay (VNA) , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)and Th1/Th2 response data. Because the data from study VAC31518COV1001 (including data on elderly) demonstrated that Ad26.COV2.S at 5×1010 vp is both immunogenic and safe, Stage 2a (participants ≥60 years of age) of study VAC31518COV3001 will start enrolling in parallel to Stage 1a, unless this is not allowed per local Health Authority guidance. Within Stage 1a and Stage 2a, enrollment will be restricted to participants without comorbidities that are associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 as described below."

If no safety concerns are identified, enrollment will proceed, expanding enrollment to ≥18- to <60-year-old participants with and without comorbidities that are associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (Stage 1b) (see Section 1.2[Figure 1 ] for a schematic overview of the study and Section 5.2for the list of relevant comorbidities) . In parallelto Stage 1a, inStage 2 of the study, approximately2, 000 adults ≥60 years of age without comorbidities that are associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 will be enrolled (Stage 2a; including approximately 1, 000 Ad26.COV2.S recipients and approximately 1, 000 placebo recipients) . Following enrollment of these initial 2, 000 participants in Stage 2a, further vaccination in Stage 2 of the study will be paused to allow the DSMB to examine Day 3 safety data (ie, from Day 1 to Day 3; including safety data from Stage 1 and the ongoing clinical studies) . Upon confirmation that there are no safety concerns in this population or in the Stage 1 population up to that point, enrollment will proceed, including participants aged ≥60 years with and withoutcomorbidities that are associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID- 19 (Stage 2b) (see Section 1.2[Figure 1 ] for a schematic overview of the study and Section 5.2for the list of relevant comorbidities) . The total sample size for the study (including ≥18- to <60-year-old and ≥60-year-old participants, and participants with and without comorbidities that are associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19) will be approximately 40, 000 participants. It is intended that a minimum of approximately 30% of recruited participants will be ≥60 years of age and approximately 20% of recruited participants will be ≥18 to <40 years of age. Refer to Section 9.2.1for details about the sample size determination. Following EUA,conditional licensure,or approval in any country, a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S will be offered to enrolled participants who initially received placebo, where Amendment 4 is approved by the local Health Authority and IEC/IRB, resulting in de facto unblinding of participants and investigators. Of note, after the primary analysis, sponsor personnel except individuals directly in contact with study investigators are already unblinded according to the study protocol. All participants will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue to be followed for efficacy/effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity as originally planned up to 2 years after double-blind vaccination. This will allow assessment of the duration of protection and immunogenicity of a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S by comparing 2 groups vaccinated approximately 4 to 6 months apart.

Participants who choose to receive a booster vaccination with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (if recommended and available) or another authorized COVID-19 vaccine outside the study or choose not to receive a booster vaccination will not be withdrawn from the study and will be encouraged to remain in the study. Background Nonclinical Pharmacology Nonclinical studies were performed to test the immunogenicity of different vaccine candidates, leading to the selection of the current vaccine for this development program. In addition, VE of Ad26.COV2-S has been shown in Syrian hamsters and NHP. Details are provided in the IB.41,42 Nonclinical Safety Biodistribution To assess distribution, persistence, and clearance of the Ad26 viral vector platform, intramuscular (IM) biodistribution studies have been conducted in rabbits using an Ad26-based HIV vaccine, Ad26.ENVA.01, and an Ad26-based RSV vaccine, Ad26.RSV.preF. In the available biodistribution studies, the Ad26 vector did not widely distribute following IM administration in rabbits. Ad26 vector deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was primarily detected at the site of injection, draining lymph nodes and (to a lesser extent) the spleen. Clearance of the Ad26 vector from the tissues was observed. Both Ad26 vectors showed a comparable biodistribution despite carrying different antigen transgenes. These data further indicate that the Ad26 vector does not replicate and/or persist in the tissues following IM injection. These platform data are considered sufficient to inform on the biodistribution profile of Ad26.COV2.S for which the same Ad26 vector backbone is used. Toxicology The sponsor has significant nonclinical experience with Ad26-vectored vaccines using various transgenes encoding HIV, RSV, Ebola virus, filovirus, human papilloma virus, Zika, influenza (universal flu [Uniflu]) , and malaria antigens. To date, more than 10 Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) combined repeated dose toxicology and local tolerance studies have been performed in rabbits (and 1 study in rats) , testing the nonclinical safety of various homologous and heterologous regimens with Ad26-based vaccines at full human doses up to 1.2×1011 vp. No adverse effects have been observed in these studies. The vaccine-related effects observed were similar across studies, considered to be reflective of a physiological response to the vaccines administered, and seem to be independent of the antigen transgene. Overall, there were no safety signals detected in any of the available GLP toxicology studies with Ad26-based vaccines up to the highest dose tested (1.2×1011 vp) . In a combined embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development GLP study in female rabbits with another Ad26-based vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV, encoding an Ebola virus antigen) , there was no maternal or developmental toxicity observed following maternal exposure during the premating and gestation period.

Clinical Studies At the time of initial protocol writing, no clinical data with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine were available. As of 10 September 2020, a single injection of Ad26.COV2.S has been administered to 805 adult participants, aged 18 and older. The FIH study VAC31518COV1001 will be ongoing at the time of initiation of study VAC31518COV3001. Study VAC31518COV1001 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, Phase 1/2a multicenter study in adults aged ≥18 to ≤55 years and aged ≥65 years. The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S will be evaluated at 2 dose levels (5×1010 vp and 1×1011 vp) , administered IM as a single-dose or 2-dose schedule, with a single booster vaccination administered in 1 cohort. The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity will be evaluated in a cohort of adults aged ≥18 to ≤55 years (Cohort 1) . Safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity will also be evaluated in an expanded cohort in this age group (Cohort 2) . In addition, safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity will be evaluated in a cohort of adults aged ≥65 years (Cohort 3) .

Revised per VAC31518COV1001 protocol Amendment 6, dated 19 September 2020. N = number of participants; vp = virus particles. At the time of protocol Amendment 1 writing, initial immunogenicity and safety data (28 days post-Dose 1 data from Cohort 1a and available data from Cohort 3) from study VAC31518COV1001 have demonstrated that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5×1010 vp and 1×1011 vp induces an immune response that meets prespecified minimum criteria and had an acceptable safety profile. The sponsor has therefore decided to proceed with the single dose regimen at a 5×1010 vp dose level in this Phase 3 study.

As of 01 July 2020, Ad26-based vaccines had been administered to approximately 90, 000 participants in ongoing and completed studies, including more than 76, 000 participants in an ongoing Ebola vaccine study in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (VAC52150EBL3008/DRC-EB-001) and an ongoing immunization campaign in Rwanda (UMURINZI Ebola Vaccine Program campaign) . The sponsor’s clinical AdVac® safety database report (V5.0, dated 10 April 2020, cut-off date 20 December 2019) describes integrated safety data from 26 completed clinical studies using Ad26-based vaccines for which the database was locked for final analysis. In these 26 studies, 4, 224 adult participants were vaccinated with an Ad26-based vaccine and 938 adult participants received a placebo. A total of 6, 004 Ad26-based vaccine doses were administered to adults. Most adult participants (3, 557 out of 4, 224; 84.2%) received Ad26-based vaccine at a dose level of 5×1010 vp, while 284 adult participants (6.7%) received Ad26-based vaccine at the 1×1011 vp dose level (the highest dose level tested) . As of 01 July 2020, more than 85, 000 participants were enrolled in ongoing studies and the ongoing immunization campaign in Rwanda (UMURINZI Ebola Vaccine Program campaign) . However, their safety data were not included in the AdVac®safety database report V5.0 because the studies were still blinded, the studies were unblinded but their analysis took place after the AdVac®safety database report cut-off date,or the study data were not integrated in the Ad26-based vaccine database used for the report. Overall, the Ad26-based vaccines were well tolerated irrespective of the antigen transgene, without significant safety issues identified to date. See Section 2.3.1 for a summary of data from the AdVac®safety database report. Ad26-based V accines in Adults Aged 60 Y ears and Older In the RSV vaccine clinical development program, Ad26.RSV.preF has been evaluated in studies in participants aged ≥60 years, including the Phase 1 studies VAC18193RSV1003 and VAC18193RSV1005, Phase 1/2a study VAC18193RSV1004, Phase 2a study VAC18193RSV2003, and Phase 2b study VAC18193RSV2001. Up to a cut-off date of 24 April 2020, approximately 3, 700 participants aged ≥60 years have received an Ad26.RSV.preF-based regimen in completed and ongoing studies. An acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile in participants aged ≥60 years has been reported for the Ad26.RSV.preF-based regimens assessed in these studies, and no safety concerns have been raised to date.

For SARS and MERS, the mechanism of enhanced disease observed in mice has been associated with a Th2-mediated eosinophilic infiltration in the lung, which is reminiscent of ERD effects observed after RSV infection of mice immunized with FI RSV. Similar to RSV vaccines, enhanced disease has been shown for whole-inactivated SARS- CoV vaccines, as well as subunit vaccines inducing a Th2-type immune response, which can be rescued by formulating vaccines in Th1-skewing adjuvants. In addition to a Th1-biased immune response, also induction of a high proportion of neutralizing antibodies compared with virus binding antibodies is desirable to prevent predisposition to enhanced disease as observed for RSV vaccines. While vaccine-associated enhanced disease was observed in nonclinical studies with experimental SARS and MERS vaccines, it is not a given that the same risk applies to COVID-19 vaccines. To the sponsor’s knowledge, antibody-related COVID-19 disease enhancement has not been observed in nonclinical models yet. Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 were shown not to enhance in vitro infectivity. Repeated SARS-CoV-2 challenge of NHP or NHP studies with Th2 biasing COVID-19 vaccines that would be expected to predispose to enhanced disease did not show any signs of enhanced disease. In addition, disease enhancement was not observed in NHP immunized with ChAdOx1 encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein prior to challenge with SARS-CoV-2.42 The immunogenicity profile of adenoviral vectors, with particular emphasis on Th1 responses, is illustrated by data obtained from immunization of adults with Ad26-vectored HIV vaccines (Ad26.ENVA.01 and Ad26.Mos.HIV) and Ad26-vectored Ebola vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV) . These data show predominantly IFN-γ and TNF-α production in CD4+and CD8+T cells.3,4,5 In the RSV vaccine clinical development program, Ad26.RSV.preF is being evaluated in healthy RSV-seropositive toddlers aged 12 to 24 months (Phase 1/2a study VAC18194RSV2001) . Safety data from the PA at 28 days after the second study vaccination revealed no safety concerns following Ad26.RSV.preF dosing at 5×1010 vp or a placebo. The immunogenicity of a single immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF in RSV-seropositive toddlers aged 12 to 24 months, including favorable Th1 bias, was confirmed. In a further study of Ad26.RSV.preF in RSV-seronegative toddlers aged 12 to 24 months (Phase 1/2a study VAC18194RSV2002) , initial safety data have not revealed concerns after Ad26.RSV.preF dosing.

Risk s Related to Ad26.COV2.S No clinical data with Ad26.COV2.S are available at the time of finalization of the initial VAC31518COV3001 protocol. For emerging clinical data and the most comprehensive nonclinical information regarding Ad26.COV2.S, refer to the latest version of the IB and its addenda (if applicable) . Sites should advise participants that side effects include fever as well as injection site pain, headache, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea per the current ICF; however, the occurrence of fever appears to be more common in younger adults and can be severe. This is based on information from study VAC31518COV1001 that became available at the time of protocol Amendment 1 writing. Anaphylaxis is considered an important identified risk for Ad26.COV2.S. Individuals should be observed by a healthcare provider after vaccination per protocol requirements. Refer to the latest version of the IB and its addenda (if applicable) for further details. Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS]) , in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Reports include severe cases of venous thrombosis at unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) , splanchnic vein thrombosis and arterial thrombosis, in combination with thrombocytopenia. These cases occurred approximately 1-2 weeks following vaccination, mostly in women under 60 years of age. Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia can be fatal. The exact physiology of TTS is unclear. TTS is considered an important identified risk for Ad26.COV2.S. Participants should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain, severe or persistent headaches, blurred vision, and skin bruising and/or petechiae beyond the site of vaccination. The medical management of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia is different from the management of isolated thromboembolic diseases. Study site personnel and/or treating physicians should follow available guidelines for treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenia (eg,from the American Society of Hematology2, British Society of Haematology - Expert Haematology Panel10, and the CDC15) . The use of heparin may be harmful and alternative treatments may be needed. Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Management of the participant should not be delayed by decision-making of the AESI Adjudication Committee. Refer to the latest version of the IB and its addenda (if applicable) for further details. Due to the possibility of the occurrence of TTS after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, additional reporting and data collection procedures have been included in the study"

Risk s Related to Ad26.COV2.S Administration after Previous Vaccination Ad26.COV2.S Preliminary safety data of an Ad26.COV2.S booster administered at the 5×1010 vp dose level ≥6 months post-primary single-dose Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 vp) vaccination indicate that the safety and reactogenicity of a second Ad26.COV2.S dose is acceptable and in line with the safety and reactogenicity observed after the first Ad26.COV2.S dose. There is no indication of increased reactogenicity upon administration of a second dose of Ad26.COV2.S and no safety concerns have been observed. Risk s Related to Ad26.COV2.S Administration after Previous Vaccination with a Different COVID-19 Vaccine To date, no clinical data are available for Ad26.COV2.S vaccination after previous vaccination with a different COVID-19 vaccine. Risk s Related to Adenoviral-vectored Vaccines The clinical AdVac® safety database (report version 5.0, dated 10 April 2020, cut-off date 20 December 2019) contains pooled safety data from 26 Janssen-sponsored clinical studies with Ad26 vaccine candidates: Ad26.ZEBOV (Ebola; 10 studies) , Ad26.ENVA.01, Ad26.Mos.HIV and Ad26.Mos4.HIV (HIV; 8 studies) , Ad26.CS.01 (malaria; 1 study) , Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad26.RSV.preF (RSV; 6 studies) , and Ad26.Filo (filovirus; 1 study) . In these studies, 4, 224 adult participants and 650 children received at least 1 vaccination with an Ad26-based vaccine. The AdVac® safety database report includes data only from studies for which the database has been locked for the final analysis; therefore, of the studies including an Ad26.RSV.preF-based regimen mentioned in Section 2.2, only data for approximately 230 participants aged ≥60 years from studies VAC18193RSV1003, VAC18193RSV1005, and VAC18193RSV2003 were included. Overall, the Ad26-based vaccines were well tolerated, without significant safety issues identified. The majority of solicited local and systemic AEs were of mild or moderate severity and usually started within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. Most of the events resolved within 1 to 3 days. In adults, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was injection site pain (56.9% of Ad26 participants, compared with 22.5% of placebo participants) . All other solicited local AEs were experienced by less than 25% of adult participants. The most frequently experienced solicited local AE in children was injection site pain, reported in 13.9% of children aged 1-3 years, 29.8% of children aged 4 to 11 years, and 24.8% of children aged 12 to 17 years after vaccination with an Ad26-based vaccine. For placebo, these percentages were 29.2% in children aged 4 to 11 years and 14.3% in children aged 12 to 17 years. No children aged 1 to 3 years have received placebo."

No children in the other 2 age groups and no placebo participants experienced severe injection site pain. There was a trend toward an increase in the frequency of some local AEs with an increase in Ad26 dose, ie, injection site pain (18.7% of participants at the 0.8×1010 vp dose level, 38.7% of participants at the 2×1010 vp dose level, 52.0% of participants at the 5×1010 vp dose level, and 77.1% of participants at the 1×1011 vp dose level) , and to a lesser extent injection site swelling (6.7%, 2.7%, 9.3%, and 17.6%, respectively) . Injection site warmth was not collected at the 0.8×1010 vp and the 2×1010 vp dose level. The frequency of injection site warmth at the 5×1010 vp and the 1×1011 vp dose level was 19.5%, and 26.7%, respectively. This trend needs to be interpreted with caution since the participants in the lower dose groups (0.8×1010 vp and 2×1010 vp dose level) were all from a single study (VAC52150EBL3002) , and the majority of the participants in the highest dose group (1×1011 vp dose level) were also from a single study (VAC18193RSV2003) . The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs (ie, reported in more than 30% of participants) for adult Ad26 participants were malaise (53.8%) , fatigue (48.3%) , headache (45.7%) , and myalgia (38.3%) , all of which were more frequent for Ad26 participants compared with placebo (36.4%, 30.7%, 30.0%, and 17.7% of placebo participants, respectively) . Most of these events were considered related to the study vaccine. Pyrexia (9.9%) and vaccine-related pyrexia (9.0%) were also reported more frequently after administration of an Ad26-based vaccine compared with placebo (3.5% and 2.9%, respectively) . Solicited systemic AEs reported in ≥10% of children aged 1 to 3 years were decreased appetite (13.9%) , decreased activity (13.2%) , pyrexia (11.1%) , and irritability (10.4%) . The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs in children aged 4 to 11 years (reported in ≥15% of Ad26 participants) were headache (23.6%; no data are available for the placebo group in this age group) , and decreased activity (18.5%) and irritability (17.6%) , which were both reported in 4.2% (N=1) of placebo participants. The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs in children aged 12 to 17 years (reported in ≥15% of Ad26 participants) were headache (34.6%) and fatigue (24.0%) , compared to 33.3% and 19.0% of placebo participants, respectively. Most of the frequently experienced solicited systemic AEs in children were considered related to the study vaccine. The majority of solicited systemic AEs were of mild or moderate severity. For adults, 6.5% of Ad26 participants and 2.0% of placebo participants reported severe solicited systemic AEs, mostly malaise and fatigue. Other severe solicited systemic AEs were reported in less than 3% of adult Ad26 participants. There was a trend toward an increase in the frequency of solicited systemic AEs with an increase in Ad26 dose (35.3% at the 0.8×1010 vp dose level, 49.3% at the 2×1010 vp dose level, 64.5% at the 5×1010vp dose level, and 70.4% at the 1×1011vp dose level) . The frequency of severe solicited systemic AEs also tended to increase with higher Ad26 dose, ie, 1.3% of participants at the 0.8×1010 vp and the 2×1010 vp dose level, 5.3% of participants at the 5×1010 vp dose level, and"

This trend needs to be interpreted with caution since the participants in the lower dose groups (0.8×1010 vp and 2×1010 vp dose level) were all from a single study (VAC52150EBL3002) , and the majority of the participants in the highest dose group (1×1011 vp dose level) were also from a single study (VAC18193RSV2003) . The most frequently reported unsolicited AE in adult Ad26 participants was upper respiratory tract infection (5.3% vs. 7.0% in adult placebo participants) . The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs considered related to the vaccine were neutropenia (1.0% of adult Ad26 participants vs. 0.5% of adult placebo participants) and dizziness (0.7% vs. 0.2%, respectively) . For Ad26, the most frequently reported unsolicited AE in children was malaria,areported in 36.8% of children aged 1 to 3 years, in 19.0% of children aged 4 to 11 years, and in 10.6% of children aged 12 to 17 years. One child in the 12 to 17years group (4.8%) experienced malaria after placebo vaccination. There were no other children in the placebo groups who experienced malaria. The most frequently reported related unsolicited AE was hypernatremia (1.6% of children aged 4 to 11 years [vs. 4.2% with placebo] and 2.4% of children aged 12 to 17 years [vs. 4.8% with placebo]) . No AEs in children aged 1 to 3 years were considered related to the vaccine. General Risk s Related to Vaccination In general, IM injection may cause local itching, warmth, pain, tenderness, erythema/redness, induration, swelling, arm discomfort, or bruising of the skin. Participants may exhibit general signs and symptoms associated with IM injection of a vaccine and/or placebo, including fever, chills, rash, myalgia, nausea/vomiting, headache, dizziness, arthralgia, general itching, and fatigue. These side effects will be monitoredbutare generally short-term. Instructions regarding use of antipyretic medication can be found in Section 6.10. Syncope can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines. Syncope can be accompanied by falls. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury. If syncope develops, participants should be observed until the symptoms resolve. Fear of injection might lead to fainting and fast breathing. Participants may have an allergic reaction to the vaccination. An allergic reaction may cause a rash, urticaria, or even anaphylaxis (see above risks related to Ad26.COV2.S) . Severe reactions are rare. Participants with a known or suspected allergy, or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or their excipients (including specifically the excipients of the study vaccine) ,will be excluded from the study. After vaccination, participants will remain at the study site for close observation by study staffto monitor for the development of any acute reactions. The first 2, 000 participants in each of the 2 age groups will remain under observation at the study site for at least30 minutes after vaccination to monitor for the development of acute reactions. Ifat the time of the Day 3 safety review of the aT his was expected as the pediatric studies were conducted in malaria-endemic regions. The imbalance in the frequency of malaria between Ad26 participants and placebo participants can largely be explained by the fact that the active control group of study VAC52150EBL3001 was not included in the pooling."

Necessary emergency equipment and medications must be available in the study site to treat severe allergic reactions. Pregnancy and Birth Control The effect of the study vaccine on a fetus or on nursing baby is unknown. Given the limited number of incident pregnancies in the clinical studies with Ad26-based vaccines in the AdVac® safety database report (HIV vaccine: 20 pregnancies in participants and 10 in partners of participants; Ebola vaccine: 32 pregnancies in participants and 13 in partners of participants) , it is not possible at present to draw firm conclusions on the safety of the vaccines when administered around the time of conception or prior to the initiation of the pregnancies. There is currently no concerning pattern of AEs in the pregnancies initiated around the time of vaccination or after exposure to the Ad26-based vaccines in the Janssen vaccines clinical development programs. Participants of childbearing potential will be required to agree to practicing an acceptable effective method of contraception and agree to remain on such a method of contraception from providing consent until 3 months after receiving study vaccine (see Section 5.1) . Use of condoms is not considered as an acceptable contraceptive barrier method due to the failure rate of female and male condoms.19 Participants who are pregnant at screening will be excluded from the double-blind phase of the study. Participants who are pregnant at their Month 6/Unblinding Visit and received placebo during the double-blind phase, may be vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S if allowed by local regulations and if the investigator considers that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and fetus (see Section 6.4) . Participants who are pregnant may receive booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, if allowed by local regulations and if the investigator considers that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and fetus. Participants who become pregnant during the study will remain in the study and will continue to undergo all procedures for surveillance and follow-up of COVID-19 and all safetyfollow-up as outlined in the protocol for all participants. Participants who are breastfeeding are allowed to participate in the study. Risk s from Blood Draws Blood draws may cause pain, tenderness, bruising, bleeding, dizziness, vasovagal response, syncope, and rarely, infection at the site where the blood is taken. Risk s from Collection of Nasal Swab Samples Collection of a nasal swab sample may cause a nosebleed. Participants are asked to perform the nasal swab samples themselves at home or to seek assistance from a trained health care professional (HCP) . Assistance with the collection of nasal swab samples bears the risk of potentially infecting the assistant."

In contrast, the Ad26-based vaccines have been shown to induce a clear Th1-skewed immune response and generate potent neutralizing antibody responses in both humans and animal models (see Section 2.2) . Participants in the present study will be informed of the theoretical risk of disease enhancement in the informed consent form (ICF) . As a risk mitigation strategy, all enrolled participants will be intensively monitored during the conduct of the study to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 and refer for treatment, if applicable. In case of any new symptoms or health concerns that could be related to infection with SARS-CoV-2, participants will be evaluated for acquisition of molecularly confirmed COVID-19 and severity will be assessed using the case definitions specified in Section 8.1.3by the investigator. The subset of cases with potential for severe disease will be assessed by the Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee (see Section 8.1.3.6 ) , as part of the primary and secondary endpoints (see Section 3) . All participants will be monitored for safety (including enhanced disease) for approximately 1 year after the Year 1/ Booster Visit, ie, until the last study visit. In addition, as detailed in Section 9.8, the statistical support group (SSG) will monitor the number and severity of molecularly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups to identify an imbalance between groups if it occurs. The SSG will inform the DSMB as soon as an imbalance between groups is detected. A prespecified threshold (imbalance above a certain percentage and/or number of cases) that will trigger notification of the DSMB will be described in the SAP. Unk nown Risk s There may be other risks that are not known. If any significant new risks are identified, the investigators and participants will be informed. 2.3.2 Benefits of Study Participation Participants may benefit from clinical testing and physical examination. The efficacy, immunogenicity and safety data to date support a favorable benefit-risk profile for Ad26.COV2.S in the proposed indication, ie, active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in adults ≥18 years of age. The overall benefit and risk balance for individual participants is ongoing. Preliminary immunogenicity and safety data for a Ad26.COV2.S booster dose (5×1010 vp) at ≥6 months post-primary single-dose Ad26.COV2.S administration and efficacy data for a 2nddose of Ad26.COV2.S 2-3 months post-primary single-dose Ad26.COV2.S administration support a favorable benefit-risk profile. 2.3.3 Benefit-Risk Assessment of Study Participation Based on the available data and proposed safety measures, the overall benefit-risk assessment for this clinical study is considered acceptable for the following reasons:"

The selection criteria include adequate provisions to minimize the risk and protect the well-being of participants in the study.  Safety will be closely monitored throughout the study:  In general, safety evaluations will be performed at scheduled visits during the study, as indicated in the Schedules of Activities .  The first 2, 000 participants in each of the 2 age groups will remain under observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes after vaccination to monitor for the development of acute reactions. If at the time of the Day 3 safety review of the initial 2, 000 participants no acute reactions have been observed in the age groups, the observation period at the study site may be reduced to at least 15 minutes for the remaining participants in the study. Necessary emergency equipment and medications must be available in the study site to treat severe allergic reactions. Participants in the Safety Subset will use an e-Diary to document solicited signs and symptoms. Details are provided in Section 8.3.  The investigator or the designee will document unsolicited AEs for participants in the Safety Subset, and SAEs and medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs) for all participants as indicated in Section 8.3and Appendix 4 .  Suspected AESIs (thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia [defined as platelet count below 150, 000/µL]9) must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. From the time of local approval of protocol Amendment 5 onwards, TTS is considered an AESI (Section 8.3.7) . Suspected AESIs will be followed up as described in the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3.3. Refer to Section 10.14Appendix 14 for a list of thrombotic events to be reported to the sponsor as suspected AESIs.  Any clinically significant abnormalities (including those persisting at the end of the study/early withdrawal) will be followed by the investigator until resolution or until clinically stable.  A DSMB will be established to monitor safety data on an ongoing basis to ensure the continuing safety of the participants enrolled in this study. This committee will review interim unblinded data. The DSMB responsibilities, authorities, and procedures will be documented in the DSMB Charter. The DSMB will also review Day 3 safety data (ie, from Day 1 to Day 3; including safety data from the ongoing clinical studies) from participants enrolled in Stages1a and Stage 2a, before enrollment of participants in Stages 1b and Stage 2b, respectively. Additional ad hoc review may be performed further to the occurrence of any SAE leading to a study pausing situation as outlined in Section 6.11, or at request of the sponsor’s medical monitor or designee. During the open-label phase, the DSMB will continue to monitor safety.  Several safety measures are included in this protocol to minimize the potential risk to participants, including the following:  The study will use the following enrollment strategy to mitigate the risks for participants at increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19:"

STUDY DESIGN Overall Design This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,Phase 3,pivotal efficacy and safety study in adults ≥18 to <60 years of age and ≥60 years of age. The efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S will be evaluated in participants living in, or going to, locations with high risk for acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection after administration of study vaccine. Following EUA,conditional licensure,orapproval in any countryfor a single dose regimen, based on the VAC31518COV3001 study interim results, all participants from countries where protocol Amendment 4 is approved by the local Health Authority and IEC/IRB will be unblinded at the on- site Month 6/Unblinding Visit. The study will then be conducted in an open-label fashion. A final analysis of the double-blind phase will be performed, using the data collected prior to unblinding, when all participants have completed the Month 6/Unblinding Visit or discontinued earlier. Depending on the operational implementation of the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, as well as the stage"

All participants will be invited for an on-site Month 6/Unblinding Visit and will undergo the procedures in the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3.1. Participants who initially received placebo in the double-blind phase and consent will receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine under the conditions delineated in Section 6.4. Initial immunogenicity and safety data (28 days post-Dose 1 data from Cohort 1a and available data from Cohort 3) from study VAC31518COV1001 have demonstrated that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5×1010 vp and 1×1011 vp induces an immune response that meets prespecified minimum criteria and had an acceptable safety profile. The sponsor has therefore decided to proceed with the single dose regimen at a 5×1010 vp dose level in this Phase 3 study. With protocol Amendment 6, the open-label phase of the study is extended to include an open- label booster vaccination with a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at the Year 1/Booster Visit (see also below) . The combination of homologous or heterologous prime/boost vaccination will not be randomized, but depends on what participants received during the double-blind phase of the study as described in this protocol. The start date of the first crossover unblinding visit (implemented with Amendment 4) and the date of first booster vaccine administration until 1-year follow-up of the last booster vaccination define the open-label booster vaccination phase of the study. This phase will be utilized to describe safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy during the time participants have and have not been boosted. The observational open-label booster vaccination phase of the study will be analyzed separately and analysis of the data is planned to be performed 6 months and 1 year after all participants were offered the booster vaccination. The study will consist of a screening phase of up to 28 days, a 62-week study period (including the administration of 1 dose of study vaccine [on Day 1], after randomization, unblinding and, for consenting participants, cross-over vaccination at the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, and, for consenting participants, Ad26.COV2.S booster vaccination at the Year 1/Booster Visit) , and a long-term follow-up period until the Year 2 Visit (52 weeks after the Year 1/Booster Visit) . The duration of individual participation, including screening, will be approximately 2 years and 1 month. If a participant is unable to complete the study, but has not withdrawn consent, an early exit visit will be conducted. The end-of-study is considered as the completion of the last visit for the last participant in the study. Participants will be randomized in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive Ad26.COV2.S or placebo intramuscularly (IM) as shown in Table 2 . Ad26.COV2.S will be administered at a dose level of 5×1010 vp. At the Month 6/UnblindingVisit, participants who initially received placebo and signed a new ICF will be offered a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5×1010 vp. As of implementation of protocol Amendment 6, all ongoing participants in the study who have previously received any COVID-19 vaccination(s) (as primary regimen or additional dose) with"

Participants who received placebo on Day 1 will be offered to receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp under conditions delineated in Section 6.4. Investigators are encouraged to consider current local public health guidance for determining the scheduling priority of participants when feasible, eg, participants with co-morbidities and/or of specific age groups can be scheduled prior to participants without co-morbidities if this is in line with local guidance. This should be done in a blinded way,ensuring that participants who were not previously unblinded for other reasons are not unblinded until the Month 6/Unblinding Visit. The following enrollment strategy will be used in the double-blind phase:  Stage 1a: Initially, approximately 2, 000 participants (≥18- to <60-year-old) without comorbidities that are associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (including approximately 1, 000 Ad26.COV2.S recipients and approximately 1, 000 placebo recipients) will be enrolled based on acceptable Day 29 safety and acceptable immunogenicity data, including Th1/Th2, from the corresponding age group (Cohort 1a) of the FIH study VAC31518COV1001 (see Section 2.2for more details) .  Stage 1b: After a vaccination pause (in the age group ≥18 to <60 years of age) , to allow the DSMB (also known as an independent data monitoring committee [IDMC]) to examine Day 3 safety data(ie, from Day 1 to Day 3; including safety data from the ongoing clinical studies) from Stage 1a, if no safety concerns are identified enrollment will proceed, expanding enrollment to include ≥18- to <60-year-old participants with and without comorbidities that are associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (see Section 1.2 [Figure 1 ] for a schematic overview of the study and Section 5.2 for the list of relevant comorbidities) . In Stage 1, the enrollment of participants aged ≥18 to <40 years will be limited to approximately 20% of the total study population.  Stage 2a: Initially, approximately 2, 000 participants ≥60 years of age without comorbidities that are associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 will be enrolled (including approximately 1, 000 Ad26.COV2.S recipients and approximately 1, 000 placebo recipients) . Considering the data from study VAC31518COV1001 (including data on elderly) , Stage 2a will be enrolled in parallel with Stage 1a, unless this is not allowed per local Health Authority guidance."

Stage 2 will enroll a minimum of approximately 30% of the total study population. Overall, a target ofapproximately 40, 000 adult participants (≥18- to <60-year-old and ≥60-year- old, with and without relevant comorbidities)will be randomly assigned in this study. Efforts will be made to ensure good representation in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender. All participants will be actively and passively followed for acute molecularly confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19, regardless of severity. Molecularly confirmed COVID-19 is defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA result by a central laboratory using a RT-PCR based or other molecular diagnostic test. The primary objective will be evaluated in real-time manner through sequential testing of accumulating primary endpoints through the SSG and DSMB. Only if both co-primary endpoints have crossed the sequential boundary, the DSMB will discuss the signal with the Oversight Group. As soon as a decision is reached, the sponsor representative on the Oversight Group will initiate internal decision procedures to trigger health authority interactions based on the outcome of the study. Sponsor personnel will be unblinded at the time of the primary analysis. If an efficacy signal is triggered before the required 8-week follow-up after double-blind vaccination for 50% of participants is reached, selected sponsor personnel will be unblinded at the time of the snapshot analysis. Further details are described in Section 9.5.1. In the open-label phase, participants who initially received placebo and consent will receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. No additional participants will be recruited for the open-label phase. Key efficacy assessments include the surveillance for COVID-19-like signs and symptoms, recording of COVID-19-related hospitalizations and complications, and the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a molecular assay (based on RT-PCR) and by anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology (see Section 8.1.2) . Immunogenicity assessments, and especially assessments of the humoral immune responses with emphasis on neutralizing and binding antibodies will also be performed (see Section 8.1.4) . Key safety assessments during the double- blind phase will include the monitoring of solicited and unsolicited AEs in the Safety Subset only. All participants who received booster vaccination at the Year 1/Booster Visit will record solicited signs and symptoms, collected through an e-Diary. For a subset of participants, the e-Diary will be reviewed by the investigator at the next visit, if feasible. Unsolicited AEs will be recorded for all participants who received booster vaccination at the Year 1/Booster Visit. In addition, key safety assessments throughout the study include the collection of SAEs and MAAEs in all participants. (see Section 8.3) .

Medical resource utilization (MRU) following vaccination will be recorded for all participants with molecularly confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 (see Section 8.6) . Additional characteristics related to current work situation, living situation, and community interactions, from participants who consent to this, will be collected for risk factor analysis, if allowed per local regulations. Participants who consent to this will be interviewed on these aspects prior to vaccination on Day 1 and, at other timepoints, on changes compared to Day 1 (See Appendix 12 ) . For consenting participants in the US, medical data (electronic health records, claims, laboratory data from other settings) from 5 years prior to study enrollment until 5 years after study completion may be accessed utilizing tokenization and matching procedures (See Section 4.2 and Section 8.8) . These data together with prior medical history data collected at study entry may be used for exploratory analyses to enhance our understanding of the potential impact of prior medical history on the response to immunization and the impact of immunization on efficacy and duration of efficacy as well as adverse events that may occur during and after completion of the study. The first 2, 000 participants in each of the 2 age groups will be closely observed at the study site for at least30 minutes post-vaccination to monitor for the development of acute reactions. If at the time of the Day 3 safety review of the initial 2, 000 participants no acute reactions have been observed in the age groups, the observation period at the study site may be reduced to at least 15 minutes post-vaccination for the remaining participants in the study. For participants in the Safety Subset, solicited local (at injection site) and systemic AEs, unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and concomitant therapies will be documented by study-site personnel following this observation period. Participants in the Safety Subset (double-blind phase) will also record solicited signs and symptoms in an e-Diary for 7 days post-vaccination. The reporting periods of unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, and special reporting situations are detailed in Section 8.3. Reporting periods for concomitant therapy are outlined in Section 6.10. All participants will be followed-up until approximately 1 year post the Year 1/Booster Visit to monitor for signs and symptoms ofCOVID-19 (to determine duration of protection) and to monitor for safety (including enhanced disease) . The approach for the analysis of this long-term follow-up cohort for safety and VE will be provided in detail in the analytic plan. Participants in the Immunogenicity Subset will additionally be followed-up for long-term immunogenicity. Participants will also be monitored for complications potentially associated with COVID-19 (such as but not limited to hyperinflammatory syndrome, pneumonia, neurological or vascular complications, severe pneumonia, severe neurological or vascular events, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal complications, sepsis, septic shock, death)71, and for MRU (such as rates of ICU admission, ventilator use) . Until 1 year after the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, each participant will be asked at least twice a week, through the electronic clinical outcome assessment (eCOA) , if they have experienced any new symptoms or health concerns that could be related to infection with SARS-CoV-2. As of 1-year after the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, until the end of the 2-year follow-up period, the frequency of this surveillance question through the eCOA may decrease to once every 2 weeks depending on epidemology.

Every effort will be made to document the status ofall participants that are lost to follow-up due to not completing the eCOA and for whom hospitalization has not been recorded. Enrolled participants will be counselled on SARS-COV-2 infection prevention each time that they have a contact with site staff, in line with local guidelines. At the time of study entry, each participant will need to indicate to the study site, in case they would get infected with SARS-CoV-2,the identity and location of their routine medical care physician and/or facility and the identity and location of where they would obtain emergency care and hospitalization if necessary. If this information is not available, a plan for where such care could be obtained should be developed. If a participant should have COVID-19 and their symptoms deteriorate, they will be instructed to go to the HCP or hospital that has been identified in advance. Any positive RT-PCR test regardless if it is obtained outside the study or at a study visit will be considered a trigger to start COVID-19 procedures. All participants with COVID-19-like signs or symptoms meeting the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19a (see Section 8.1.1) and all participants with at least one positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on COVID-19 Day 1-2 or Day 3-5 visits, should undertake the COVID-19 procedures (see Section 8.1.2 and Section 1.3) until 14 days after symptom onset (COVID-19 Day 15) or until resolution of the COVID-19 episode, whichever comes last. However, participants with COVID-19-like signs or symptoms meeting the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19ashould stop the COVID-19 procedures as soon as it is confirmed that both nasal swabs collected on COVID-19 Day 1-2 and Day 3-5 are negative for SARS-CoV-2. Resolution of the COVID-19 episode is defined as having 2 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 negative nasal swabs and 2 consecutive days with no COVID-19- related signs or symptoms. At the time of resolution of the COVID-19 episode, the collected information will be applied against the clinical case definition (Sections 8.1.3.1 , 8.1.3.2 , and 8.1.3.3) . Site staff and participants will not be blinded as to the outcome of the molecular test results from the local (hospital) laboratory and the baseline molecular test results from the central laboratory. Their routine HCP can obtain external diagnostics, including RT-PCR or other molecularly confirmed viral tests, as medically needed. The occurrence of molecularly confirmed COVID-19, all complications associated with COVID-19, and concomitant therapies associated with COVID-19 will be captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF) for the duration of the study. Every effort will be made to capture medical information from any medical visits (eg, visits to the primary care providers, emergency department/urgent care clinic visits, etc.) related to COVID-19 or its complications via the medically-attended COVID-19 form (MA-COV form) (see Appendix 8 ) . a A s several of the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19 overlap with vaccine-related reactogenicity, investigators' clinical judgement is required to exclude vaccine-related events when assessing suspected COVID- 19."

Additional study procedures and assessments for immunogenicity and safety (reactogenicity and unsolicited AE) will be performed in subsets of participants (see Section 8.1.4and Section 8.3) . A DSMB will be commissioned for this study. Refer to Section 9.8 and Appendix 3 for more details. A diagram of the study design is provided in Section 1.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design Vector Selection The rationale behind the selection of the Ad26 vector is described in Section 2. Dose Selection The rationale behind the selection of the dose is described in Section 4.3. Blinding, Control, Study Phase/Periods, Vaccine Groups A placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in clinical and immunological endpoints that may occur in the absence of active vaccine. Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of participantsto vaccinegroups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown participant attributes (eg,demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across vaccine groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across vaccine groups. Blinded study vaccine will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of study endpoints. Blinding will be guaranteed by the preparation of the study vaccine by an unblinded pharmacist or other qualified study-site personnel with primary responsibility for study vaccine preparation and dispensing, and by the administration of vaccine in a masked syringe by a blinded study vaccine administrator. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the groups based on a computer- generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by or under the supervision of the sponsor and using the interactive web response system (IWRS) (see also Section 6.3) . When EUA, conditional licensure,orapproval is granted in any country and upon implementation of protocol Amendment 4, all participants will be invited for an on-site Month 6/Unblinding Visit and will be unblinded at that visit. Participants who initially received placebo, will be offered to receive a single dose of Ad26.COV.2 vaccine. All participants will be requested to provide a blood sample and nasal swab, which will require a new informed consent."

Medical Resource Utilization Data Collection Prophylaxis of COVID-19 with Ad26.COV2.S may reduce the need for and duration of supportive care (eg, hospitalization, oxygen supplementation) . The study will evaluate the impact of Ad26.COV2.S versus placebo on the development and clinical course of COVID-19. Participant Medical Information Prior to, During and After the Study (Real-world Data) Real-world data plays a critical role in improving understanding of factors that may influence response to immunization and the effectiveness and safety of a vaccine product during and after completion of the study. This may be important to gain insight into duration of efficacy and incidence of adverse events after study completion. This may be especially important in the event that efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S or another vaccine is shown and follow-up in a randomized manner is compromised. To allow the linking of participant records from different sources, ie, data collected as part of the study as specified in the Schedules of Activities and longitudinal real-world data (from 5 years prior to enrollment in the study until 5 years after study completion) such as electronic health records, claims, and laboratory data from other care settings, without compromising the participant’s confidentiality, tokenization and matching procedures will be utilized for US participants only . The tokenization process starts with each data provider generating a token behind the firewall via a proprietary software. Personal information such as names and dates of birth from study participants are removed from real-world data sources and replaced with encrypted, one-way, hashed identifiers then further encrypted using asymmetric keys in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) .62 This encrypted anonymized information is sent for matching to the anonymized participant master index. While it is not possible to reverse the hash, source-specific tokens can be decrypted and re-encrypted so that records can be linked across sources. The result of the process is a unique anonymized identifier for each participant, which can be used to link participant records across sources (real world data and study data) . 4.2.1. Study-Specific Ethical Design Considerations Potential participants will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study and, during the study, participants will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue participation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalty or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Only participants who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and potential AEs of the study, and provide their consent voluntarily will be enrolled."

See Section 2.3 for details on potential and known benefits and risks, and for the safety measures taken to minimize risk to participants. Another ethical concern is the use of placebo vaccine and maintaining the study blind during the double-blind phase of the study while the active study vaccine may prevent a serious disease. The study design, with continuous evaluation of efficacy, addresses that concern as much as possible. The sponsor will offer the active study vaccine to placebo recipients, with the implementation of Amendment 4. See Section 6.8for details. In addition, the sponsor will offer a single booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (5×1010 vp) at the Year 1/Booster Visit booster to all ongoing participants who have previously received any COVID-19 vaccination(s) (as primary regimen or additional dose) with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and/or an mRNA vaccine or another for primary vaccination authorized COVID-19 vaccine including protein, inactivated, and adenovector based vaccines with the implementation of Amendment 6. The total blood volume to be collected is considered to be an acceptable amount of blood to be collected over this time period from the population in this study based upon the US Department of Health and Human Services Office for Human Research Protections, and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines of 550 mL in any 8-week period.64 For participants in the US who consent to the optional collection of real-world medical data, the sponsor is committed to protect their data and privacy. Tokenization and matching procedures will be utilized to allow for those participant’s medical data to be obtained without violation of participant confidentiality (See Section 4.2) . Participants will be informed that consent to this part of the study is completely optional and that they can withdraw their consent at any given time. In case of withdrawal of consent, the sponsor will remove the token generated and any associated linked real-world data. Participation in or withdrawal from this optional part of the study will not affect the participation in the main study. Justification for Dose The dose level of Ad26.COV2.S to be assessed in the present study (5×1010 vp) is based on experience with other Ad26-vectored vaccines administered to adults in clinical studies including Ad26.ZEBOV (Ebola virus program) ; Ad26.ENVA.01, Ad26.Mos.HIV, and Ad26.Mos4.HIV (HIV program) ; Ad26.CS.01 (malaria program) ; Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad26.RSV.preF (RSV program) ; and Ad26.ZIKV.001 (Zika virus program) . Studies with Ad26.RSV.preF also included participants aged ≥60 years. The dose level of 5×1010 vp is the most extensively tested dose to date and has shown to be well tolerated and immunogenic in these vaccine programs. Safety data from studies with other Ad26-based vaccines are summarized in Section 2.3.1. The same dose level is also being assessed in study VAC31518COV1001, where initial immunogenicity and safety data (28 days post-Dose 1 data from Cohort 1a and available data from Cohort 3) have demonstrated that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5×1010 vp and 1×1011 vp"

The sponsor has therefore decided to proceed with the single dose regimen at a 5×1010 vp dose level in this Phase 3 study. Non-human primates immunized with a single-dose of Ad26.COV2.S (Study 20-14, dose level titration study) showed robust protection after intranasal and intratracheal challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S at 5×1010 vp provided complete protection in the lung in 5 of 5 animals, and in 5 of 6 animals in the upper respiratory tract. All control animals showed substantial viral load in both the lower and upper respiratory tract. End-of-study Definition End-of-study Definition The end-of-study is considered as the completion of the last visit for the last participant in the study. The final data from each participating study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion of the final participant visit at that study site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement. Study Completion Definition A participant will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed the assessments at the visit approximately 104 weeks after double-blind vaccination. Participants who prematurely discontinue study participation for any reason before completion of these assessments will not be considered to have completed the study. 5. STUDY POPULATION Screening for eligible participants will be performed within ≤28 days before randomization and administration of the study vaccine, or on the day of the vaccination. Refer to Section 5.4 for conditions under which the repeat of any screening procedures are allowed. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolling participants in this study are described below. Some inclusion and exclusion criteria only apply to a particular stage (1a, 1b, 2a, and/or 2b) , as indicated below. See Section 4.1for more details about enrollment in the different stages. If there is a question about these criteria, the investigator must consult with the appropriate sponsor representative and resolve any issues before enrolling a participant in the study. Waivers are not allowed. Once enrolled, all participants who receivedplacebo during the double-blind phase will be eligible to receive vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at the Month 6/Unblinding Visit if they agree and consent to receive the active vaccine and meet the criteria described in Section 6.4. As of Amendment 6, all ongoing participants who have previously received any COVID-19 vaccination(s) (as primary regimen or additional dose)with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, and/or an mRNA vaccine or another COVID-19 vaccine authorized for primary vaccination including protein, inactivated, and adenovector based vaccines will be eligible to receive a 1-dose booster"

Screen Failures Participant Identification, Enrollment, and Screening Logs The investigator agrees to complete a participant identification and enrollment log to permit easy identification of each participant during and after the study, however, without referring to direct communication with participants. This document will be reviewed by the sponsor study-site contact for completeness. The participant identification and enrollment log will be treated as confidential and will be filed by the investigator in the study file. To ensure participant confidentiality, no copy will be made. All reports and communications relating to the study will identify participants by participant identification and age at initial informed consent. In cases where the participant is not randomized into the study,the date seen and age at initial informed consent will be used. In cases where a participant does not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) , the main reason for non-eligibility is to be documented in the eCRF. An individual who does not meet the criteria for participation in Stages 1a or 2a, but does meet the criteria for participation in Stages 1b or 2b, will not be considered a screening failure and can be enrolled in the appropriate stage, if enrollment occurs within the 28-day Screening window. An individual who does not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) or individuals for whom the 28-day screening window is exceeded may be rescreened on 1 occasion only. All participants who are rescreened will be assigned a new participant number, undergo the informed consent process, and then re-start a new screening phase.

If, at the start of the double-blind phase, any of these events occur at the scheduled time for the vaccination, randomization at a later date within the screening window is permitted at the discretion of the investigator and after consultation with the sponsor. If randomization cannot occur within the screening window, rescreening is required. If, at the start of the open-label phase, any of the above listed events occur at the scheduled time for the vaccination, the Month 6/Unblinding Visitwith active vaccine can be delayedup to 28 days following unblinding. In addition, a urine pregnancy test (for participants of childbearing potential, according to the local guidelines) will be required for the Month 6/Unblinding Visitfor participants who will be vaccinated at this visit. Participants who are pregnant at the Month 6/Unblinding Visit and received placebo during the double-blind phase may be vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S, if allowed by local regulations, and if the investigator considers that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and fetus (See Section 6.4) . If any of the above listed events occur at the scheduled time for the booster vaccination, the Year 1/Booster Visit with active vaccine can be delayed within the preferred visit window. In addition, a urine pregnancy test (for participants of childbearing potential, according to the local guidelines) will be required for the Year 1/Booster Visit for participants who will be vaccinated at this visit. Participants who are pregnant at the Year 1/Booster Visit may receive booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, if allowed by local regulations, and if the investigator considers that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and fetus (see Section 6.5) . 6.

If study vaccine is exposed to temperatures outside the specified temperature range, all relevant data will be sent to the sponsor to determine if the affected supplies can be used or will be replaced. The affected study vaccine must be quarantined and not used until further instruction from the sponsor is received. Refer to the study SIPPM and the IPPI for additional guidance on study vaccine preparation, handling, and storage. In the double-blind phase, an unblinded study-site pharmacist, or other qualified individual, who will have no other study function following vaccination, will prepare the appropriate vials and syringes, labeled with the participant’s identification number, and provide the syringes for the study vaccine in a blinded manner to the blinded vaccine administrator (a trained and qualified study nurse, medical doctor, or otherwise qualified HCP) who will perform the injection. At the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, all participants will be unblinded to their study vaccine allocation. Participants, who initially received placebo, will be of fered to receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Vaccination at the Month 6/Unblinding Visit will be performed by a trained and qualified study nurse, medical doctor, or otherwise qualified HCP.

Vaccination at the Year 1/Booster Visit will be performed by a trained and qualified study nurse, medical doctor, or otherwise qualified HCP. Accountability The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study vaccine received at the site is inventoried and accounted for throughout the study. The study vaccine administered to the participant must be documented on the vaccine accountability form. All study vaccine will be stored and disposed of according to the sponsor’s instructions. Study-site personnel must not combine contents of the study vaccine containers. Study vaccine must be handled in strict accordance with the protocol and the container label and must be stored at the study site in a limited-access area or in a locked cabinet under appropriate environmental conditions. Unused study vaccine must be available for verification by the sponsor’s unblinded site monitor during on-site monitoring visits. The return to the sponsor of unused study vaccine will be documented on the vaccine accountability form. When the study site is an authorized destruction unit and study vaccine supplies are destroyed on-site, this must also be documented on the vaccine accountability form. Potentially hazardous materials containing hazardous liquids, such as needles and syringes should be disposed of immediately in a safe manner and therefore will not be retained for vaccine accountability purposes."

Study vaccine will be administered only to participants participating in the study. Returned study vaccine must not be dispensed again, even to the same participant. Study vaccine may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by other participants. The investigator agrees neither to dispense the study vaccine from, nor store it at, any site other than the study sites agreed upon with the sponsor. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study vaccine are provided in the SIPPM. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding Intervention Allocation Procedures f or Randomization and Stratif ication Central randomization will be implemented in this study in the double-blind phase. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 vaccination groups (active vaccine [Group 1] versus placebo [Group 2]) . This will be based on a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by or under the supervision of the sponsor. The randomization will be balanced by using randomly permuted blocks and will be stratified by vaccination unit (eg, site, mobile unit) , age group (≥18 to <60 years of age versus ≥60 years of age) , and absence/presence of comorbidities that are or might be associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 as described in Exclusion Criterion 15. The IWRS will assign a unique intervention code, which will dictate the intervention assignment for the participant. The requestor must use his or her own user identification and personal identification number when contacting the IWRS and will then give the relevant participant details to uniquely identify the participant. Blinding: Double-blind Phase Blinding will be guaranteed by the preparation of the study vaccine by an unblinded pharmacist or other qualified study-site personnel with primary responsibility for study vaccine preparation and dispensing, and by the administration of vaccine in a masked syringe by a blinded study vaccine administrator. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the groups based on a computer- generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by or under the supervision of the sponsor and using the IWRS. The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained within the IWRS, which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an individual participant. Data that may potentially unblind the study vaccine assignment (ie, immunogenicity data, study vaccine accountability data, study vaccine allocation, biomarker, or other specific laboratory data) will be handled with special care to ensure that the integrity of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This can include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by the investigators, clinical team, or others as appropriate until the time of database lock and unblinding."

Note thatsponsor personnelwill be unblinded at the time of primary analysis. Sites and participants will remain blinded until the Month 6/Unblinding Visit. Details will be provided in the DSMB Charter. The investigator may in an emergency determine the identity of the intervention by contacting the IWRS. While the responsibility to break the intervention code in emergency situations resides solely with the investigator, it is recommended that the investigator contact the sponsor or its designee if possible, to discuss the particular situation, before breaking the blind. Telephone contact with the sponsor or its designee will be available 24 hours per day, 7days per week. In the event the blind is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, time, and reason for the unblinding must be documented in the IWRS and in the source document. The documentation received from the IWRS indicating the code break must be retained with the participant’s source documents in a secure manner. Participants who have had their intervention assignment unblinded should continue to return for scheduled safety evaluations. In general, randomization codes will be disclosed fully only at the Month 6/Unblinding Visit. In the double-blind phase of the study, investigators may receive requests to unblind study participants who become eligible to receive an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine if/when these become available. In these cases, the investigator will discuss with the participant available options and ramifications. If the participant is eligible for an authorized/licensed vaccine according to local immunization guidelines or recommendation and if the participant wishes to proceed with the unblinding, the investigator will follow the unblinding procedures described above. The reason for the unblinding request should be documented. The name and date(s) of administration of the other COVID-19 vaccine should be recorded (see Section 6.10) . When unblinding, if it is determined that the participant received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (and not placebo) , the participant will be informed that there are no data on the safety of receiving two different COVID-19 vaccines. Unblinded participants, both in the double-blind and open-label phase will be asked to continue to be followed in this study in line with the Schedule of Activities to the extent that they permit. Safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity evaluations will be identical for all participants, including participants that are unblinded to obtain an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine and who remain in the study, including participants in the Safety Subset, if applicable and feasible. All data will be analyzed separately from the point of unblinding for safety, efficacy,and immunogenicity, as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Prior to EUA, conditional licensure, or approval in any country, participants who opt for enrollment in an Expanded Access Program or a Phase 3b study (eg, Sisonke/TOGETHER in South Africa) may be unblinded upon their request and will be encouraged to continue in study VAC31518COV3001.

This should be done in a blinded way, ensuring that participants who were not previously unblinded for other reasons are not unblinded until the Month 6/Unblinding Visit. All participants will be counselled to continue practicing other public health/preventative measures that were introduced at the start of this pandemic (eg, social distancing, face masks, frequent hand washing) , in compliance with local and national guidelines. Participants who receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. will continue to follow the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3.1. Booster Vaccination All ongoing participants in the study who have received primary vaccination with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, or an mRNA vaccine or another authorized COVID-19 vaccine including protein, inactivated, and adenovector based vaccines and who have subsequently remained in the study will be offered to receive a 1-dose booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at the 5x1010 vp dose level. Participants who have only received one dose of a two dose primary immunization regimen are also eligible to receive the booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in this study. Participants in the study who have already received an additional COVID-19 vaccination after the primary regimen outside the study with any vaccine as described above will also be eligible for the Ad26.COV2.S booster in this study. Booster vaccination should occur preferably 6 months but at least 3 months after the last COVID-19 vaccination. Participants are free to choose when to receive the booster vaccination within the window of the booster vaccination visit, to receive booster vaccination outside the study, or not to receive booster vaccination. Participants who choose to receive a booster vaccination with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (if recommended and available) or another authorized COVID-19 vaccine outside the study or choose not to receive a booster vaccination will not be withdrawn from the study and will be encouraged to remain in the study.

Study investigators should query participants to elicit and document such participation in other studies in the VAC31518COV3001 study record. Following EUA, conditional licensure, or approval in any country and approval of protocol Amendment 4 by the local Health Authority and IEC/IRB, participants who initially received placebo will be offered a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S study vaccine at no cost, as described in Section 6.4. With approval of Amendment 6 by the local Health Authority and IEC/IRB, ongoing participants who have previously received any COVID-19 vaccination(s) (as primary regimen or additional dose) with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, and/or an mRNA vaccine or another COVID-19 vaccine authorized for primary vaccination including protein, inactivated,and adenovector based vaccines will be offered a single booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S study vaccine at no cost, as described in Section 6.5. At the time when another COVID-19 vaccine is determined to be efficacious and authorized/licensed for use, some participants may become eligible to receive such vaccine, depending on country-specific conditions (eg registration status, local recommendations/regulations, vaccine availability or the specific target group for vaccination) . The investigator will discuss with the participants the available information and options to allow the participant to make an informed choice as to whether they qualify to receive the authorized/licensed vaccine and whether they should request individual unblinding to take up the offer of an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine. Safety evaluations will be identical for all participants, including participants that are unblinded to obtain an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine and who remain in the study. Access to Ad26.COV2.S vaccine for participants already unblinded will be under the conditions delineated in Section 6.4. All data will be analyzed from the point of unblinding for safety, efficacy,and immunogenicity,as described in the SAP. Treatment of Overdose For this study, any dose of Ad26.COV2.S greater than the assigned dose will be considered an overdose. The sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. In the event of a known overdose, the investigator should:  Contact the medical monitor immediately.  Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE/MAAE (ie, the participant will remain at the study site for at least 1 hour and will be closely monitored for allergic or other reactions by study staff.

For these participants, all prestudy therapies (excluding vitamins, herbal supplements; non-pharmacologic therapies such as electrical stimulation, acupuncture, special diets, and exercise regimens) administered up to 30 days before the vaccination must be recorded at screening. For all participants, concomitant therapies associated with an SAE or suspected AESI meeting the criteria outlined in Section 10.4.1 and Section 8.3.7, respectively, will be collected and recorded in the eCRF from the moment of vaccination (or from the time of local approval of protocol Amendment 5 for suspected AESIs) through the end of the study. Concomitant therapies associated with MAAEs will be collected and recorded in the eCRF from the moment of vaccination until 6 months after (double-blind or open-label) Ad26.COV2.S. Concomitant therapies associated with MAAEs leading to study discontinuation will be recorded in the eCRF during the entire study. For all participants, concomitant therapies associated with COVID-19 will be captured in the electronic eCRF for the duration of the study. For participants in the Safety Subset, concomitant therapies associated with unsolicited AEs will be collected and recorded in the eCRF from the time of vaccination through 28 days after double-blind vaccination. Concomitant therapies associated with solicited AEs will be collected by the participants and recorded in the eCRF from the time of vaccination through 7 days after double-blind vaccination. Antipyretics are recommended post-vaccination for symptom relief as needed. Prophylactic antipyretic use is not encouraged; however, in some instances, it could be considered for participants with special circumstances and/or comorbidities. Participants may not have received an investigational drug (including investigational drugs for prophylaxis of COVID-19) within 30 days or used an invasive investigational medical device within 30 days or received investigational Ig or monoclonal antibodies within 3 months, or received convalescent serum for COVID-19 treatment within 4 months or received an investigational vaccine (including investigational Adenoviral-vectored vaccines) within 6 months before the planned administration of the study vaccine.

The use of any coronavirus vaccine (licensed or investigational) other than Ad26.COV2.S is disallowed at any time prior to vaccination and during the study except under the conditions described in Sections 6.3 and6.8. If a vaccine is indicated in a post-exposure setting (eg, rabies or tetanus) , it must take priority over the study vaccine. Receipt of another licensed/authorized COVID-19 vaccine by a study participant at any timepoint during the study must be recorded. The name and date(s) of administration of the COVID-19 vaccine should be recorded in the eCRF. Chronic or recurrent use of systemic corticosteroidsa at immunosuppressive dose and administration of antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents or radiotherapy are prohibited during the study and within 6 months before the planned administration of the study vaccine. If any of these agents are indicated in a disease setting, these must take priority over the study vaccine. Refer to Section 5.2for further details of prohibited therapy. The sponsor must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible thereafter) of any instances in which prohibited therapies are administered. The participant should remain in the study. Depending on the time of the occurrence, any participant who receives a prohibited concomitant therapy will not be included in the immunogenicity analyses. Study Vaccination Pausing Rules for Stages 1a and 2a A committee consisting of the representatives of the sponsor and collaboration partners, along with the principal investigator (the protocol safety review team [PSRT])and the Janssen Medical Safety Council will monitor safety in a blinded manner, including the study vaccination pausing rules (applicable to Stages 1a and 2a only) . Adverse events that may lead to the study vaccination pausing rules (applicable to Stages 1a and 2a only) are described below and will be assessed by the Janssen Medical Safety Council to confirm that the study pause is warranted. The occurrence of any of the following events in Stages 1a and 2a will lead to a pause in further study vaccination: 1. Death of a participant, considered related to study vaccine or if the causal relationship to the study vaccine cannot be excluded; OR 2. One or more participants experience an SAE (solicited or unsolicited) that is determined to be related to study vaccine; OR 3. One or more participants experience anaphylaxis or generalized urticaria, clearly not attributable to other causes than vaccination with study vaccine. To enable prompt response to a situation that could trigger pausing rules, the investigator should notify the sponsor’s medical monitor or designee (AND fax or email the SAE form to Global a N ote: Ocular,topical or inhaled steroids are allowed."

Based on the pausing criteria, the sponsor’s medical monitor or designee, in consultation with the Janssen Medical Safety Council, then decides whether a study pause is warranted and informs the DSMB of the decision. All sites will be notified immediately in the event of a study pause. The sponsor’s medical monitor or designee is responsible for the immediate notification of DSMB members and coordination of a DSMB meeting in the event of a study pause. The DSMB will review unblinded data and will make recommendations regarding the continuation of the study to the sponsor study team. Resumption of vaccinations will start only upon receipt of written recommendations by the DSMB. The clinical site(s) will be allowed to resume activities upon receipt of a written notification from the sponsor. The formal recommendation from the DSMB will be forwarded by the investigator to the IRB/IEC and by the sponsor to the relevant health authorities, according to local standards and regulations. Vaccinations for an individual participant may be suspended for safety concerns other than those described in the pausing criteria, at the discretion of the investigator if he/she feels the participant’s safety may be threatened. The sponsor’s medical monitor or designee or the investigator(s) (upon consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor or designee) may initiate DSMB review for any single event or combination of multiple events which, in their professional opinion, could jeopardize the safety of the participants or the reliability of the data. Vaccinations for the study may be suspended for safety concerns other than those described above, or before pausing rules are met, if, in the judgement of the DSMB, participant safety may be threatened. 7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY VACCINATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL Discontinuation of Study Vaccination Not applicable. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study A participant will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  Lost to follow-up  Withdrawal of consent  Death  Repeated failure to comply with protocol requirements When a participant withdraws before study completion, the reason for withdrawal is to be documented in the eCRF and in the source document. If the reason for withdrawal from the study is withdrawal ofconsent then no additional assessments are allowed."

Alternate follow-up mechanisms that the participant agreed to when signing the consent form apply as local regulations permit. 7.2.1. Withdrawal From the Use of Research Samples Withdrawal From the Use of Samples in Future Research The participant may withdraw consent for use of samples for research (refer to Long-Term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research in Section 10.3.5 in Appendix 3 ) . In such a case, samples will be destroyed after they are no longer needed for the clinical study. Details of the sample retention for research are presented in the main ICF. Lost to Follow-up To reduce the chances of a participant being deemed lost to follow-up, prior to randomization attempts should be made to obtain contact information from each participant, eg, home, work, and mobile telephone numbers and email addresses for both the participant as well as appropriate family members. A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. A participant cannot be deemed lost to follow-up until all reasonable efforts made by the study-site personnel to contact the participant are deemed futile. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the study site for a required study visit:  The study-site personnel must attempt to contact the participant to reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible, to counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule, to ascertain whether the participant wishes to or should continue in the study.  Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every reasonable effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls, e-mails, fax, and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address, or local equivalent methods) . Locator agencies may also be used as local regulations permit. These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical records.  Should the participant continue to be unreachable, they will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. Should a study site close, eg, for operational, financial, or other reasons, and the investigator cannot reach the participant to inform them, their contact information will be transferred to another study site."

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES Overview The Schedules of Activities summarize the frequency and timing of all measurements applicable to this study. All participants will be provided access to an eCOA digital tool. This eCOA will be used to collect COVID-19 signs and symptoms surveillance info for all participants, ePRO (Symptoms of infection with Coronavirus-19 [SIC], including body temperature, and pulse oximetry results) for all participants at baseline and in case of COVID-19-like signs and symptoms, and e-Diary data on 7-day reactogenicity (solicited signs and symptoms, including body temperature) in the Safety Subsetand all participants who receive booster vaccination at the Year 1/Booster Visit, if feasible. All eCOA assessments should be conducted/completed before any tests, procedures, or other consultations to prevent influencing participantresponses. Refer to the PRO completion guidelines for instructions on the administration of ePROs. If multiple assessments are scheduled for the same timepoint, it is recommended that procedures be performed in the following sequence: vital signs before blood draws. If needed, assessments may be performed on another day within the applicable visit window. Actual dates and times of assessments will be recorded in the source document, the eCRF, or the sample requisition form. All participants will be provided a thermometer to measure body temperature ifthey experience COVID-19-like signs and symptoms. Participants in the Safety Subset and all participants who receive booster vaccination at the Year 1/Booster Visit will be provided a ruler (to measure local injection site reactions) and a participant e-Diary in the eCOA digital tool to record body temperature and solicited local (at injection site) and systemic signs and symptoms. The e-Diary includes instructions on how to capture the data and grading scales to assess severity of the signs and symptoms post-vaccination (reactogenicity) . The study staff is responsible for providing appropriate training to the participant to avoid missing or incorrect data. The e-Diary from participants in the Safety Subset (double-blind phase) and a subset of participants who received booster vaccination at the Year 1/Booster Visit, ie, participants included in the Safety Subset of the double-blind phase and all participants who received a heterologous prime or heterologous additional COVID-19 vaccination outside the study, if feasible, will be reviewed by the study personnel at visits indicated in the Schedules of Activities . If the e-Diary review is missed, the diary will be reviewed during the following visit. All participants will also be provided with a kit to collect nasal swabs samples and recipients to collect saliva (see Section 8.1.2) . The total blood volume to be collected over the course of the study from each participant will be approximately a maximum of 183.5 mL for participants in the immunogenicity subsets and a maximum of 72.0 mL for the other participants. Additional blood samples (up to 35 mL) will be collected from participants that experience COVID-19-like signs and symptoms meeting prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19. For participants who experience a suspected AESI, an additional 30 mL of blood will be collected. Refer to the Schedules of Activities for the total"

Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. If allowed by local regulation, study visits may take place at the participant’s home or other location in the event of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the area of the participant. If possible and allowed per local regulation, visits, except screening and vaccination visits, can be performed by a phone call or a telemedicine contact, provided that assessments requiring a face- to-face interaction between the participant and a trained health care professional (including but not limited to blood sampling) are performed by a site staff member or a designee at the participant’s home or other location, whichever is applicable. Conversely, in case of home visit, assessments that cannot be delegated to a designee must be performed by an appropriate site staff member via a phone call or telemedicine. Visit Windows Visit windows are provided in the Schedules of Activities . The participant should be encouraged to come on the exact day planned and use the visit window only if absolutely necessary. If the Month 6/Unblinding Visit or vaccination window is missed due to a study/vaccination pause (see Section 6.11) , efforts will be made to still vaccinate the participant as soon as possible after the pause has been lifted, even if out of the visit window. Screening The study will consist of a screening phase of up to 28 days. Screening may also be performed prior to randomization on the day of vaccination. In that case, Visits 1 and 2 will coincide on Day 1. Screening must be completed, and all eligibility criteria must be fulfilled prior to randomization and vaccination. Screening may be conducted in part via a sponsor- and IRB/IEC-pre-approved non-study-specific screening consent process, but only if the relevant pre-screening tests are identical to the per- protocol screening tests and are within 28 days prior to vaccination. However, no study-specific procedures, other than these pre-approved pre-screening assessments, will be performed until the participant has signed the study-specific ICF. The study-specific ICF date will be collected for the study database. The non-study-specific ICF will be considered source data. Long term follow-up Until 1 year after the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, each participant will be asked at least twice a week, through the eCOA, if they have experienced any new symptoms or health concerns that could be related to infection with SARS-CoV-2. As of 1-year after the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, until the end of the 2-year follow-up period, the frequency of this (suspected) COVID-19 surveillance (symptom check) through the eCOA may decrease to once every 2 weeks depending on epidemiology. All participants will be monitored for safety (including enhanced disease) for approximately 1 year after the Year 1/Booster Visit, ie, until the last study visit. Sites should"

Samples for the serologic tests will be sent to a central laboratory for testing.a Participants who test positive will be informed of the result by the study staff. Safety Assessments Details regarding the DSMB are provided in Section 9.8and in Appendix 3 . Adverse events will be reported and followed by the investigator as specified in Section 8.3 and Appendix 4 . Any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study must be recorded on the AE section of the eCRF. Any clinically significant abnormalities persisting at the end of the study/early withdrawal will be followed by the investigator until resolution or until a clinically stable condition is reached. The study will include the following evaluations of safety and reactogenicity according to the timepoints provided in the Schedules of Activities . The PSRT and the Janssen Medical Safety Council will monitor safety in a blinded manner in the double-blind phase (see Section 6.11)as well as in the open-label phase. 8.2.1. Physical Examinations Height and body weight will be assessed at screening. To obtain the actual body weight, participants must be weighed lightly clothed. The height should be measured without footwear. A targeted physical examination will be performed during a COVID-19 episode by the investigator or designated medically trained clinician (or a trained HCP, if allowed per local regulations) . Any clinically relevant abnormalities or changes in severity observed during the review of body systems should be documented in the eCRF. 8.2.2. Vital Signs At all visits, body temperature (oral route preferred, or in accordance with the local standard of care) will be assessed. Participants in the Safety Subset (double-blind phase) will utilize an e-Diary to record body temperature measurements from the time of vaccination until 7 days post-vaccination in the eCOA (see Section 8) . All participants with COVID-19 signs and symptoms should measure body temperature daily (oral route preferred, or in accordance with the local standard of care) and record the highest temperature a V accination with Ad26.COV2.S may interfere with some serologic assays utilized at local community health clinics/commercial laboratories, by seeking and identifying the spike protein in the vaccine and rendering a false positive result.

Vital signs will be measured during a COVID-19 episode by a qualified member of the study site. This includes measurement of preferably supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. It is recommended that vital signs are measured before collection of nasal swabs and blood draws. Blood pressure and pulse/heart rate measurements will be assessed in a supineposition(preferably) with a completely automated device. Manual techniques will only be used if an automated device is not available. Blood pressure and pulse/heart rate measurements should be performed before blood draws and preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones) . Under special circumstances such as high altitude, the investigator should assess baseline respiratory rate and other vital signs, as appropriate. Any vital signs measurements taken at home that may trigger the severe/critical case definition will be confirmed as soon as possible by qualified medical staffand participants will be referred for care, if needed. 8.2.3. Pregnancy Testing A urine pregnancy test for participants of childbearing potential will be performed at screening, before double-blind vaccination, before open-label vaccination, and before the booster vaccination. Participants of childbearing potential who originally received placebo and will not be receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine under EUA do not need to complete a pregnancy test. Additional serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed for participants of childbearing potential, as determined necessary by the investigator or required by local regulation, to establish the absence of pregnancy at any time during the participation in the study. 8.2.4. Clinical Laboratory Assessments Blood samples for clinical laboratory assessments (as detailed in Section 10.2, Appendix 2) will be collected as described in the Schedules of Activities in Section 1.3. In case of a thrombotic event or TTS, every effort should be made to collect local hospital/laboratory test results obtained by the treating physician to allow rapid diagnosis and treatment. This information should be reported through the TTS AESI form (see Section 10.13, Appendix 13) electronically per instructions in the eCRF completion guidelines. In addition, every effort should be made to collect blood samples from the participant for a platelet count (local laboratory or substitute for local laboratory) and other applicable testing (central laboratory) (see the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3.3 and Section 10.2, Appendix 2) . The Investigator will review the laboratory test results to assist the investigation of the AESI."

The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information; all clinical studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in accordance with those procedures. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver or surrogate) during the reporting periods detailed below. Further details on AEs,SAEs,suspected AESIs, MAAEs,and PQCs can be found in Appendix 4 . 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event, Medically- attended Adverse Event, Adverse Events of Special Interest, and Serious Adverse Event Information All Adverse Events For all participants:  (S) AEs that are related to study procedures or that are related to non-investigational sponsor products will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until the end of the study/early withdrawal.  Clinically relevant medical events not meeting the above criteria and occurring between signing of the ICF and moment of vaccination in the double-blind phase of the study will be collected on the Medical History eCRF page as pre-existing conditions. This does not apply to the open-label phase.  All SAEs and all AEs leading to study discontinuation (regardless of the causal relationship) are to be reported from the moment of vaccination until completion of the participant’s last study-related procedure, which may include contact for safety follow-up. The sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported by an investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol.  MAAEs are defined as AEs with medically-attended visits including hospital, emergency room, urgent care clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel for any reason. Routine study visits will not be considered medically-attended visits. New onset of chronic diseases will be collected as part of the MAAEs.

For participants in the Safety Subset (double-blind phase) :  Solicited AEs, collected through an e-Diary, will be recorded from the time of vaccination until 7 days post-vaccination.  All other unsolicited AEs, whether serious or non-serious, will be recorded from the time of vaccination until 28 days post-vaccination. For all participants who received booster vaccination at the Year 1/Booster Visit:  Solicited AEs, collected through an e-Diary, will be recorded from the time of vaccination until 7 days post-vaccination. All participants will collect signs and symptoms in the e-Diary, if feasible. For a subset of participants, ie, participants included in the Safety Subset of the double-blind study phase and all participants who received a heterologous COVID-19 vaccination outside the study, the e-Diary will be reviewed by the study personnel and solicited AEs recorded in the eCRF, if feasible.  All other unsolicited AEs, whether serious or non-serious, will be recorded from the time of vaccination until 28 days post-vaccinationfor all participants who received the booster at Year 1/Booster Visit. Adverse Events of Special Interest Suspected AESIs (thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia [defined as platelet count below 150, 000/µL9]) will be recorded from the moment of vaccination until the end of the study/early withdrawal (see Section 8.3.7) . An AESI Adjudication Committee with appropriate expertise will be established to evaluate each suspected AESI and determine whether it is a case of TTS. From the time of local approval of protocol Amendment 5 onwards, TTS is considered an AESI. Serious Adverse Events All SAEs, as well as PQCs,occurring during the study must be reported to the appropriate sponsor contact person by study-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. SAEs, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator before the end of the study, must be reported using an SAE form. The sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported by an investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol. Participants will be reminded once a month to contact the study site in case of an SAE."

Information regarding SAEs will be transmitted to the sponsor using the SAE Form and Safety Report Form of the eCRF, which must be completed and reviewed by a physician from the study site and transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow-up reports of an SAE should be transmitted electronically or by facsimile (fax) . Telephone reporting should be the exception and the reporter should be asked to complete the appropriate form(s) first. Overview of Safety Reporting in the Main Study (a) Refer to Section 10.4.4; eg, this includes AEs related to study procedures which are procedures related to interventions (eg, blood drawn for immunogenicity sampling) that may result in an AE (eg, bruise) . (b) Adverse events of special interest (AESIs that require reporting to the sponsor within 24 hours) . 8.3.2. Method of Detecting Adverse Events, Medically-attended Adverse Events, Adverse Events of Special Interest, and Serious Adverse Events Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs, MAAEs, suspected AESIs, or SAEs. Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Solicited Adverse Events (Applicable for Double-blind phase only) Solicited AEs are used to assess the reactogenicity of the study vaccine and are predefined local (at injection site) and systemic events for which the participant is specifically questioned, and which are noted by participants in their e-Diary. The first 2, 000 participants in each of the 2 age groups will remain under observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes post-vaccination to monitor for the development of acute reactions.

In addition, participants in the Safety Subset (double-blind phase) will record solicited signs and symptoms in an e-Diary from time of double-blind vaccination until 7 days post-vaccination. Participants in the Safety Subset will be provided with an e-Diary and instructions on how to complete the diary (see Overview in Section 8) . Electronic diary information will be transferred from the e-Diary source to the sponsor. After review and verbal discussion of the initial e-Diary entries with the participant, the investigator will complete his/her own assessment in the relevant sections of the eCRF/eCOA. Once a solicited sign or symptom from an e-Diary is considered to be of severity Grade 1 or above, it will be recorded as a solicited AE. Solicited Injection Site (Local) Adverse Events Participants will be asked to note in the e-Diary occurrences of injection site pain/tenderness, erythema,and swelling at the study vaccine injection site daily for 7 days post-vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days) . The extent (largest diameter) of any erythema and swelling should be measured (using the ruler supplied) and recorded daily. The case definitions for solicited injection site events can be found in the references.37,47 Solicited Systemic Adverse Events Participants will be instructed on how to record daily temperature using a thermometer provided for home use. Participants should record the temperature in the e-Diary in the evening of the day of vaccination, and then daily for the next 7days approximately at the same time each day. If more than 1 measurement is made on any given day, the highest temperature of that day will be recorded in the e-Diary. Fever is defined as endogenous elevation of body temperature ≥38.0°C or ≥100.4°F, as recorded in at least 1 measurement.51 Participants will also be instructed on how to note signs and symptoms in the e-Diary on a daily basis for 7days post-vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7days) ,for the following events: fatigue, headache, nausea, myalgia. Unsolicited Adverse Events (Applicable for Double-blind phase only) Unsolicited AEs are all AEs for which the participant is not specifically questioned. Medically-attended Adverse Events MAAEs are AEs with medically-attended visits including hospital, emergency room, urgent care clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel for any reason. New onset of chronic diseases will be collected as part of the MAAEs. Routine study visits will not be considered medically- attended visits. For details about AESIs, refer to Section 8.3.7."

Follow-up of Adverse Events, Medically-attended Adverse Events, Adverse Events of Special Interest, and Serious Adverse Events The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and evaluations as medically indicated to elucidate the nature and causality of the AE, suspected AESI, MAAE, SAE, or PQC as fully as possible. This may include laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other HCPs. AEs, including pregnancy, will be followed by the investigator as specified in Appendix 4 . 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) . The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report SUSARs to the appropriate IEC/IRB that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by the IEC/IRB. A SUSAR will be reported to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating investigators and IEC/IRB will receive a blinded SUSAR summary, unless otherwise specified. 8.3.5. Pregnancy All initial reports of pregnancy in participants or partners of male participants must be reported to the sponsor by the study-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg,spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and must be reported using an SAE reporting form. Any participant who becomes pregnant during the study will remain in the study and will continue to undergo all procedures for surveillance and follow-up of COVID-19 and all safety follow-up as outlined in the protocol for all participants. Participants who are pregnant and received placebo during the double-blind phase may be vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S if allowed by local regulations and if the investigator considers that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and fetus (See Section 6.4) . Participants who are pregnant may receive booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S if allowed by local regulations and if the investigator considers that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and fetus (see Section 6.5) . Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required. 8.3.6. Disease-related Events and Disease-related Outcomes Not Qualifying as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events (S) AEs caused by molecularly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection will be removed at the analysis level from the (S) AE listings and tables and presented separately.

Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest are significant AEs that are judged to be of special interest because of clinical importance, known or suspected class effects, or based on nonclinical signals. Adverse events of special interest will be carefully monitored during the study by the sponsor. Adverse events of special interest must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness irrespective of seriousness (ie, serious and non-serious AEs) or causality following the procedure described above for SAEs. Specific requirements for the AESI are described below. 8.3.7.1. Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome As described in Section 2.3.1, Risks Related to Study Participation, TTS has been observed very rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S and is considered an AESI in this study. TTS is a syndrome characterized by a combination of both a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia.2,9 Because this syndrome is rare and not completely understood, all cases of thrombosis and/or thrombocytopenia will be considered a suspected case of TTS until further adjudication can be performed. An AESI Adjudication Committee with appropriate expertise will be established to evaluate each suspected AESI and determine whether it is a case of TTS. The investigator shall be responsible for reporting any suspected AESI of TTS using the SAE form and the form detailed in Section 10.13, Appendix 13. A suspected TTS case is defined as: Thrombotic events: suspected deep vessel venous or arterial thrombotic events as detailed in Section 10.14, Appendix 14 Thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count below 150, 000/µL9 Symptoms, signs, or conditions suggestive of a thrombotic event should be recorded and reported as a suspected AESI even if the final or definitive diagnosis has not yet been determined, and alternative diagnoses have not yet been eliminated or shown to be less likely. Follow-up information and final diagnoses, if applicable, should be submitted to the sponsor as soon as they become available. In the event of thrombocytopenia, study site personnel should report the absolute value for the platelet count and the reference range for the laboratory test used. For either a thrombotic event or thrombocytopenia, testing for anti-PF4 should be performed at the local laboratory or substitute local laboratory; repeat testing may be requested for confirmation upon sponsor discretion. Suspected AESIs will require enhanced data collection and evaluation (see Section 1.3.3) . Every effort should be made to report as much information as possible about the AESI to the sponsor in a reasonable timeframe."

The form detailed in Section 10.13, Appendix 13 is intended as a guide for assessment of the AESIs to facilitate diagnosis and determine treatment options. If the investigator is not the treating physician, every effort should be made to collect the information requested in the form from the treating physician and enter the available information in the eCRF. The sponsor will also attempt to collect information from any thrombotic event /thrombocytopenia/ TTS reported prior to protocol Amendment 5. Virology Assessments Nasal swabs will be used to detect and/or quantify SARS-CoV-2. Exploratory quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva samples will also be performed. Gene sequencing may be performed to detect changes in the S gene and potentially also other parts of the viral genome, if a sample is available. Nasal swabs collected during a confirmed COVID-19 episode may also be tested at a central laboratory for the presence of other respiratory pathogens using a broad respiratory pathogens panel. All confirmedCOVID-19 episodes will be communicated to the respective participant and to other authorities according to local regulations. Participants, with stable/well-controlled HIV infection, will be encouraged to have HIV RNA viral load and CD4 cell count assessed at least twice a year and to provide these data for inclusion in the eCRF. Biomarkers During a COVID-19-episode, blood will be collected on COVID-19 Day 3-5 and on COVID-19 Day 29 for evaluation of biomarkers (eg, those associated with severe COVID-19) . Medical Resource Utilization Medical resource utilization data over the last 3 months, associated with medical encounters, will be collected by interview with the participant and recorded in the eCRF by the investigator and study-site personnel at baseline (for all participants, concerning MRU within the last 3 months before double-blind vaccination) , and on COVID-19 Day 3-5 and COVID-19 Day 29 (for all participants during a COVID-19 episode; which is defined to be resolved after having 2 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 negative nasal swabs and 2 consecutive days with no COVID-19- related signs or symptoms; see Section 8.1.2])(Appendix 7 ) . Medical resource utilization data will also be collected through the MA-COV form ( Appendix 8 ) . This form will be provided to the participant at the double-blind vaccination visit and should be completed by the medical care provider or the study site personnel during medical visits for COVID-19 or COVID-19"

Protocol-mandated procedures, tests, and encounters are excluded. The data collected may be used to conduct exploratory economic analyses and will include:  Number and duration of medical care encounters, including selected procedures (inpatient and outpatient)  Duration and type of mechanical ventilation and ECMO use  Duration of hospitalization (total days length of stay, including duration by wards; eg, ICU)  Number and character of diagnostic and therapeutic tests and procedures  Outpatient medical encounters and treatments (including physician or emergency room visits, tests and procedures, and medications) Risk Factor Assessment If allowed by local regulations and if the participant consents, he/she will be interviewed on characteristics related to his/her current work situation, living situation, and community interactions (See Appendix 12 )prior to double-blindvaccination on Day 1 and, at other timepoints, on changes compared to Day 1. These characteristics can potentially be useful to identify the risk of individual participants in acquiring COVID-19 and will be used in several analyses including the correlate analysis. Risk factor data initially collected from participants at screening prior to implementation of protocol Amendment 3 will also be used for the planned risk-factor analysis. Participant Medical Information Prior to, During and After the Study (Real- world Data) For consenting participants in the US, medical data from 5 years prior to study enrollment until 5 years after study completion, such as electronic health records, claims and laboratory data from other care settings may be accessed utilizing tokenization and matching procedures. These data, together with data collected as part of the study as specified in the Schedules of Activities , may be used to conduct exploratory analyses to enhance our understanding of the impact of prior medical history on the response to immunization and the impact of immunization on efficacy and duration of efficacy as well as adverse events that may occur during and after completion of the study (see Section 9.5.4) . The utilization of tokenization and matching procedures allows for the medical data to be obtained without violation of participant confidentiality (Section 4.2 and 4.2.1) . The real-world medical data, which are not collected as part of the study, will not be part of the clinical study database. Assessment and Procedures After EUA or Approval/Licensure and Implementation of Protocol Amendment 4 Following EUA, conditional licensure,orapproval in any country for a single dose regimen based on the VAC31518COV3001 study interim results, all participants from countries where Amendment 4 is approved by the local Health Authority and IEC/IRB will be unblinded at the on- site Month 6/Unblinding Visit.

Depending on the operational implementation of the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, as well as the stage of the pandemic, this analysis may be conducted when a minimum of 90% of the study population has been unblinded. Participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group will be assured they received at a minimum the dose level that was submitted for EUA approval (single-dose regimen of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S) and will be asked to continue to be followed in this study in line with the Schedules of Activities . A Month 6/Unblinding Visit will take place for all participants. A nasal swab and blood sample for serology will be collected from all participants. In addition, body temperature and urine pregnancy test (for participants of childbearing potential) will be collected from participants who will be vaccinated at this visit. Participants from placebo group will be offered to receive 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine under the conditions delineated in Section 6.4. After vaccination, participants should remain under observation at the study site for at least 15 minutes for the presence of any acute reactions after vaccination and will be followed for SAEs until 1 year after Ad26.COV2.S administration. The importance to continue practicing other public health or preventative measures that were introduced at the start of this pandemic (eg, social distancing, face masks, frequent hand washing) , in compliance with local and national guidelines, will be emphasized. Assessment and Procedures Related to Booster Vaccination The Year 1/Booster Visit will take place for all ongoing participants. Participants who have previously received any COVID-19 vaccination(s) (as primary regimen or additional dose) with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, and/or an mRNA vaccine or another COVID-19 vaccine authorized for primary vaccination including protein, inactivated, and adenovector based vaccines will be offered to receive a 1-dose booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at the 5x1010 vp dose level. Participants who choose not to receive booster vaccination at this time will be informed that they can still choose to receive the booster vaccination at a later date within the visit window. In addition, body temperature and urine pregnancy test (for participants of childbearing potential) will be collected from participants who will be vaccinated at this visit. After vaccination, participants should remain under observation at the study site for at least 15 minutes for the presence of any acute reactions after vaccination and will be followed for SAEs until 1 year after Ad26.COV2.S administration. Participants who choose to receive a booster vaccination outside of the study are encouraged to schedule their Year 1/Booster Visit prior to their booster vaccination, if feasible, and come in for the Year 1 + 28 Days and Year 1 + 72 Days visits within the specified visit window, if feasible, or as close as possible to the visit window. During the Year 1/Booster Vaccination visit, the investigator should ask the participant if he/she received any other COVID-19 vaccines and record type and date of administration."

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Statistical analysis will be done by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A general description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety data is outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the SAP. Sections 9.1 to 9.7 are applicable to the double-blind phase of the study. Considerations for the analysis of the open-label booster vaccination phase (introduced with Amendment 6) of the study are described in Section 9.8; details will be provided in a separate SAP. Statistical Hypotheses Refer to Section 3for the statistical hypotheses. The study will have the following timepoints for analysis: 1. The evaluation of the primary objective will be performed as soon as the target number of events (TNE) has been reached in the double-blind phase for both co-primary endpoints, or earlier based on sequential monitoring of both co-primary endpoints (details in Section 9.5.1) . Sponsor unblinding will occur but investigator and participants remain blinded until implementation of Amendment 4 (see Section 6.4) . 2. If an efficacy signal is triggered before the required 8-week follow-up after double-blind vaccination of 50% of participants is reached, an additional analysis will be performed when that follow-up timepoint is reached (8-week median follow-up timepoint) . If the time between the efficacy signal and the required 8-week median follow-up is too short to make a difference in terms of preparing two analyses,then a single analysis will take place at the time of the 8-week median follow-up. The analysis at the time of the 8-week median follow-up is considered the primary analysis. 3. After the primary analysis, additional analyses to support health authority interactions will be planned, as deemed appropriate. 4. A final analysis of the double-blind phase of the study, including all double-blind data, will be performed when all participants have completed the Month 6/Unblinding Visit or discontinued earlier. Depending on the operational implementation of the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, as well as the stage of the pandemic, this analysis may be conducted when a minimum of 90% of the study population has been unblinded. 5. The final analysis will be performed when the last participant completes the 18 months visit which corresponds to approximately 12 months visit after the Month 6/Unblinding Visit or discontinued earlier."

The end-of-study analysis will be performed when all participants have completed the Year 2 visit of the study or discontinued earlier. Sample Size Determination 9.2.1. Efficacy (Total Sample Size) The study TNE is determined using the following assumptions:  a VE for molecularly confirmed,moderate to severe/critical SARS-CoV-2 infection of 60%.  approximately 90% power to reject a null hypothesis of H0: VE≤30%.  type 1 error rate α = 2.5% to evaluate VE of the vaccine regimen (employing the sequential probability ratio test [SPRT] to perform a fully sequential design analysis; detailed in Section 9.5.1) .  a randomization ratio of 1:1 for active versus placebo Events are defined as first occurrence of molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 according to the case definition in Section 8.1.3.1 in the PP population. The two co-primary endpoints will evaluate the events at least 14 days after double-blind vaccination (Day 15) and at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination (Day 29)with study vaccine. Under the assumptions above, the total TNE to compare the active vaccine versus placebo equals 154, based on events in the active vaccination and placebo group, according to the primary endpoints case definition of moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 (Section 8.1.3.1 ) . If the co-primary hypothesis testing is successful for both co-primary endpoints, secondary objectives will be evaluated against a null hypothesis employing a lower limit VE>0%. The method to perform hypothesis testing of primary and secondary objectives preserving the FWER will be specified in the SAP. The FWER will be controlled at 2.5%. Sample Size Justification Based on epidemiological modeling for the targeted study countries, province/states of the various site locations, the annualized incidence of moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 cases meeting the primary endpoints definitions has been predicted to be 1.4% for the October-November timeframe. The estimate incorporates that real-world-evidence data and literature data only detected and reported a fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, it includes that, based on literature and real-world-evidence data, only a fraction of all infections meets the moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 case definition and the fraction varies by age as well (increasing with higher ages) . Moreover, projections for the selected study regions indicate that incidences will decline over time. Finally, seroprevalence rates are expected to vary between 5-15%."
140,page_140,"VAC31518 (JNJ-78436735) Clinical Protocol VAC31518COV3001 Amendment 6 C ONFIDENTIAL –FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 141 St atus: Approved,Date: 04 September 2021For the purpose of sample size evaluation, an incidence assumption of moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 cases meeting the primary endpoints definition of 1.4% during the first 3 months of the study, with a 50% reduction in Month 4, and 62% reduction in the months thereafter is assumed in combination with a seroprevalence rate of 10%. At the time of protocol planning, the epidemiological situation was uncertain: actual seroprevalence rates, degree of social distancing and use of personal protective equipment during the study, local regulations (eg, potential lockdowns, other vaccines if available) potentially becoming in effect during the course of the study and potential drop-outs from the study could impact the disease incidence rate. To that end, the maximum sample size of approximately 60, 000 participants was selected. This sample size was selected, based on the uncertainty of the epidemiological situation in combination with the ability to provide a high probability (approximately 90%) to reach a time to signal within 8 months of the study for a vaccine with an assumed 60% VE. Based on an estimated case-hospitalization ratio of 2.5% and estimates obtained from reported real-world-evidence data of 3-10% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections meeting the severe/critical COVID-19 definition, this would provide a reasonable likelihood of observing 5 severe cases in the placebo group within the same time frame (8 months) . At the time of writing protocol Amendment 3, the incidence of moderate to severe COVID-19 seen in the US and reported in other COVID-19 vaccine studies is significantly higher than assumed at the time of protocol planning as described above. Furthermore, based on that incidence and modeling there is a high degree of probability that an efficacy signal meeting the prespecified criteria in this amendment will be reached at, or prior to, the time when approximately 40, 000 participants will have been followed for a median of 8 weeks from the time of vaccination. Therefore, the sample size is reduced from 60, 000 to approximately 40, 000. The operating characteristics of the study design, statistical methods, study monitoring rules and efficacy evaluations specified in this protocol with the chosen event and sample sizes will be described in a separate modeling and simulation report and will be added to the SAP before the first participant is vaccinated. No additional participants will be recruited for the open-label phase. 9.2.2. Immunogenicity Subset (Double-blind Phase) All participants included in the Immunogenicity Subset (N=400) will be added randomly at each stage of the enrollment. Healthy adults (Subset 1a) will be enrolled in Stage 1a, adults with comorbidities (Subset 1b) in Stage 1b, healthy elderly (Subset 2a) in Stage 2a, and elderly with comorbidities (Subset 2b)in Stage 2b, with approximately 100 participants per group as displayed in Table 3 . Although Stage 1b and 2b will also enroll participants without comorbidities, only participants with comorbidities will be included in Immunogenicity Subset 1b and Subset 2b."

These numbers are expected to provide a solid understanding of the magnitude and kinetics of the humoral response induced by the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. 9.2.3. Immunogenicity Correlates (Correlates Subset) Correlates will be assessed in a subset where immune responses and transcriptome modifications are measured in all vaccine recipients who experience a SARS-CoV-2 event, and in random samples of vaccine recipients who have not been infected, in a 1:5 ratio. The goal of this case– control study is to assess correlates of risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (and potential other secondary endpoints) in the vaccine group by comparing vaccine-induced immune responses and transcriptome modifications associated with COVID-19. Also, placebo participants will be included in this subset (placebo infected, seropositive [based on N protein] non-infected and seronegative non-infected) , if feasible. Correlates will also be investigated via a case-cohort design, including measurement of immunological markers in a random subcohort augmented by infected and symptomatic cases. Controls will be matched with cases from the same stage (age, comorbidities) and other co-factors as deemed appropriate. These will be detailed in the Correlates SAP. 9.2.4. Safety 9.2.4.1. Safety Subset While mild to moderate reactogenicity (local injection site and systemic reactions) are expected, AEs that preclude further vaccine administration (if applicable) are not anticipated. Unsolicited AEs will be captured for a period of 28 days after double-blind vaccination. Solicited and unsolicited AEs will be captured in the Safety Subset, ie, approximately 6, 000 participants (~3, 000 from the active group, ~3, 000 from the placebo group; and including at least 2, 000 from the older age group [≥60 years of age] if feasible) . 9.2.4.2. All Participants Adverse events of special interest (from protocol Amendment 5 onwards) and SAEs will be captured in all participants and throughout the study. MAAEs (including new onset of chronic diseases) will be captured in all participants until 6 months after (double-blind or open-label) vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S,except for MAAEs leading to study discontinuation which are to be reported during the entire study. Based on a sample size of approximately 40, 000 participants, and approximately 20, 000 in the active vaccination group, for SAEs, the observation of 0 events in the database would be associated with 95% confidence that the true rate is less than 0.015%. Table 7 shows the probabilities of observing at least 1 event (solicited, unsolicited, or SAE) in 1 of the groups at given true AE rates."

Analyses of safety will be performed on the FAS. Vaccine efficacy analyses can be repeated using the FAS. Safety Subset : subset of the FAS for the analysis of solicited and unsolicited AEs. Per-protocol Efficacy (PP) population: Participants in the FAS who receive double-blind study vaccine and who are seronegative at the time of double-blind vaccination and who have no other major protocol deviations that were judged to possibly impact the efficacy of the vaccine. Participants who became aware of their study vaccine allocation will cease to be part of the PP population. The PA of VE will be based on the PP population. The PP will be the main analysis population for efficacy analyses. Per-protocol Immunogenicity (PPI) population: All randomized and vaccinated participants, including those who are part of the Immunogenicity Subset and for whom immunogenicity data are available, excluding participants with major protocol deviations expected to impact the immunogenicity outcomes. In addition, for participants who experience a SARS-CoV-2 event (molecularly confirmed) , samples taken after the event and samples taken outside protocol windows will not be taken into account in the assessment of the immunogenicity. The PPI population is the primary immunogenicity population. For key tables, sensitivity immunogenicity analyses will also be performed on the FAS, including participants who are part of the Immunogenicity Subset for whom immunogenicity measures are available. Excluded samples might be taken into account as well in the sensitivity analysis. Analyses of vaccine immunogenicity and immune correlates of risk will be based on PPI. Open-Label (OL) population : The OL population consists of all participants who have been treated with Ad26.COV2.S vaccination during the study. Participants will be describedin 2 groups, those who were treated with Ad26.COV2.S in the double-blind phase and those who were treated in the open-label phase."

Participant Information For all participants, descriptive statistics of demographic (eg, gender, age, height, weight, BMI, race, and other baseline characteristics) will be provided by vaccination group. Additional characteristics related to current work situation, living situation, and community interactions will be collected for risk factor analysis, if allowed per local regulations. Risk factor data initially collected from participants at screening prior to implementation of protocol Amendment 3 will also be used for the planned risk-factor analysis. See also Section 9.5.3. Efficacy Analyses The SAP will be finalized prior to first participant in and it will include a more technical and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this section. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints including primary and key secondary endpoints. 9.5.1. Primary Endpoints Evaluation The study is designed to test the co-primary hypotheses of VE in the PP population. For both co-primary endpoints the following hypothesis will be tested: H0: VE ≤30% versus H1: VE >30% and each hypothesis will be evaluated at a 2.5% one-sided significance level. The co-primary endpoints will evaluate:  the first occurrence of molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 according to the case definition in Section 8.1.3.1 , with onset at least 14 days after double-blind vaccination (Day 15) with Ad26.COV2.S versus placebo, in the PP population, including all events from both age groups, with and without comorbidities.  the first occurrence of molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 according to the case definition in Section 8.1.3.1 , with onset at least 28 days after double- blind vaccination (Day 29) with Ad26.COV2.S versus placebo, in the PP population, including all events from both age groups, with and without comorbidities. Participants included in the seronegative analysis set are those participants with a negative SARS- CoV-2 serology test result at (double-blind) baseline. Considering the current COVID-19 pandemic, early detection of VE will be very important. The proposed current analysis setup is designed for continuous sequential analyses (see Section 9.5.1.1 ) , where statistical hypothesis testing is conducted repeatedly on accumulating data, generating an earliest possible signal if and when the splits between the number of events in"
144,page_144,"VAC31518 (JNJ-78436735) Clinical Protocol VAC31518COV3001 Amendment 6 C ONFIDENTIAL –FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 145 St atus: Approved,Date: 04 September 2021placebo recipients are much larger compared to the Ad26.COV2.S-vaccinated group for both co-primary endpoints and in such a way that they are unlikely to be due to chance alone using a truncated SPRT. A successful primary efficacy conclusion will require: 1. Establishing the hypothesis H1: VE>30% for each co-primary endpoint AND 2. A favorable split vaccine:placebo for the subset of primary endpoints meeting the severe/critical COVID-19 case definition (expressed as a VE point estimate against severe/critical COVID-19 molecularly confirmed endpoints ≥50%) and a minimum of 5 events in the placebo group. This requirement needs to be met for severe/critical events with onset at least 14 days after double-blind vaccination and for severe/critical events with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination. AND 3. A VE of at least 50% for each co-primary endpoint. To evaluate the primary null hypotheses: H0: VE ≤30% versus H1: VE >30% for the co-primary endpoints,the truncated sequential probability ratio test will be used based on accumulating event data for each co-primary endpoint. This boundary is set up using the fully sequential design and is derived in such a way to have approximately 90% power to detect a VE=60% using a one-sided alpha=0.025 against H0:VE≤30%. For the evaluation of the favorable ratio against the severe/critical COVID-19 endpoints a sequential boundary corresponding to a VE point estimate ≥50% and a minimum of 5 events in the placebo group will be prespecified. The specific boundaries will be detailed in the SAP. The monitoring can start as soon as the following conditions are met: 1. A minimum of 6 COVID-19 cases for the ≥60 years age group with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination 2. At least 42 cases meeting the primary endpoints definition of moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination 3. A subset of at least 5 cases meeting the primary endpoints definition of severe/critical COVID-19 with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination No interim evaluation will be done, until those conditions are fulfilled. Monitoring for efficacy will not start before the above conditions 1-3 are met and will occur at least once a week by the SSG of the DSMB until the prespecified boundaries have been crossed. The efficacy analysis will be triggered by either: 1. a) An interim evaluation if all prespecified efficacy boundaries have been met ORif 154 cases meeting the primary endpoints definition of moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 are observed for events with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination"

OR, alternatively, 2. If the prespecified non-efficacy boundary has been met (evaluating events with start 28 days after double-blind vaccination) or when the harm boundary has been crossed. The decision rules for harm and non-efficacy are detailed in Section 9.5.1.1 . If an efficacy signal is triggered before the required 8-week follow-up after double-blind vaccination of 50% of participants is reached, an additional analysis will be performed when that follow-up timepoint is reached. If the time between the efficacy signal and the required 8-week median follow-up is too short to make a difference in terms of preparing two analyses,then a single analysis will take place at the time of the 8-week median follow-up. The analysis at the time of the 8-week median follow-up is considered the primary analysis. If more than 154 primary endpoints are observed for events with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination before the 3 conditions above are met, a single analysis will take place as soon as the conditions are met, using the full 2.5% one-sided significance level. Ifthe prespecified boundaries and above conditions are met, the SSG will inform the DSMB and, if deemed appropriate by the DSMB, a meeting with the DSMB and the Oversight Group will be set up to discuss the efficacy signal. Upon this meeting the sponsorrepresentative on the Oversight Group can trigger internal decision procedures to initiate health authority interactions based on the outcome of the study. However, the study sites and participants will remain blinded to allow for evaluation of durability of VE. Sponsor personnel will be unblinded at the time of the primary analysis. If an efficacy signal is triggered before the required 8-week follow-up after double-blind vaccination of 50% of participants is reached (defined as “snapshot analysis”) , selected sponsor personnel will be unblinded at the time of the snapshot analysis. A positive RT-PCR or other molecular diagnostic test result obtained from a central laboratory will be utilized to define a molecularly confirmed case of COVID-19. Sensitivity analysis comparing cases also including a positive RT-PCR test result from any source, including external to the study,will be performed for each diagnostic category individually (mild, moderate, severe, moderate+severe, and medical utilization [hospitalization, ICU care, mechanical ventilation, ECMO]) . The primary efficacy analysis will pool data across populations (both age groups with and without comorbidities) to evaluate the primary and secondary objectives. In addition, these will be supplemented with a subgroup analysis for age group (18 to <60 years, ≥60 years) and comorbidities employing a descriptive summary including 95% confidence intervals to describe the VE in each subpopulation. Depending on the recruited study population, the ≥60 years subgroup may be further subcategorized (≥70 years, ≥80 years) . In addition, to assess potential time-effects of VE, the Kaplan-Meier method will be used to plot the estimated cumulative incidence rates over time for the vaccine and placebo groups. This"

Divergence of vaccine and placebo curves may be utilized to estimate onset of efficacy following immunization. Furthermore,VE will be evaluated in seronegative participants, counting primary endpoints since onset after double-blind vaccination.

Secondary Endpoints All secondary endpoint analyses will occur in the PP analysis set, in seronegative participants unless otherwise indicated. To evaluate the effect of the vaccine against symptomatic molecularly confirmed COVID-19, including mild infections, a BOD endpoint will be evaluated based on the first occurrence of molecularly confirmed COVID-19, including mild, moderate and severe/critical case definitions in Sections 8.1.3.1 and 8.1.3.2 , with onset at least 14 days after double-blind vaccination (Day 15) and with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination (Day 29)with Ad26.COV2.S versus placebo, in the PP population, including all events across age groups, with and without comorbidities. In this study, the BOD endpoint is defined as taking the value 1 for mild and moderate disease and the value 2 for severe disease (implicitly assigning a value of 0 for no disease [not infected or asymptomatic infection]) . By assigning higher weight to severe infections, the BOD endpoint aims at providing higher statistical power for differentiating from placebo vaccines with increased protection against severe infections (but potentially lower vaccine efficacy against milder infections) . The BOD evaluates the severity-adjusted VE against preventing symptomatic incidence. The hypothesis to evaluate the vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection will be based on this method. In addition, the VE against each severity category according to the case"

Statistical significance for the BOD endpoint will be tested using H0:VE≤0 at a one-sided α=2.5% according to multiplicity adjusted strategy. Details on the calculation of VE for the BOD endpoint and its associated confidence interval (for testing) and hypothesis testing will be foreseen in the SAP. VE against severe/critical infections with onset at least 14 days after double-blind vaccination (Day 15) and with onset 28 days after double-blind vaccination will be evaluated. Exact Poisson regression will be used to estimate the VE and associated confidence interval in seronegative participants in the PP analysis set. The co-primary endpoints and BOD endpoint will be evaluated at the time of efficacy signal, and again at the time when the 8-week median follow-up requirement is reached (should the efficacy signal occur earlier) . VE against any SARS-CoV-2 infection and against asymptomatic infections will be evaluated as soon as a sufficient number of participants have data available. This timepoint will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan and may occur at any of the planned analysis timepoints. Available N-serology measurements will be incorporated to evaluate VE against any infection, including asymptomatic infection and against asymptomatic/undetected infection only. A participant will be defined as having any infection whether he/shehad either a symptomatic infection (mild, moderate or severe according to the case definition) or an asymptomatic infection (as defined in Section 8.1.3.4 ) . Poisson regression will be used to estimate the VE and associated confidence interval in seronegative participants in the PP analysis set for each of both analyses. Among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effect of the study vaccine on the viral load levels at and after diagnosis as well as on the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral load positivity will be evaluated. The effect of the vaccine will be evaluated against molecularly confirmed COVID-19 infections requiring medical intervention once sufficient events are available for events with onset at least 14 days after double-blind vaccination and with onset at least 28 days after double-blind vaccination. Medical interventions are evaluated as a composite endpoint of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and ECMO, linked to objective measures such as decreased oxygenation, X-ray or CT findings. Exact Poisson regression will be used to estimate the VE and the associated confidence interval in seronegative participants in the PP analysis set. All VE evaluations will be repeated regardless of their serostatus. Supportive and/or descriptive analysis will be reported with 95% confidence intervals; confirmatory endpoints will have an adjusted confidence interval reported at the time of hypothesis testing whereby the alpha level is determined according to the FWER-controlled testing strategy."

Geometric mean fold rises from baseline and corresponding 95% confidence intervals might additionally be calculated. Baseline is considered as the last available assessment before double-blind vaccination. For participants, who received vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at the Month 6/Unblinding Visit in the open-label phase after having received placebo initially, descriptive statistics of available data after vaccination will be provided. Graphical representations of immunologic parameters will be made as applicable. The impact of baseline factors on the humoral responses will be explored graphically or via descriptive statistics.

Correlates of Risk If VE is demonstrated, correlates of risk will be explored. More details with appropriate methods will then be provided in a separate analysis plan. Safety Analysis No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data according to the double-blind vaccination receivedand based on the FAS will be analyzed descriptively. The analysis of solicited and unsolicited AEs will be restricted to a subset of the FAS (ie, the Safety Subset) . For SAEs, AESIs, and MAAEs the full FAS is considered. New onset of chronic diseases will be collected as part of the MAAEs.

Adverse Events (Solicited and Unsolicited) The verbatim terms used in the eCRF by investigators to identify AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) . All Reported AEs with onset during the active vaccination phase (ie, AEs occurring after double-blind vaccination up to 28 days post- vaccination) , and all SAEs/AESIs/MAAEs will be included in the analysis. (S) AEs caused by molecularly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection will be removed at the analysis level from the (S) AE listings and tables and presented separately. For each AE, the percentage of participants who experience at least 1 occurrence of the given event will be summarized by study vaccine group. Summaries, listings, datasets, or participant narratives may be provided, as appropriate, for those participants who die, who discontinue the study due to an AE or who experience a severe AE, an AESI, or an SAE. Solicited local (at injection site) and systemic AEs will be summarized descriptively. The number and percentages of participants with at least 1 solicited local (at injection site) or systemic AE will be presented. Solicited AEs shown in the tables and listings will be based on the overall assessment of the investigator. The overall frequencies by vaccine group as well as frequencies according to severity and duration will be described for solicited AEs. Frequencies of unsolicited AEs, separately for all and vaccination-related only, will be presented by System Organ Class and preferred term, while those of solicited AEs will be presented only by preferred term. Clinical Laboratory Tests Laboratory data (abnormal or graded, when available) will be listed and/or tabulated by participant and time point.

Other vital signs may be measured at the discretion of the investigator. Vital signs abnormalities will be listed. For COVID-19 cases, temperature will be summarized over time from start of symptoms, using descriptive statistics and/or graphically. For systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and pulse oximetry, values and the percentage of participants with values beyond clinically relevant limits will be summarized at each scheduled timepoint. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for changes between COVID-19 Day 29 and COVID-19 Day 3-5. Physical Examinations For all participants, physical examinations can be performed at the discretion of the investigator. Physical examination abnormal findings will be listed. For COVID-19 cases, physical examination findings and the percentage of participants with values beyond clinically relevant limits will be summarized at each scheduled timepoint. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for changes between COVID-19 Day 29 and COVID-19 Day 3-5, if available. Analysis of the Open-label Booster Vaccination Phase No additional participants will be recruited for the open-label phase. Safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy endpoints following booster vaccination will be descriptively summarized by homologous or heterologous prime/boost combination (mRNA, adenovector, protein,or inactivated vaccine) . The analysis of the data is planned to be performed 6 months and 1 year after all participants were offered the booster vaccination. Additional analyses may be conducted to support health authority interactions and/or based on public health demand in case of emerging variants. 9.8.1. Sample Size Determination of Immunogenicity Subset (Open-label Booster Vaccination Phase) Homologous Booster Subset: The Homologous Booster Subset will include approximately 2 00 participants. This subset will include participants from the Immunogenicity Subset, who received Ad26.COV2.S in the double blind phase or after crossover, and subsequently received an Ad26.COV2.S booster vaccination in the study. This group may be augmented by other participants to replace participants who are not available. Participants in the Homologous Booster Subset will have a blood sample collected pre-booster vaccination, and 28 days, 72 days, 6 months, and 1 year post booster vaccination for humoral immunogenicity assessment. Heterologous Booster Subset: The Heterologous Booster Subset will include approximately 4 00 participants. This subset will include participants in the study who received placebo in the double-blind phase and have received primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine or another authorized COVID-19 vaccine including protein, inactivated, and adenovector based vaccines"

Participants who already received an additional COVID-19 vaccination after the primary regimen outside the study will not be included in the Heterologous Booster Subset. Participants will be selected out of countries where these vaccines were authorized for emergency use or are licensed. Participants in the Heterologous Booster Subset will have blood collected pre boostervaccination, and 28 days, 72 days, 6 months, and 1 year post booster vaccination for humoral immunogenicity assessment. A sample size of approximately 600 participants, distributed as described in Table 4 and Table 5 , is estimated to be sufficient to allow robust description of immune responses to Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. These numbers are expected to provide a solid understanding of the magnitude and kinetics of the humoral response induced by a booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine in participants who received homologous Ad26.COV2.S primary vaccination or heterologous primary vaccination with an mRNA, protein, inactivated or adenovector based vaccine. 9.8.2. Immunogenicity Correlates (Correlates Subset) Correlates for participants who received a booster dose will be assessed in a subset where immune responses and transcriptome modifications are measured in all vaccine recipients who experience a SARS-CoV-2 event, and in random samples of vaccine recipients who have not been infected, in a 1:5 ratio. The goal of this case– control study is to assess correlates of risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (and potential other secondary endpoints) in the vaccine group by comparing vaccine- induced immune responses and transcriptome modifications associated with COVID-19. 9.8.3. Efficacy Analyses If deemed feasible, efficacy of the booster vaccination may be explored by comparing efficacy data after boosting to data in the absence of booster, on the same primary regimen. Feasibility will be assessed based on data availability as well as adjustments for potential confounding in the statistical analysis. The following data sources will be explored: 1. If available, data of participants in the study who did not receive a booster and/or available data prior to boosting. 2. Data of individuals outside the study who received a similar primary regimen but did not receive a booster. It will be explored if external data (eg, real world evidence data, and/or published literature data) is available to that end for the countries enrolled in this study. For the statistical analysis, it will be explored if adjustment for potential confounding factors is feasible (based on risk factors identified in the analysis of the double-blind phase/and or literature) in each comparison. This may include, but not limit to age, presence of co-morbidities as well as the spatiotemporal evolution of variants and the epidemic. It is anticipated that comparative evaluation of efficacy against asymptomatic infections using real world evidence of data of individuals outside the study will not be feasible due to the difficulty of detecting asymptomatic infections in real world evidence."

All of the above will be detailed in an SAP prior to conducting the analysis. Interim Analysis and Committees The study will be formally monitored by a DSMB (also known as an IDMC) . In general, the DSMB will monitor safety data on a regular basis to ensure the continuing safety of the participants. Enrollment will not be paused during these safety reviews, except after Stage 1a (2, 000 participants) and stage 2a (2, 000 participants) . The DSMB will review unblinded data. The DSMB responsibilities, authorities, and procedures will be documented in the DSMB Charter. The DSMB will also review Day 3 safety data (ie, from Day 1 to Day 3; including safety data from the ongoing clinical studies)from participants enrolled in Stage 1a and Stage 2a, before enrollment of participants in Stage 1b and Stage 2b, respectively. Vaccination of participants in the respective age groups will be paused during these safety reviews. Continuous monitoring for vaccine-associated enhanced disease will be performed through the SSG who will look at each of the diagnosed FAS COVID-19 events. Vaccine harm monitoring will be performed for the severe/critical COVID-19/death endpoint based on the FAS. As these events will be monitored in real-time, and, after each confirmed respective case, the SSG will assess if a stopping boundary is reached. Specifically, monitoring for a higher rate of severe/critical disease or death in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group starts at the 5th event and at each additional event until the harm boundary is reached or until the primary analysis is triggered. If the stopping boundary is met, then the SSG immediately informs the Chair of the DSMB through secure communication procedures. At this point the DSMB will convene and provide a recommendation to the Oversight Group, which includes a sponsor representative as a core member. As such, the potential harm monitoring is in real-time, resulting in the earliest indication of harm possible as soon as data come in. In addition, the DSMB will formally monitor the SARS- CoV-2 events to conclude both non-efficacy and efficacy (for more details on the evaluation of and monitoring for efficacy,see section 9.5.1and 9.5.1.1 , respectively) . The DSMB will evaluate in an unblinded fashion whether superiority is established for the primary endpoints or whether non-efficacy is shown based on a report provided by the SSG, when the prespecified boundaries have been crossed. The study will also be monitored for operational non-efficacy to evaluate whether enough events to perform the PA can be collected within reasonable time. For that purpose, a monitoring rule will be set up to assess the probability that the minimal needed target number of primary endpoints events to be able to perform the PA in the PP set will be reached. For the double-blind phase of the study,two versions of the non-efficacymonitoring report will be generated. A report provided to the DSMB will contain unblinded events and a report provided to the sponsor will contain blinded events. While it is the primary responsibility of the sponsor to make decisions regarding study operations and modifications based on monitoring of study vaccine-blinded primary events from the study, the DSMB can evaluate the progress towards primary endpoints targets in the"

During the open-label phase,the DSMB will continue to monitor safety. The monitoring rules will be detailed in the DSMB Charter, with the statistical details in the SAP. A final analysis of the double-blind phase will be performed when all participants have completed the Month 6/Unblinding Visit. Depending on the operational implementation of the Month 6/Unblinding Visit, as well as the stage of the pandemic, this analysis may be conducted when a minimum of 90% of the study population has been unblinded. This will provide an analysis of all endpoints for the blinded portion of the study. This analysis will incorporate data collected after the EUA submission to the FDA. All data generated after the unblinding will be considered as part of an analytic plan devoted to the open-label phase. This analysis may be supplemented by independent measures of incidence and efficacy with real world data obtained in separate studies, to be described in a separate protocol. More details will be provided in the SAP. The SAP will describe the planned analyses in greater detail. Analyses for Cohort Unblinded Due to Administration of an Authorized/Licensed COVID-19 Vaccine In the double-blind phase of the study, investigators may receive requests to unblind study participants who become eligible to receive an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine if/when these become available. In these cases, the investigator will discuss with the participant available options and ramifications. If the participant is eligible for an authorized/licensed vaccine according to local immunization guidelines or recommendation and if the participant wishes to proceed with the unblinding, the investigator will follow the unblinding procedures. The reason for the unblinding request should be documented. When unblinding, if it is determined that the participant received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (and not placebo) , the participant will be informed that there are no data on the safety of receiving 2 different COVID-19 vaccines. Unblinded participants, both in the double-blind and open-label phase, will be asked to continue to be followed in this study in line with the Schedule of Activities to the extent that they permit. Safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity evaluations will be identical for all participants, if applicable and feasible, including participants who are unblinded to obtain an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine and who remain in the study, including participants in the Safety Subset, if applicable and feasible. All data will be analyzed separately from the point of unblinding for safety, efficacy,and immunogenicity, as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan."

Regulatory and Ethical Considerations Investigator Responsibilities The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study is performed in accordance with the protocol, current International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) , and applicable regulatory and country-specific requirements. Good Clinical Practice is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation of human participants. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected, consistent with the principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the study data are credible. Protocol Amendments Neither the investigator nor the sponsor will modify this protocol without a formal amendment by the sponsor. All protocol amendments must be issued by the sponsor, and signed and dated by the investigator. Protocol amendments must not be implemented without prior IEC/IRB approval, or when the relevant competent authority has raised any grounds for non-acceptance, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the participants, in which case the amendment must be promptly submitted to the IEC/IRB and relevant competent authority. Documentation of amendment approval by the investigator and IEC/IRB must be provided to the sponsor. When the change(s) involve only logistic or administrative aspects of the study, the IEC/IRB (where required) only needs to be notified. During the course of the study, in situations where a departure from the protocol is unavoidable, the investigator or other physician in attendance will contact the appropriate sponsor representative listed in the Contact Information page(s) , which will be provided as a separate document. Except in emergency situations, this contact should be made before implementing any departure from the p rotocol. In all cases, contact with the sponsor must be made as soon as possible to discuss the situation and agree on an appropriate course of action. The data recorded in the eCRF and source documents will reflect any departure from the protocol, and the source documents will describe this departure and the circumstances requiring it. Regulatory Approval/Notification This protocol and any amendment(s) must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities in each respective country, if applicable. A study may not be initiated until all local regulatory requirements are met.

At least once a year, the IEC/IRB will be asked to review and reapprove this study, where required. At the end of the study, the investigator (or sponsor where required) will notify the IEC/IRB about the study completion. Country Selection This study will only be conducted in those countries where the intent is to launch or otherwise help ensure access to the developed product if the need for the product persists, unless explicitly addressed as a specific ethical consideration in Section 4.2.1. Other Ethical Considerations For study-specific ethical design considerations, refer to Section 4.2.1. 10.3.2. Financial Disclosure Investigators and subinvestigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in accordance with local regulations to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study. Refer to Required Prestudy Documentation (above) for details on financial disclosure. 10.3.3. Informed Consent Process Consent of each participant must be obtained according to local requirements after the nature of the study has been fully explained. The informed consent(s)must be obtained before performance of any study-related procedure. Downloading of an application to the participant’s eDevice, to access materials for enrollmentand study information, is not considered a study-related procedure. The ICF can be signed remotely prior to the Screening Visit. The ICF(s) that is/are used must be approved by both the sponsor and by the reviewing IEC/IRB and be in a language that the participant can read and understand. The informed consent should be in accordance with principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and sponsor policy. Before enrollment in the study, the investigator or an authorized member of the study-site personnel must explain to potential participants the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study, and any discomfort participation in the study may entail. Participants will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw consent to participate at any time. They will be informed that choosing not to participate will not affect the care the participant will receive. Finally, they will be told that the investigator will maintain a participant identification register for the purposes of long-term follow-up if needed and"

By signing the ICF the participant is authorizing such access. It also denotes that the participant agrees to allow his or her study physician to recontact the participant for the purpose of obtaining consent for additional safety evaluations, if needed. The participant will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study, consent should be appropriately recorded by means of the participant’s personally dated signature. After having obtained the consent, a copy of the ICF must be given to the participant. Participants who are rescreened are required to sign a new ICF. Participants entering the open-label phase are required to sign a new ICF at the Month 6/Unblinding Visit or at an unscheduled visit beyond the Month 6/Unblinding Visit if this visit has already been conducted. All participants are required to sign a new ICF at the Year 1/Booster Visit. As described in Section 8.1.2, a caregiver may assist a participant who is unable to complete the SIC in the eCOA, by reading the questions aloud and recording the responses in the eCOA on the participant’s behalf (using the caregiver’s unique identifier and PIN) . For this purpose, a caregiver consent form has been developed. Consent must be obtained according to local requirements and must be obtained from the caregiver before he or she is allowed to complete the eCOA on behalf of the participant. After having obtained the caregiver’s consent, a copy of the consent form must be given to the caregiver. Of note, the caregiver is not intended to be a Legally Authorized Representative who can provide informed consent for study participation on behalf of the participant. It is also not the intent that the caregiver collects nasal swabs or other samples from the participant unless he or she is specifically qualified to perform these tasks and can document the use of appropriate personal protective equipment during the performance of such tasks. 10.3.4. Data Protection Privacy of Personal Data The collection and processing of personal data from participants enrolled in this study will be limited to those data that are necessary to fulfill the objectives of the study. These data must be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and regulations. Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss or alteration must be put in place. Sponsor personnel whose responsibilities require access to personal data agree to keep the identity of participants confidential. The informed consent obtained from the participant includes explicit consent for the processing of personal data and for the investigator/institution to allow direct access to his or her original medical records (source data/documents) for study-related monitoring, audit, IEC/IRB review, and"

This consent also addresses the transfer of the data to other entities and to other countries. The participant has the right to request through the investigator access to his or her personal data and the right to request rectification of any data that are not correct or complete. Reasonable steps will be taken to respond to such a request, taking into consideration the nature of the request, the conditions of the study, and the applicable laws and regulations. Exploratory biomarkerand immunogenicity research is not conducted under standards appropriate for the return of data to participants. In addition, the sponsor cannot make decisions as to the significance of any findings resulting from exploratory research. Therefore, exploratory research data will not be returned to participants or investigators, unless required by law or local regulations. Privacy and confidentiality of data generated in the future on stored samples will be protected by the same standards applicable to all other clinical data. 10.3.5. Long-term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research Samples collected in this study may be stored for up to 15 years (or according to local regulations) for additional research. Samples will only be used to understand Ad26.COV2.S, to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection, to understand differential vaccine responders, and to develop tests/assays related to Ad26.COV2.S and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The research may begin at any time during the study or the post-study storage period. Stored samples will be coded throughout the sample storage and analysis process and will not be labeled with personal identifiers. Participants may withdraw their consent for their samples to be stored for research (refer to Section 7.2.1) . 10.3.6. Committees Structure Independent Data Monitoring Committee A DSMB (also known as an IDMC) will be established to monitor safety data on an ongoing basis to ensure the continuing safety of the participants enrolled in this study. Enrollment will not be paused during these safety reviews, except after stage 1a (2, 000 participants) and stage 2a (2, 000 participants) . This committee will consist of at least 1 medical expert in the relevant therapeutic area and at least 1 statistician; committee membership responsibilities, authorities, and procedures will be documented in its charter. The DSMB will also review Day 3 safety data (ie, from Day 1 to Day 3; including safety data from the ongoing clinical studies) from participants enrolled in Stage 1a and Stage 2a, before enrollment of participants in Stage 1b and Stage 2b, respectively. Vaccination of participants in the respective age groups will be paused during these safety reviews. Ad hoc review may be performed further to the occurrence of any SAE leading to a study pausing situation as outlined in Section 6.11, or at request of the sponsor’s medical monitor or designee. The principal investigator and sponsor’s study responsible physician will inform the DSMB of any AE of concern."

At this point, the DSMB will convene and provide a recommendation to the Oversight Group, which includes a sponsor representative as a core member. In addition, the DSMB will formally monitor the infections in all groups to conclude both non- efficacy and efficacy. The DSMB will evaluate in an unblinded fashion whether superiority is established for the primary endpoints or whether non-efficacy is shown (see Section 9.8) based on a report provided by the SSG, when the prespecified boundaries have been crossed. The boundaries are based on the SPRT. Following the EUA and treatment group unblinding, the DSMB will continue to monitor participant safety during the open-label phase. The PSRT and the Janssen Medical Safety Council review all clinical and laboratory safety data during the course of the study. Statistical Support Group The SSG is the statistical support group to the DSMB; they are unblinded and provide the DSMB with the statistical analysis based on unblinded data. As the DSMB, they are independent to the company. They will continuously monitor for vaccine-associated enhanced disease by looking at each diagnosed COVID-19 case in the FAS (and also SARS-CoV-2 infections in participants requiring hospitalization; and SARS-CoV-2 infections in participants being admitted to the ICU [or equivalent]; and SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting in death [with death being at least probably related to COVID-19]) . As these infections will be monitored in real-time, and, after each confirmed respective case, the SSG will assess if a stopping boundary is reached. If the stopping boundary is met, then the SSG immediately informs the Chair of the DSMB through secure communication procedures. At this point the DSMB will convene and provide a recommendation to the Oversight Group, which includes a sponsor representative as a core member. As such, the potential harm monitoring is in real-time, resulting in the earliest indication of harm possible as soon as data come in. Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee The Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee will review all cases in the study, except for cases already adjudicated as severe, as a supplement to the algorithm described in the SAP, as well as those requiring medical intervention (such as a composite endpoint of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and ECMO, linked to objective measures such as decreased oxygenation, X-ray or CT findings) , including onset of cases, taking into account all available relevant information at the time of adjudication. More details will be provided in the revised charter of the Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee. Readjudication will occur if new information becomes available. The last adjudication for a given case will determine the status of the case for analysis. The Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee's assessment will be considered the definitive classification of the case."

AESI Adjudication Committee An AESI Adjudication Committee with appropriate expertise will be established to evaluate each suspected AESI and determine whether it is a case of TTS (see Section 8.3.7) . A Charter will be developed to describe the roles and responsibilities of the Committee. 10.3.7. Publication Policy/Dissemination of Clinical Study Data All information, including but not limited to information regarding Ad26.COV2.S or the sponsor’s operations (eg,patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, prior clinical data, formulation information) supplied by the sponsor to the investigator and not previously published, and any data generated as a result of this study, are considered confidential and remain the sole property of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to maintain this information in confidence and use this information only to accomplish this study and will not use it for other purposes without the sponsor’s prior written consent. The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by the sponsor in connection with the continued development of Ad26.COV2.S, and thus may be disclosed as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory agencies. To permit the information derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide the sponsor with all data obtained in the study. The results of the study will be reported in a Clinical Study Report generated by the sponsor and will contain data from all study sites that participated in the study as per-protocol. Recruitment performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the study will be used to determine a coordinating investigator for the study. Results of analyses performed after the Clinical Study Report has been issued will be reported in a separate report and will not require a revision of the Clinical Study Report. Study participant identifiers will not be used in publication of results. Any work created in connection with performance of the study and contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection (except any publication by the investigator as provided for below) shall be the property of the sponsor as author and owner of copyright in such work. Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary (multicenter) data and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to publish study site-specific data after the primary data are published. If an investigator wishes to publish information from the study, a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review at least 60 days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by the sponsor in writing, the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60 days to allow for"

In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity or regulatory compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress information. For multicenter study designs and sub-study approaches, secondary results generally should not be published before the primary endpoints of a study have been published. Similarly, investigators will recognize the integrity of a multicenter study by not submitting for publication data derived from the individual study site until the combined results from the completed study have been submitted for publication, within 18 months after the study end date,or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study publication. Authorship of publications resulting from this study will be based on the guidelines on authorship, such as those described in the ICMJE Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant contribution to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data for the work; and drafted the work or revised it critically for important intellectual content; and given final approval of the version to be published; and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. Registration of Clinical Studies and Disclosure of Results The sponsor will register and disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as required by law. The disclosure of the final study results will be performed after the end-of-study in order to ensure the statistical analyses are relevant. 10.3.8. Data Quality Assurance Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and study-site personnel before the study, and periodic monitoring visits by the sponsor. Written instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples. Guidelines for eCRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study-site personnel before the start of the study. The sponsor will review the eCRF for accuracy and completeness after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they will be verified for accuracy and consistency with the data sources. 10.3.9. Case Report Form Completion Case report forms are prepared and provided by the sponsor for each participant in electronic format. All data relating to the study will be recorded in the eCRF or eCOA. All eCRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by the investigator or authorized study-site personnel. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRF are accurate and correct."

Study-specific data will be transmitted in a secure manner to the sponsor. Worksheets may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate completion of the eCRF. Any such worksheets will become part of the participant’s source documents. Data must be entered into the eCRF in English. The eCRF must be completed as soon as possible after a participant visit and the forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit. If necessary, queries will be generated in the electronic data capture (eDC) tool. If corrections to aneCRF are needed after the initial entry into the eCRF, this can be done in either of the following ways:  Investigator and study-site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own initiative or as a response to an auto query (generated by the eDC tool) .  Sponsor or sponsor delegate can generate a query for resolution by the investigator and study- site personnel. 10.3.10. Source Documents At a minimum, source documents consistent in the type and level of detail with that commonly recorded at the study site as a basis for standard medical care must be available for the following: participant identification, eligibility(including relevant medical history, including anything related to footnotes hand ito the Schedules of Activities ) , and study identification; study discussion and date of signed informed consent; dates of visits; results of safety and efficacy parameters as required by the protocol; record of all AEs and follow-up of AEs; concomitant therapy; study vaccine receipt/dispensing/return records; study vaccine administration information; and date of study completion and reason withdrawal from the study, if applicable. The author of an entry in the source documents should be identifiable. Given that PROs are reports of a patient’s health condition that come directly from the patient, without interpretation by a clinician or anyone else, the responses to ePRO measures entered by studyparticipants into source records cannot be overridden by site staff or investigators. Participant- and investigator-completed scales and assessments designated by the sponsor (ie, SIC) will be recorded directly into an eDevice and will be considered source data. The participant’s e- Diary used to collect information regarding solicited signs and symptoms after vaccination will be considered source data. The documentation of the positive RT-PCR result that serves as a trigger to start procedures for COVID-19 follow-up, will be considered source data. Specific details required as source data for the study and source data collection methods will be reviewed with the investigator before the study and will be described in the monitoring guidelines (or other equivalent document) . An eSource system may be utilized, which contains data traditionally maintained in a hospital or clinic record to document medical care (eg, electronic source documents) as well as the clinical study-specific data fields as determined by the protocol. This data is electronically extracted for"

If eSource is utilized, references made to the CRF in the protocol include the eSource system but information collected through eSource may not be limited to that found in the eCRF. 10.3.11. Monitoring The sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring)to monitor this study. The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary, if allowed per local regulations. Ifon-site monitoring visits are not possible due to local regulations, restrictions and guidance, the monitor will conduct site monitoring visits and activities remotely. Additional on- site monitoring visits may be needed at a later moment in time to catch up on source data review. Remote source data review of electronic records might be performed if possible and if allowed by local/national regulations, restrictions and guidance. The monitor will record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the monitor will reviewthe source documents (eg,hospital/clinic/physician’s office medical records)to ensure adherence to the protocol. The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor and study-site personnel and are accessible for review by the sponsor study-site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the study site, the method of review must be discussed with the study-site personnel. Direct access to source documents (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of source document review and may be needed to ensure that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review will be discussed with the study-site personnel. The sponsor expects that during monitoring visits, the relevant study-site personnel will be available, the source documents will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study-related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct. In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these remote contacts, study-site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the study at the site. Central monitoring will take place for data identified by the sponsor as requiring central review. 10.3.12. On-Site Audits Representatives of the sponsor’s clinical quality assurance department may visit the study site at any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance with regulatory guidelines and company policy. Remote auditing techniques may also be utilized, if necessary. These audits will require access to all study records, including (electronic) source documents as allowed per local regulations, for inspection. Participant privacy must, however, be"

The investigator and study-site personnel are responsible for being present and available for consultation during routinely scheduled study-site audit visits conducted by the sponsor or its designees. Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by agents of any regulatory body, either as part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a regulatory submission. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor if he or she has been contacted by a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection. 10.3.13. Record Retention In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRF and all source documents that support the data collected from each participant, as well as all study documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial, and all study documents as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s) . The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents must be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new custodian. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor. If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any documentation relating to this study, the investigator/institution must permit access to such reports. 10.3.14. Study and Site Start and Closure First Act of Recruitment The first site open is considered the first act of recruitment and it becomes the study start date. Study/Site Termination The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed."

Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the vaccine. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding) , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per ICH) . This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Forthe Safety Subset, any respiratory tract infection will be reported as an AE if it occurs between the time of any vaccination through the following 28 days. Any respiratory tract infection recorded as an AE in the eCRF will be excluded from the AE analysis if the molecular test is subsequently found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory tract infections arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection will not be reported as (S) AEs in the Clinical Study Report but will be tabulated separately. Note: For time period of sponsor’s AE collection, see All Adverse Events under Section 8.3.1. Serious Adverse Event An SAE based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  Results in death  Is life-threatening (The participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  Is Medically Important*"

These should usually be considered serious. If a serious and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study vaccine and the event (eg, death from anaphylaxis) , the event must be reported as a SUSAR even if it is a component of the study endpoint (eg, all-cause mortality) . Any respiratory tract infection fulfilling the criteria of an SAE will be reported as such during the entire study. If the molecular test is positive for SARS-CoV-2, the SAE will be excluded from the SAE analysis in the Clinical Study Report, and will be tabulated separately. Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information An AE is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product reference safety information. For Ad26.COV2.S, the expectedness of an AE will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the IB. 10.4.2. Attribution Definitions Assessment of Causality The causal relationship to study vaccine is determined by the investigator. The following selection should be used to assess all AEs. Related There is a reasonable causal relationship between study vaccine administration and the AE. Not Related There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study vaccine administration and the AE. The term “reasonable causal relationship”means there is evidence to support a causal relationship. By definition, all solicited AEs at the injection site (local) will be considered related to the study vaccine administration."

Severity Criteria All AEsand laboratory data will be coded for severity using a modified version of the FDA grading table, based on version of September 200763, included in Appendix 9 . For AEs not identified in the grading table, the following guidelines will be applied: Grade 1 Mild Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional activities Grade 2 Moderate Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social and functional activities Grade 3 Severe Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities and requires medical intervention Grade 4 Potentially life- threatening Symptoms causing inability to perform basic self-care functions OR medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability OR ER visit or hospitalization For participants in the Safety Subset, the severity of solicited signs and symptoms will be graded in the e-Diary by the participant based on the severity assessment provided in the diary as well as assessed by the investigator using the toxicity grading scale in Appendix 9 . (Note: severity of the measured events will be derived from the diameter [for erythema and swelling] and the temperature measurements [for fever]) . See also Section 8.3.2. 10.4.4. Special Reporting Situations Safety events of interest on a sponsor study vaccine in an interventional study that may require expedited reporting or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:  Known overdose of a sponsor study vaccine  Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study vaccine  Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study vaccine  Medication error, intercepted medication error, or potential medication error involving a Johnson & Johnson medicinal product (with or without patient exposure to the Johnson & Johnson medicinal product, eg, product name confusion, product label confusion, intercepted prescribing or dispensing errors) Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that meets the criteria of an SAE should be recorded on the Safety Report Form of the eCRF."

Procedures All Adverse Events All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study vaccine, must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the eCRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg,cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respiratory infection”) . Investigators must record in the eCRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the AE to study therapy. All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor instructions. For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open-label studies, the participant must be provided with a “wallet (study) card”and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration of the study indicating the following:  Study number  Statement, in the local language(s) , that the participant is participating in a clinical study  Investigator’s name and 24-hour contact telephone number  Local sponsor’s name and 24-hour contact telephone number (for medical personnel only)  Site number  Participant number  Any other information that is required to do an emergency breaking of the blind Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not resolved upon the participant’s discontinuation from the study, must be followed until any of the following occurs:  The event resolves  The event stabilizes  The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available  The event can be attributed to agents other than the study vaccine or to factors unrelated to study conduct  It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (participant or health care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow-up after demonstration of due diligence with follow-up efforts) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as an SAE."

Note: Hospitalizations that were planned before the signing of the ICF, and where the underlying condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened, will not be considered SAEs. Any AE that results in a prolongation of the originally planned hospitalization is to be reported as a new SAE. The cause of death of a participant in a study, whether or not the event is expected or associated with the study vaccine, is considered a SAE. Information regarding SAEs will be transmitted to the sponsor using a SAE Form and Safety Report Form of the eCRF, which must be completed and reviewed by a physician from the study site, and transmitted in a secure manner to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow-up reports of an SAE should be transmitted in a secure manner electronically or by facsimile (fax) . Telephone reporting should be the exception and the reporter should be asked to complete the appropriate form(s) first. Adverse Events of Special Interest AESIs will be carefully monitored during the study by the sponsor. Suspected AESIs must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of site awareness irrespective of seriousness (ie, serious and non-serious AEs) or causality assessment, following the procedure described above for SAEs and will require enhanced data collection. 10.4.6. Product Quality Complaint Handling Definition A PQC is defined as any suspicion of a product defect related to manufacturing, labeling, or packaging, ie, any dissatisfaction relative to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, or performance of a distributed product, including its labeling, drug delivery system, or package integrity. A PQC may have an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, it includes any technical complaints, defined as any complaint that indicates a potential quality issue during manufacturing, packaging, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or distribution of the product or the drug delivery system. Procedures All initial PQCs must be reported to the sponsor by the study-site personnel within 24 hours after being made aware of the event. A sample of the suspected product should be maintained under the correct storage conditions until a shipment request is received from the sponsor."

Amendment 5 (07 May 2021) Overall Rationale for the Amendment: This amendment has been created to include additional safety measures due to reports of adverse events following use of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States (US) , suggesting an increased risk of thrombosis combined with thrombocytopenia.

All participants will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue to be followed for efficacy/effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity as originally planned for up to 2 years post-vaccination on Day 1. This will allow assessment of the duration of protection and immunogenicity of a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S by comparing 2 groups vaccinated approximately 4 to 6 months apart. In addition, clarification is provided that RT-PCR test results obtained from any source (including local laboratories) may be used for analyses and that confirmation by the central laboratory will no longer be required as part of the case definitions.

This is to occur as soon as possible after the Day 71 visit. All participants at the Month 6/unblinding visit will have a blood draw and nasal swab. Relevant sections were updated regarding the open-label phase. Participants to be reminded there is no data on the safety of receiving 2 different COVID-19 vaccines. Removed the following sentence at the end of Section 6.6: ""At such time, an amendment will be submitted to permit individual unblinding and to determine the approach to this situation in the Statistical Analysis Plan."" As the vaccine is highly efficacious against severe disease, hospitalization and death, it is considered ethical to offer the active vaccine to the placebo controls in this study. Hereby, an unblinding visit will be scheduled to inform all participants about their study vaccine allocation as well as to offer all placebo recipients Ad26.COV2.S after EUA, conditional licensure or approval in any country. Taking blood samples and nasal swabs from all participants will allow the comparison of efficacy and immunogenicity results in a placebo-controlled manner up to the point of the Month 6/unblinding visit, as well as having a new baseline read-out for the remainder of the study. The 6 Month visit with a broadened visit window will be used as an unblinding visit to allow for rapid cross over in the context of logistic issues. Investigators will be encouraged to follow health authority guidelines on prioritization of immunization when feasible. All participants will be counselled to continue practicing other public health/preventative measures that were introduced at the start of this pandemic (eg, social distancing, face masks, frequent hand washing) , in compliance with local and national guidelines. 1 .1 Synopsis 6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 6.7 Continued Access to Study Vaccine After the End of the Study Additional changes needed to allow unblinding prior to authorization/licensure and simultaneous participation in an Expanded Access Program or a Phase 3B study (eg, Sisonke/TOGETHER in South Africa) .To allow participants in an Expanded Access Program for Ad26.COV2.S prior to EUA, conditional licensure or approval in any country to continue to be followed in VAC31518COV3001. 6.4 Unblinding and Open-label Phase (added) Describes the conditions under which participants who received placebo initially may be vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S.

In addition, any RT-PCR test not meeting the above criteria can only be used for determination of an asymptomatic case. Confirmation by the central laboratory will not be required as part of any of the case definitions.Based on data seen thus far, there was a high concordance of results between the central and local laboratories, therefore it is deemed reasonable to use RT-PCR results from local laboratories to confirm cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1 .1 Synopsis 8.1.3.6 Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee 10.3.6 Committees Structure Added text describing adjudication of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and cases requiring hospitalization, ICU, ventilator support or ECMO and death including date of onset and reasons for the classification.

The applicable secondary and exploratory endpoints were updated similarly to also include COVID-19 cases with onset at least 28 days post double-blind vaccination. In addition, the total sample size was reduced from 60, 000 to approximately 40, 000 participants. The protocol is further amended to change the conditions for monitoring whether efficacy greater than 30% is achieved using the sequential monitoring algorithm: (1) The minimum number of COVID-19 cases meeting the primary case definition needed to start the efficacy monitoring was modified to at least 42 instead of 20, (2) The need for a follow-up of 8 weeks for 50% of the participants prior to an initial look at an efficacy signal if the other conditions are met was removed.

The applicable secondary and exploratory endpoints were updated to also include COVID-19 cases with onset at least 28 days post- vaccination, in addition to from 14 days post-vaccination.This change will allow for formal testing and reporting of the primary endpoint counting cases from 28 days post-vaccination as an additional condition for success along with the 14 days post- vaccination endpoint results. Maintaining the original primary endpoint will preserve trial integrity. This approach will allow to provide the most accurate description of the vaccine efficacy and to assess vaccine efficacy as early as 14 days post-vaccination. 3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTSDeletion of the exploratory endpoint relating to evaluation of the occurrence, severity and duration of COVID-19 episodes in participants who received Ad26.COV2.S, as compared to placebo, by the Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee, previously known as the Clinical Evaluation Committee.The Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee only exists to determine severe/critical cases of COVID-19."

The paragraph on the operational futility was removed.The incidence of moderate to severe COVID-19 seen in the US and reported in other COVID-19 vaccine studies is significantly higher than assumed at the time of protocol planning. Furthermore, based on that incidence and modeling, there is a high degree of probability that an efficacy signal meeting the prespecified criteria in this amendment will be reached at, or prior to, the time when 50% of participants will have been followed for 8 weeks from the time of vaccination. 1 .1 Synopsis 9.5.1 Primary Endpoints Evaluation The conditions for monitoring whether efficacy greater than 30% is achieved using the sequential monitoring algorithm were changed: (1) The minimum number of COVID-19 cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination meeting the primary case definition needed to start the efficacy monitoring was modified to at least 42 instead of 20. (2) The need for a follow-up of 8 weeks for 50% of participants prior to an initial look at an efficacy signal if the other conditions are met, was removed. In addition, text was added to clarify the timing of primary and interim analyses.(1) The minimum number of COVID-19 cases was increased to have a more robust signal at the time of the efficacy declaration. (2) This change was made to expedite submissions to ensure the vaccine is made available to the public as soon as possible. Following 50% of participants for 8 weeks from the day of vaccination meets the sponsor’s understanding of the requirement for 8 weeks median follow-up for a 40, 000-participant study. 1 .1 Synopsis 3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 9.5.2 Secondary Endpoints A secondary objective and endpoint were added assessing the efficacy of the vaccine in the prevention of molecularly confirmed, severe/critical COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days post-vaccination and 28 days post- vaccination. With the increased incidence of disease that is being observed, the likelihood of having enough severe cases of COVID-19 to examine vaccine efficacy against this endpoint has increased. Vaccine efficacy against severe disease is considered an important endpoint for a 1-dose vaccine. 1 .1 Synopsis 1.3.1 All Participants 3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 8.1.3 Efficacy Assessments 8.1.3.5 SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion Assessment 8.1.4 Immunogenicity Assessments 10.2 Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory TestsAn exploratory objective and endpoint were added assessing the effect of the vaccine on confirmed asymptomatic or undetected infections by testing serologic conversion between baseline and 28 days post-vaccination.This change allows the evaluation of the effect of the vaccine on asymptomatic infections up to Day 29, in line with other efficacy endpoints."

Participant medical data (electronic health records, claims, laboratory data from other care settings) prior to, during and following participation in the study (real- world data) is important to obtain in order to better understand the impact of prior medical history on the response to immunization and the impact of immunization on efficacy and duration of efficacy as well as adverse events that may occur during and after completion of the study. The technique proposed to obtain this data, ie, tokenization and matching procedures, allows for such data to be obtained without violation of participant confidentiality.

The safety data from Cohort 1a and Cohort 3 of the FIH study with the Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010vp dose level were deemed acceptable. Since all criteria for proceeding to Phase 3 were met by the 5x1010vp dose, the sponsor decided to use this dose for further evaluation in the Phase 3 study VAC31518COV3001. 1 .1 Synopsis 2.1 Study Rationale 4.1 Overall Design 9.2.1 Efficacy (Total Sample Size) 9.2.4 Safety (Safety Subset) The protocol has been adjusted to reflect the selected sample size of approximately 60, 000 participants. A detailed rationale for the sample size selection has been added to Section 9.2 Sample Size Determination of the protocol.Based on epidemiological modeling and currently available data (further explained in Section 9.2.1) , the maximum sample size of 60, 000 participants was selected. 1 .1 Synopsis 9.5.1 Primary Endpoint Evaluation The trigger for the evaluation of the primary endpoint has been modified, adding 3 conditions, one related to available follow-up information, one related to the number of severe/critical COVID-19 cases and one related to the number of cases meeting the primary endpoint definition of moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 in the elderly population, that need to be met.In order to ensure the evaluation of the primary endpoint provides sufficient information to assess the benefit/risk and potentially support an Emergency Use Authorization. 1 .1 Synopsis 1.3.1 All Participants 3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 8.1.4 Immunogenicity Assessments 9.2.1 Efficacy (Total Sample Size) 9.5.1 Primary Endpoint Evaluation 9.5.2 Secondary Endpoints 9.5.1.1 Study Monitoring 10.2 Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory TestsThe time to begin counting COVID-19 cases after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S has been decreased from at least 28 days post-vaccination to at least 14 days post-vaccination (Day 15) .Based on preliminary data from Cohort 1b of study VAC31518COV1001, showing robust immunology data 14 days after vaccination that are similar to the data seen 28 days after vaccination."
