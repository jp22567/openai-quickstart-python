Outline of the research : Please provide a brief outline of the proposed research under the sub -headings below. N.B. below we included a scientic and lay person abstracts for your assistance as by way of introducing the project briefly. 200-word lay abstract Mindfulness is a popular set of knowledge and practical tec hniques that can help people cope with stress . It includes meditation practices, everyday small practices to break and change usual habits, as well as under standing and developing competencies to be more aware of thoughts, emotions and physical sensations . Mindfulness can help not to excessively react to them, or becoming distressed by them . In persistent pain (pain that lasts more than three months), mindfu lness is thought to improve depression, quality of life, and even how sore people feel . There are numerous versions of mindfulness and mindfulness -based therapies. One approach, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), is based on science (as opposed to religion or common sense). ACT helps people to learn about and apply skills to cope with thoughts, emotions and sensations without getting upset, distracted or impeded by them. It also assists people to develop the ability to set clear goals that matter i n their life. ACT evaluates successful outcomes in this areas (called ‘processes’) and how they link to changes in pain, mood and stress. However, more puritan mindfulness courses tend to only focus on the latter. Research on mindfulness courses for chron ic pain, can show that people improve, but not so well what changes in people’s experience and skill s, or how they apply these. We also know that pain sufferers who attend mindfulness courses for stress, may say it is not so relevant to their pain difficu lties."
18,page_18,"HSSD Research Ethic ’s Committee v2018 Page 19 of 68 In this study we want to explore how both mindfulness for stress and mindfulness for pain courses , online, contribute to: - how specific areas of ACT and other mindfulness learning change If/how these link with practical skills and any emotional or improvements in the participants’ quality of life, use of medication or GP visits . To help us evalu ate this, we will ask participants to complete scientifically accepted questionnaires and interview them. We will then use statistical methods and qua litative methods to evaluate change. This may help us with better supporting chronic pain sufferers wit h choices around mindfulness as a standalone or as part of attending intensive pain -coping programmes involving different professions. Scientific abs tract of the work proposed In chronic ( persistent ) pain, mindfulness can improve coping, depression, quali ty of life, and reduce pain intensity. Both Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT ; Hayes, Strosahl et al. 1999) and mindfulness research, including Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR, Kabat - Zinn 1982) and M indfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT, Segal, Williams et al. 2002) provide theore tical and/or practical frameworks for mindful process measurement. However, numerous methodological and contextual limitations exist within the con text of pain management centres that are increasingly providing mindfulness based interventions to pain sufferers. This has potential implications for whether implementing mindfulness skills is done with clarity , good governance about whether, where and h ow it is helpful, or whether it even can be harmful, duplicate other treatments or unnecessarily burden pai n sufferers with something that is not needed. In this context, it also has significant implications on any required development of teachers’ compete ncies. No current research has attempted to unify ACT and other mindfulness process measurement (how peop le get to change – as opposed to what change they achieve) or to establish the potential contribution and relevance of different specific mindfulness courses in chronic pain patients’ treatment pathways and outcomes. A community -based multidisciplinary -pain-management naïve sample (N=100) of chronic pain patients will be recruited in primary care and placed on a time -set waiting list and then randomly allocated to one of two stand ardised active online mindfulness treatment s - stress or pain group"
19,page_19,"HSSD Research Ethic ’s Committee v2018 Page 20 of 68 condition s. Measurement will include theoretically validated process and outcome measurement. Treatment adherence and fidelity will be independently evaluated from recorded session s and inter-rater agreement checks performed. Quantitative analysis will be perform ed to include descriptive statistics, analysis of variance , session -by-session process change trends, and post -hoc analysis on GP and A&E visits. Qualitative thematic analysis will complement and bolster the findings of the quantitative phase to include a dditional process variables unaccounted for by the ACT model, patient experience and descriptive comparison of the two active conditions , including d escriptive statistics comparing frequency of reported themes between the two treatments . i. Aims and objecti ves: This study aims to explore and better understand the contribution of standardised group -based mindfulness courses to theoretically valid and c oherent mindful -change processes. OBJECTIVES 1. To explore the differential contribution of standardised stres s and pain -explicit group - based mindfulness courses on mindful -change process as described in the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) psycholo gical flexibility model (Hayes, Strosahl et al. 1999) on a chronic pain population that is naïve to multidisciplinary pain treatment. 2. To improve on methodological and c onfounding issues inherent in current research on mindfulness for chronic pain. 3. To contribute to the understanding of the potential relevance and r ole of standardised stress and pain explicit mindfulness courses in chronic pain treatment outcomes and pathw ays. a. Hypotheses and/or research question(s) to be addressed :"
20,page_20,"HSSD Research Ethic ’s Committee v2018 Page 21 of 68 Quantitative project What is the differential contribution of online stress and pain explicit mindfulness courses to mindful -change process variables and outcomes? More specifically: 1. What individual contribution do mindfulness for stress (MfS; Hennessy 2017) and Mindfulness for Health – Mindfulness Based Pain Manage ment (MfH -MBPM; Burch and Penman 2013) courses make to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (AC T) processes and relevant chronic pain outcomes in pain -management -naïve chronic pain sufferers? 2. Which associations exist between weekly course content and specific process change? Qualitative project Given consideration of: a) The practical impossibility of quantitatively measur ing all the relevant process variables, b) The potential questionnaire burden, and c) The sheer number of processes and mechani sms contained within both ACT and chronic pain literature on mindfulness courses and meditation, we aim to u tilise thematic analysis to complement the quantitative findings. This will allows us to explore the impact of both versions of courses , reduce que stionnaire burden in the quantitative analysis, and contribute to answering the following questions. a) Which r elevant ACT -process variables are reported by participants and how have they changed? b) Do participants report the presence of other contributing va riables considered within the mindfulness -groups literature in chronic pain, such as group cohesion, engageme nt and the impact of teachers’ experience on reported change ? c) How frequently are the se variables reported across the two groups , and in which direc tion? (improvement/deterioration/no change). This component will take the form of descriptive statistics and qualitative comparison of occurrence within patients’ interview - derived themes."
21,page_21,"HSSD Research Ethic ’s Committee v2018 Page 22 of 68 ii. Rationale, to include a brief synopsis of the background to the research: Mindfulness can be defined operationally as Paying attention; on purpose in the present moment and non-judgmentally (Kabat -Zinn 2013) Evidence -based (often referred to as ‘secular’) mindfulness has seen an exponentially increasing interest in the scientific literature and the estimated numbe r of published scientific journals has recently been reported to have grown from one single journal in 1982, to 667 scientific publications in 2016 (Kabat -Zinn 2017) and in excess of 30,000 Media Pieces in Newspapers (Van Dam, van Vugt et al. 2018) (extract from Kabat -Zinn 2017) However, there are unknowns around the mechanisms (the ‘vehicles’ of change) by which mindfulness works, and that these must be understood in order to avoid continu ed pr ofessional and public misinformation, poor research and ultimately, potential harm to the end user. (Van Dam, van Vugt et al. 2018) . ISSUES WITH AND IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT WE CURRENTLY DEFINE AS MINDFULNESS AND ITS APPLICATION TO CHRONIC PAIN"
22,page_22,"HSSD Research Ethic ’s Committee v2018 Page 23 of 68 Within the context of the exponential growth of interest in and research of mindfulness (e.g. Kabat -Zinn 2017, Van Dam, van Vugt et al. 2018) including in the treatment of chronic p ain (Bawa, Mercer et al. 2015, Hilton, Hempel et al. 2017) , several factors have contributed to the consid eration for the current project: 1. The integration of mindfulness based interventions in gold -standard multidis ciplinary treatments for chronic pain, such as ACT (BPS 2013) , 2. Researchers’ calls to improve intention to treat, to better understand facets of what i s unde rstood to be mindfulness, better targetting of and a more unified approach to mindf ulness -change proces s variables – thus aiming to reduce treatment burden . 3. There are relevant mindful mechanisms and processes specifically in chronic pain that have ma de a case from both the ACT and the more purist mindfulness research derived from group based interventions o r meditation alone in chronic pain – and that are not currently typically or routinetly included in mindfulness groups research for chronic pain. 4. Methodological issues including a. lack of clarity about providers’ competencies and requirements in chronic p ain, b. arbitrary removal of essential components of a given intervention, c. often no active or waiting list control condition and d. no consideration a t all of utilising a theoretically valid and coherent process - measurement frameworks nor consideration for th e teachers’ competencies requirements when delivering mindfulness courses to chronic pain patients (e.g. Do bkin 2008, Day, Jensen et al. 2014, Van Dam, Hobkirk et al. 2014, Day 2017, Harrison, Scott et al. 2017, Hilt on, Hempel et al. 2017) . From reviewing the evidence quoted, the research on mindfulness for chronic pain has exclusively utilised standardised m indfulness groups typically aimed at stress populations, excluded less researched pain explicit (contextually relevant to pain) mindfulness group interventions, ignored theoretically valid mindful -process measurement provided by the ACT framework, or not c ontrolled appropriately for significant counfouding factors. This debate is increasingly important conside ring that recently published audit data suggets that"
23,page_23,"HSSD Research Ethic ’s Committee v2018 Page 24 of 68 mindfulness in one format or the other, or as part of ACT -based multidisciplinary treatment is being provided regularly in pain management centres in the UK . This has been leading, possibly premautrely, to discussion about providing training in mindfulness competencies for pain practitioners such as mindfulness enquiry or leading meditations (e.g. Williams, Watson et al. 2017) , which may lead, in turn, to implementing pro fessional skills without sound, targetted and theoretically evidenced rationale. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES WITH CURRENT MINDFULNESS RESEARCH AND THE IMPROVEMENTS WITH THIS STUDY The current research will therefore aim to address and control, some of the cu rrently reported methodological issues in research on group mindfulness based interventions (MBIs), including: - Utilising a waiting list for the wh ole group as a control prior to randomisation. This will act as a pseudo treatment -as-usual condition and wil l track key outcome and process measures across this time. - Utilising two active interventions, Mfs and MfH -MBPM, with standardised, transparent, comparable in content, time and delivery process that can therefore be easily evaluated for adherence and treat ment fidelity. - Using e stablished and matched teacher’s competence in line with UK Network standards (MBTT 2011) for the intervention delivered. - Utilising the s ame ‘dosage’ and type of intervent ions (groups with similar structure, delivery times and requirements for practice) utilising MfH -MBPM and Mf S (Burch and Penm an 2013, Hennessy 2017) - Using appropriate psychometric and qualitative analysis and targetting of explicit process -change. - Reporting adverse side effects - Measures in line with IMMPACT recommendations for research on chronic pain (Dworking et al. , 2005) . iii.

Once recruited, participants will be required to complete baseline outcome and process measures, 8 -weeks ahead of beginning their 8 -week course. Ra ndomisation will take place at this point to ei ther the stress or the pain course. They will repeat this assessment on week 1 of the course and then again at week 4. They will also complete only process measures weekly during the course, in order to explor e for links between weekly course content and s pecific process change. Posttreatment assessment will be completed within four weeks of treamtent completion and at 3 -month follow up. How this study will improve on previous research The current study therefore offers an opportunity to impact on the understanding , application of mindfulness and management of chronic pain in the following ways : - Improved targeting of mindfulness courses as part of multidisciiplinary treatment for chronic pain - A better unde rstanding of the contribution that mindfulness courses may provide in chronic pain patient treatment pathways, as improved understanding of their mindful - process -change relevance, may allow improved targetting and avoid unecessary duplicatio n, treatment b urden or even harm. - Improving the understanding of the requirement for and development of relevant teaching/training competencies in mindfulness in this area. - Potentially contributing to establishing whether full mindfulness courses have a place (and what that is) building up to, or as part of multidi sciplinary pain management programmes or possibly ahead of these, within the community or as an adjunct to them - for chornic pain sufferers. Procedure: 100 people with chronic pain (defined as > three month s duration) will be recruited from primary care and social media adverts in Jersey (the social media participants will be required to register their interest via their GP). The allocation (stress or pain) will not be concealed from the participants, treatm ent providers or the researcher. However, analy sis of the data ill be conducted blind to allocation. Post -treatment assessment will be completed within four week of"

The sample size has been determined to recru it 8-12 participants for each of four stress an d pain courses to be administered with a recruitment of 50 and a minimum target of 30 per active intervention. Qualitative study: DESIGN AND SETTING A qualitative study involving semi -structured interviews will be held, with a topic guide informed by the ACT psychological flexibility model (Hayes, Strosahl et a l. 1999) and Day’s framework for mindfulness -relevant processes (Day, Jens en et al. 2014) in chronic pain, and based on mindfulness research improvement based on adaptations of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for chronic pain (Day 2017) . Exclusion criteria (in addition to quantitative study criteria): Non-completers (participants who completed less than 6/8 course sessions) Decli ned to take part in interviews SAMPLING An opportunity sample from all patients invited to take part to the quantiative research aspect, invited as part of the intial quantitative study informed consent proce ss. We will invite all participants from the sa mple, aiming from 10 -15 participants from each the stress and pain version of the courses, hence a total sample of 30 participants maximum and a target of 10 completed interviews for each intervention . iv. Proposed method(s) of data analysis Quantitative: PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS After randomisation, we will carry out preliminary baseline analysis using independent group t - tests to establish no signifcant demographic (age, education, duration of pain, number of comorbid medical conditions, visits for pain the past three months) or psychometric differences between the groups. This will act as a pseudo -waiting list treatment -as-usual (TAU) control group."

These will include a practical selection of primary outcome measures, treatment process measures, as well as measures of emotional functioning, patient rating of change and change in medication use. Post-hoc analysis Will include number of GP and A&E visits comparing the waiting period and from the end of treatment to follow up. STATISTICAL POWER This study will be a mo dification of a previous pilot test trial of a brief, widely inclusive UK primary care setting (McCracken, Sato and Taylor, 2013), to include the whole sample of participants acting as a waiting list control, randomly allocated to two active treatment cond itions. In line with this study which was delivered in a population area of 119,000 people, power calculations were not completed, nor wer e formal predictions of signfic ant treatment effects . This was on the basis that the same treatment format and in a co mmunity based sample had not been tried before and demonstrated of successful rectuirment of > 60 participants within a two -month period and reporting moderate effect sizes for the active condition. Given the whole island population of Jersey is estimated currently at 106,000, power calculations will n ot be provided in this study as the sample size was deemed appropriate in the previous that also cited"

PROCESS AND OUTCOME MEASURES Process and outcome measu rement has included consideration of factors such participants’ burden, requirement for validated ACT and mindfulness groups process measurement (Day, Jensen et al. 201 4, Day 2017, Feliu -Soler, Montesinos et al. 201 8), relevant recommendations on measurement of outcome in chronic pain (Dworkin, Turk et al. 2005) and our current research team resources. Ultimately, in attemptin g to have a clearly targeted study, we have bee n unable to have comprehensive quantitative measurement and the qualitative analysis will go some way to compensate for that. Process measures: In line with a recent review of validated and acceptable measur es of psychological flexibility in chronic pain (Feliu -Soler, Montesinos et al. 2018) : 1) Acceptance a. The 7 -item Acceptance and Action Questionnaire v.2 (AAQ -II, Bond et.al, 2011) will be utilised to measure the person’s change in w illingness to experience general unpleasant feelings and emotions that are not pain related (not to unfairly disadvantage the stress version of the course) b. Pain Acceptance The 8 -item Chronic Pain Acceptance Qu estionnaire (Fish, McGuire et al. 2010) 2) Contact with the Present Moment: The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (Brown and Ryan 2003) will be utilised. 3) Self in c ontext : The Self Experience Questionnaire (Yu, McCracken et al. 2016) (SEQ, Yu, McCracken & Nor ton, 2016) will be utlised. 4) Cognitive fusion: the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (Gillander et. al , 2014) 5) Values: The Chronic Pain Values Inventory (McCracken and Yang 2006) 6) Committed Action: The 8 -item Committed A ction Questionnaire (McCracken, Chilcot et al. 2015) Outcome measures: Pain Intensity and interference on quality of life : the Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form (Tan, Jensen et al. 2004) , numeric rating scale (NRS) on intensity (scale 0 -10) incl uding, worst, least"

TOPIC GUIDE Do you have any previous experience in taking part in clinical trials or medical research? I’m really interested in finding out what were your initial expectations and feelings about the mindfulness course? What do you feel you have gained from attending th e course? What (if any) changes have you noticed in your health/quality of life? [probe for anything getting better or worse: health, emotional, physical, practical] How do you feel the course has contributed to how you manage chronic pain? This study has involved you doing some reading, meditation and practices in everyday life (‘habit releasers’). Would you give me a sense as to whether you have managed to engage in these practices? [Ask about how long typic ally they have practiced daily formal meditatio n; are they still practising?; What has stuck and what hasn’t?] Is there anything else you would like to say about your experience of the course? How do you feel the teacher contributed to your experience of t he course? What contribution do you feel the gr oup has made to what you have learnt? Since attending the course: - Can you tell me if you have noticed any changes in pain?"
31,page_31,"HSSD Research Ethic ’s Committee v2018 Page 32 of 68 - Have you started or stopped any other treatments for your pain? [what and why] (prom pt re prescribed and other treatments e.g. CBT/ diet/complementary medicines/cannabis) - What have you noticed about your thoughts? [prompt re whether they notice their thoughts more or less in the past and future and whether they can bring themselves back to the present more or less – and how do they ach ieve that? ] - What would you say the course has contributed to how you respond to thoughts and emotions? - How has the course contributed to how you respond to pain within yourself and in what you do or don’t do ? - What changes you have noticed in how you man age or experience bad days with pain? - How has the course influenced what you see is important to you in life? - What have you noticed in terms of whether you do or do not see important things through ? [promp t if needed: do you notice whether you avoid im portant stuff has changed in any way? If ‘yes’, how?] - How do thoughts and feelings shape you as a person and in life? General prompts to be used flexibly include: What was that like? Can you give me an exam ple of that? How did you feel about that? v. Description of site(s) / facilities required : The study (delivery of courses and interviews) will take place online . Given the expected sample size (approximate ly 50 per active condition) for the quantitativ e project, it is likely there will be a requirement to run three courses twice per week (two stress and two pain) over eight weeks . This will be done around the current pain clinic requirements and At coordinated and pre -agreed times. 3. Ethical issues : Please summarise what you think are the ethical issues inherent in this study. The"
32,page_32,"HSSD Research Ethic ’s Committee v2018 Page 33 of 68 questions that follow will give you the opportunity to demonstrate how you will manage these issues in the conduct of your resear ch. Potential to cause distress There is a chance that patients may become upset talking about chronic pain, related or unrelated emotional difficulties and there may be risk, during the course or the interviews. If this should occur , the pa rticipant will be given the option to stop the course/int erview and be linked with the consultant clinical psychologist overseeing the project (who will be available throughout the duration of the courses for supervision ) and, if required, case management and signpost ing to the GP or appropriate mental health se rvices. Also see Risk Assessment in Appendix. In addition, the lead researcher will remain as contactable throughout the project and will provide advice, risk assessment and signposting throughout the project. At the outset of each group and as part of gro up agreement and rules, all participants will be made aware of the need to speak to the facilitators should they experience any significant adverse physical or emotional difficulties requiring further medical o r psychological attention. i. Are there any po tential risks or adverse effects to participants? As well as any physical risks or adverse effects, you should consider the potential for discomfort, distress, inconvenience or change in lifestyle for the parti cipants, and explain how these will be managed . See Risk Assessment ii. Are there any particular requirements or abstensions that will be imposed on participants? (Eg. multiple attendance sessions; abstention from alcohol, tobacco, etc.). Participants w ill be required to attend all 8 sessions of th e mindfulness course and will be classed as completers with a minimum of 6 sessions. Participants will be required to abst ain from alcohol, illegal or otherwise mentally impairing substances. Participants wi ll be required to keep a log of their personal -time practice, read the appropriate course manual/book and complete their home mindfulness practice."
33,page_33,"HSSD Research Ethic ’s Committee v2018 Page 34 of 68 iii. Are there any potential benefits to participants, or to the wider society? Given the evidence presente d earlier and the broader evidence of mindfuln ess, the current costs of attending mindfulness courses, participants will be able to complete a full and Breathworks accredited Stress or Pain Course, which also provides the basis for future mindfulnes teache r training in line with current UK standards. These courses would usually retail in the region of £190 -£350 per head. As the courses will be offered to a community sample, this will not prevent patients with chronic pain from accessing the current provisi on at the local pain management centre. In act ual fact, it will give opportunity to more people to access both stress and pain coruses. Above and beyond the benefits to understanding research, they will contribute to furthering understanding, improving p rovision of pain specialist services and to pa in professionals competency standards. The benefits of mindfulness go beyond pain and include those to the workplace, team working, productivity, stress and performance and general wellbeing. iv. Are there any potential risks or adverse effects to researc hers themselves ? Given the open recruitment via social media, there is the potential risk of unknown participants’ forensic or problematic history. However, this will be mitigated by requesting all participan ts seek to access the research project via ini tial contact with their GP surgeries. v. Where samples will be taken from the participant, please state which samples, the amount and frequency of them and whether the sample would be taken as part of the norma l patient care or specifically for the purpose s of the research? If a sample would normally be taken as part of usual patient care - will the amount taken be any greater due to the participation of the participant in the research? Not applicable vi. Where the research involves the use of radioactive iso topes, please confirm that the dosage proposed to be used in the research has been approved by a Radiological Safety Committee or Administration of Radioactive Substances"

(Eg. will any of the participa nts be students, subordinates or colleagues of the investigator, or staff members of the Unive rsity?) Not applicable. However, given the nature of Jersey, participants may be known to the research team, may b e acquaintances or fellow colleagues. This is unavoidable. 4. Informed consent : Will informed consent be obtained from the research participants? Yes No If ‘YES’, please give details of who will obtain consent and how this will be d one, including how long participants will have to decide whether or not to take part. If ‘NO’, please explain why not. Participants will be initially approached with support of GP practices and local social media pages for working age adults (18 yrs and above), given that chronic pain speciality in children and young adults is a specialty within itself."

Please state any financial or other interests (including any c onflicts of interest) that the a pplicant, supervisor(s) o r employer has in relation to the conduct of this research. The Lead Researcher is a Breathworks Accredited Mindfulness Teacher since 2013 and trainer since 2018. He is also an ACT practitioner and part of th e Brewathworks Work Advisory Group (2018). How ever, given the project will evaluate the data utilsiing both Breathworks packages as active interventions, and with equal provision of both packages, there is not a direct preference for a given therapeutic ap proach. Breathworks have agreed to support fin ancially the project and contribute to assessing the fidelity of the interventions provided. However, the analysis of data will be performed blind by Dr Ben Rosser at LJMU, in order to manage any potentail conf lict. There is no financial incentive or rewa rd for the applicant, supervisor or employer in conducting this research. 2. Please state the amount of payment, if any, that will be paid to the researcher(s) [over and above their normal salary] . None 3. What additional costs will be incurred by HSSD through the conduct of the research, and how are these to be met? Please state the details of any funding which has been secured for the research . Currently Breathworks are considering the funding of two te achers to deliver the mindfulness intervention s (flights, accommodation and subsistence), estimated to be in the region of £ 8000 plus £8160 in travel, accommodation and subsistence costs. We have also applied for in the region of £13000 to cover the qual itative analysis of the"

The pain clinic lead and project sponsor, Dr Chat Taylor, has agreed for the project to be part of the Pain Clinic r esearch work that forms part of the lead resea rcher and assist ant psychologist / research assistant remit, and therefore, as part of the job plan of both members of staff. It is also in line with the pain clinic strategy around contribution to teaching and training on self -managing pain in Jersey. We have however showed the monetary value of this contribution as part of any requests for support and grant requests. Dr Taylor has agreed to fund materials (books that are used as course manuals, stationery fo r psychometric and interview material, floor m ats, refreshments and utilisation of group room within the premises outside of the times used by the clinics regular courses ). The anticipated cost of books is in the region of £1000 , mats & stationary £200 & r efreshments £40 Total: £1240 Stationary cost s will be will be mitigated with the use of online survey tools where possible (surveymonkey). 4. What arrangements are in place for monitoring the conduct of the research, and dealing with any issues, complaint s or adverse effects which may arise from the research? [Note that, in the first instance, complaints should be addressed to the Academic Research Supervisor or the sponsoring Head of Department] The lead researcher will be the point of contact for any a dverse effects (distressing thoughts or emotio ns) arising from the intervention. However, to mitigate this, no participant with current diagnosis of PTSD or active psychiatric condition requiring treatment, or drugs and alcohol dependence will be accepted on the trial (part of the exclusion criteria) as part of the recruitment process."

Researchers should carry personal i nsurance and/or be covered by insur ance, or provis ion made by the employer. Research sponsored by a pharmaceutical company r equires adherence to Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Guidelines . Research undertaken as part of an academic p rogramme of study must have university sponsorship . Part 3 – The Research Section 2 Outline of research It is important that the c ommittee is made aware of the status and type of participant to be recruited and the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of individuals. Please note that in the case of clinical trials, t he relative level of acceptable risk may be greater in therapeutic research in patient volunteers (where there is a balancing factor of potential benefit) than in non-therapeutic research using ""healthy vol unteers"". You must state whether participants will be selected with specific reference to sex, age group and status. You should make clear what proportion of participants recruited (if any) will act as controls. The effectiveness and propriety of recrui tment and selection procedures must be clear. Participant s must not be coerced or induced to participate . Any conflict of interest must be declared, particularly in cases where a participant 's relationship with the researcher could raise issues as to the willingness or motive of the participant in consenting to participation (e.g. students). Section 3 Ethical issues In discussing the potential risks and hazards which are associated with the research, applicants are required to specify the degree of pr obability (e.g. percentage terms or as unlikely, possible, likely, expected) and to categorise the risk (e.g. serious, moderate, minor, negligible or in percentage terms). The c ommittee is concerned about the possib ility and"

Section 4 Informed consent Informed consent is a requirement from all research participants . Where problems may be encountered as a result of language or hearing difficulties, the applicant must explain how these difficulties are to be handled - e.g. interpreter, translation of documents In any circumstances where the investigator does not anticipate being in a position to obtain participant consent (e.g. studies involving emergency patients, the unconscious, children under 16 who are not judged competent by the investigator to consent in their own right etc.) the applicant must pr ovide full details of the course propose d to be taken with regard to consent and the justification for it. The answer must address the patient's best interests: i.e. will or could enrolment into the research be of ther apeutic value to the individual . Participant i nformation sheets and consen t forms must be prepared and presented as separate documents or as an appendix to the application . In respect of clinical trial research, the participant’s GP should be notified before the research commences. Par ticipant consent to such notification (a nd to further related communication with the GP if necessary) should therefore generally be incorporated into the consent form (and notice of this requirement added to the information sheet).
