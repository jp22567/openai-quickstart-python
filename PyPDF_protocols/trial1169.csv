Study Rationale This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fremanezumab -vfrm on interictal migraine related burden in adult participants age 18 to 65 years old , who meet International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition ( ICHD- III; Appendix 5) criteria for migraine with or without aura and have 4 to 22 migraine days per month. 2.2. Background The burden of Migraine can extend well beyond the pain phase and affect more than just work and school attendance. Patients with frequent Episodic Migraine and Chronic Migraine are known to experience the impact of migraine even on days they do not have migraine pain or associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia. Most of the focus of migraine management is placed on migraine pain and associated symptom relief and the interictal burden of migraine is often overlooked. Individuals exper iencing frequent migraine attacks regularly find themselves engaged in preparatory or compensatory behaviors, hoping to minimize lost productivity or compromised quality of life, even before attacks begin. These types of behaviors originate from the fear and dread of the inevitable migraine attacks to come and lead to a significant diminution of quality of life before the pain has even started 1,2. Patients frequently cancel plans with family and friends or avoid making commitments in the first place based on their anticipation of a migraine episodes. Even worse, these fears and behavior changes also tend to exacerbate co -occurring conditions such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders, further contributing to poor quality of life. Unfortunately, migraine prevention trials have traditionally focused on reduction of migraine days as a primary endpoint and have largely ignored the significant health and lifestyle burdens also associated with migraine and associated symptoms. 2.3. Significance This study aims to capture changes in functional impact , including but not limited to the assessment of the interictal burden of migraine after participants begin treatment with fremanezumab -vfrm . In addition to using a variety of scales to capture these changes this study will use activity trackers to allow detailed monitoring of daily activity and sleep patterns. This approach has been used in a variety of clinical trials over a wide range of disease states with success and its addition will enrich the results obtained through administration of traditional questionnaires. Specific assessments of worry, work productivity, and self- efficacy will"

Page 12 of 50 complement the overall impact of patients’ lives directly and indirectly related to response to CGRP blockade. It is hypothesized that participants treated with fremanezumab -vfrm will demonstrate improvements in a variety of measures of daily activity and attitudes . Results from this study will be a significant contribution to the medical literature and bring value to providers as they manage expectations with patients regarding the functional impact of fremanezumab - vfrm on migraine prophylaxis efforts. Moreover, this study aims to bridge the gap between the traditional focus on reduction of migraine days as a primary endpoint and the numerous other significant health and lifestyle burdens also associated with migraine and associated symptoms. 2.4.

Overall Design This is a multicenter, open label study assessing the interictal impact of fremanezumab -vfrm in participants with migraine. The study population will consist of 40 participants 18 to 65 years old, with at least 4 and up to 22 migraine days per month (inclusive) following IC HD-III criteria for migraine with or without aura. At Visit 1, the participant will sign the informed consent indicating they are willing to participate in the study and will provide basic demographic information, have a comprehensive review of their medical history and prior and concomitant medications. The subject’s migraine history will be reviewed and confirmed in accordance with the ICHD -III, by the PI or an appropriately delegated and qualified sub- Investigator. A physical and neurological examination (including vital signs) will be performed as well as a 12- lead Electrocardiography ( ECG ), screening comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP ) labs, and the PHQ-9 will be completed . Women of childbearing potential (WOCB P) will complete a urine pregnancy test. All participants will complete the MIBS -4 questionnair e. Inclusion and Exclusion criteria will also be reviewed . Participants who meet the study criteria will be dispensed the activity tracker and its associated phone application instructi ons, as well as their unique Daily Headache Diary (DHD) URL and its instructions. Participants will then enter into a 28-day run-in period. During the 28- day run- in period, all participants will be monitored through the use of electronic Daily Headache Diary (DHD) to ensure they continue to meet all inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria. During this run-in period, participants will continue treating their migraines and other defined conditions with their usual treatment providing it has been stable for a minimum of 3 months. Daily electronic diaries will be used to assess symptoms and treatment response throughout the run-in period. Visit 2 will take place 28 to 33 days following Visit 1. Those participants who (1) continue to meet eligibility criteria (2) experienced 4 -22 migraine days that meet ICHD -III criteria for migraine and (3) have completed at least 23/28 diary days will be eligible to be enrolled into the study. At this visit a physical examination (including vital signs) will be performed , WOCBP will complete a urine pregnancy test , and all participants will complete the PHQ -9. M edical history and/or adverse events and concomitant medications will be reviewed and updated as needed. Participant’s DHD will be reviewed for compliance, and participants will complete the following questionnaires: • MIBS -4"

Discontinuation of Study Intervention and Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal 7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue (definitive discontinuation) study intervention . If study intervention is definitively discontinued, the participant will not remain in the study. See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 7.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study • A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. • At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit should be conducted, as shown in the SoA. See SoA for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed . • The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time . • If the participant withdraws consent for disclos ure of future info rmation, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent . • If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested , and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 7.3. Lost to Follow up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: • The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importanc e of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study."

No part of this report, or any information contained therein, may be disseminated without the written consent of Clinvest Research LLC. Page 26 of 50 • Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (e .g., television, cell phones). • Vital signs will be measured in a s emi-supine position after 5 minutes rest and will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse. 8.2.3. Electrocardiograms • 12-lead ECG ’s will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3 ). The heart rate , PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be measured/calculated . Investigators will read final EKG’s and determine any abnormalities. The overall interpretation and determination of the clinical relevance of ECG findings will be the responsibility of the investigator 8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments • See Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to th e SoA for the timing and frequency. • The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. • All laboratory tests with values considered clinically sign ificantly abnormal during participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. o If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified and Clinvest and the medical monitor notified. o All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the SoA. o If laboratory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE or dos e modification), then the resul ts must be recorded in the CRF."

Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring Participants being treated with fremanezumab -vfrm should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for suicidal ideation and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior, especially at the beginning and end of the course of intervention , or at the time of dose changes, either increases or decreases. Consideration should be given to discontinuing the study medication in participant s who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior, following a risk assessment. Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior/ intervention emergent suicidal ideation and behavior will be monitored during the study using PHQ-9. 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative). The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinu e the study intervention or study (see Section 7 ). 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information All SAEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until Visit 5 as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). All AE s will be collected from the start of intervention until Visit 5 as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3 ). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF not the AE section. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to actively solicit reports of AE’s or SAE ’s after conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, within five half- lives after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor."

Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 10.3. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. 8.3.3. Follow- up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). Further information on follow-up procedures is provided in Appendix 10.3. 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs • Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. • The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators. • For all studies except those utilizing medical devices investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpe cted serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. • An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety informati on (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Pregnancy • Details of all pregnancies in female participants and, female partners of male participants will be collected after the start of study intervention and until 5 terminal half- lives after the last dose. Pregnancies will be followed until delivery."

Statistical Hypotheses The null hypothesis of this study is that participants’ global Migraine Interictal Burden Scale (MIBS -4) scores will not be statistically different between 50% responders and non-responders from baseline (Visit 2) to any 4-week treatment period during the 12- week treatment period after 3 months dose of 225 mg fremanezumab -vfrm . 9.2. Sample Size Determination To determine the needed sample size for this study we utilized G *Power3 Version 3.1.9.3 to conduct a power analysis f or the Primary Endpoint analysis (repeated measures ANOVA , within -between interaction) comparing baseline MIBS -4 scores to treatment month(s) MIBS -4 scores between 50% responders and non- responders. Based on prior research, we expect an approximate equal proportion of responders and non-responders in this open-label study. The power analysis indicated that a total of 36 subjects would be adequate to detect a medium effect (f = 0.25), with alpha set at 0.05, and a power of .95. To account for a 10% early withdrawal rate, a total of 40 subjects should be enrolled in the study. 9.3. Populations for Analyses The following populations are defined: Population Description Full Analysis Population All participants enrolled and with at least one administration of IP, will be included in this study population. The Full Analysis Population will be used to analyze the primary efficacy and safety endpoints Note: Other populations may be defined in the SAP . 9.4. Statistical Analyses The statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will be finalized prior to database lock and it will include a more technical and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this section. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints including primary and key secondary endpoints. In case of a discrepancy, the SAP will supersede the protocol."

All statistically significant multivaria te analyses will be followed by univariate post- hoc tests. Appropriate multiple comparison adjustments will be made if needed. A Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method will be utilized to impute missing data where appropriate. 9.4.2. Primary endpoint Data for the primary endpoint will be statistically analyzed via a repeated measures ANOVA, within -between interaction comparing baseline MIBS -4 scores to treatment month(s) MIBS -4 scores between 50% responders and non- responders. 9.4.3. Secondary endpoint(s) Data for each of the secondary outcome measures will be statistically analyzed for within and between group changes via analysis of variance ( ANOVA), t -tests, or chi -square tests as appropriate. 9.4.4. Tertiary/exploratory endpoint(s) The Statistical Analysis Plan will describe any planned tertiary/exploratory analyses in greater detail. 9.4.5. Other safety Analyses There will not be a formal statistical analysis for safety endpoints (adverse events, etc.); however, all adverse events will be summarized via tables and descriptive statistics as appropriate. 9.5. Interim Analyses Not Applicable, i.e., there is not a planned int erim analysis for this study. 9.6. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Not Applicable, i.e., there is not a DMC for this study."

Source Documents • Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site. • Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available. • Data for this trial will be primarily collected in a web -based electronic data capture (EDC) REDCap platform. The EDC access will be supplied by the sponsor with relevant training support to sites. Sites will be responsible for training study subjects in the EDC system. All data specified sh ould be captured by the site personnel or participants in the EDC system. When possible, all eCRFs are to be completely filled out by personnel administering the study procedures in real- time at the time of the visit. All eCRFs that are completed in real -time at the time of the visit will be considered source documentation for this study. When allowed by the site’s IRB, any data entered on an eCRF which was not entered into REDCap in real- time at the time of the visit, or where such data originated from an external paper source document (e.g., signed Informed Consent Form (ICF) signature page, laboratory, procedure findings, etc.), will require paper source documents to be uploaded into the REDCap system to allow for source data verification monitoring. W hen a site’s IRB does not allow for specific paper source documents to be uploaded into REDCap (e.g., the ICF signature pages, etc.), then those paper source documents will be reviewed during on- site monitor visits. • It is the investigator’s responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRF and confirmation the data is accurate, authentic, attributable, complete, and consistent. The investigator or sub- investigator must sign the CRFs within the E DC system to attest the information contained with the CRF is true and causality of any safety information has been assessed. All data must be reviewed and signed by the investigator or sub-investigator at the conclusion of the study for each subject. The CRFs should not be made available in any form to third parties, without written permission from the sponsor."

Study and Site Start and Closure The study start date is the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of participants. The first act of recruitment is the first site open and will be the study start date. The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study- site closure visit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: • Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines • Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator • Discontinuation of further study intervention development If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the Investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organization(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow -up 10.1.9. Publication Policy • The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Teva (financial sponsor) before submission. This allows the financial sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments. • Teva (financial sponsor) will c omply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the financial sponsor will generally support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. • Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements."

Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting 10.3.1. Definition of AE AE Definition • An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. • NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention. Events Meeting the AE Definition • Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medi cal and scientific judgment of the investigator (i.e., not related to progression of underlying disease). • Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. • New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be repor ted regardless of sequelae. • The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, “lack of efficacy ” or “ failure of expected pharmacological action” also constitutes an AE or SAE."

No part of this report, or any information contained therein, may be disseminated without the written consent of Clinvest Research LLC. Page 39 of 50 Events NOT Meeting the AE D efinition • Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. • The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. • Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. • Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). • Anticipated day- to-day fluctuatio ns of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 10.3.2. Definition of SAE If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death b. Is life- threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” o ccurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious."

No part of this report, or any information contained therein, may be disseminated without the written consent of Clinvest Research LLC. Page 40 of 50 A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: • Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity • The term disability me ans a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. • This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f. Other situations: • Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. • Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 10.3.3. Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE AE and SAE Recording • When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. • The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. • It is not acceptable for the inves tigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page."

No part of this report, or any information contained therein, may be disseminated without the written consent of Clinvest Research LLC. Page 41 of 50 AE and SAE Recording • There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission. • The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: • Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. • Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities. • Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ w hen it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality • The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. • A “reasonable possibility ” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. • The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. • Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated. • The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. • For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assess ment of causality."

Page 42 of 50 Assessment of Causality • There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every even t before the initial transmission of the SAE data. • The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. • The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow- up of AEs and SAEs • The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. • The investigator will submit any updated SAE data within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 10.3.4. Reporting of SAEs SAE Reporting to Sponsor and Medical Monitor via an Electronic Data Collection Tool • The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to sponsor and medical monitor will be the electronic data collection tool. • If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours. • The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available. • After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. • If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off- line, then the site can report this informat ion on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to the sponsor and medical monitor by telephone."

Premenarchal 2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: • Documented hysterectomy • Documented bilateral salpingectomy • Documented bilateral oophorectomy For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (e .g., mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigato r discretion should be applied to determining study entry. Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 3. Postmenopausal female • A postmenopausal stat e is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. If fertility is unclear (e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.

This applies only to male participants who receive AJOVY® (fremanezumab -vfrm ). • After o btaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. Female P articipants who become pregnant • The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. The initial information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a participant's pregnancy. • The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant and the neonate and the information will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, follow- up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. • While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy comp lication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. • A spontaneous abortion (occurring at <22 weeks gestational age) or still birth (occurring at >22 weeks gestational age) is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. • Any post-study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention by the investigator will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section 8.3.4. While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. Any female participant wh o becomes pregnant while participating in the study will discontinue study intervention or be withdrawn from the study."
