Investigators: Multicenter Study Sites: Approximately 400 sites Study Population: Males and females aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 80 years of age, or minimum age of adult consent according to local regulations at the Baseline visit, or aged 16 to < 18 years of age where locally permitted and who meet the definition of Tanner stage 5 development (refer to Appendix J), at the Baseline visit, with a diagnosis of moderately to severely active CD, defined as: 1. average daily stool frequency (SF) ≥ 4 (when calculating SF, only the number of liquid or very soft stools should be recorded) and/or average daily abdominal pain (AP) score ≥ 2; plus 2. endoscopic evidence of mucosal inflammation measured by the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD). All eligible scores exclude the presence of narrowing component and are confirmed by a central reader. Endoscopic activity is defined as a SES-CD of ≥ 3. The number of subjects enrolled with a SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease will be no more than 58 subjects. Once cap of no more than 58 subjects is reached, enrollment criterion will be an eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease, or eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease. The study will enroll 100% of subjects who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to prior biologic therapy (bio-IR). The bio-IR population is defined as subjects with documented intolerance or inadequate response to one or more of the approved biologic agents for CD (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab). The percent of subjects with exposure, including intolerance or inadequate response to ustekinumab will be no more than 20%. Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: Approximately 579 for the primary ITT population used for efficacy analysis; additionally, up to 58 subjects with lower SES-CD will be enrolled"

Subjects (n = 579) will be randomized 1:1:1 to 1200 mg risankizumab or 600 mg risankizumab or placebo intravenous (IV) given at Baseline, Weeks 4, 8. The randomization will be stratified by both the number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1), Baseline steroid use (yes, no), and Baseline SES-CD (original, alternative), where the stratum of ""original"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for subjects with isolated ileal disease), and the stratum of ""alternative"" includes the patients withbaseline SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease. Visits during the study will occur at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/Premature Discontinuation (PD) to collect clinical and laboratory assessments of disease activity. Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 may be eligible for treatment with blinded risankizumab in Induction Period 2 with evaluation for clinical response at Week 24. All subjects will be provided with a subject diary where they will record CD related symptoms throughout the study. Subjects will also be dispensed a patient information card during Screening. Additionally, subjects will complete symptom, quality of life (QoL) and work productivity questionnaires throughout the study. Clinical labs including, but not limited to, urinalysis, chemistry and hematology, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum risankizumab concentrations, and serum anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels will be collected throughout the study. In addition, stool samples for calprotectin analysis will be collected and should be taken before starting bowel preparations for endoscopy. All endoscopies will be evaluated using SES-CD and will be confirmed by a central reader. Biopsy to confirm diagnosis (during Screening) or to rule out dysplasia/malignancy may be performed during the same time points as the endoscopy. Optional exploratory research samples may be taken during the study. At the Week 12/PD visit, all subjects will undergo an endoscopy for evaluation of mucosal inflammation. It is expected that all subjects who remain in the study through at least Week 8 will have a Week 12/PD endoscopy. All subjects achieving clinical response, defined as ≥ 30% decrease in average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily AP score (both not worse than Baseline) at Week 12 may be eligible to enter Study M16-000. Subjects are not eligible to enter Study M16-000 until endoscopy has been completed (local reader results will be used for stratification for Study M16-000). All subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 may be eligible to receive blinded treatment with risankizumab in Induction Period 2 as described below. Subjects are not eligible to enter Induction Period 2 until Week 12 endoscopy has been completed."

Subjects who received IV risankizumab induction treatment will be randomized 1:1:1 to: !Group 1: 1200 mg IV risankizumab !Group 2: 360 mg SC risankizumab !Group 3: 180 mg SC risankizumab Subjects who received placebo induction treatment will receive: !Group 4: 1200 mg IV risankizumab The IV risankizumab dose or matching IV placebo will be given at Weeks 12, 16, and 20; The SC risankizumab dose or matching SC placebo will be given at Weeks 12, and 20. At Week 24, subjects who received treatment in Induction Period 2 will be reassessed and undergo a third endoscopy for evaluation of mucosal inflammation. Subjects who achieve clinical response at Week 24 may be eligible to enter Study M16-000. Subjects without clinical response at Week 24, as well as all subjects who terminate the study early (including subjects who are eligible for, but do not receive treatment during Induction Period 2) will be discontinued and have a follow-up call 140 days from the last dose of study drug to obtain information on any new or ongoing AEs. Concomitant Aminosalicylates, Immunomodulators (Azathioprine [AZA], 6-Mercaptopurine [6-MP], Methotrexate [MTX]), and/or CD-Related Antibiotics Subjects taking aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and/or CD-related antibiotics at Baseline must continue these treatments for the duration of the study. Initiating and/or increasing doses of aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and/or CD-related antibiotics during the study is prohibited. Decreasing doses of aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and/or CD-related antibiotics is prohibited during the study, except in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment related toxicities and after discussion with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD). CD-related antibiotics may be discontinued in Induction Period 2 at the discretion of the Investigator. Note: the duration of the study includes Induction Period 2.Concomitant Corticosteroids Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline must continue their concomitant treatment at the Baseline dose for the duration of the 12-week induction period. Initiation and/or increasing doses of systemic and/or CD related corticosteroids during the entire study is prohibited. Decreasing doses of corticosteroids is prohibited during the 12-week induction period, except in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment related toxicities and after discussion with the AbbVie TA MD. Subjects who enter Induction Period 2 will be allowed to taper their corticosteroids at the discretion of the Investigator. Increasing doses above the Baseline dose is prohibited."
6,page_6,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 7 Methodology (Continued): Dose SelectionThis study will evaluate two IV doses of risankizumab (600 mg and 1200 mg). The selection of the doses in this study is informed by the analysis of the safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of a Phase 2 study in subjects with CD that explored 200 mg and 600 mg doses. The results from the Phase 2 study suggest a potential for increased benefit with 1200 mg administration. Induction Period 2 will evaluate IV (1200 mg Q4w) or SC (180 mg or 360 mg Q8w; maintenance dosing regimen) risankizumab. The purpose of Induction Period 2 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of re-induction of risankizumab (1200 mg IV at Weeks 12, 16, and 20) versus starting maintenance dosing on clinical response status. Data from the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD suggested that re-induction with 600 mg IV increased both clinical response and clinical remission in subjects with inadequate response at Week 12. The selection of the SC doses is informed by the analysis of the safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of the maintenance period during the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD that evaluated 180 mg SC risankizumab for maintenance. The results from the Phase 2 study suggest a potential for increased benefit with 360 mg SC administration for maintenance regimen. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) An external independent DMC will review unblinded safety data on a cohort level, at a minimum of 6-month intervals throughout the course of the study. At the timing of this amendment, the DMC has provided recommendation that the study may continue without modification and allowed enrollment to begin for 16 – 17 year-olds. A patient information card with information of the symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reactions, infusion related reactions as well as late stage reactions will be provided to the patients at Screening so that any such events once occurred will be reported immediately by the patients to the investigator. A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency and triggers of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. The cardiac adjudication committee (CAC) and anaphylaxis adjudication committee (AAC) adjudicates blinded data and the DMC reviews the data in an unblinded manner. Unblinded adjudicated cardio-cerebrovascular events and anaphylactic reactions will be presented to the DMC for review on a periodic basis. Communications from the DMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion: Main Inclusion: 1. Male or female aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 80 years of age, or minimum age of adult consent according to local regulations, at the Baseline visit.

Pharmacokinetics: Serum risankizumab concentrations will be determined from samples collected just prior to dosing at Weeks 4, 8, and 12/PD, and at Week 24 for subjects who enter Induction Period 2. Immunogenicity: Serum ADAs will be determined from samples collected just prior to dosing at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/PD, and at Week 24 for subjects who enter Induction Period 2. Safety: Safety analyses will be performed on safety set which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. Incidence of adverse events (AEs), changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed throughout the study. Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional): Prognostic, surrogate, predictive and pharmacodynamics biomarkers signatures may be investigated. Samples for different applications, potentially including but not limited to pharmacogenetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic, phenotypic, functional and targeted investigations will be collected at various time points. Assessments may include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, lipids, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Statistical Methods: Efficacy:The co-primary endpoints are the proportion of subjects with CDAI clinical remission at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects who achieve endoscopic response at Week 12. A total of approximately 579 subjects will be randomized into two risankizumab treatment groups and the placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio (193 subjects/arm). When all patients complete their Week 12/PD visit, the database will be locked for the final analysis of 12-week induction period. When all the patients who enter the induction Period 2 finish Week 24/PD visit, the database will be locked for the whole study and all the planned analysis for the induction Period 2 will be performed. Assuming the Week 12 CDAI clinical remission rate will be 34% for one of the risankizumab groups and 15% for the placebo group, a sample size of 193 subjects for each risankizumab group and 193 subjects for the placebo group will have approximately 97% power to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab dose groups and placebo in CDAI clinical remission rates at Week 12 using Fisher's exact test at a 0.025 significant lev el (two sided). The comparisons between each risankizumab dose versus placebo for the primary efficacy variable will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by the number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1) and Baseline steroid use (yes, no). Both of the primary efficacy endpoints will be tested at statistically significant of 0.025 for each of the risankizumab dose group versus placebo to adjust for multiplicity. A CMH based two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated."
14,page_14,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 15 Statistical Methods (Continued): Efficacy (Continued): The intent-to-treat (ITT) set includes all randomized subjects who have taken at least one dose of study drug. The primary population for efficacy analysis are the subjects in the intent-to-treat analysis set who had baseline eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease). Subjects who discontinue prior to Week 12 for any reason will be considered as ""not-achieved"" for CDAI clinical remission and endoscopic response endpoints. In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model including factors for treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, and stratification variables, for the longitudinal continuous endpoints. The MMRM analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity: Serum risankizumab concentrations will be summarized at each time point for each dosing regimen using descriptive statistics. Population pharmacokinetic analyses combining the data from this study and other studies may be performed. Relationships between risankizumab exposures and efficacy and safety variables of interest may be explored. ADA incidence will be summarized by cohorts and study visits. ADA titers will be tabulated for each subject at the respective study visits. The effect of ADA on risankizumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy and/or safety variable(s) and/or any additional analyses will be explored. Safety: Adverse events, laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in this study. All safety comparisons will be performed between treatment groups using the safety set. Treatment emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dose of the study drug and within 140 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not participate in Study M16-000 or until first dose of study drug in Study M16-000 if the subject is enrolled in Study M16-000. An overview of treatment-emergent AEs, AEs leading to death and AEs leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the statistical analysis plan [SAP]), AEs by Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to study drug, and AEs by maximum severity will be summarized by number and percentage. Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared between-treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory will be used. Vital signs will be analyzed similarly."

24,page_24,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 25 3.0 Introduction Crohn's disease (CD) encompasses a spectrum of clinical and pathological processes manifested by focal asymmetric, transmural, and occasionally granulomatous inflammation that can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract and presents with symptoms of fatigue, prolonged diarrhea with or without gross bleeding, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. 1 The disease can affect persons of any age, and its onset is most common in the second and third decades. Females are affected slightly more than males, and the risk for disease is higher in some ethnic groups. 2,3 The incidence of CD has steadily increased in developed countries over the past 3 decades4with recent estimates varying from 12.7 and 20.2 cases/100,000, and a prevalence of 319 and 322 cases/100,000 in North America and Europe, respectively. 5 In Asia, the incidence of CD is estimated to be 0.5 to 1.0 cases per 100,000 persons, with a prevalence rate ranging from 3.6 to 7.7.6,7 The exact cause of CD is still unknown, but is hypothesized to be the result of a dysregulated immune system in the context of a genetically susceptible individual. It is thought that a combination of a patient's genetics, microbiome, immune response, and the environment result in an excessive and abnormal immune response in the gut that results in pathology seen in CD. 2 The aim of medical treatment in CD has been focused on controlling inflammation and reducing symptoms. 8 In addition to improving symptoms, an emerging goal of therapy is to heal the gut mucosa. Resolution of intestinal ulcers, also known as mucosal healing has been associated with positive clinical benefits, including higher rates of clinical remission, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer abdominal surgeries. 9,10 However, improvement of the appearance of the intestinal mucosa may be more difficult to achieve than symptomatic improvement alone. Conventional pharmaceutical therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, thiopurines, methotrexate) are limited, do not always completely abate the inflammatory process, and have significant adverse effects. 1,11 The advent of anti-TNFα agents"
25,page_25,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 26 (e.g., adalimumab) and integrin inhibitors (e.g., vedolizumab) have been shown to achieve clinical remission in patients refractory to conventional therapies.9-13 Despite the benefits of available biologic therapies, many patients do not respond to initial treatment (primary loss of response) or lose treatment over time (secondary loss of response). Regarding anti-TNF agents, approximately 40% of patients will experience primary non-response and secondary non-response occurs in 38% of patients at 6 months and 50% of patients at 1 year. 12,14-17 Additionally, some patients are not candidates for available biologic therapies. Therefore new therapeutic options are required in order to continue to improve the outcome of patients with CD. Risankizumab is a fully humanized mAb of the IgG1 subclass directed towards IL-23p19. The antibody has been engineered to reduce Fc γ receptor and complement binding and potential charge heterogeneity. Risankizumab binds with high affinity to human IL-23 and inhibits IL-23 stimulated IL-17 production at inhibitory concentration (IC) 50 concentrations below 10 pM, as compared with 167 pM for ustekinumab in the same system. Risankizumab does not affect IL-12 at a maximum tested concentration (33 nM) and it does not inhibit IL-12 stimulated IFN- γ production. 3.1 Differences Statement This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two risankizumab induction doses versus placebo during induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active CD. The primary difference between Study M15-991 and the prior phase 2 study of risankizumab in CD is that this study will test a higher dosing of 1200 mg. Additionally, the endpoints in this study are different to reflect the changing regulatory requirements for pivotal registrational studies for new agents for the treatment of CD. 3.2 Benefits and Risks Data suggest that altered immune regulation at the epithelial barrier, leads to an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, tissue destruction, and aberrant tissue repair in CD. Among the cytokines implicated in CD pathogenesis, data at the genetic, human"
26,page_26,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 27 biology and clinical level strongly implicate IL-23 in this disease.18,19 The preclinical and clinical profiles of risankizumab suggest that it may have the potential to address unmet medical need in CD. The data observed in the Phase 2 study suggest that risankizumab will alleviate signs and symptoms of active CD and reduce mucosal inflammation. Participation in this study may help to generate future benefit for subjects with CD. Though there are no serious adverse drug reactions known to be associated with risankizumab therapy, risks of participating in this study include risk of infection and risks related to the study specific procedures of blood sampling, infusion and injection of study drug, and colonoscopy with biopsy. Blood sampling, intravenous (IV) infusions and subcutaneous (SC) injections can cause local bruising, inflammation, and pain. Colonoscopy and biopsy, although generally well tolerated, can be associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in more severe cases, perforation, bleeding, effects from anaesthetic medications, and infection. Local reactions to IV or SC administered biologic therapies are uncommon, and are usually limited to redness, swelling or induration at the injection site. Manifestations of systemic hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis, pruritus, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Both local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions are readily detectable, transient in nature, and manageable with standard medical treatment. Subjects will be closely monitored during drug administration. As with any immune modulating agent, risankizumab has the potential to impair immune function resulting in a risk of infection. This will be addressed by clinical monitoring for adverse events (AEs) during the treatment and follow up periods. Subjects with positive screening for M. Tuberculosis (TB) (skin/interferon-gamma release assay [IGRA] test positive) will be further worked up for signs and symptoms of active TB (e.g., chest x-ray [CXR]). Subjects with active TB will be excluded from enrolling in the study. Subjects with latent TB will be allowed to enroll in line with local guidelines. If latent TB is established, TB prophylaxis/treatment should be initiated and maintained according to"
27,page_27,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 28 local country guidelines. Subjects with current signs or symptoms of infection or history of serious infection will not be included in the study. The role of IL-23 in tumor immunity is not well established at this time, but an increased risk of cancer from an IL-23 antagonist, though considered small, cannot be excluded. Although rare, a potential for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is under constant surveillance by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, though there is no known DILI risk with risankizumab, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects' safety. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be assessing all potential safety signals and will be unblinded to treatment allocation. The DMC will review unblinded safety data on a cohort level, at a minimum of 6 month intervals throughout the course of the study. At the timing of this amendment, the DMC has provided recommendation that the study may continue without modification and allowed enrollment to begin for 16 –17 year-olds. A patient information card with information of the symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reactions, infusion related reactions as well as late stage reactions will be provided to the patients at Screening so that any such events once occurred will be reported immediately by the patients to the investigator. Increases in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and cardiovascular death have been reported in drugs with similar mechanism of action to risankizumab (e.g., p40 inhibitors). However, the incidence of MACE has not been observed in longer term studies. While the likelihood of increased MACE is small, all suspected cardiovascular events (serious or nonserious) observed in this study will be adjudicated by an independent adjudication committee. An independent cardiac adjudication committee (CAC) will be adjudicating observed cardio-and cerebro-vascular events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation. In addition, an independent anaphylaxis adjudication committee (AAC) will be adjudicating observed potential anaphylactic events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation."

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit-risk profile of various immunomodulatory therapies on COVID-19 is being evaluated based on real world and clinical trial data. At this time, the effects of risankizumab on the course of COVID-19 are not well defined. 4.0 Study Objective The objective of Study M15-991 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus placebo during induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active CD. 5.0 Investigational Plan 5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description The study was designed to enroll approximately 579 subjects to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled. In addition to the 579 subjects, up to 58 subjects with a lower SES-CD, defined as an eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease will be enrolled in order to inform treatment effect in this patient population, but these subjects will not be included in the primary ITT population for efficacy analysis. This is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction study to assess the efficacy and safety of risankizumab in subjects with moderately to severely active CD, defined as: 1. average daily stool frequency (SF) ≥ 4 (when calculating SF, only the number of liquid or very soft stools should be recorded) and/or average daily abdominal pain (AP) score ≥ 2; plus"

All eligible scores exclude the presence of narrowing component and are confirmed by a central reader. Endoscopic activity is defined as SES-CD of ≥ 3. The number of subjects enrolled with a SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease will be no more than 58 subjects. Once cap of no more than 58 subjects is reached, enrollment criterion will be an eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease, or eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease. All endoscopies will be centrally read to document eligibility and for assessment at the time points indicated in Appendix C . The study will enroll subjects who have had a documented inadequate response (IR) or intolerance to use of an approved biologic agent (bio-IR), such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab. The percentof subjects with exposure, including intolerance or inadequate response, to ustekinumabwill be no more than 20%. The study duration may be up to 49 weeks, including a Screening period of 35 days, a 12-week induction period, a 12-week Induction Period 2 for those subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12, and a 140 days of follow up period from the last dose of study drug. Visits for clinical evaluation will occur at Baseline Weeks 4, 8, and 12/PD. Subjects, who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12, will be offered blinded risankizumab in Induction Period 2 with evaluation for clinical response at Week 24. At the study visit indicated in Appendix C , all subjects will be provided with a subject diary where they will record CD related symptoms throughout the study. Subjects will also be dispensed a patient information card during Screening. Additionally, subjects will"

Clinical labs including, but not limited to, urinalysis, chemistry and hematology, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum risankizumab concentrations, and serum anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels may be collected. In addition, stool samples for calprotectin analysis will be collected and should be taken before starting bowel preparations for endoscopy. All endoscopies will be evaluated using SES-CD and will be confirmed by a central reader. Biopsy to confirm diagnosis (during Screening) or to rule out dysplasia/malignancy may be performed during the same time points as the endoscopy. Optional exploratory research samples may be taken during the study.

Once written informed consent is obtained, subjects will undergo screening procedures. The length of time between Screening and the Baseline visit must allow time for endoscopy central reading and lab results. The Screening period (35 days ± 7 days is granted around all study visits) may be extended as necessary after consultation with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-TB therapy, or in case of external circumstances (e.g., due to the delay of availability of screening test results). Laboratory values that are exclusionary can be re-tested once during the screening period upon discussion and clearance with TA MD. If the re-tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will be considered a screen failure. Redrawing samples if previous samples were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since the previous result was never obtained. Clinical laboratory assessments as specified in Appendix C will only need to be repeated at Baseline if the time between Screening and Baseline is > 14 days, or if the subject's health status has changed to warrant a repeat test. All subjects need to have their average daily SF, average daily AP, and CDAI calculated and meeting eligibility criteria before randomization at Baseline. 12-Week Induction Period At the Baseline visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study and randomized to the double-blind induction period where they will receive either risankizumab 1200 mg IV, risankizumab 600 mg IV, or placebo.

During this period of the study, subjects will visit the study site at Weeks 4, 8 and 12/PD. Subjects, who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 and choose to continue in the study, will have additional visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 for blinded Induction Period 2 with risankizumab. A ± 7-day window is permitted around scheduled study visits. An effort will be made to bring subjects back to their original scheduled visit (calculated from Baseline) if they are out of the visit window. At the Week 12/PD visit, all subjects will undergo an endoscopy for evaluation of mucosal inflammation. It is expected that all subjects who remain in the study through at least Week 8 will have a Week 12/PD endoscopy. All subjects achieving clinical response, defined as ≥ 30% decrease in average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily AP score (both not worse than Baseline) at Week 12 may be eligible to enter Study M16-000. Subjects are not eligible to enter Study M16-000 until endoscopy has been completed (local reader results will be used for stratification for Study M16-000).

An updated medical history will be obtained prior to study drug administration at Baseline, to ensure the subject is still eligible for enrollment, and updated as necessary. Information on prior biologic, corticosteroid, immunomodulators (i.e., AZA, 6-MP, MTX), CD-related antibiotics, aminosalicylates or any other physician prescribed therapy for CD use will be obtained as outlined in Section 5.2.3.1. A detailed medical history with respect to TB exposure will be documented. This information will include BCG vaccination, cohabitation with individuals who have had TB, and residence or work in TB endemic locations. Subjects with active TB (during Screening) or documented history of active TB who have documented completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy may be allowed to enter the study after consultation with the AbbVie TA MD. TB history and anti-TB therapy needs to be documented in the source documents and eCRFs. Physical Examination A physical examination including evaluation of extra intestinal manifestations (EIMs) will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Appendix C . A full physical examination will be performed as outlined in Appendix C . Physical examinations at all other visits (including unscheduled visits) are symptom based and should include the assessment of EIMs as part of calculating the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI). The number of cutaneous fistulas should be recorded, including the number of fistulas draining upon gentle compression. Fistulas will be classified as abdominal or perianal/anal.

IGRA is preferred for subjects with a prior history of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) administration or who were exposed to other Mycobacteria species. If PPD and/or the QuantiFERON ®-TB Gold test (IGRA equivalent) is positive, or if there is a repeat indeterminate (note: the first indeterminate results must be repeated) QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) upon retesting, subjects may participate in the study if further work up (according to local practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the subject has no evidence of active tuberculosis. Subjects with a history of active TB who have documented completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy may be allowed to enter the study after consultation with the AbbVie TA MD. If active TB is diagnosed, the subject may not enroll in the study. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established, then tuberculosis prophylaxis should be initiated and maintained according to local country guidelines. It is also necessary to report the latent TB or positive TB testing in the source documents and eCRFs. ●QuantiFERON ®-TB Gold Test is the preferred method which will be analyzed by the central laboratory (QuantiFERON test is preferred over TB Skin Test). However, if other IGRA equivalent tests are used, these may be performed by a certified local laboratory at the Investigator's discretion. ●If the QuantiFERON ®-TB Gold Test is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Test and the PPD Skin Test are required per local guidelines) the PPD Skin Test will be performed according to standard clinical practice. ●The PPD Skin Test should be read by a licensed healthcare professional between 48 and 72 hours after administration.

A certified central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical laboratory tests. All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically significant by the Investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution. The central laboratory chosen for this study will provide instructions regarding the collection, processing and shipping of these samples. For serum chemistry tests and some exploratory biomarker tests, it is preferred that the subject has fasted (8 hours, except for water) prior to sample collection, however it is not required. It must be recorded whether the subject has fasted or not at the time of collection in the laboratory request, source document, and eCRF. If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic prevent the subject from having blood drawn for laboratory testing at the study site, if possible, arrange for subjects to have laboratory work done at a local lab, hospital, or other facility. Local lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges and kept within the subjects' source documentation. Local lab results should be reviewed by the investigator as soon as possible.

During screening subjects will be instructed on how to calculate the number of very soft and liquid stools, including a visual depiction. Physical exam and appropriate laboratory values will be calculated at all study visits beginning at Baseline. The Screening period will be a minimum of 7 days to calculate the Baseline scores. The CDAI scores must be calculated using a central laboratory hematocrit (Hct) value from the same visit for all visits, except Baseline, where the most recent Screening Hct value will be used. The final CDAI for all other visits will be calculated once the hematocrit value is received from the central lab. If the Hct is missing due to technical issues (e.g., lost sample, clotted sample, etc.), the Hct value from the preceding visit may be used. Instructions to calculate CDAI ●To answer questions one (1) through three (3), entries from the 7 days prior to the visit should be used as recorded by the subject from the diary. ●Diary entries should not be included in the 7 days evaluated prior to the visit if: (1) the day the subject received medication for bowel preparation prior to endoscopy, (2) the day the subject underwent an endoscopy, and (3) 2 days following the endoscopy.

The Hct values either prior to completing the calculation or at the subtotal box 7 of the CDAI should not be rounded to a whole number. ●For question eight (8) , the height obtained at Screening should be used when selecting the standard weight in Appendix G , and this standard weight should be used for calculating every CDAI throughout subject participation in the study. ●Standard height is calculated by using the height obtained at Screening (without shoes) adding 1 inch or 2.5 cm. For subjects < 18 years of age at Baseline, height will be re-measured at Week 12 and Week 24 (if applicable) and standard height should be recalculated. ●If the body weight obtained at the time of assessment is not captured in kilograms (kg), then when converting into kg, rounding should occur using the second digit after the decimal (also known as the hundredth place) where if the number is 0 – 4, then keep the first digit after the decimal (also known as the tenth place) unchanged. If the second digit after the decimal is 5 – 9, then round up the first digit after the decimal (e.g., 90.246 would be captured as 90.2 and 97.687 would be captured as 97.7). ●The subtotal of box 8 should not be rounded to a whole number.

Biopsy During Endoscopy Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of CD, in the assessment of the Investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's eligibility for the study. Biopsies may be done when performing the endoscopy to confirm CD diagnosis (if appropriate documentation for confirmation of the diagnosis does not exist), and/or to rule out dysplasia and colon cancer at the Investigator's discretion. These biopsies will be processed and evaluated locally and the histology report should be available in the subject's medical records. If any biopsy sample(s) are obtained, it should also be recorded on the video. Any biopsy sample(s) will be collected from the respective bowel segment during the withdrawal of the endoscope and after sufficient recording for the central reader to calculate the SES-CD. The signed pathology report will be monitored by the responsible CRA and kept with the subject's source documents onsite. Subjects should not be enrolled if high grade colonic dysplasia or colon cancer is discovered at Screening endoscopy or endoscopy performed within 45 days prior to Baseline visit. Subjects may be enrolled if low grade colonic dysplasia is discovered during endoscopy and is completely removed. If a diagnosis of high grade colonic dysplasia or colon cancer is discovered during any subsequent endoscopic evaluation during the course of the study, the findings should be recorded as an AE and the subject should be discontinued from the study.

The procedures for obtaining and documenting informed consent are discussed in Section 9.3. Exploratory research can help to improve our understanding of how individuals respond to drugs and our ability to predict which patients would benefit from receiving specific therapies. In addition, exploratory research may help to improve our understanding of how to diagnose and assess/monitor CD by assessing associations between disease characteristics, outcomes data and biomarkers of interests. Validation studies, including those related to the development of potential in vitro diagnostic tests, may be carried out retrospectively in order to assess associations between events of interest (i.e., efficacy and/or safety events) and candidate biomarkers. AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the biomarker exploratory research/validation studies samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples will be retained while research on risankizumab (or drugs of this class) or this disease and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion. It is preferred that the subject has fasted (8 hours, except for water) prior to sample collection, however it is not required. It must be recorded whether the subject has fasted or not at the time of collection in the laboratory request, source document, and eCRF. The following samples will be collected according to Appendix D from each subject who consents to provide samples for exploratory research/validation studies: ●DNA samples for pharmacogenetic or epigenetic analyses. ●RNA samples for transcriptomic and/or epigenetic analyses. ●Serum and plasma samples for systemic analyses including, but not limited to, proteomics and metabolomics. ●Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples for analyses including, but not limited to, immune cell profiling and assessment of functional activity"

The IRT will provide access to blinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency. In the event of a medical emergency in which the Investigator believes that knowledge of study drug treatment is required, reasonable efforts must be made to contact the AbbVie TA MD (see Section 6.1.5 ) prior to breaking the blind, as long as it does not compromise subject safety. However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary which warrants breaking the blind prior to contacting AbbVie TA MD, the Investigator can directly access the IRT system to break the blind without AbbVie agreement. In the event that the blind is broken before notification to AbbVie TA MD, it is requested that the AbbVie TA MD be notified within 24 hours of the blind being broken. Also, the date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source document and eCRF, as applicable."

An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed by the site and reconciliation will be performed by the CRA/monitor (blinded or unblinded according to the monitoring plan) throughout the study and at the site close-out visit. After verification of drug accountability, used study drug must be destroyed at the site according to local regulations governing biohazardous waste. Destruction of used study supplies must be completed and documented in such a way that blinding is maintained for all blinded study personnel. All unused supplies must be inventoried, accounted for and destroyed on site according to local procedures or regulation or returned to a destructionfacility. A copy of the Return Consignment Form from IRT, in accordance with instructions provided by the monitor/CRA (blinded or unblinded according to the monitoring plan), will be included in the return shipments. The use of a third party vendor for drug destruction must be pre-approved by AbbVie. For sites performing on-site drug destruction or using a third party vendor for drug destruction, a copy of the destruction methodology and date of destruction should be maintained at the site's facility. 5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design 5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups Risankizumab is a selective IL-23 inhibitor that may provide improved clinical benefit to risk profile in CD patients. The proposed study is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risankizumab compared to placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active CD, who have had inadequate response or intolerance to biologic agents such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab."
83,page_83,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 84 The study consists of a 12 week induction period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different IV risankizumab doses (600 mg or 1200 mg, Q4w) versus placebo. For subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12, an optional blinded Induction Period 2 (IV, 1200 mg, Q4w; SC, 360 mg, Q8w; SC, 180 mg, Q8w) for an additional 12 weeks will be offered. Subjects with clinical response at the end of induction or Induction Period 2 can enter Study M16-000 for an additional 52 weeks of treatment, with additional OL treatment being offered through approval. At this time, a 12-week placebo controlled study is necessary for registrational purposes. A comparative study utilizing placebo provides an unbiased assessment of the efficacy and safety profile of risankizumab. Furthermore, as approved biologics for CD are increasing, comparisons versus active drugs are important for market access. To ensure all subjects are given the opportunity to receive potentially efficacious therapy, all subjects not responding after 12 weeks can participate in the blinded Induction Period 2 with risankizumab. 5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements Standard statistical, clinical, endoscopy-related and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study. All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with CD. All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted. Central reading of endoscopy will increase study rigor and ensure enrollment of subjects with moderately to severely active CD. 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population Adult male and female subjects with moderately to severely active CD who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are eligible for enrollment in this study. The specific population chosen was based on the unmet medical need of those subjects with a history of inadequate response or intolerance to biologic therapies."
84,page_84,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 85 5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study AbbVie plans to evaluate two doses of risankizumab (600 mg and 1200 mg) via IV administration every 4 weeks (Q4w; Weeks 0, 4, 8) through induction (12-Week Induction Period) and an additional three doses of 1200 mg of risankizumab via IV administration (Q4w; Weeks 12, 16, 20) or two doses of 180 or 360 mg SC (Q8W, Weeks 12 and 20; Induction Period 2) for subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12. The selection of the doses in this study is informed by the analysis of safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of a Phase 2 study in subjects with CD (Study 1311.6) and the pharmacokinetic data from the completed studies in subjects with psoriasis (Studies 1311.1 and 1311.2). Results from the placebo controlled Study 1311.6 that evaluated 200 mg and 600 mg IV doses of risankizumab at Weeks 0, 4, 8 weeks for induction suggests increasing trend of clinical response and remission (for both CDAI and PRO-2 based measures) at Week 12 with increasing risankizumab dose and exposure, indicating a potential for further improvement in proportion of subjects with response and remission with evaluation of higher doses. Preliminary model predictions suggest further incremental benefit in CDAI remission in subjects with CD at 1200 mg IV Q4w dose compared to 600 mg IV Q4w dose. The evaluation of higher dose data (1200 mg IV Q4w) will facilitate a more robust characterization of the dose-response and exposure-response relationship for these efficacy endpoints. Inclusion of 1200 mg IV dose in this study is further supported by the safety results from the 12 week blinded induction period in Study 1311.6. The safety profile of the 600 mg risankizumab group compared favorably with the placebo group and no overall safety concerns were identified which would preclude evaluation of IV induction doses higher than 600 mg risankizumab in patients with CD. Furthermore, the projected steady state exposures for the 1200 mg IV risankizumab Q4w regimen in subjects with CD are covered by safety margins of ~1.6 and ~3.6 for C maxand AUC 0-28 days respectively (relative to NOAEL identified in the 26 week GLP toxicology study). Induction Period 2 will evaluate IV (1200 mg Q4w) or SC (180 mg or 360 mg Q8w) risankizumab. The purpose of Induction Period 2 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of"

Data from the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD suggested that re-induction with 600 mg IV increased both clinical response and clinical remission. The selection of the SC doses is informed by the analysis of the safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of the maintenance period during the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD that evaluated 180 mg SC risankizumab for maintenance. The results from the Phase 2 study suggest a potential for increased benefit with 360 mg SC administration for maintenance regimen. 6.0 Complaints A Complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for distribution.

For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2. 6.1 Medical Complaints The Investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a routine basis throughout the study. The Investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken. For serious adverse events considered as having ""no reasonable possibility"" of being associated with study drug, the Investigator will provide an ""Other"" cause of the event.

Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded. All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. 6.1.1 Definitions 6.1.1.1 Adverse Event An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event. Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event."

Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle). Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF."

Hepatic Events In the case of any of the following AEs, the appropriate supplemental eCRFs should be completed: ●Discontinuation or interruption of study drug due to any hepatic related AE ●Any hepatic related SAE ●A subject experiencing an ALT/AST > 8 × ULN ●A subject experiencing an ALT/AST > 3 × ULN in conjunction with a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN. Systemic Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic Reactions Therapeutic protein products, such as biologics, may elicit a range of acute effects, from symptomatic discomfort to sudden, fatal reactions that have often been grouped as 'infusion reactions' in the past. Although the term implies a certain temporal relationship, infusion reactions are otherwise not well defined and may encompass a wide range of clinical events, including anaphylaxis and other event that may not be directly related to antibody responses, such as cytokine release syndrome. In the event of a suspected systemic hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction, in addition to the standard AE eCRF, a supplemental eCRF should also be completed by the site. The clinical criterion for diagnosing anaphylaxis is provided in Appendix H for reference; symptoms of anaphylactic reaction usually occur within 24 hours after exposure to an allergen. These are guidelines that are used to help diagnose anaphylaxis. The investigator is encouraged to report any suspected reactions. All intravenous and subcutaneous doses of risankizumab will be administered by study- site personnel under the direction of the Investigator. Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for signs and symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions,"

All appropriate medical support measures (e.g., diphenhydramine, steroids, epinephrine, oxygen) for thetreatment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions should be available for immediate use in the event that a suspected hypersensitivity reaction occurs. Subjects who manifest any new signs or symptoms during the infusion should be monitored for appropriate resolution prior to leaving the site. Subjects are encouraged to report any symptoms related to a possible infusion related reactions or local injection site reaction or late phase reactions to the site any time during the study. A patient information card listing the symptoms of these reactions will be provided to the participants. Cardiac Events/Procedures In the case of any of the following reported MACE, the appropriate supplemental eCRFs should be completed: ●Cardiac events; ●Myocardial infarction or unstable angina; ●Cerebral vascular accident and transient ischemic attack; ●Cardiovascular procedures Tuberculosis (TB) In the case of any positive TB test or diagnosis of active TB, the appropriate supplemental eCRFs should be completed. 6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity When criteria are available, events should be graded as described in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, 20 which can be accessed at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40"

When all patients complete their Week 12/PD visit, the database will be locked and un-blinded for the 12-week induction period. The planned analysis for the 12-week induction period will be performed. This is the only and final analysis for co-primary endpoints of the 12-week induction period. When all the patients who enter the induction Period 2 finish Week 24/PD visit, the database will be locked for the whole study and all the planned analyses for the induction Period 2 will be performed. Complete, specific details of the statistical analyses will be described and fully documented in the study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized prior to the study database lock. The impact of missing data due to COVID-19 will be monitored and appropriate modifications to the analysis of primary and key secondary endpoints for handling such missing data will be reflected and incorporated in the final SAP. 8.1.1 Datasets for Analysis 8.1.1.1 Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. The primary population for efficacy analysis are the subjects in the intent-to-treat set who had baseline eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease). The ITT subjects will be analyzed as randomized."

The safety set will be analyzed as treated, according to treatment the subject actually received. The safety set will be used for safety analysis. 8.1.2 Definition of Missing Data Imputation Missing data will be imputed using one or more of the following methods: Non-Responder Imputation (NRI): In NRI analyses, subjects who prematurely discontinue the study prior to efficacy assessment at Week 12 will be considered non-responders with respect to the efficacy endpoint. Observed Cases (OC): The OC analysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from the OC analysis for that visit. 8.1.3 Subject Disposition The number and percentage of subjects who are enrolled, randomized and received at least one dose of study drug, and the number of subjects who prematurely discontinued and the reason for premature discontinuation will be summarized by treatment group. Premature discontinuation of study drug will be summarized for each treatment group, as well as for all subjects combined, with frequencies and percentages overall and by reason for discontinuation for all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Subjects may have multiple reasons for prematurely discontinuing study drug, but will be counted no more than once for the total (""Any Reason""). 8.1.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographics (where collection is allowed) and Baseline characteristics of the study subjects will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of observations, mean, standard deviation,"

For other categorical or discrete variables, frequencies and percentages will be computed in each category for each treatment group, as well as for all subjects combined. 8.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications Prior therapy and medications will include all therapies and medications administered prior to the date of the first dose of study drug. Prior therapy and medication will be summarized for all randomized subjects. No statistical test will be performed. Concomitant medications will be summarized for all randomized subjects. Concomitant medications will be summarized using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary with frequencies and percentages for each treatment group. No statistical test will be performed. 8.1.6 Efficacy Analysis 8.1.6.1 Primary Efficacy Variables The co-primary endpoints are the proportion of subjects who achieve CDAI clinical remission at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects who achieve endoscopic response at Week 12. The comparisons between each risankizumab dose versus placebo for the primary efficacy variable will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1) and steroid use at Baseline (yes, no). A multiple testing procedure will be used to provide strong control of the type 1 error rate at alpha = 0.05 (2-sided) across analyses comparing each risankizumab dose level to placebo with respect to the co-primary endpoints, and ranked secondary endpoints. Specifically, testing will utilize a sequence of hypothesis testing for the co-primary endpoints followed by the ranked secondary endpoints, and will begin with testing each of the co-primary endpoints using α of 0.025 (2-sided) for each dose compared to placebo. If both co-primary endpoints achieve statistical significance within a dose level, continued testing will follow a pre-specified weight of α allocation between the single hypothesis within the"
101,page_101,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 102 family, as well as between the families of hypotheses across the doses. Details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan. A CMH based two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated. Subjects who discontinue prior to Week 12 for any reason will be considered as ""not- achieved"" for CDAI clinical remission and endoscopic response endpoints. Sensitivity analyses for missing data handling using MI, PMM and OC will be performed for co-primary endpoints and details will be outlined in the SAP. 8.1.6.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables The secondary efficacy variables are divided into two groups. The first group includes ranked secondary endpoints, which are ranked by clinical importance. Statistical significance is assessed at the pre-specified alpha level (two-sided) in ranked endpoint order until the significant level exceeds the pre-specified alpha level. No additional statistically significant treatment differences could be declared if the preceding ranked endpoint fails to achieve the pre-specified alpha level. The second group includes all other additional secondary variables. All analyses of secondary endpoints will be performed using the ITT analysis set. In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model including factors for treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, and stratification variables, for the longitudinal continuous endpoints. The MMRM analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes. Categorical secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using the CMH test controlling for stratification variables. Non-responder imputation for missing data will be used for categorical secondary endpoints. Analysis of Pattern Mixture Model (PMM) will be performed as sensitivity analyses for ranked secondary endpoints."

Incidence of AEs, including those related to study drug, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed. AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that began or worsened in severity after initiation of study drug and within 140 days after the last dose of the study drug. An overview of treatment-emergent AEs, including AEs leading to death and AEs leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the SAP), AEs by MedDRA preferred term and system organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to study drug, and AEs by maximum severity will be summarized by number and percentage. Continuous laboratory and vital sign parameters will be summarized for each treatment group by visit. Treatment group differences between each of the risankizumab dosing groups and the placebo group for changes from Baseline may be analyzed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Vital signs and laboratory data will be described by statistical characteristics and frequency of abnormal values. In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory will be used. Analysis details will be specified in the SAP. 8.1.8 Analysis of Optional Exploratory Variables For exploratory biomarkers that are measured, including but not limited to pharmacogenetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic and immune cell surface markers or functional biomarkers, the association of biomarkers to the efficacy and safety endpoints may be explored for each biomarker one at a time, and also for combinations of biomarkers via some multivariate predictive modeling algorithms. Optimal multivariate combinations of biomarkers that associate with efficacy endpoints, subject response/non-response (with respect to appropriate clinical endpoints), and also with safety endpoints may be explored via a variety of statistical predictive modeling"
103,page_103,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 104 algorithms. Cut-points for individual biomarkers and optimal combinations of biomarkers that differentiate the subject response with respect to efficacy/safety endpoints may be explored using the in-house developed subgroup identification algorithms: Sequential BATTing, PRIM, AIM BATTing, and AIM Rule. The significance of these multivariate combinations of biomarkers may be assessed via at least 20 iterations of 5-fold cross-validation. 21,22 8.1.9 Analysis of Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Variables Serum risankizumab concentrations will be summarized at each time point for each dosing regimen using descriptive statistics. In addition, ADA incidence will be summarized by cohorts and study visits. ADA titers will be tabulated for each subject at the respective study visits. Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses and may not be part of the clinical study report. Population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses of only data from this study may not be conducted. The following general methodology will be used for the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Population pharmacokinetic analyses of risankizumab will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing. Pharmacokinetic models will be build using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach with NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version). The structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic analysis data from previous studies. Systemic clearance and volume of distribution of risankizumab will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of major interest in the NONMEM analyses. If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be estimated if useful in the analysis. The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models: 1. The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the alternative model(s)."

The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity (a straight line with zero intercept and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s). 3. Visual inspection of model fit, standard errors of model parameters and change in inter-subject and intra-subject error. Once an appropriate base pharmacokinetic model (including inter- and intra-subject error structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated by the posterior conditional estimation technique using NONMEM. The relationship between these conditional estimates CL/F or V ss/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as ADA classification, subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, possibly baseline inflammatory and disease markers) may be explored using stepwise forward selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.01. After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates from the full model will be employed to evaluate the significance (at P < 0.001, corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 10.83 for one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model.

Assuming the Week 12 CDAI clinical remission rate will be 34% for one of the risankizumab dose groups and 15% for the placebo group, a sample size of 193 subjects for each risankizumab dose group and 193 subjects for the placebo group will have approximately 97% power to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab dose groups and placebo in CDAI clinical remission rates at Week 12 using Fisher's exact test at a 0.025 significant level (two-sided). Assuming the Week 12 endoscopic response rate will be 17% for one of the risankizumab groups and 5% for the placebo group, this sample size will have 93% power to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab and placebo in endoscopic response rates at Week 12 using a Fisher's exact test at a 0.025 significant level (two-sided). 8.3 Randomization Methods A total of approximately 579 subjects will be randomized into two risankizumab dose groups and the placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by the number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1), steroid use at Baseline (yes, no), and Baseline SES-CD (original, alternative), where the stratum of ""original"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for subjects with isolated ileal disease), and the stratum of ""alternative"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileaocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease. Subjects with clinical non-response to risankizumab at Week 12 will be re-randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1200 mg IV dose group, 360 mg SC dose group, or 180 mg SC dose group.

The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted. IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site. Following local regulation, substantial amendments may also be reviewed and approved by the national competent authority. Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation of any changes made to the study design. The Investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive study essential documents according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) GCP and all other applicable regulatory requirements. Any SAEs that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local regulations, will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by local regulations. During the conduct of the study, the Investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects. Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie. 9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that"

Responsibilities of the clinical Investigator are specified in Appendix A . In the event of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to difficulties in performing protocol-specified procedures, AbbVie will engage with study site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity of the study while trying to best manage subject continuity of care. This may include alternative methods for assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection (e.g., use of a local lab instead of a central lab). In all cases, these alternative measures must be allowed by local regulations and permitted by IRB/IEC. Investigators should notify AbbVie if any urgent safety measures are taken to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. 9.3 Subject Information and Consent For adult subjects the Investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject, and answer all questions regarding this study. Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements. A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record. An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy. Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.

The separate written consent must be signed before the exploratory research/validation studies samples are collected and testing is performed. If the subject does not consent to the exploratory research/validation studies, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study. For adolescent subjects the investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and the subject's parent/legal guardian, and answer all questions regarding this study. Adolescent subjects will be included in all discussions in order to obtain verbal or written assent. Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject's parent/legal guardian, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements. Additionally, in keeping with each institution's IRB/IEC requirements, an informed assent form may also be obtained by each subject prior to any study-related procedures being performed. If a subject becomes of legal age during the course of the study, that subject will need to be re-consented. A copy of the informed consent form and the assent form will be given to the subject and the subject's parent/legal guardian and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record. An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy. Genetic and non-genetic biomarker analysis will only be performed if the subject's parent/legal guardian has voluntarily signed and dated a separate genetic and non-genetic biomarker informed consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject and subject's parent/legal guardian has had an opportunity to ask questions. The separate genetic and non-genetic biomarker informed consent must be signed before the genetic and non-genetic biomarker testing is performed. If the subject's parent/legal guardian does not consent to the genetic and non-genetic biomarker testing, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study."

Update inclusion/exclusion, prior and concomitant therapy, and medical/surgical history information to assure subject eligibi lity. e. Physical examinations are full physical examinations at Screening and Week 12 and Week 24 if the subject receives treatment i n Induction Period 2. Physical examinations at all other visits (including unscheduled visits) are symptom based and should include the assessment of EIMs and a count of the number of cutaneous fistulas as part of calculating the CDAI. f. Blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, respiratory rate and weight should be performed before blood draws are performed. H eight will be measured at Screening only (with shoes off and then adding 1 inch or 2.5 cm) for subjects ≥ 18 years of age. Height will be re-measured at Week 12 and Week 24 (if applicable) for subjects < 18 years of age at Baseline. g. Collection of SAEs and protocol-related nonserious AEs begins the day the subject signs the informed consent. h. Subjects with negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and/or PPD test within 90 days of Screening will not require a repeat test (d ocumentation must be available). PPD skin test is to be read 48 to 72 hours after placement. In case of positive PPD/positive or repeat indeterminate IGRA testing, subj ects may participate in the study if further work up (according to local practice/guidelines) is negative for active TB. i. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required, provided so urce documentation is available. Subjects can have a repeat ECG at any time during the study as warranted based on the opinion of the Investigator. j. Subjects will be tested for the presence of the HBV and HCV at Screening. A positive result for the hepatitis B surface anti gen (HBs Ag) or hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable in any subject with anti-HCV Ab) will be exclusionary. For subjects who are negative for HBs Ag but are positive for core antibodies (HBc Ab), HBV DNA PCR will be performed and any result that meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary. k. HIV testing will be performed at the central laboratory, which will report the results directly to the sites. AbbVie will no t receive results from the testing. l. Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by the sites at required visits. A microscopic analysis will be performed by the centr al laboratory, in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal. m. Urinalysis, chemistry and hematology, hs-CRP, and FCP may be collected at other scheduled and unscheduled visits than indicat ed in the table if they are warranted by the Investigator. n. Lab assessments will only need to be repeated at Baseline if the time between Screening and Baseline is greater than 14 days, or if the subject's health status has changed to warrant a repeat test. o. Serum pregnancy test will be performed on all WOCBP at Screening. Urine pregnancy test will be performed locally as indicated in the table for all WOCBP. The urine pregnancy test must be negative to receive study drug. If any urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test will be performed by the central laboratory. FSH will be performed in all female subjects < 55 years old with no menses for 12 months."

Serum risankizumab concentrations and ADA will be determined from samples collected just prior to dosing at every visit. The date and time of sample collection will be captured on the eCRF. q. Stool sample will be collected at each time point indicated in the table. For the visit when endoscopy will be conducted, sto ol sample should be collected prior to bowel prep and should be returned to the site per the instructions provided outside of this protocol. If a sample cannot be obtained duri ng the site visit, the site will give instructions and a stool sample supply kit. r. Diary information collected during Screening will serve to calculate Baseline CDAI. During Screening, subjects will be instr ucted on how to calculate the number of very soft and liquid stools, including a visual depiction. CDAI should be completed at Baseline visit, just prior to randomization. s. Endoscopy at/during the Screening period or within 45 days of the Baseline visit will be used to calculate the SES-CD score a t Baseline. Endoscopic evaluations using SES-CD confirmed by central reader will be done at Screening. Endoscopies completed at Week 12 and Week 24, for those subjects who receive treatment in Induction Period 2, will use the local reader results for stratification for Study M16-000. t. Biopsies may be done when performing the endoscopy to confirm CD diagnosis (if appropriate documentation for confirmation of the diagnosis does not exist), and/or to rule out dysplasia and colon cancer at the Investigator's discretion. These samples will be processed and assessed locally. Histol ogy report should be available in the subject's source records. u. Administration of drug will be performed after all assessments and examinations scheduled for that day have been completed, including endoscopy. Completion of PROs are permitted during administration of study drug. At Week 12, study drug will only be administered for subjects who are to receiv e treatment in Induction Period 2. Subjects will also be dispensed a patient information card. In the event of a suspected systemic post-dose hypersensitivity reaction, s erum risankizumab, ADA, and nAb should be collected once within 24 hours of the reaction. In addition, tryptase sample should be obtained between 15 minutes to 3 hours of symptom onset, and no later than 6 hours, and another sample is requested a minimum of 2 weeks after the recorded event or at the next study visit. Also, plasma histami ne sample should be obtained within 5 to 15 minutes of the onset of symptoms and no later than 1 hour. v. Subjects should also be dispensed the patient information card. w. For Rescreening, if a subject is being rescreened within 14 days ( ≤ 14 days have passed) from the collection date of the previous screening testing, it is not required to repeat Screening testing for chemistry/hematology, urinalysis, serum pregnancy, and C. difficile provided that the subject's health st atus has not changed to warrant a repeat test. x. For Rescreening, if the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation including the TB test, hepatitis B virus (HBV), h epatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and electrocardiogram (ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated for re-screening provided the conditi ons noted in Section 5.3.1.1 are met and no more than 90 days have passed since the collection date of the testing. y. Assessment for signs/symptoms of COVID-19 infection. If the investigator suspects the possibility of COVID-19 based on the si gns, symptoms and medical complaint (chief complaint, history of exposure, etc.), local laboratory testing must be completed."

Tanner Stage 5 for Development Tanner Stage 5 for Development25,26 Puberty and the Tanner Stages – developed by Professor James M Tanner IntroductionAdolescents experience several types of maturation, including cognitive (the development of formal operational thought), psychosocial (the stages of adolescence), and biologic. The complex series of biologic transitions are known as puberty, and these changes may impact psychosocial factors. The most visible changes during puberty are growth in stature and development of secondary sexual characteristics. Equally profound are changes in body composition; the achievement of fertility; and changes in most body systems, such as the neuroendocrine axis, bone size, and mineralization; and the cardiovascular system. As an example, normal cardiovascular changes, including greater aerobic power reserve, electrocardiographic changes, and blood pressure changes, occur during puberty. The normal sequence of pubertal events and perils of puberty are reviewed here. This is within the normal ranges and does not take into account Precocious Puberty or Delayed Puberty. Tanner StagesConceptually, pubertal maturation can be described in terms of sequence, timing, and tempo (Puberty consists of a series of predictable events, and the sequence of changes in secondary sexual characteristics has been categorized by several groups. The staging system utilized most frequently is that published by Marshall and Tanner and the sequence of changes, commonly referred to as ""Tanner stages,"" is described below."

Investigators: Multicenter Study Sites: Approximately 400 sites Study Population: Males and females aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 80 years of age, or minimum age of adult consent according to local regulations at the Baseline visit, or aged 16 to < 18 years of age where locally permitted and who meet the definition of Tanner stage 5 development (refer to Appendix J), at the Baseline visit, with a diagnosis of moderately to severely active CD, defined as: 1. average daily stool frequency (SF) ≥ 4 (when calculating SF, only the number of liquid or very soft stools should be recorded) and/or average daily abdominal pain (AP) score ≥ 2; plus 2. endoscopic evidence of mucosal inflammation measured by the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD). All eligible scores exclude the presence of narrowing component and are confirmed by a central reader. Endoscopic activity is defined as a SES-CD of ≥ 3. The number of subjects enrolled with a SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease will be no more than 58 subjects. Once cap of no more than 58 subjects is reached, enrollment criterion will be an eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease, or eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease. The study will enroll 100% of subjects who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to prior biologic therapy (bio-IR). The bio-IR population is defined as subjects with documented intolerance or inadequate response to one or more of the approved biologic agents for CD (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab). The percent of subjects with exposure, including intolerance or inadequate response to ustekinumab will be no more than 20%. Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: Approximately 579 for the primary ITT population used for efficacy analysis; additionally, up to 58 subjects with lower SES-CD will be enrolled"

The randomization will be stratified by both the number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1), Baseline steroid use (yes, no), and Baseline SES-CD (original, alternative), where the stratum of ""original"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for subjects with isolated ileal disease), and the stratum of ""alternative"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease. Visits during the study will occur at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/Premature Discontinuation (PD) to collect clinical and laboratory assessments of disease activity. Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 may be eligible for treatment with blinded risankizumab in Induction Period 2 with evaluation for clinical response at Week 24. All subjects will be provided with a subject diary where they will record CD related symptoms throughout the study. Subjects will also be dispensed a patient information card during Screening. Additionally, subjects will complete symptom, quality of life (QoL) and work productivity questionnaires throughout the study. Clinical labs including, but not limited to, urinalysis, chemistry and hematology, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum risankizumab concentrations, and serum anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels will be collected throughout the study. In addition, stool samples for calprotectin analysis will be collected and should be taken before starting bowel preparations for endoscopy. All endoscopies will be evaluated using SES-CD and will be confirmed by a central reader. Biopsy to confirm diagnosis (during Screening) or to rule out dysplasia/malignancy may be performed during the same time points as the endoscopy. Optional exploratory research samples may be taken during the study. At the Week 12/PD visit, all subjects will undergo an endoscopy for evaluation of mucosal inflammation. It is expected that all subjects who remain in the study through at least Week 8 will have a Week 12/PD endoscopy. All subjects achieving clinical response, defined as ≥ 30% decrease in average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily AP score (both not worse than Baseline) at Week 12 may be eligible to enter Study M16-000. Subjects are not eligible to enter Study M16-000 until endoscopy has been completed (local reader results will be used for stratification for Study M16-000). All subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 may be eligible to receive blinded treatment with risankizumab in Induction Period 2 as described below. Subjects are not eligible to enter Induction Period 2 until Week 12 endoscopy has been completed."

Subjects who received IV risankizumab induction treatment will be randomized 1:1:1 to: !Group 1: 1200 mg IV risankizumab !Group 2: 360 mg SC risankizumab !Group 3: 180 mg SC risankizumab Subjects who received placebo induction treatment will receive: !Group 4: 1200 mg IV risankizumab The IV risankizumab dose or matching IV placebo will be given at Weeks 12, 16, and 20; The SC risankizumab dose or matching SC placebo will be given at Weeks 12, and 20. At Week 24, subjects who received treatment in Induction Period 2 will be reassessed and undergo a third endoscopy for evaluation of mucosal inflammation. Subjects who achieve clinical response at Week 24 may be eligible to enter Study M16-000. Subjects without clinical response at Week 24, as well as all subjects who terminate the study early (including subjects who are eligible for, but do not receive treatment during Induction Period 2) will be discontinued and have a follow-up call 140 days from the last dose of study drug to obtain information on any new or ongoing AEs.

140,page_140,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 141 Methodology (Continued): Dose SelectionThis study will evaluate two IV doses of risankizumab (600 mg and 1200 mg). The selection of the doses in this study is informed by the analysis of the safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of a Phase 2 study in subjects with CD that explored 200 mg and 600 mg doses. The results from the Phase 2 study suggest a potential for increased benefit with 1200 mg administration. Induction Period 2 will evaluate IV (1200 mg Q4w) or SC (180 mg or 360 mg Q8w; maintenance dosing regimen) risankizumab. The purpose of Induction Period 2 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of re-induction of risankizumab (1200 mg IV at Weeks 12, 16, and 20) versus starting maintenance dosing on clinical response status. Data from the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD suggested that re-induction with 600 mg IV increased both clinical response and clinical remission in subjects with inadequate response at Week 12. The selection of the SC doses is informed by the analysis of the safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of the maintenance period during the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD that evaluated 180 mg SC risankizumab for maintenance. The results from the Phase 2 study suggest a potential for increased benefit with 360 mg SC administration for maintenance regimen. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) An external independent DMC will review unblinded safety data on a cohort level, at a minimum of 6-month intervals throughout the course of the study. At the timing of this amendment, the DMC has provided recommendation that the study may continue without modification and allowed enrollment to begin for 16 – 17 year-olds. A patient information card with information of the symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reactions, infusion related reactions as well as late stage reactions will be provided to the patients at Screening so that any such events once occurred will be reported immediately by the patients to the investigator. A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency and triggers of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. The cardiac adjudication committee (CAC) and anaphylaxis adjudication committee (AAC) adjudicates blinded data and the DMC reviews the data in an unblinded manner. Unblinded adjudicated cardio-cerebrovascular events and anaphylactic reactions will be presented to the DMC for review on a periodic basis. Communications from the DMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments.

147,page_147,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 148 Criteria for Evaluation (Continued): Pharmacokinetics:Serum risankizumab concentrations will be determined from samples collected just prior to dosing at Weeks 4, 8, and 12/PD, and at Week 24 for subjects who enter Induction Period 2. Immunogenicity: Serum ADAs will be determined from samples collected just prior to dosing at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/PD, and at Week 24 for subjects who enter Induction Period 2. Safety: Safety analyses will be performed on safety set which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. Incidence of adverse events (AEs), changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed throughout the study. Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional): Prognostic, surrogate, predictive and pharmacodynamics biomarkers signatures may be investigated. Samples for different applications, potentially including but not limited to pharmacogenetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic, phenotypic, functional and targeted investigations will be collected at various time points. Assessments may include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, lipids, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Statistical Methods: Efficacy:The co-primary endpoints are the proportion of subjects with clinical remission at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects who achieve endoscopic response at Week 12. A total of approximately 579 subjects will be randomized into two risankizumab treatment groups and the placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio (193 subjects/arm). When all patients complete their Week 12/PD visit, the database will be locked for the final analysis of 12-week induction period. When all the patients who enter the induction Period 2 finish Week 24/PD visit, the database will be locked for the whole study and all the planned analysis for the induction Period 2 will be performed. Sample size calculation is based on the larger sample size needed to detect treatment difference for each of the co-primary endpoints. Since historical data show slightly lower event rate and similar treatment difference versus placebo for the endoscopic response rate than the clinical remission rate at Week 12, clinical remission rates at Week 12 are used for power calculation. Assuming the Week 12 clinical remission rate will be 23.5% for risankizumab groups and 10% for the placebo group, a sample size of 193 subjects for each risankizumab group and 193 subjects for the placebo group will have approximately 89% power to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab and placebo in clinical remission rates at Week 12 using a Fisher's exact test at alpha level of 0.025 (two-sided). The comparisons between each risankizumab dose versus placebo for the primary efficacy variable will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by the number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1) and Baseline steroid use (yes, no). Both of the primary efficacy endpoints will be tested at statistically significant of 0.025 for each of the risankizumab dose group versus placebo to adjust for multiplicity. A CMH based two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated."
148,page_148,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 149 Statistical Methods (Continued): Efficacy (Continued): The intent-to-treat (ITT) set includes all randomized subjects who have taken at least one dose of study drug. The primary population for efficacy analysis are the subjects in the intent-to-treat analysis set who had baseline eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease). If the average daily SF or average daily AP score at Week 12 are missing, the non-responder imputation (NRI) approach will be applied. Subjects who discontinue prior to Week 12 for any reason will be considered as ""not-achieved"" for clinical remission and endoscopic response endpoints. In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model including factors for treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, and stratification variables, for the longitudinal continuous endpoints. The MMRM analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity: Serum risankizumab concentrations will be summarized at each time point for each dosing regimen using descriptive statistics. Population pharmacokinetic analyses combining the data from this study and other studies may be performed. Relationships between risankizumab exposures and efficacy and safety variables of interest may be explored. ADA incidence will be summarized by cohorts and study visits. ADA titers will be tabulated for each subject at the respective study visits. The effect of ADA on risankizumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy and/or safety variable(s) and/or any additional analyses will be explored. Safety: Adverse events, laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in this study. All safety comparisons will be performed between treatment groups using the safety set. Treatment emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dose of the study drug and within 140 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not participate in Study M16-000 or until first dose of study drug in Study M16-000 if the subject is enrolled in Study M16-000. An overview of treatment-emergent AEs, AEs leading to death and AEs leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the statistical analysis plan [SAP]), AEs by Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to study drug, and AEs by maximum severity will be summarized by number and percentage. Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared between-treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory will be used. Vital signs will be analyzed similarly."

Investigators: Multicenter Study Sites: Approximately 400 sites Study Population: Males and females aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 80 years of age, or minimum age of adult consent according to local regulations at the Baseline visit, or aged 16 to < 18 years of age where locally permitted and who meet the definition of Tanner stage 5 development (refer to Appendix J), at the Baseline visit, with a diagnosis of moderately to severely active CD, defined as: 1. average daily stool frequency (SF) ≥ 4 (when calculating SF, only the number of liquid or very soft stools should be recorded) and/or average daily abdominal pain (AP) score ≥ 2; plus 2. endoscopic evidence of mucosal inflammation measured by the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD). All eligible scores exclude the presence of narrowing component and are confirmed by a central reader. Endoscopic activity is defined as a SES-CD of ≥ 3. The number of subjects enrolled with a SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease will be no more than 58 subjects. Once cap of no more than 58 subjects is reached, enrollment criterion will be an eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease, or eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease. The study will enroll 100% of subjects who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to prior biologic therapy (bio-IR). The bio-IR population is defined as subjects with documented intolerance or inadequate response to one or more of the approved biologic agents for CD (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab). The percent of subjects with exposure, including intolerance or inadequate response to ustekinumab will be no more than 20%. Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: Approximately 579 for the primary ITT population used for efficacy analysis; additionally, up to 58 subjects with lower SES-CD will be enrolled"

Subjects (n = 579) will be randomized 1:1:1 to 1200 mg risankizumab or 600 mg risankizumab or placebo intravenous (IV) given at Baseline, Weeks 4, 8. The randomization will be stratified by both the number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1), Baseline steroid use (yes, no), and Baseline SES-CD (original, alternative), where the stratum of ""original"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for subjects with isolated ileal disease), and the stratum of ""alternative"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease. Visits during the study will occur at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/Premature Discontinuation (PD) to collect clinical and laboratory assessments of disease activity. Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 may be eligible for treatment with blinded risankizumab in Induction Period 2 with evaluation for clinical response at Week 24. All subjects will be provided with a subject diary where they will record CD related symptoms throughout the study. Subjects will also be dispensed a patient information card during Screening. Additionally, subjects will complete symptom, quality of life (QoL) and work productivity questionnaires throughout the study. Clinical labs including, but not limited to, urinalysis, chemistry and hematology, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum risankizumab concentrations, and serum anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels will be collected throughout the study. In addition, stool samples for calprotectin analysis will be collected and should be taken before starting bowel preparations for endoscopy. All endoscopies will be evaluated using SES-CD and will be confirmed by a central reader. Biopsy to confirm diagnosis (during Screening) or to rule out dysplasia/malignancy may be performed during the same time points as the endoscopy. Optional exploratory research samples may be taken during the study. At the Week 12/PD visit, all subjects will undergo an endoscopy for evaluation of mucosal inflammation. It is expected that all subjects who remain in the study through at least Week 8 will have a Week 12/PD endoscopy. All subjects achieving clinical response, defined as ≥ 30% decrease in average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily AP score (both not worse than Baseline) at Week 12 may be eligible to enter Study M16-000. Subjects are not eligible to enter Study M16-000 until endoscopy has been completed (local reader results will be used for stratification for Study M16-000). All subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 may be eligible to receive blinded treatment with risankizumab in Induction Period 2 as described below. Subjects are not eligible to enter Induction Period 2 until Week 12 endoscopy has been completed."

Subjects who received IV risankizumab induction treatment will be randomized 1:1:1 to: !Group 1: 1200 mg IV risankizumab !Group 2: 360 mg SC risankizumab !Group 3: 180 mg SC risankizumab Subjects who received placebo induction treatment will receive: !Group 4: 1200 mg IV risankizumab The IV risankizumab dose or matching IV placebo will be given at Weeks 12, 16, and 20; The SC risankizumab dose or matching SC placebo will be given at Weeks 12, and 20. At Week 24, subjects who received treatment in Induction Period 2 will be reassessed and undergo a third endoscopy for evaluation of mucosal inflammation. Subjects who achieve clinical response at Week 24 may be eligible to enter Study M16-000. Subjects without clinical response at Week 24, as well as all subjects who terminate the study early (including subjects who are eligible for, but do not receive treatment during Induction Period 2) will be discontinued and have a follow-up call 140 days from the last dose of study drug to obtain information on any new or ongoing AEs. Concomitant Aminosalicylates, Immunomodulators (Azathioprine [AZA], 6-Mercaptopurine [6-MP], Methotrexate [MTX]), and/or CD-Related Antibiotics Subjects taking aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and/or CD-related antibiotics at Baseline must continue these treatments for the duration of the study. Initiating and/or increasing doses of aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and/or CD-related antibiotics during the study is prohibited. Decreasing doses of aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and/or CD-related antibiotics is prohibited during the study, except in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment related toxicities and after discussion with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD). CD-related antibiotics may be discontinued in Induction Period 2 at the discretion of the Investigator. Note: the duration of the study includes Induction Period 2.Concomitant Corticosteroids Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline must continue their concomitant treatment at the Baseline dose for the duration of the 12-week induction period. Initiation and/or increasing doses of systemic and/or CD related corticosteroids during the entire study is prohibited. Decreasing doses of corticosteroids is prohibited during the 12-week induction period, except in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment related toxicities and after discussion with the AbbVie TA MD. Subjects who enter Induction Period 2 will be allowed to taper their corticosteroids at the discretion of the Investigator. Increasing doses above the Baseline dose is prohibited."
152,page_152,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7.01 (US Only) EudraCT 2016-003190-17 153 Methodology (Continued): Dose SelectionThis study will evaluate two IV doses of risankizumab (600 mg and 1200 mg). The selection of the doses in this study is informed by the analysis of the safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of a Phase 2 study in subjects with CD that explored 200 mg and 600 mg doses. The results from the Phase 2 study suggest a potential for increased benefit with 1200 mg administration. Induction Period 2 will evaluate IV (1200 mg Q4w) or SC (180 mg or 360 mg Q8w; maintenance dosing regimen) risankizumab. The purpose of Induction Period 2 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of re-induction of risankizumab (1200 mg IV at Weeks 12, 16, and 20) versus starting maintenance dosing on clinical response status. Data from the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD suggested that re-induction with 600 mg IV increased both clinical response and clinical remission in subjects with inadequate response at Week 12. The selection of the SC doses is informed by the analysis of the safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of the maintenance period during the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD that evaluated 180 mg SC risankizumab for maintenance. The results from the Phase 2 study suggest a potential for increased benefit with 360 mg SC administration for maintenance regimen. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) An external independent DMC will review unblinded safety data on a cohort level, at a minimum of 6-month intervals throughout the course of the study. At the timing of this amendment, the DMC has provided recommendation that the study may continue without modification and allowed enrollment to begin for 16 – 17 year-olds. A patient information card with information of the symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reactions, infusion related reactions as well as late stage reactions will be provided to the patients at Screening so that any such events once occurred will be reported immediately by the patients to the investigator. A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency and triggers of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. The cardiac adjudication committee (CAC) and anaphylaxis adjudication committee (AAC) adjudicates blinded data and the DMC reviews the data in an unblinded manner. Unblinded adjudicated cardio-cerebrovascular events and anaphylactic reactions will be presented to the DMC for review on a periodic basis. Communications from the DMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion: Main Inclusion: 1. Male or female aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 80 years of age, or minimum age of adult consent according to local regulations, at the Baseline visit.

Proportion of subjects without draining fistulas at Week 12 in subjects with draining fistulas at Baseline For further information, including non-ranked endpoints, refer to protocol. Pharmacokinetics: Serum risankizumab concentrations will be determined from samples collected just prior to dosing at Weeks 4, 8, and 12/PD, and at Week 24 for subjects who enter Induction Period 2. Immunogenicity: Serum ADAs will be determined from samples collected just prior to dosing at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/PD, and at Week 24 for subjects who enter Induction Period 2. Safety: Safety analyses will be performed on safety set which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. Incidence of adverse events (AEs), changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed throughout the study. Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional): Prognostic, surrogate, predictive and pharmacodynamics biomarkers signatures may be investigated. Samples for different applications, potentially including but not limited to pharmacogenetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic, phenotypic, functional and targeted investigations will be collected at various time points. Assessments may include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, lipids, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Statistical Methods: Efficacy:The co-primary endpoints are the proportion of subjects with CDAI clinical remission at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects who achieve endoscopic response at Week 12. A total of approximately 579 subjects will be randomized into two risankizumab treatment groups and the placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio (193 subjects/arm). When all patients complete their Week 12/PD visit, the database will be locked for the final analysis of 12-week induction period. When all the patients who enter the induction Period 2 finish Week 24/PD visit, the database will be locked for the whole study and all the planned analysis for the induction Period 2 will be performed. Assuming the Week 12 CDAI clinical remission rate will be 34% for one of the risankizumab groups and 15% for the placebo group, a sample size of 193 subjects for each risankizumab group and 193 subjects for the placebo group will have approximately 97% power to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab dose groups and placebo in CDAI clinical remission rates at Week 12 using Fisher's exact test at a 0.025 significant lev el (two sided). The comparisons between each risankizumab dose versus placebo for the primary efficacy variable will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by the number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1) and Baseline steroid use (yes, no). Both of the primary efficacy endpoints will be tested at statistically significant of 0.025 for each of the risankizumab dose group versus placebo to adjust for multiplicity. A CMH based two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated."

The primary population for efficacy analysis are the subjects in the intent-to-treat analysis set who had baseline eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease). Subjects who discontinue prior to Week 12 for any reason will be considered as ""not-achieved"" for CDAI clinical remission and endoscopic response endpoints. In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model including factors for treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, and stratification variables, for the longitudinal continuous endpoints. The MMRM analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity: Serum risankizumab concentrations will be summarized at each time point for each dosing regimen using descriptive statistics. Population pharmacokinetic analyses combining the data from this study and other studies may be performed. Relationships between risankizumab exposures and efficacy and safety variables of interest may be explored. ADA incidence will be summarized by cohorts and study visits. ADA titers will be tabulated for each subject at the respective study visits. The effect of ADA on risankizumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy and/or safety variable(s) and/or any additional analyses will be explored. Safety: Adverse events, laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in this study. All safety comparisons will be performed between treatment groups using the safety set. Treatment emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dose of the study drug and within 140 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not participate in Study M16-000 or until first dose of study drug in Study M16-000 if the subject is enrolled in Study M16-000. An overview of treatment-emergent AEs, AEs leading to death and AEs leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the statistical analysis plan [SAP]), AEs by Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to study drug, and AEs by maximum severity will be summarized by number and percentage. Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared between-treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory will be used. Vital signs will be analyzed similarly. Section 3.2 Benefits and Risks Last paragraph previously read: Considering the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects participating in this study have been re-evaluated.

Section 8.2 Determination of Sample Size Previously read: The co-primary endpoints are the proportion of subjects with clinical remission at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects who achieve endoscopic response at Week 12. Sample size calculation is based on the larger sample size needed to detect treatment difference for each of the co-primary endpoints. Since historical data show slightly lower event rate and similar treatment difference versus placebo for the endoscopic response rate than the clinical remission rate at Week 12, clinical remission rates at Week 12 are used for power calculation. A total of approximately 579 subjects will be randomized into 2 risankizumab treatment groups and the placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio with 193 subjects per treatment group). The sample size for this study is based on the expected proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission at Week 12 between risankizumab and placebo. Assuming the Week 12 clinical remission rate will be 23.5% for risankizumab groups and 10% for the placebo group, a sample size of 193 subjects for each risankizumab group and 193 subjects for the placebo group will have approximately 89% power to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab and placebo in clinical remission rates at Week 12 using a Fisher's exact test at alpha level of 0.025 (two-sided). Assuming the Week 12 endoscopic response rate will be 17% for one of the risankizumab dose groups and 5% for the placebo group, this sample size will have 93% power to detect the treatment difference between the risankizumab dose groups and placebo in endoscopic response rates at Week 12 using a Fisher's exact test at alpha of 0.025 (two-sided).

Investigators: Multicenter Study Sites: Approximately 400 sites Study Population: Males and females aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 80 years of age, or minimum age of adult consent according to local regulations at the Baseline visit, or aged 16 to < 18 years of age where locally permitted and who meet the definition of Tanner stage 5 development (refer to Appendix J), at the Baseline visit, with a diagnosis of moderately to severely active CD, defined as: 1. average daily stool frequency (SF) ≥ 4 (when calculating SF, only the number of liquid or very soft stools should be recorded) and/or average daily abdominal pain (AP) score ≥ 2; plus 2. endoscopic evidence of mucosal inflammation measured by the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD). All eligible scores exclude the presence of narrowing component and are confirmed by a central reader. Endoscopic activity is defined as a SES-CD of ≥ 3. The number of subjects enrolled with a SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease will be no more than 58 subjects. Once cap of no more than 58 subjects is reached, enrollment criterion will be an eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease, or eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease. The study will enroll 100% of subjects who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to prior biologic therapy (bio-IR). The bio-IR population is defined as subjects with documented intolerance or inadequate response to one or more of the approved biologic agents for CD (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab). The percent of subjects with exposure, including intolerance or inadequate response to ustekinumab will be no more than 20%. Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: Approximately 579 for the primary ITT population used for efficacy analysis; additionally, up to 58 subjects with lower SES-CD will be enrolled"

Subjects (n = 579) will be randomized 1:1:1 to 1200 mg risankizumab or 600 mg risankizumab or placebo intravenous (IV) given at Baseline, Weeks 4, 8. The randomization will be stratified by both the number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1), Baseline steroid use (yes, no), and Baseline SES-CD (original, alternative), where the stratum of ""original"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for subjects with isolated ileal disease), and the stratum of ""alternative"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease. Visits during the study will occur at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/Premature Discontinuation (PD) to collect clinical and laboratory assessments of disease activity. Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 may be eligible for treatment with blinded risankizumab in Induction Period 2 with evaluation for clinical response at Week 24. All subjects will be provided with a subject diary where they will record CD related symptoms throughout the study. Subjects will also be dispensed a patient information card during Screening. Additionally, subjects will complete symptom, quality of life (QoL) and work productivity questionnaires throughout the study. Clinical labs including, but not limited to, urinalysis, chemistry and hematology, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum risankizumab concentrations, and serum anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels will be collected throughout the study. In addition, stool samples for calprotectin analysis will be collected and should be taken before starting bowel preparations for endoscopy. All endoscopies will be evaluated using SES-CD and will be confirmed by a central reader. Biopsy to confirm diagnosis (during Screening) or to rule out dysplasia/malignancy may be performed during the same time points as the endoscopy. Optional exploratory research samples may be taken during the study. At the Week 12/PD visit, all subjects will undergo an endoscopy for evaluation of mucosal inflammation. It is expected that all subjects who remain in the study through at least Week 8 will have a Week 12/PD endoscopy. All subjects achieving clinical response, defined as ≥ 30% decrease in average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily AP score (both not worse than Baseline) at Week 12 may be eligible to enter Study M16-000. Subjects are not eligible to enter Study M16-000 until endoscopy has been completed (local reader results will be used for stratification for Study M16-000). All subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 may be eligible to receive blinded treatment with risankizumab in Induction Period 2 as described below. Subjects are not eligible to enter Induction Period 2 until Week 12 endoscopy has been completed."

Subjects who received IV risankizumab induction treatment will be randomized 1:1:1 to: !Group 1: 1200 mg IV risankizumab !Group 2: 360 mg SC risankizumab !Group 3: 180 mg SC risankizumab Subjects who received placebo induction treatment will receive: !Group 4: 1200 mg IV risankizumab The IV risankizumab dose or matching IV placebo will be given at Weeks 12, 16, and 20; The SC risankizumab dose or matching SC placebo will be given at Weeks 12, and 20. At Week 24, subjects who received treatment in Induction Period 2 will be reassessed and undergo a third endoscopy for evaluation of mucosal inflammation. Subjects who achieve clinical response at Week 24 may be eligible to enter Study M16-000. Subjects without clinical response at Week 24, as well as all subjects who terminate the study early (including subjects who are eligible for, but do not receive treatment during Induction Period 2) will be discontinued and have a follow-up call 140 days from the last dose of study drug to obtain information on any new or ongoing AEs.

174,page_174,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 7 Methodology (Continued): Dose SelectionThis study will evaluate two IV doses of risankizumab (600 mg and 1200 mg). The selection of the doses in this study is informed by the analysis of the safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of a Phase 2 study in subjects with CD that explored 200 mg and 600 mg doses. The results from the Phase 2 study suggest a potential for increased benefit with 1200 mg administration. Induction Period 2 will evaluate IV (1200 mg Q4w) or SC (180 mg or 360 mg Q8w; maintenance dosing regimen) risankizumab. The purpose of Induction Period 2 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of re-induction of risankizumab (1200 mg IV at Weeks 12, 16, and 20) versus starting maintenance dosing on clinical response status. Data from the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD suggested that re-induction with 600 mg IV increased both clinical response and clinical remission in subjects with inadequate response at Week 12. The selection of the SC doses is informed by the analysis of the safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of the maintenance period during the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD that evaluated 180 mg SC risankizumab for maintenance. The results from the Phase 2 study suggest a potential for increased benefit with 360 mg SC administration for maintenance regimen. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) An external independent DMC will review unblinded safety data on a cohort level, at a minimum of 6-month intervals throughout the course of the study. At the timing of this amendment, the DMC has provided recommendation that the study may continue without modification and allowed enrollment to begin for 16 – 17 year-olds. A patient information card with information of the symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reactions, infusion related reactions as well as late stage reactions will be provided to the patients at Screening so that any such events once occurred will be reported immediately by the patients to the investigator. A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency and triggers of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. The cardiac adjudication committee (CAC) and anaphylaxis adjudication committee (AAC) adjudicates blinded data and the DMC reviews the data in an unblinded manner. Unblinded adjudicated cardio-cerebrovascular events and anaphylactic reactions will be presented to the DMC for review on a periodic basis. Communications from the DMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments.

181,page_181,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 14 Criteria for Evaluation (Continued): Pharmacokinetics:Serum risankizumab concentrations will be determined from samples collected just prior to dosing at Weeks 4, 8, and 12/PD, and at Week 24 for subjects who enter Induction Period 2. Immunogenicity: Serum ADAs will be determined from samples collected just prior to dosing at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/PD, and at Week 24 for subjects who enter Induction Period 2. Safety: Safety analyses will be performed on safety set which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. Incidence of adverse events (AEs), changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed throughout the study. Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional): Prognostic, surrogate, predictive and pharmacodynamics biomarkers signatures may be investigated. Samples for different applications, potentially including but not limited to pharmacogenetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic, phenotypic, functional and targeted investigations will be collected at various time points. Assessments may include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, lipids, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Statistical Methods: Efficacy:The co-primary endpoints are the proportion of subjects with clinical remission at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects who achieve endoscopic response at Week 12. A total of approximately 579 subjects will be randomized into two risankizumab treatment groups and the placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio (193 subjects/arm). When all patients complete their Week 12/PD visit, the database will be locked for the final analysis of 12-week induction period. When all the patients who enter the induction Period 2 finish Week 24/PD visit, the database will be locked for the whole study and all the planned analysis for the induction Period 2 will be performed. Sample size calculation is based on the larger sample size needed to detect treatment difference for each of the co-primary endpoints. Since historical data show slightly lower event rate and similar treatment difference versus placebo for the endoscopic response rate than the clinical remission rate at Week 12, clinical remission rates at Week 12 are used for power calculation. Assuming the Week 12 clinical remission rate will be 23.5% for risankizumab groups and 10% for the placebo group, a sample size of 193 subjects for each risankizumab group and 193 subjects for the placebo group will have approximately 89% power to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab and placebo in clinical remission rates at Week 12 using a Fisher's exact test at alpha level of 0.025 (two-sided). The comparisons between each risankizumab dose versus placebo for the primary efficacy variable will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by the number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1) and Baseline steroid use (yes, no). Both of the primary efficacy endpoints will be tested at statistically significant of 0.025 for each of the risankizumab dose group versus placebo to adjust for multiplicity. A CMH based two-sided 95%confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated."
182,page_182,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 15 Statistical Methods (Continued): Efficacy (Continued): The intent-to-treat (ITT) set includes all randomized subjects who have taken at least one dose of study drug. The primary population for efficacy analysis are the subjects in the intent-to-treat analysis set who had baseline eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease). If the average daily SF or average daily AP score at Week 12 are missing, the non-responder imputation (NRI) approach will be applied. Subjects who discontinue prior to Week 12 for any reason will be considered as ""not-achieved"" for clinical remission and endoscopic response endpoints. In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model including factors for treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, and stratification variables, for the longitudinal continuous endpoints. The MMRM analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity: Serum risankizumab concentrations will be summarized at each time point for each dosing regimen using descriptive statistics. Population pharmacokinetic analyses combining the data from this study and other studies may be performed. Relationships between risankizumab exposures and efficacy and safety variables of interest may be explored. ADA incidence will be summarized by cohorts and study visits. ADA titers will be tabulated for each subject at the respective study visits. The effect of ADA on risankizumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy and/or safety variable(s) and/or any additional analyses will be explored. Safety: Adverse events, laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in this study. All safety comparisons will be performed between treatment groups using the safety set. Treatment emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dose of the study drug and within 140 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not participate in Study M16-000 or until first dose of study drug in Study M16-000 if the subject is enrolled in Study M16-000. An overview of treatment-emergent AEs, AEs leading to death and AEs leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the statistical analysis plan [SAP]), AEs by Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to study drug, and AEs by maximum severity will be summarized by number and percentage. Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared between-treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory will be used. Vital signs will be analyzed similarly."

192,page_192,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 25 3.0 Introduction Crohn's disease (CD) encompasses a spectrum of clinical and pathological processes manifested by focal asymmetric, transmural, and occasionally granulomatous inflammation that can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract and presents with symptoms of fatigue, prolonged diarrhea with or without gross bleeding, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. 1 The disease can affect persons of any age, and its onset is most common in the second and third decades. Females are affected slightly more than males, and the risk for disease is higher in some ethnic groups. 2,3 The incidence of CD has steadily increased in developed countries over the past 3 decades4with recent estimates varying from 12.7 and 20.2 cases/100,000, and a prevalence of 319 and 322 cases/100,000 in North America and Europe, respectively. 5 In Asia, the incidence of CD is estimated to be 0.5 to 1.0 cases per 100,000 persons, with a prevalence rate ranging from 3.6 to 7.7.6,7 The exact cause of CD is still unknown, but is hypothesized to be the result of a dysregulated immune system in the context of a genetically susceptible individual. It is thought that a combination of a patient's genetics, microbiome, immune response, and the environment result in an excessive and abnormal immune response in the gut that results in pathology seen in CD. 2 The aim of medical treatment in CD has been focused on controlling inflammation and reducing symptoms. 8 In addition to improving symptoms, an emerging goal of therapy is to heal the gut mucosa. Resolution of intestinal ulcers, also known as mucosal healing has been associated with positive clinical benefits, including higher rates of clinical remission, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer abdominal surgeries. 9,10 However, improvement of the appearance of the intestinal mucosa may be more difficult to achieve than symptomatic improvement alone. Conventional pharmaceutical therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, thiopurines, methotrexate) are limited, do not always completely abate the inflammatory process, and have significant adverse effects. 1,11 The advent of anti-TNFα agents"
193,page_193,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 26 (e.g., adalimumab) and integrin inhibitors (e.g., vedolizumab) have been shown to achieve clinical remission in patients refractory to conventional therapies.9-13 Despite the benefits of available biologic therapies, many patients do not respond to initial treatment (primary loss of response) or lose treatment over time (secondary loss of response). Regarding anti-TNF agents, approximately 40% of patients will experience primary non-response and secondary non-response occurs in 38% of patients at 6 months and 50% of patients at 1 year. 12,14-17 Additionally, some patients are not candidates for available biologic therapies. Therefore new therapeutic options are required in order to continue to improve the outcome of patients with CD. Risankizumab is a fully humanized mAb of the IgG1 subclass directed towards IL-23p19. The antibody has been engineered to reduce Fc γ receptor and complement binding and potential charge heterogeneity. Risankizumab binds with high affinity to human IL-23 and inhibits IL-23 stimulated IL-17 production at inhibitory concentration (IC) 50 concentrations below 10 pM, as compared with 167 pM for ustekinumab in the same system. Risankizumab does not affect IL-12 at a maximum tested concentration (33 nM) and it does not inhibit IL-12 stimulated IFN- γ production. 3.1 Differences Statement This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two risankizumab induction doses versus placebo during induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active CD. The primary difference between Study M15-991 and the prior phase 2 study of risankizumab in CD is that this study will test a higher dosing of 1200 mg. Additionally, the endpoints in this study are different to reflect the changing regulatory requirements for pivotal registrational studies for new agents for the treatment of CD. 3.2 Benefits and Risks Data suggest that altered immune regulation at the epithelial barrier, leads to an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, tissue destruction, and aberrant tissue repair in CD. Among the cytokines implicated in CD pathogenesis, data at the genetic, human"
194,page_194,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 27 biology and clinical level strongly implicate IL-23 in this disease.18,19 The preclinical and clinical profiles of risankizumab suggest that it may have the potential to address unmet medical need in CD. The data observed in the Phase 2 study suggest that risankizumab will alleviate signs and symptoms of active CD and reduce mucosal inflammation. Participation in this study may help to generate future benefit for subjects with CD. Though there are no serious adverse drug reactions known to be associated with risankizumab therapy, risks of participating in this study include risk of infection and risks related to the study specific procedures of blood sampling, infusion and injection of study drug, and colonoscopy with biopsy. Blood sampling, intravenous (IV) infusions and subcutaneous (SC) injections can cause local bruising, inflammation, and pain. Colonoscopy and biopsy, although generally well tolerated, can be associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in more severe cases, perforation, bleeding, effects from anaesthetic medications, and infection. Local reactions to IV or SC administered biologic therapies are uncommon, and are usually limited to redness, swelling or induration at the injection site. Manifestations of systemic hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis, pruritus, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Both local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions are readily detectable, transient in nature, and manageable with standard medical treatment. Subjects will be closely monitored during drug administration. As with any immune modulating agent, risankizumab has the potential to impair immune function resulting in a risk of infection. This will be addressed by clinical monitoring for adverse events (AEs) during the treatment and follow up periods. Subjects with positive screening for M. Tuberculosis (TB) (skin/interferon-gamma release assay [IGRA] test positive) will be further worked up for signs and symptoms of active TB (e.g., chest x-ray [CXR]). Subjects with active TB will be excluded from enrolling in the study. Subjects with latent TB will be allowed to enroll in line with local guidelines. If latent TB is established, TB prophylaxis/treatment should be initiated and maintained according to"
195,page_195,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 28 local country guidelines. Subjects with current signs or symptoms of infection or history of serious infection will not be included in the study. The role of IL-23 in tumor immunity is not w ell established at this time, but an increased risk of cancer from an IL-23 antagonist, though considered small, cannot be excluded.Although rare, a potential for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is under constant surveillance by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, though there is no known DILI risk with risankizumab, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects' safety. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be assessing all potential safety signals and will be unblinded to treatment allocation. The DMC will review unblinded safety data on a cohort level, at a minimum of 6 month intervals throughout the course of the study. At the timing of this amendment, the DMC has provided recommendation that the study may continue without modification and allowed enrollment to begin for 16 –17 year-olds. A patient information card with information of the symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reactions, infusion related reactions as well as late stage reactions will be provided to the patients at Screening so that any such events once occurred will be reported immediately by the patients to the investigator. Increases in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and cardiovascular death have been reported in drugs with similar mechanism of action to risankizumab (e.g., p40 inhibitors). However, the incidence of MACE has not been observed in longer term studies. While the likelihood of increased MACE is small, all suspected cardiovascular events (serious or nonserious) observed in this study will be adjudicated by an independent adjudication committee. An independent cardiac adjudication committee (CAC) will be adjudicating observed cardio-and cerebro-vascular events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation. In addition, an independent anaphylaxis adjudication committee (AAC) will be adjudicating observed potential anaphylactic events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation."

Considering the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects participating in this study have been re-evaluated. Based on the limited information to date, no additional risk to study participants is anticipated with the use of risankizumab. 4.0 Study Objective The objective of Study M15-991 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus placebo during induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active CD. 5.0 Investigational Plan 5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description The study was designed to enroll approximately 579 subjects to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled. In addition to the 579 subjects, up to 58 subjects with a lower SES-CD, defined as an eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease will be enrolled in order to inform treatment effect in this patient population, but these subjects will not be included in the primary ITT population for efficacy analysis. This is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction study to assess the efficacy and safety of risankizumab in subjects with moderately to severely active CD, defined as: 1. average daily stool frequency (SF) ≥ 4 (when calculating SF, only the number of liquid or very soft stools should be recorded) and/or average daily abdominal pain (AP) score ≥ 2; plus"

All eligible scores exclude the presence of narrowing component and are confirmed by a central reader. Endoscopic activity is defined as SES-CD of ≥ 3. The number of subjects enrolled with a SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease will be no more than 58 subjects. Once cap of no more than 58 subjects is reached, enrollment criterion will be an eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease, or eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease. All endoscopies will be centrally read to document eligibility and for assessment at the time points indicated in Appendix C . The study will enroll subjects who have had a documented inadequate response (IR) or intolerance to use of an approved biologic agent (bio-IR), such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab. The percentof subjects with exposure, including intolerance or inadequate response, to ustekinumabwill be no more than 20%. The study duration may be up to 49 weeks, including a Screening period of 35 days, a 12-week induction period, a 12-week Induction Period 2 for those subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12, and a 140 days of follow up period from the last dose of study drug. Visits for clinical evaluation will occur at Baseline Weeks 4, 8, and 12/PD. Subjects, who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12, will be offered blinded risankizumab in Induction Period 2 with evaluation for clinical response at Week 24. At the study visit indicated in Appendix C , all subjects will be provided with a subject diary where they will record CD related symptoms throughout the study. Subjects will also be dispensed a patient information card during Screening. Additionally, subjects will"

Clinical labs including, but not limited to, urinalysis, chemistry and hematology, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum risankizumab concentrations, and serum anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels may be collected. In addition, stool samples for calprotectin analysis will be collected and should be taken before starting bowel preparations for endoscopy. All endoscopies will be evaluated using SES-CD and will be confirmed by a central reader. Biopsy to confirm diagnosis (during Screening) or to rule out dysplasia/malignancy may be performed during the same time points as the endoscopy. Optional exploratory research samples may be taken during the study. Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio as shown in Figure 1 . At the timing of this amendment, the DMC has provided recommendation that the study may continue without modification and allowed enrollment to begin for 16 – 17 year-olds."

Once written informed consent is obtained, subjects will undergo screening procedures. The length of time between Screening and the Baseline visit must allow time for endoscopy central reading and lab results. The Screening period (35 days ± 7 days is granted around all study visits) may be extended as necessary after consultation with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-TB therapy, or in case of external circumstances (e.g., due to the delay of availability of screening test results). Laboratory values that are exclusionary can be re-tested once during the screening period upon discussion and clearance with TA MD. If the re-tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will be considered a screen failure. Redrawing samples if previous samples were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since the previous result was never obtained. Clinical laboratory assessments as specified in Appendix C will only need to be repeated at Baseline if the time between Screening and Baseline is > 14 days, or if the subject's health status has changed to warrant a repeat test. All subjects need to have their average daily SF, average daily AP, and CDAI calculated and meeting eligibility criteria before randomization at Baseline. 12-Week Induction Period At the Baseline visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study and randomized to the double-blind induction period where they will receive either risankizumab 1200 mg IV, risankizumab 600 mg IV, or placebo. The randomization at"

During this period of the study, subjects will visit the study site at Weeks 4, 8 and 12/PD. Subjects, who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 and choose to continue in the study, will have additional visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 for blinded Induction Period 2 with risankizumab. A ± 7-day window is permitted around scheduled study visits. An effort will be made to bring subjects back to their original scheduled visit (calculated from Baseline) if they are out of the visit window. At the Week 12/PD visit, all subjects will undergo an endoscopy for evaluation of mucosal inflammation. It is expected that all subjects who remain in the study through at least Week 8 will have a Week 12/PD endoscopy. All subjects achieving clinical response, defined as ≥ 30% decrease in average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily AP score (both not worse than Baseline) at Week 12 may be eligible to enter Study M16-000. Subjects are not eligible to enter Study M16-000 until endoscopy has been completed (local reader results will be used for stratification for Study M16-000). All subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 will be able to receive blinded risankizumab in Induction Period 2, as specified below. Subjects are not eligible to receive blinded Induction Period 2 therapy until endoscopy has been completed. Induction Period 2 At Week 12, subjects who do not achieve clinical response will be randomized by Interactive Response Technologies (IRT) to Induction Period 2, a double-blind, double-dummy 12-week treatment period.

Initiation and/or increasing doses of systemic and/or CD related corticosteroids during the entire study is prohibited. Decreasing doses of corticosteroids is prohibited during the 12-week induction period, except in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment related toxicities and after discussion with the AbbVie TA MD. Subjects who receive blinded therapy in Induction Period 2 during Weeks 12 to 24 will be allowed to taper their corticosteroids at the discretion of the Investigator. While stopping the taper is permitted, increasing doses above the Baseline dose is prohibited. Follow-Up Period/Premature Discontinuation (PD) Subjects may discontinue treatment at any time during the study participation (Section 5.4). Subjects who end study participation early will have a PD visit and complete the procedures outlined for the PD visit in Appendix C as soon as possible after the last dose of study drug and preferably prior to the administration of any new therapies. Subjects who discontinue the study or subjects who complete the Week 12/Week 24 visit and do not roll-over into Study M16-000 will have a follow-up call 140 days from the last dose of study drug to obtain information on any new or ongoing AEs. Re-Screen Subjects who initially screen fail for the study may be permitted to re-screen following re-consent. The subject must meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the time of re-screening in order to qualify for the study. There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re-screen for the study.

If a subject is being rescreened within 14 days ( ≤ 14 days have passed) from the date of the previous screening testing, it is not required to repeat testing for chemistry/hematology, urinalysis, serum pregnancy, and C. difficile provided that the subject's health status has not changed to warrant a repeat test. In this case, all Baseline testing should be performed at the Baseline visit. If rescreening occurs more than 14 days (> 14 days have passed) from the collection date of the previous screening testing then new samples (chemistry/hematology, urinalysis, serum pregnancy, and C. difficile ) should be collected during Rescreening. In this case, chemistry/hematology, urinalysis do not need to be repeated at the Baseline visit if Baseline occurs within 14 days ( ≤ 14 days) from the date of rescreening testing provided that the subject's health status has not changed to warrant a repeat test.

If the serum pregnancy test is positive, study drug will be permanently discontinued. A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation or continuation in this study or be allowed to continue study drug. High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) Blood samples for hs-CRP will be obtained per Appendix C . The hs-CRP results will remain blinded to Investigator, study site personnel and the subject. Blood draws should be performed, as much as possible, after all efficacy assessments, questionnaires (CDAI, IBDQ, etc.), and vital sign determinations are obtained and before study drug administration during a visit. In order to maintain the study blind, local routine laboratory testing should not be performed."

During screening subjects will be instructed on how to calculate the number of very soft and liquid stools, including a visual depiction. Physical exam and appropriate laboratory values will be calculated at all study visits beginning at Baseline. The Screening period will be a minimum of 7 days to calculate the Baseline scores. The CDAI scores must be calculated using a central laboratory hematocrit (Hct) value from the same visit for all visits, except Baseline, where the most recent Screening Hct value will be used. The final CDAI for all other visits will be calculated once the hematocrit value is received from the central lab. If the Hct is missing due to technical issues (e.g., lost sample, clotted sample, etc.), the Hct value from the preceding visit may be used. Instructions to calculate CDAI ●To answer questions one (1) through three (3), entries from the 7 days prior to the visit should be used as recorded by the subject from the diary. ●Diary entries should not be included in the 7 days evaluated prior to the visit if: (1) the day the subject received medication for bowel preparation prior to endoscopy, (2) the day the subject underwent an endoscopy, and (3) 2 days following the endoscopy. Diary entries, up to 14 days prior to the visit, will be used accordingly in order to provide the most recent data for 7 days prior to the respective study visit. The 7 days do not need to be consecutive. ●In question four (4) , for the section regarding presence of anal fistulas and other fistulas, all fistulas detectable on physical examination (draining and non-draining) should be captured on the CDAI and calculated into the CDAI score. ●And the evaluation for fever should include all the days that are taken into account for the calculation of the CDAI. ●When completing question five (5) (""Taking Lomotil/Imodium/Loperamide/opiates for diarrhea, 0 = no, 1 = yes"") on the"

The use of these medications takes into account only the day of the scheduled visit and is only assessing their use as anti-diarrheals ●For question seven (7) , hematocrit results from central laboratory will be used for the CDAI calculation. If the hematocrit value contains more than one decimal point, the rounding will be allowed to the tenths decimal (e.g., Hct value 33.44 will be captured as 33.4, Hct value of 33.45 will be captured as 33.5). The Hct values either prior to completing the calculation or at the subtotal box 7 of the CDAI should not be rounded to a whole number. ●For question eight (8) , the height obtained at Screening should be used when selecting the standard weight in Appendix G , and this standard weight should be used for calculating every CDAI throughout subject participation in the study. ●Standard height is calculated by using the height obtained at Screening (without shoes) adding 1 inch or 2.5 cm. For subjects < 18 years of age at Baseline, height will be re-measured at Week 12 and Week 24 (if applicable) and standard height should be recalculated. ●If the body weight obtained at the time of assessment is not captured in kilograms (kg), then when converting into kg, rounding should occur using the second digit after the decimal (also known as the hundredth place) where if the number is 0 – 4, then keep the first digit after the decimal (also known as the tenth place) unchanged. If the second digit after the decimal is 5 – 9, then round up the first digit after the decimal (e.g., 90.246 would be captured as 90.2 and 97.687 would be captured as 97.7). ●The subtotal of box 8 should not be rounded to a whole number. The calculation of the CDAI score is in Appendix F . Endoscopy An endoscopy will be performed on the following visits: ●During Screening* ●Week 12/PD"

In addition, where possible, the Investigator or sub-Investigator should be the endoscopist for the study. It is expected that all subjects who remain in the study through at least Weeks 8 will have a Week 12/PD endoscopy. * An endoscopy performed before the Screening visit, independently of the study, may be used as the Screening endoscopy, with the approval of the AbbVie TA MD, if the following conditions are met: 1. Biopsy confirmation of the diagnosis is available according to section ""Biopsy During Endoscopy"" below, as applicable. 2. The endoscopy took place within 45 days prior to Baseline visit. 3. The endoscopy was recorded in a video format as the endoscopic eligibility will be determined by the central reviewers. All ileocolonoscopies will be performed and recorded at the site in a video format. Sites should also perform the SES-CD assessment and record the findings on the SES-CD score sheet ( Appendix E) and in the appropriate eCRF. All endoscopies will be reviewed by a central reviewer who is blinded. Endoscopies completed at Week 12 and Week 24, for those subjects who undergo blinded therapy in Induction Period 2, will use the local reader results for stratification for Study M16-000. There will be a window of ± 7 days to conduct the ileocolonoscopy. This window may be extended as necessary after consultation with the AbbVie TA MD in case of external circumstances. The endoscopies performed at the time points described above will be used to provide the endoscopy subscores to calculate the SES-CD. All attempts should be made by the endoscopist to explore all segments of the colon and terminal ileum, including intubation"

The endoscopy subscores by segment will be noted in the subject's source documents and in the database but the central reviewer's endoscopy subscore will be used for the efficacy analyses. Biopsy During Endoscopy Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of CD, in the assessment of the Investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's eligibility for the study. Biopsies may be done when performing the endoscopy to confirm CD diagnosis (if appropriate documentation for confirmation of the diagnosis does not exist), and/or to rule out dysplasia and colon cancer at the Investigator's discretion. These biopsies will be processed and evaluated locally and the histology report should be available in the subject's medical records. If any biopsy sample(s) are obtained, it should also be recorded on the video. Any biopsy sample(s) will be collected from the respective bowel segment during the withdrawal of the endoscope and after sufficient recording for the central reader to calculate the SES-CD. The signed pathology report will be monitored by the responsible CRA and kept with the subject's source documents onsite. Subjects should not be enrolled if high grade colonic dysplasia or colon cancer is discovered at Screening endoscopy or endoscopy performed within 45 days prior to Baseline visit. Subjects may be enrolled if low grade colonic dysplasia is discovered during endoscopy and is completely removed. If a diagnosis of high grade colonic dysplasia or colon cancer is discovered during any subsequent endoscopic evaluation during the course of the study, the findings should be recorded as an AE and the subject should be discontinued from the study. If low grade colonic dysplasia is discovered during any subsequent endoscopic evaluation during the course of the study, the findings should be entered as an AE and the subject can continue in the study if the lesion has been completely removed."

All subjects should complete their subject diary on a daily basis throughout the entire study. The diary will be reviewed by site personnel with the subject at each visit and collected at the Final/PD visit, unless the subject continues into Study M16-000. Subjects will also be dispensed a patient information card at Screening. Completion will be reinforced during study visits as necessary.

For WOCBP subjects, the urine pregnancy test needs to be negative prior to receiving study drug. The site will be provided administration instructions. Also, the initial 20 subjects enrolled between the Phase 3 induction trials will be monitored on site for 2 hours after completion of each infusion. Subjects should be observed after study drug administration until judged clinically stable by the study personnel. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of study drug should be discontinued immediately, appropriate laboratory testing samples drawn and appropriate therapy initiated. Study drug kits are assigned by the IRT following the subjects randomized treatment schedule. (Refer to Section 5.5for additional information.) During the Study Drug Dosing Period, a subject with confirmed (viral test positive) or suspected COVID-19 infection can only be dosed with study drug if the following COVID-19 viral clearance criteria are met: ●Symptomatic subjects: At least 2 negative viral tests in a row, ≥ 24 hours apart after at least 10 days have passed since recovery, defined as resolution of fever without use of antipyretics and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) ●Asymptomatic subjects: At least 2 negative viral tests in a row, ≥ 24 hours apart after at least 10 days have passed since prior positive result (note: subjects who develop symptoms will follow guidance above for symptomatic subjects) 5.3.1.2 Collection and Handling of Optional Exploratory Research/Validation Studies Samples Subjects will have the option to provide samples for exploratory research and validation studies.

The procedures for obtaining and documenting informed consent are discussed in Section 9.3. Exploratory research can help to improve our understanding of how individuals respond to drugs and our ability to predict which patients would benefit from receiving specific therapies. In addition, exploratory research may help to improve our understanding of how to diagnose and assess/monitor CD by assessing associations between disease characteristics, outcomes data and biomarkers of interests. Validation studies, including those related to the development of potential in vitro diagnostic tests, may be carried out retrospectively in order to assess associations between events of interest (i.e., efficacy and/or safety events) and candidate biomarkers. AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the biomarker exploratory research/validation studies samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples will be retained while research on risankizumab (or drugs of this class) or this disease and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion. It is preferred that the subject has fasted (8 hours, except for water) prior to sample collection, however it is not required. It must be recorded whether the subject has fasted or not at the time of collection in the laboratory request, source document, and eCRF.

The IRT will provide access to blinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency. In the event of a medical emergency in which the Investigator believes that knowledge of study drug treatment is required, reasonable efforts must be made to contact the AbbVie TA MD (see Section 6.1.5 ) prior to breaking the blind, as long as it does not compromise subject safety. However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary which warrants breaking the blind prior to contacting AbbVie TA MD, the Investigator can directly access the IRT system to break the blind without AbbVie agreement. In the event that the blind is broken before notification to AbbVie TA MD, it is requested that the AbbVie TA MD be notified within 24 hours of the blind being broken. Also, the date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source document and eCRF, as applicable. 5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product In order to maintain the blind, it is necessary to have unblinded site staff (unblinded licensed pharmacist or qualified designee) to prepare the IV solutions and blind the doses. Study personnel who administer the infusions to the subjects must remain blinded. The Administration Instructions and Dose Preparation Instructions are to be checked for the staff requirements for all activities concerning handling of study kits, including IRT transactions. 5.5.5.2 Data Monitoring Committee An external independent DMC will review unblinded safety data on a cohort level, at a minimum of 6-month intervals throughout the course of the study."

The DMC charter will describe the composition of the DMC, the roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency and triggers of data reviews, relevant safety data to be assessed, meeting occasions, and communication with AbbVie as well as relevant competent authorities, if necessary. The DMC is responsible for monitoring safety data, alerting AbbVie to possible safety concerns related to the conduct of the study, and recommending appropriate actions for the study conduct. At the timing of this amendment, the DMC has provided recommendation that the study may continue without modification and allowed enrollment to begin for 16 – 17 year-olds. A patient information card with information of the symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reactions, infusion related reactions as well as late stage reactions will be provided to the patients at Screening so that any such events once occurred will be reported immediately by the patients to the investigator. The DMC will review safety data at a minimum of 6-month intervals throughout the course of the study. The DMC will determine if more frequent DMC meetings are required based on review of the accumulating safety data. In addition, ad-hoc DMC meetings will be scheduled in the event of any significant safety concerns. Based on these reviews, the DMC will make recommendations, as appropriate, regarding the conduct and management of the study. The CAC and AAC adjudicate blinded data and the DMC reviews the data in an unblinded manner. Unblinded adjudicated cardio-cerebrovascular events and anaphylactic reactions will be presented to the DMC for review on a periodic basis. Communications from the DMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments."

The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol. 5.5.7 Drug Accountability The Investigator or designee (blinded or unblinded as applicable) will verify that study drug supplies are received intact, at the appropriate temperature, and in the correct amounts from the depot. This will be accomplished by documenting the condition of the shipment, verifying the kit numbers in the package against the Proof of Receipt (POR) or similar document included with each drug shipment, and documenting this verification by signing and dating the POR or similar document and via direct reporting in IRT. The original POR note or similar document will be kept in the site files as a record of what was received. In addition, IRT will be used to document investigational product accountability including date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date and number of vials and syringes dispensed, and subject number. For this study, unless otherwise prohibited locally, these records will be maintained electronically as part of the IRT system. An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed by the site and reconciliation will be performed by the CRA/monitor (blinded or unblinded according to the monitoring plan) throughout the study and at the site close-out visit. After verification of drug accountability, used study drug must be destroyed at the site according to local regulations governing biohazardous waste. Destruction of used study supplies must be completed and documented in such a way that blinding is maintained for all blinded study personnel. All unused supplies must be inventoried, accounted for and destroyed on site according to local procedures or regulation or returned to a destructionfacility.

The use of a third party vendor for drug destruction must be pre-approved by AbbVie. For sites performing on-site drug destruction or using a third party vendor for drug destruction, a copy of the destruction methodology and date of destruction should be maintained at the site's facility. 5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design 5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups Risankizumab is a selective IL-23 inhibitor that may provide improved clinical benefit to risk profile in CD patients. The proposed study is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risankizumab compared to placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active CD, who have had inadequate response or intolerance to biologic agents such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab. The study consists of a 12 week induction period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different IV risankizumab doses (600 mg or 1200 mg, Q4w) versus placebo. For subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12, an optional blinded Induction Period 2 (IV, 1200 mg, Q4w; SC, 360 mg, Q8w; SC, 180 mg, Q8w) for an additional 12 weeks will be offered. Subjects with clinical response at the end of induction or Induction Period 2 can enter Study M16-000 for an additional 52 weeks of treatment, with additional OL treatment being offered through approval. At this time, a 12-week placebo controlled study is necessary for registrational purposes. A comparative study utilizing placebo provides an unbiased assessment of the efficacy and safety profile of risankizumab. Furthermore, as approved biologics for CD are increasing, comparisons versus active drugs are important for market access. To ensure all subjects are given the opportunity to receive potentially efficacious therapy, all"
251,page_251,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 84 subjects not responding after 12 weeks can participate in the blinded Induction Period 2 with risankizumab. 5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements Standard statistical, clinical, endoscopy-related and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study. All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with CD. All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted. Central reading of endoscopy will increase study rigor and ensure enrollment of subjects with moderately to severely active CD. 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population Adult male and female subjects with moderately to severely active CD who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are eligible for enrollment in this study. The specific population chosen was based on the unmet medical need of those subjects with a history of inadequate response or intolerance to biologic therapies. 5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study AbbVie plans to evaluate two doses of risankizumab (600 mg and 1200 mg) via IV administration every 4 weeks (Q4w; Weeks 0, 4, 8) through induction (12-Week Induction Period) and an additional three doses of 1200 mg of risankizumab via IV administration (Q4w; Weeks 12, 16, 20) or two doses of 180 or 360 mg SC (Q8W, Weeks 12 and 20; Induction Period 2) for subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12. The selection of the doses in this study is informed by the analysis of safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of a Phase 2 study in subjects with CD (Study 1311.6) and the pharmacokinetic data from the completed studies in subjects with psoriasis (Studies 1311.1 and 1311.2). Results from the placebo controlled Study 1311.6 that evaluated 200 mg and 600 mg IV doses of risankizumab at Weeks 0, 4, 8 weeks for induction suggests increasing trend of clinical response and remission (for both CDAI and PRO-2 based measures) at Week 12 with increasing risankizumab dose and exposure, indicating a potential for further"
252,page_252,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 85 improvement in proportion of subjects with response and remission with evaluation of higher doses. Preliminary model predictions suggest further incremental benefit in CDAI remission in subjects with CD at 1200 mg IV Q4w dose compared to 600 mg IV Q4w dose. The evaluation of higher dose data (1200 mg IV Q4w) will facilitate a more robust characterization of the dose-response and exposure-response relationship for these efficacy endpoints. Inclusion of 1200 mg IV dose in this study is further supported by the safety results from the 12 week blinded induction period in Study 1311.6. The safety profile of the 600 mg risankizumab group compared favorably with the placebo group and no overall safety concerns were identified which would preclude evaluation of IV induction doses higher than 600 mg risankizumab in patients with CD. Furthermore, the projected steady state exposures for the 1200 mg IV risankizumab Q4w regimen in subjects with CD are covered by safety margins of ~1.6 and ~3.6 for C maxand AUC 0-28 days respectively (relative to NOAEL identified in the 26 week GLP toxicology study). Induction Period 2 will evaluate IV (1200 mg Q4w) or SC (180 mg or 360 mg Q8w) risankizumab. The purpose of Induction Period 2 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of re-induction of risankizumab versus starting maintenance dosing on clinical response. Data from the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD suggested that re-induction with 600 mg IV increased both clinical response and clinical remission. The selection of the SC doses is informed by the analysis of the safety and efficacy data, as well as the exposure-response relationship of efficacy, of the maintenance period during the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD that evaluated 180 mg SC risankizumab for maintenance. The results from the Phase 2 study suggest a potential for increased benefit with 360 mg SC administration for maintenance regimen. 6.0 Complaints A Complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for distribution."

An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product."
254,page_254,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 87 Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event. Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event. Supplemental study case report forms should be completed in the event of COVID-19 related missed/virtual visits, study drug interruptions or discontinuations, or adverse events (including capture of specific signs/symptoms of infection and testing results). COVID-19 infections should be captured as adverse events. If the event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE), then follow the SAE reporting directions per the protocol and above.

Systemic Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic Reactions Therapeutic protein products, such as biologics, may elicit a range of acute effects, from symptomatic discomfort to sudden, fatal reactions that have often been grouped as 'infusion reactions' in the past. Although the term implies a certain temporal relationship, infusion reactions are otherwise not well defined and may encompass a wide range of clinical events, including anaphylaxis and other event that may not be directly related to antibody responses, such as cytokine release syndrome. In the event of a suspected systemic hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction, in addition to the standard AE eCRF, a supplemental eCRF should also be completed by the site. The clinical criterion for diagnosing anaphylaxis is provided in Appendix H for reference; symptoms of anaphylactic reaction usually occur within 24 hours after exposure to an allergen. These are guidelines that are used to help diagnose anaphylaxis. The investigator is encouraged to report any suspected reactions. All intravenous and subcutaneous doses of risankizumab will be administered by study- site personnel under the direction of the Investigator. Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for signs and symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions,"

All appropriate medical support measures (e.g., diphenhydramine, steroids, epinephrine, oxygen) for the treatment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions should be available for immediate use in the event that a suspected hypersensitivity reaction occurs. Subjects who manifest any new signs or symptoms during the infusion should be monitored for appropriate resolution prior to leaving the site. Subjects are encouraged to report any symptoms related to a possible infusion related reactions or local injection site reaction or late phase reactions to the site any time during the study.

The ITT subjects will be analyzed as randomized."
267,page_267,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 100 8.1.1.2 Safety Analysis Set The safety analysis set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of the study drug. The safety set will be analyzed as treated, according to treatment the subject actually received. The safety set will be used for safety analysis. 8.1.2 Definition of Missing Data Imputation Missing data will be imputed using one or more of the following methods: Non-Responder Imputation (NRI): In NRI analyses, subjects who prematurely discontinue the study prior to efficacy assessment at Week 12 will be considered non-responders with respect to the efficacy endpoint. Observed Cases (OC): The OC analysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from the OC analysis for that visit. 8.1.3 Subject Disposition The number and percentage of subjects who are enrolled, randomized and received at least one dose of study drug, and the number of subjects who prematurely discontinued and the reason for premature discontinuation will be summarized by treatment group. Premature discontinuation of study drug will be summarized for each treatment group, as well as for all subjects combined, with frequencies and percentages overall and by reason for discontinuation for all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Subjects may have multiple reasons for prematurely discontinuing study drug, but will be counted no more than once for the total (""Any Reason""). 8.1.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographics (where collection is allowed) and Baseline characteristics of the study subjects will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of observations, mean, standard deviation,"

For other categorical or discrete variables, frequencies and percentages will be computed in each category for each treatment group, as well as for all subjects combined. 8.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications Prior therapy and medications will include all therapies and medications administered prior to the date of the first dose of study drug. Prior therapy and medication will be summarized for all randomized subjects. No statistical test will be performed. Concomitant medications will be summarized for all randomized subjects. Concomitant medications will be summarized using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary with frequencies and percentages for each treatment group. No statistical test will be performed. 8.1.6 Efficacy Analysis 8.1.6.1 Primary Efficacy Variables The co-primary endpoints are the proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects who achieve endoscopic response at Week 12. The comparisons between each risankizumab dose versus placebo for the primary efficacy variable will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1) and steroid use at Baseline (yes, no). A multiple testing procedure will be used to provide strong control of the type 1 error rate at alpha = 0.05 (2-sided) across analyses comparing each risankizumab dose level to placebo with respect to the co-primary endpoints, and ranked secondary endpoints. Specifically, testing will utilize a sequence of hypothesis testing for the co-primary endpoints followed by the ranked secondary endpoints, and will begin with testing each of the co-primary endpoints using α of 0.025 (2-sided) for each dose compared to placebo. If both co-primary endpoints achieve statistical significance within a dose level, continued testing will follow a pre-specified weight of α allocation between the single hypothesis within the family, as well as between the families of hypotheses across the doses. Details will be"

A CMH based two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated. If average daily SF or average daily AP score or endoscopic data at Week 12 are missing, the NRI approach will be applied. Subjects who discontinue prior to Week 12 for any reason will be considered as ""not-achieved"" for clinical remission and endoscopic response endpoints. Sensitivity analyses for missing data handling using MI, PMM and OC will be performed for co-primary endpoints and details will be outlined in the SAP. 8.1.6.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables The secondary efficacy variables are divided into two groups. The first group includes ranked secondary endpoints, which are ranked by clinical importance. Statistical significance is assessed at the pre-specified alpha level (two-sided) in ranked endpoint order until the significant level exceeds the pre-specified alpha level. No additional statistically significant treatment differences could be declared if the preceding ranked endpoint fails to achieve the pre-specified alpha level. The second group includes all other additional secondary variables. All analyses of secondary endpoints will be performed using the ITT analysis set. In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model including factors for treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, and stratification variables, for the longitudinal continuous endpoints. The MMRM analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes. Categorical secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using the CMH test controlling for stratification variables. Non-responder imputation for missing data will be used for categorical secondary endpoints. Analysis of Pattern Mixture Model (PMM) will be performed as sensitivity analyses for ranked secondary endpoints."

Incidence of AEs, including those related to study drug, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed. AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that began or worsened in severity after initiation of study drug and within 140 days after the last dose of the study drug. An overview of treatment-emergent AEs, including AEs leading to death and AEs leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the SAP), AEs by MedDRA preferred term and system organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to study drug, and AEs by maximum severity will be summarized by number and percentage. Continuous laboratory and vital sign parameters will be summarized for each treatment group by visit. Treatment group differences between each of the risankizumab dosing groups and the placebo group for changes from Baseline may be analyzed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Vital signs and laboratory data will be described by statistical characteristics and frequency of abnormal values. In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory will be used. Analysis details will be specified in the SAP. 8.1.8 Analysis of Optional Exploratory Variables For exploratory biomarkers that are measured, including but not limited to pharmacogenetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic and immune cell surface markers or functional biomarkers, the association of biomarkers to the efficacy and safety endpoints may be explored for each biomarker one at a time, and also for combinations of biomarkers via some multivariate predictive modeling algorithms. Optimal multivariate combinations of biomarkers that associate with efficacy endpoints, subject response/non-response (with respect to appropriate clinical endpoints), and also with safety endpoints may be explored via a variety of statistical predictive modeling"
271,page_271,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 104 algorithms. Cut-points for individual biomarkers and optimal combinations of biomarkers that differentiate the subject response with respect to efficacy/safety endpoints may be explored using the in-house developed subgroup identification algorithms: Sequential BATTing, PRIM, AIM BATTing, and AIM Rule. The significance of these multivariate combinations of biomarkers may be assessed via at least 20 iterations of 5-fold cross-validation. 21,22 8.1.9 Analysis of Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Variables Serum risankizumab concentrations will be summarized at each time point for each dosing regimen using descriptive statistics. In addition, ADA incidence will be summarized by cohorts and study visits. ADA titers will be tabulated for each subject at the respective study visits. Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses and may not be part of the clinical study report. Population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses of only data from this study may not be conducted. The following general methodology will be used for the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Population pharmacokinetic analyses of risankizumab will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing. Pharmacokinetic models will be build using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach with NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version). The structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic analysis data from previous studies. Systemic clearance and volume of distribution of risankizumab will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of major interest in the NONMEM analyses. If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be estimated if useful in the analysis. The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models: 1. The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the alternative model(s)."

The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity (a straight line with zero intercept and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s). 3. Visual inspection of model fit, standard errors of model parameters and change in inter-subject and intra-subject error. Once an appropriate base pharmacokinetic model (including inter- and intra-subject error structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated by the posterior conditional estimation technique using NONMEM. The relationship between these conditional estimates CL/F or V ss/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as ADA classification, subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, possibly baseline inflammatory and disease markers) may be explored using stepwise forward selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.01. After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates from the full model will be employed to evaluate the significance (at P < 0.001, corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 10.83 for one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model. Linear or non-linear relationships of primary pharmacokinetic parameters with various covariates may also be explored. Relationships between exposure and clinical observations (primary or secondary efficacy or safety variables of interest) may be explored. Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate. 8.2 Determination of Sample Size The co-primary endpoints are the proportion of subjects with clinical remission at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects who achieve endoscopic response at Week 12."
273,page_273,"Risankizumab M15-991 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2016-003190-17 106 Sample size calculation is based on the larger sample size needed to detect treatment difference for each of the co-primary endpoints. Since historical data show slightly lower event rate and similar treatment difference versus placebo for the endoscopic response rate than the clinical remission rate at Week 12, clinical remission rates at Week 12 are used for power calculation. A total of approximately 579 subjects will be randomized into 2 risankizumab treatment groups and the placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio with 193 subjects per treatment group). The sample size for this study is based on the expected proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission at Week 12 between risankizumab and placebo. Assuming the Week 12 clinical remission rate will be 23.5% for risankizumab groups and 10% for the placebo group, a sample size of 193 subjects for each risankizumab group and 193 subjects for the placebo group will have approximately 89% power to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab and placebo in clinical remission rates at Week 12 using a Fisher's exact test at alpha level of 0.025 (two-sided). Assuming the Week 12 endoscopic response rate will be 17% for one of the risankizumab dose groups and 5% for the placebo group, this sample size will have 93% power to detect the treatment difference between the risankizumab dose groups and placebo in endoscopic response rates at Week 12 using a Fisher's exact test at alpha of 0.025 (two-sided). 8.3 Randomization Methods A total of approximately 579 subjects will be randomized into two risankizumab dose groups and the placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by the number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1), steroid use at Baseline (yes, no), and Baseline SES-CD (original, alternative), where the stratum of ""original"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for subjects with isolated ileal disease), and the stratum of ""alternative"" includes the patients with baseline SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileaocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease. Subjects with clinical non-response to risankizumab at Week 12 will be re-randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1200 mg IV dose group, 360 mg SC dose group, or 180 mg SC dose group. Subjects with clinical non-response to placebo at Week 12 will blindly receive 1200 mg risankizumab IV dose."

Update inclusion/exclusion, prior and concomitant therapy, and medical/surgical history information to assure subject eligibility. e. Physical examinations are full physical examinations at Screening and Week 12 and Week 24 if the subject receives treatment i n Induction Period 2. Physical examinations at all other visits (including unscheduled visits) are symptom based and should include the assessment of EIMs and a count of the number of cutaneous fistulas as part of calculating the CDAI. f. Blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, respiratory rate and weight should be performed before blood draws are performed. H eight will be measured at Screening only (with shoes off and then adding 1 inch or 2.5 cm) for subjects ≥ 18 years of age. Height will be re-measured at Week 12 and Week 24 (if applicable) for subjects < 18 years of age at Baseline. g. Collection of SAEs and protocol-related nonserious AEs begins the day the subject signs the informed consent. h. Subjects with negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and/or PPD test within 90 days of Screening will not require a repeat test (d ocumentation must be available). PPD skin test is to be read 48 to 72 hours after placement. In case of positive PPD/positive or repeat indeterminate IGRA testing, subj ects may participate in the study if further work up (according to local practice/guidelines) is negative for active TB. i. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required, provided so urce documentation is available. Subjects can have a repeat ECG at any time during the study as warranted based on the opinion of the Investigator. j. Subjects will be tested for the presence of the HBV and HCV at Screening. A positive result for the hepatitis B surface anti gen (HBs Ag) or hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable in any subject with anti-HCV Ab) will be exclusionary. For subjects who are negative for HBs Ag but are positive for core antibodies (HBc Ab), HBV DNA PCR will be performed and any result that meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary. k. HIV testing will be performed at the central laboratory, which will report the results directly to the sites. AbbVie will no t receive results from the testing. l. Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by the sites at required visits. A microscopic analysis will be performed by the centr al laboratory, in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal. m. Urinalysis, chemistry and hematology, hs-CRP, and FCP may be collected at other scheduled and unscheduled visits than indicat ed in the table if they are warranted by the Investigator. n. Lab assessments will only need to be repeated at Baseline if the time between Screening and Baseline is greater than 14 days, or if the subject's health status has changed to warrant a repeat test. o. Serum pregnancy test will be performed on all WOCBP at Screening. Urine pregnancy test will be performed locally as indicate d in the table for all WOCBP.

For the visit when endoscopy will be conducted, st ool sample should be collected prior to bowel prep and should be returned to the site per the instructions provided outside of this protocol. If a sample cannot be obtained duri ng the site visit, the site will give instructions and a stool sample supply kit. r. Diary information collected during Screening will serve to calculate Baseline CDAI. During Screening, subjects will be instr ucted on how to calculate the number of very soft and liquid stools, including a visual depiction. CDAI should be completed at Baseline visit, just prior to randomization. s. Endoscopy at/during the Screening period or within 45 days of the Baseline visit will be used to calculate the SES-CD score a t Baseline. Endoscopic evaluations using SES-CD confirmed by central reader will be done at Screening. Endoscopies completed at Week 12 and Week 24, for those subjects who receive treatment in Induction Period 2, will use the local reader results for stratification for Study M16-000. t. Biopsies may be done when performing the endoscopy to confirm CD diagnosis (if appropriate documentation for confirmation of the diagnosis does not exist), and/or to rule out dysplasia and colon cancer at the Investigator's discretion. These samples will be processed and assessed locally. Histol ogy report should be available in the subject's source records. u. Administration of drug will be performed after all assessments and examinations scheduled for that day have been completed, i ncluding endoscopy. Completion of PROs are permitted during administration of study drug. At Week 12, study drug will only be administered for subjects who are to receive treatment in Induction Period 2. Subjects will also be dispensed a patient information card. In the event of a suspected systemic post-dose hypersensitivity reaction, s erum risankizumab, ADA, and nAb should be collected once within 24 hours of the reaction. In addition, tryptase sample should be obtained between 15 minutes to 3 hours of symptom onset, and no later than 6 hours, and another sample is requested a minimum of 2 weeks after the recorded event or at the next study visit. Also, plasma histami ne sample should be obtained within 5 to 15 minutes of the onset of symptoms and no later than 1 hour. v. Subjects should also be dispensed the patient information card. w. For Rescreening, if a subject is being rescreened within 14 days ( ≤ 14 days have passed) from the collection date of the previous screening testing, it is not required to repeat Screening testing for chemistry/hematology, urinalysis, serum pregnancy, and C. difficile provided that the subject's health st atus has not changed to warrant a repeat test. x. For Rescreening, if the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation including the TB test, hepatitis B virus (HBV), h epatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and electrocardiogram (ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated for re-screening provided the conditi ons noted in Section 5.3.1.1 are met and no more than 90 days have passed since the collection date of the testing. y. Assessment for signs/symptoms of COVID-19 infection. If the investigator suspects the possibility of COVID-19 based on the s igns, symptoms and medical complaint (chief complaint, history of exposure, etc.), local laboratory testing must be completed."

Tanner Stage 5 for Development Tanner Stage 5 for Development25,26 Puberty and the Tanner Stages – developed by Professor James M Tanner IntroductionAdolescents experience several types of maturation, including cognitive (the development of formal operational thought), psychosocial (the stages of adolescence), and biologic. The complex series of biologic transitions are known as puberty, and these changes may impact psychosocial factors. The most visible changes during puberty are growth in stature and development of secondary sexual characteristics. Equally profound are changes in body composition; the achievement of fertility; and changes in most body systems, such as the neuroendocrine axis, bone size, and mineralization; and the cardiovascular system. As an example, normal cardiovascular changes, including greater aerobic power reserve, electrocardiographic changes, and blood pressure changes, occur during puberty. The normal sequence of pubertal events and perils of puberty are reviewed here. This is within the normal ranges and does not take into account Precocious Puberty or Delayed Puberty. Tanner StagesConceptually, pubertal maturation can be described in terms of sequence, timing, and tempo (Puberty consists of a series of predictable events, and the sequence of changes in secondary sexual characteristics has been categorized by several groups. The staging system utilized most frequently is that published by Marshall and Tanner and the sequence of changes, commonly referred to as ""Tanner stages,"" is described below."
