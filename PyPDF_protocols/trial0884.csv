The standard treatment is en bloc excision, but the site of origin of the disease often prevents complete resection . For these patients, debulking surgery followed by radiation therapy (RT) or high -dose RT alone can be an alternative. However, local relapses or more rar ely metastatic disease frequently occur, and there is no efficient standard systemic therapy available. Only very limited responses are seen with chemot herapy or targeted agents, such as imatinib and lapatinib. In chordoma cell lines and patient biopsies, the p16 ( cyclin -dependent kinase Inhibitor 2a, CDKN2A) tumor suppressor is consistently deleted. Thus, chordomas are an example of a tumor with universa l activation of the cyclin -dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) pathway, and experiments with patient -derived chordoma cell lines demonstrate aberrant CDK4/6 activity downstream of p16 loss can be efficiently inhibited by the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib , resulting in reduced proliferation and growth of neoplastic cells. We aim to conduct a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the small -molecule CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in patients with locally advanced/metastatic chordoma who are not c andidates for standard therapy. The primary objective is disease control in patients with chordoma treated with palbociclib as single agent. The study design of this phase -II study is based on a Simon two - stage design . Correlative laboratory investigations include s extensive molecular screening at study entry, systematic biobanking, and correlative studies in primary samples and cell lines. Together, this trial establish es whether the overreliance of chordomas on the activation of the CDK4/6 -Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) pathway can be exploited for therapeutic benefit. Based on previous experience with 125 mg palbociclib once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days of rest in patients with breast cancer, liposarcoma, non -small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcino ma, ovarian cancer, mantle -cell lymphoma, and glioblastoma, this regimen is chosen. Based on a Simon optimal two -stage design , the disease control rate (DCR) is the primary endpoint, whereby response is defined as complete re sponse (CR), partial re sponse (PR), or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria after six cycles. For sample size calculation , we estimate a poor response with 10% and a good response with 25% (power, 80%; alpha, 5%) leading to a first stage of 18 patients and, if three o r more patients responded , to a second stage with additional 25 patients (total n=43)."

Sie leiten sich aus Resten der Chorda dorsalis her und tret en deshalb präferentiell an Schädelbasis und Steißbein an den Enden der Wirbelsäule auf. Die Standard therapie ist eine chirurgische en bloc Resektion; wenn diese aufgrund der Lokalisation nicht möglich ist, dann ist ein chirurgisches Debulking gefolgt von Strahlentherapie eine alternative Therapieoption. Allerdings treten häufig lokale Rezidive und gelegentlich eine Metastasierung der Erkrankung auf. In diesem Stadium der Erkrankung steht aktuell keine Standardtherapie zur Verfügung. Therapeutische Ansätze mit zytostatischer Chemotherapie oder zielgerichteten Ansätzen mit Imatinib oder Lapatinib führen zu insgesamt niedrigen Ansprechraten. In Chordomzell linien und primärem Tumormaterial ist der Tumor suppressor p16 (Cyclin -dependent kinase Inhibitor 2a, CDKN2A) regelhaft deletiert. Somit sind Chordome eine beispielhafte Tumorentität mit einer universellen CDK4/6 -Aktivierung. Experimente mit aus Patienten gewonnenen Chordom - Zelllinien zeigen, dass die aberrante CDK4/6 -Aktivität „downstream “ von p16 mit dem spezifischen CDK4/6 -Inhibitor Palbociclib gehemmt werden kann, mit einer deutlich reduzierten Proliferationsrate. Unser Ziel ist eine Phase -II Studie mit dem CDK4/6 Inhibitor Palbociclib bei Patienten mit lokal fortgeschrittene n bzw. metastasierten Chordo men, die nicht mit einer Standardtherapie behandelt werden können, durchzuführen. Das Studiendesign dieser Phase -II Studie fußt auf dem Simon two -stage design mit dem primäre n Endpunkt Ansprechen, welche r die Grade komplette Remission (CR) , partielle Remis sion (PR), sowie stabile Erkrankung (SD) umfasst . Begleituntersuchungen mit molekularem Profiling bei Studieneinschluss, systematisches Biobanking, und korrelative Untersuchungen an Primärmaterial und Zell linien sind vorgesehen. Diese Studie wird zeigen, o b die Abhängigkeit von Chordomen vom CDK4/6 - Retinoblastoma 1 ( RB1) Signalweg therapeutisch nutzbar ist. Basierend auf vorhergehenden klinischen Studie n wird die Dosis von 125 mg Palbociclib einmal täglich über 21 Tage gefolgt von 7 Tagen Therapiepause wie bereits bei Pati enten mit Brustkrebs, Liposa rkomen, kleinzelligem Lungenkarzinom, hepatozellulärem Karzinom, Ovarialkarzinom, Mantelzell -Lymphom und Glioblastom eingesetzt, als sicher eingeschätzt. Der primäre Endpunkt wird in Abwesenheit eines klinisch of fensichtlichen Progresses nach 6 Monaten überprüft. Für die Fallzahlkalkulation wurde eine schlechte Ansprechrate mit 10% und eine gute Ansprechrate mit 25% (power, 80%; alpha, 5%) definiert. Dies führt zu einer Fallzahl von 18 Patienten in der ersten Stuf e und, bei Ansprechen von 3 oder mehr Patienten, zu weiteren 25 Patienten in der zweiten Stufe (Gesamt n=43)."

Patient reported outcome including Quality of life Trial Design Non-randomized, single -arm, open -label, multicenter phase II trial, designed to gain first evidence of antitumor activity of palbociclib in adult patients with (locally) advanced or metastatic chordoma. A total of 18 (stage I) or 43 patients (stages I+II) evaluable for the primary outcome (DCR) need to be treated guided by Simon's optimal two -stage design. Investigational Medicinal Product(s) Palbociclib (Ibrance®) 125 mg, 100 mg or 75 mg Capsule /Tablet Sample Size 18 in the first stage 25 in the second stage (only if first stage was positive) Total sample size: minimum 18 patients; maximum 43 patients Statistical Analysis The study is a phase II trial with a standard palbociclib dose of 125 mg once daily for 21 days in a 28 -day cycle. The study needs 43 patients evaluable for the primary endpoint to complete. The sample size and power calculations were based on Simon's optimal two -stage design (Simon, 1989). The type I error was set at  = 0.05, the type II error at  = 0.2. Here, the n ull hypothesis that the true response rate is less or equal to p0 = 0.1 is tested against a one -sided alternative, where the desirable level of response is 0.25. In the first stage, n1 = 18 patients are accrued. If there are r1 = 2 or fewer responses in these 18 patients, the study is stopped. Otherwise, 25 additional patients are accrued for a total of n = 43 patients.

The compound prevents cellular DNA synthesis by blocking progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle, as demonstrated in laboratory models and early clinical trials. Palbociclib inhibits purified CDK4 -catalyzed phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein with an IC 50 of less than 20 nM . Palbociclib prevents Rb phosphorylation at serine 780 and 795, inducing a G1 arrest. Estimated steady -state plasma concentrations of 1,000 ng/mL resulted in 80% to 90% inhibition of phospho -Rb formation and 50% reduction of tumor growth. Reduction in phospho -Rb was rapidly reversible as plasma palbociclib concentrations declined. CDK6, another enzyme that also complexes with cyclin -D subunits, is also commonly expressed in mammalian cells and tumors. CDK6 is highly homologous to CDK4 and can perform the same function by phosphorylating Rb, thus potentially creating a redundant mech anism to promote cell cycle progression. Palbociclib inhibits purified CDK6 with an IC 50 of 15 nM .1 In humans, the primary routes of metabolic clearance for [14C]-palbociclib include multiple oxidative pathways and a single conjugative pathway (sulfonation ). Minor primary routes of metabolism include glucuronidation and acylation (acetylation and formylation) pathways. Based on the sum of radioactivity in peaks from feces and urine that can be ascribed exclusively to primary and secondary oxidative metaboli tes, greater than 50% of the clearance mechanism can be assigned to oxidative pathways, while primary conjugative processes (sulfonation and glucuronidation) contribute approximately 26% and 2%, respectively, to the overall clearance, with acylation (formy l and acetyl) pathways contributing less than 3%.1 A study in 26 healthy women of non -childbearing potential evaluated drug -drug interaction with midazolam. This pharmacokinetic study was conducted to evaluate the potential of palbociclib to act as a time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 at steady -state. Plasma midazolam C max and AUC inf values increased 1.37 and 1.61 -fold, respectively, when single oral doses of midazolam were co -administered with multiple doses of palbociclib as compared to its administrati on alone. This is consistent with weak time -dependent CYP3A4/5 inhibition mediated by palbociclib at steady -state following daily 125 mg dosing.1 Two completed phase I studies have established dosing regimens of 200 mg daily for two weeks of three, or 125 mg daily for three weeks in a four -week cycle .2, 3 Following repeated daily dosing to day 14 and day 21 (assumed to be steady -state), palbociclib was absorbed with a median T max of approximately four hours. The mean palbociclib Vz/F was 3,103 L, which is s ignificantly greater than total body water (42 L), indicating that palbociclib extensively penetrates into peripheral tissues. Palbociclib was eliminated slowly with a mean t½ of 27 hours. Renal excretion of palbociclib is the minor route of elimination wi th ~1.7% of the drug excreted unchanged in urine over the 10 -hour collection period after dosing with 125 mg and 200 mg. The mean renal clearance (CLR) is ~6.6 L/hour. In all clinical studies, neutropenia has been the most frequently reported adverse event . In each case, neutropenia was the dose -limiting toxicity and the one -week break was required for neutrophil recovery. This toxicity profile is likely to be a result of transient growth arrest in hematopoietic precursor cells.4 Gastrointestinal toxicity, alopecia, mucositis, neutropenic fever, or infection were rare. Palbociclib was tested in CDK4 -amplified liposarcoma and promising results have been reported.5, 6 Similarly, palbociclib has also shown promising activity in mantle -cell lymphoma.7 The devel opment of palbociclib in breast cancer is most advanced; it has broad activity in breast cancer cells in vitro, especially the estrogen receptor -positive luminal type.8 Several clinical studies from phase I to phase III showed impressive prolongation of p rogression -free survival by"

FDA approved IBRANCE® (palbociclib) capsules in combination with letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER) -positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative advanced breast cancer as initial endocrine -based therapy for their metastatic disease. The resent investigation in vivo with patient -derived chordoma cell lines demo nstrated that downstream machinary of p16 can be efficiently inhibited by the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, resulting in reduced proliferation and growth of neoplastic cells10. 1.1.2 Chordomas Chordomas are rare tumors considered to arise from persistent notochordal remnants along in the vertebral bodies10. Because of their slow growth, there is no efficient standard chemotherapy: therapy of choice is surgery followed by radiotherapy. After surgical therapy of this orphan disease , chordoma recurs in up to 50% of patients and metastasizes in 20% an more10. Only a minority is cured by surgery, the disease -free survival is generally short10. The median survival is 6 to 7 years after diagnosis, although the range varies from months to 25 years. High -dose radiot herapy is administered for residual or recurrent disease10. Patients who have metastases and have inoperable recurrent disease are not eligible for further radiotherapy. Therefore, there is a strong unmet need for systemic pharmacologic therapy. Aggressive chemotherapy has been described to be effective in rare cases of dedifferentiated chordomas10. Only limited response is seen by therapy with alkylating agents (ifosfamid), anthracyclines (doxorubicin), and cisplatin10. In the first prospective phase II st udy with 9 -nitrocamptothecin, one patient out of 15 achieved a partial response10. Recently, new targeted therapy options using erlotinib, cetuximab, gefitinib, sunitinib, thalidomide, and lapatinib have been published10. An activated platelet -derived grow th factor receptor b (PDGFRb) was described as a basis for therapy with imatinib in patients with progressive disease7, 8. Because of the rar ity of this tumor and only a few well characterized chordoma cell lines , there is limited experience with preclinic al models10. Recent ly, systematic pharmacologic screening of our first published two chordoma cell lines U -CH1 and U -CH2 chordoma cell lines , we found that the tumor suppressor p16 (CDKN2A) is deleted and that p16 protein is not expressed in these cell lines. This deletion has been described in the majority of chordomas10. The downstream machinery of p16 can be efficiently inhibited by CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib10. Inhibition of this pathway by palbociclib is a defined mechanism to reduce the proliferation and growth of neoplastic cells10. 1.2 Trial Rationale/ Benefit -Risk Assessment 1.2.1 Trial Rationale The aim of this phase II study is to gain first evidence of antitumor activity of palbociclib in patients with locally advanced or metastasi zed chordoma not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy . Currently, no standard treatment is available in this clinical situation and tumor control rates in published experimental approaches are low (<50%). Thus , there is a clear u nmet medical need to evaluate new treatment approaches based on solid preclinical data. 1.2.2 Benefit -Risk Assessment Chordoma is a rare bone tumor. The standard treatment is en bloc excision, but the site of origin of the disease often prevents complete surgery. For thes e patients, debulking surgery followed by radiation therapy (RT) or exclusive high -dose RT can be an alternative. However, local relapses occur in >50% of cases, while metastases affect >20% of patients. Systemic therapy is needed in patients not amenable to surgery or RT11. Only very limited responses are seen with chemotherapy or targeted agents, such as imatinib and lapatinib. However, no active drugs are approved to date11. In chordoma cell lines and patient biopsies, the p16 (CDKN2A) tumor suppressor is consistently deleted. Thus, chordomas are an example of a tumor with universal activation of the CDK4/6 pathway, and experiments with"

Palbociclib, an orally available pyridopyrimidine , is a highly selective, reversible inhibitor of CDK4 and 6 that is being studied for use in the treatment of cancer. The most common side effects of palbociclib are reversible neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, constipation, nausea, and diarr hea. Taking into the consideration beneficial safety profile, palbociclib may offer these patients a more specific and effective treatment option. 1.4 Reference Committees 1.4.1 Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) An IDMC is assembled. The IDMC is composed of two independent experts, assessing the progress and safety data. The mission of the IDMC is to ensure the ethical conduct of the trial and to protect the safety interests of patients in this trial. The IDMC meet s virtually after 18 patients have finished at least one cycle of study treatment . Based on its review , the IDMC provide s the sponsor with recommendations regarding trial modification, continuation or termination. Further details including IDMC members are specified in the IDMC charter. 2 Trial Objectives 2.1 Primary Objective Primary objective of this phase II trial is to gain first evidence of antitumor activity of palbociclib in adult patients with (locally ) advanced or metastasized chordoma not amenable to to curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy . The primary endpoint is the disease control rate (DCR) after six cycles of palbociclib , which is defined as the presence of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST version 1.1 (compare Section 7.3.1 for definitions) . 2.2 Secondary Objectives Secondary objectives include further efficacy (clinical response , survival ), safety and quality of life analyses . Secondary endpoints:  Tumor response rate (TRR), defined as the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1. 1 after six cycles of study medication (compare Section 7.3.1 for definitions) .  Progression -free survival (PFS) , defined as the time from first administration of the IMP to progression of disease or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients without the event are censored on the last date of follow -up.

A total of 18 (stage I) or 43 patients (stages I+II) evaluable for the primary outcome (DCR) need to be treated guided by Simon's optimal two-stage design . 4 Trial Duration and Schedule The duration of the trial for each patient is expected to be 12 months , including 6 treatment cycles and 6 month s of follow -up. In case of clinical benefit , it will be longer. Each patient remain s on treatment until disease progression or other reasons for withdrawal. Conditions leading t o patient withdrawal from the study are detailed in Section 5.5 Criteria for Withdrawal . Treatment response is assessed every 12 wee ks according to REC IST version 1.1 criteria. In case of progressive disease, study therapy will be stopped. In patients showing response or stable disease, therapy within the study is intended until progression or LPLV . After 6 treatment cycles , primary efficacy assessment take s place. Patients are followed for 6 month s after discontinuation of study medication . There is no further follow -up in all patients under treatment with palbociclib at LPLV. LPLV is 12 months after LPFV at the latest. Recr uitment of minimally 18 and maximally 43 patients evaluable for the primary endpoint takes place at 3 investigator sites in Germany . A recruitment period of approximately 4 years and an overall s tudy duration of approximately 6 years is anticipated. The treatment duration for an individual patient is estimated to be 2 -6 months, but may be prolonged in patients with sustained response (“case -by-case decision”). After finishing all study -relevant procedures, therapy, and follow -up period, the patient is followed in terms of routine care and treated if necessary by the primary responsible hematology/oncology center.

No patient is allowed to enrol l in this trial more than once. 5.5 Criteria for Withdrawal 5.5.1 Withdrawal of Patients A patient must be withdrawn from the trial treatment or/and all trial -related procedure s for the following reasons:  At any time at their own request. Withdrawal of patient’s consent to continue therapy. Unresolved AEs should be followed.  Unacceptable toxicity dictating cessation of treatment  Changes in medical status of the patient such that the investigator believes that patient safety is compromised or that it would be in the best interest of the patient to stop treatment  Pregnancy  Non-compliance by the patient with protocol requirements  Patient is lost to follow -up. If a patient does not return for scheduled visits, every effort should be made to re -establish contact. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document patient outcome if possible. If the patient withdraws from the trial and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information (e.g. follow -up vi sits), no further evaluat ions are allowed to be performed and no additi onal data can be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 5.5.2 Handling of Withdrawals In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the case report form (CRF) and in the patient ’s medical records. In case of withdrawal of a patient at his/ her own request, the reason should be asked for as extensively as possible and documente d."

Patients who go off study due to adverse events before final staging at 6 months are considered treatment failures, receive reponse status = PD (progressive disease) , and are not be replaced. Patients going off study for other reasons (drop -outs; e.g. lost-to-follow -up, death unrelated to disease/treatment, retracted IC, etc. without assessment of the primary outcome are replaced until the goal of 18 or 43 patients (as the case may be) is met. 5.5.4 Premature Closure of the Clinical Trial or a Single Center The trial can be prematurely closed or suspended by the Sponsor after consulting the Coordinating Investigator . The Ethics Committee (EC) and the competent regulatory authorities must then be informed. Furthermore, the Ethics Committee(s) and competent regulatory authorities themselves may decide to stop or suspend the trial. Should the trial be closed prematurel y, all trial material (completed, partially completed, and blank CRFs, investigational medicinal product and other material ) must be returned to the Sponsor in Heidelberg or treated according Sponsor notice . All involved investigators have to be informed i mmediately about a cessation/ suspension of the trial. The decision is binding to all trial centers and investigators. The Sponsor after consulting the Coordinating Investigator has the right to close a center, at any time, in case of:  Non-compliance wit h the protocol  Poor data quality  No recruitment 5.6 Prior and Concomitant Illnesses Relevant additional illnesses present at the time of informed consent are regarded as concomitant illnesses and are documented on the appropriate pages of the CRF. Included are conditions that are seasonal, cyclic, or intermittent (e.g. seasonal allergies; intermittent headache). Abnormalities which appear for the first time or worsen (intensity, frequency) during the trial are adverse events (AEs) and must be documented on the appropriate pages of the CRF. 5.7 Background Medication Not applicable. 5.8 Prior and Concomitant Medication Relevant additional treatments administered to the patients on entry to the trial or at any time during the trial are regarded as concomitant treatments and must be documented on the appropriate pages of the CRF. Directives for supportive care are outlined below. 5.8.1 Supportive Care Antiemetics support: emesis prophylaxis is mandatory and is administered at the investigator’s discretion using institutional or DGHO guidelines taking into accou nt potential interactions (e.g. CYP3A4 inhibition/induction) . Antidiarrheal support: infectious work -up is left at the investigator’s discretion using institutional guidelines. Treatment with antidiarrheal drugs is recommended once the earliest signs of diarrhea are present. Patients should be instructed to refer immediately to the center in case of such symptoms, and treatment should proceed according to institutional or DGHO guidelines. Hematopoietic support: RBC and PLT transfusions should be administered as indicated."

If neutropenic complications are observed in a previous cycle, CSFs may be given at the discretion of the investigator, but only if dose reduction or delay of palbociclib are not considered reasonable alternatives. Antibiotic treatment: patients with neutropenic fever or systemic infection should be hospitalized promptly for i.v. antibiotic therapy. Pain relief: analgesics can be administered as needed. 5.8.2 Other Permitted Concomitant Medications Therapies considered necessary for the patient’s well -being may be given at the discretion of the investigator, such as chronic treatments for concomitant medical conditions as well as agents required for life -threatening medical problems, analgesics, etc. Patients should be advised to contact their physician before starting any new drug. 5.8.3 Prohibited Medications During Therapy With Palbociclib and Interactions With Strong I nhibitors/Inducers of Cytochrome P450 -3A4 Strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers: palbociclib is metabolized to multiple metabolites in a qualitatively similar manner in rat, dog, and human liver microsomes. In vitro, palbociclib is primarily metabolized by CYP3 A4 enzymes. Co -administration with drugs that are CYP3A inhibitors or inducers may change the plasma concentrations of palbociclib in humans. The concurrent use of potent CYP3A inhibitors, including but not limited to aprepitant, amprenavir, atazanavir, bo ceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin, fosamprenavir, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, mibefradil, miconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, verapami l, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice are not allowed. The concurrent use of potent CYP3A inducers, including but not limited to carbamazepine, felbamate, nevirapine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentin, and St. John’s Wort is not allowed. Refer to the following website for additional information on CYP3A4 inhibitors, inducers, and substrates: http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/table.htm Based on in vitro data, palbociclib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated transport. Therefore, administration of palbociclib with medicinal products that are substrates of P -gp (e.g., digox in, dabigatran, colchicine) or BCRP (e.g., pravastatin, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine) may increase their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Based on in vitro data, palbociclib may inhibit the uptake transporter organic cationic transporter OCT1 and then may increase the exposure of medical product substrates of this transporter (e.g., metformin). In addition, co -medication with corticosteroids above 7.5 mg prednisolone/predn isone equivalent during the study period is prohibited to avoid masking of infections. 6 Investigational Medicinal Product /-s 6.1 General Information about Investigational Medicinal Product /-s Investigational medicinal product 1: Drug Code: PD-0332991 -00 Trade name : IBRANCE"

While there are no safety issues tablets are more convenient allowing intake with or without food. The active ingredient, dosage strength and administration schedule are the same . Bioequivalence is given. Patients in the NCT-PMO - 1601 trial are treated with capsules from the beginning and will be switch ed to tablets upon availibility . Instructions in this protocol are valid without change . 6.2 Therapeutic/Diagnostic Effects Palbociclib, an orally available pyridopyrimidine, is a highly selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclin - dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CD K4/6) that is being studied for use in cancer treatment. The compound prevents cellular DNA synthesis by blocking progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle, as demonstrated in laboratory models and early clinical trials. 6.3 Known Side Effe cts The most common side effects of palbociclib are reversible neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, constipation, nausea, and diarrhea. Serious adverse events considered to be related to palbociclib included febrile neutropenia, unstable angina, diarrhea, ischemic colitis, pneumonia and bronchopneumonia, dehydration and metabolic acidosis, allergic alveolitis, and attempted suicide. In vitro data indicate that palbociclib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, tilithromycin, nefazodone, diltiazem, verapamil, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavi r, atazanavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, and grapefruit juice) are thought to represent the most significant potential for drug interaction with palbociclib. In addition, concomitant administration of agents that are strong CYP3A inducers (such as phenoba rbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine, and St. John’s Wort) may reduce the exposure to palbociclib and are thus not recommended.

The investigator at the clinical site is responsible for en suring that all sections of the CRF are completed correctly and that entries can be verified against source data. The CRF has to be filled out according to the specified CRF Completion Guidelines. The correctness of entries in the CRF is confirmed by dated signature of the responsible investigator. All data is reported pseudonymized. 7.2.2 Sample Collection and Handling Tumor biopsy Tissue blocks preferably not older than 12 months are requested either from initial diagnosis or from biopsies of locally adv anced disease or metastatic sites. A corresponding pathology report should be included along with the archival sample. In case of re -biopsies before study entry , also fresh material could be send by courier in provided standard medi um to the central pathol ogy lab. Biopsies are analy zed for p16 (CDKN2A) tumor suppressor expression level at : Institute of Pathology, M23 University of Ulm Albert -Einstein -Allee 11 89075 Ulm Blood samples Blood samples of 40 ml blood (for details see sample ship ping-manual) taken at every dedicated visit are used for biobanking.

All lesions are assessed local ly and reported at each scheduled scan. The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline is employed in the following tumor assessments. Target Lesions Complete response ( CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. Partial response ( PR) is defined as a ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. Progressive disease ( PD) is defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions recorded while on study , or th e appearance of one or more new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Stable disease ( SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient incre ase to qualify for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions since the treatment started. Non-Target Lesions Complete response ( CR) is defined as the disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non -pathologica l in size (<10 mm short axis). Non-CR/Non -PD is defined as a persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion. 7.4 Measurem ent of Safety Parameters The following laboratory parameters are used to monitor safety: Hematology (local lab): hemoglobin, RBC, PLT, WBC and differential cell counts should be performed at bas eline, weekly during the first treatment cycle, in each first week during following cycles (including ExT), Visit 6 and 11 . Clinical status and laboratory parameters are to be followed using individual institutional guidelines and the best clinical judgment of the responsible physician, which can involve more frequen t testing, especially in neutropenic/aplastic patients. It is expected that patients on this protocol are cared for by physicians experienced in the treatment and supportive care of patients with acute leukemia . Blood chemistry (local lab): including creat inine, albumin, BUN, AP, AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, serum uric acid, total bilirubin, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and LDH, are performed at baseline and then once a week during the first treatment cycle , in each first week during following cycles (including ExT) , at primary efficacy assessment, and during follow -up while ongoing treatment , or following individual institutional guidelines and the best clinical judgment of the responsible physician, which can be more often. Prothrombin time , aPTT , and fibrinogen are measured at baseline and at appropriate times during treatment cycles at the investigator’s discretion. Urinalysis (local lab ), pH, glucose, proteins [qualitative, dipstick accepted] are performed at baseline and at appropriate times d uring treatment cycles at the investigator’s discretion."

Hepatitis A, B, and C as well as HIV -1 testing (local lab) is performed at baseline and thereafter at the investigator’s discretion. 7.5 Measurement of Further Parameters Vital signs Height, weight, temperature, WHO performance status, and blood pressure / pulse are collected. Height (in cm) is measured at baseline only. Weight (in kg), WHO performance status , temperature (in grade centigrade), and blood pressure/pulse are measured at baseline and before the start of every new cycle. Echocardiography Cardiac ultrasound is performed at baseline as safety assessment and thereafter at the investigator’s discretion. Ejection fraction must be specified in case of abnormalities and quantified . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) A 12 -lead ECG is performed at baseline and during the first treatment cycle every week as well as additionally at the investigator’s discretion. For the purpose of this study, QTc B intervals are calculated according to the formula of Bazett: For QTc B intervals > 450 ms and ≤ 470 ms, check magnesium and potassium levels and correct any abnormalities. If possible, stop any medication that may prolong the QTc B interval. Continue palbociclib. For QTc B intervals > 470ms and ≤ 500 ms, check magnesium and potas sium levels and correct any abnormalities. If possible, stop any medication that may prolong the QTc B interval. Reduce palbociclib to the next lower dose level or, if the lowest dose level is reached, discontinue palbociclib. For QTc B intervals > 500 ms, i mmediately stop palbociclib, check magnesium and potassium levels and correct any abnormalities. If possible, stop any medication that may prolong the QTc B interval. Re -start palbociclib if the QTc B interval is < 470ms. If QTc B interval is not improved (QTc B remains > 470 ms for more than three weeks), discontinue palbociclib until QTc B improves to < 470 ms, then resume palbociclib. Missed doses of palbociclib are not made up. 8 Ancillary and Post Trial Care After the end of the 6 months follow -up phase , patients are routinely followed -up usually including visits every 3 months , and treated regarding standard of care according to the discretion of the treating physician."

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigation al) product. An AE may be:  New symptoms/ medical conditions  New diagnosis  Changes of laboratory parameters  Intercurrent diseases and accidents  Worsening of medical conditions/ diseases existing before inclusion into the trial  Recurrence of disease  Increase of frequency or intensity of episodical diseases. A pre -existing disease or symptom is not considered an adverse event unless there is an untoward change in its intensity, frequency or quality. This change is documented by an investigator. Surgical proce dures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE. Planned surgical measures permitted by the clinical trial protocol and the condition(s) leading t o these measures are not AEs, if the condition leading to the measure was present prior to inclusion into the trial. AEs are classified as ""non -serious"" or ""serious"". 9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that at any dose:  Result s in death  Is life -threatening (the term life -threatening refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of event and not to an event which hypothetically might have cause death if it was more severe)  Requires patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or  Results in a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  Any other important medical event may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgement, it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 9.1.3 Expectedness , Reference Safety Information (RSI) An ‘unexpected’ adverse event is one the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable reference safety information (RSI) included in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) . In this trial the current version of the SPC is considered RSI. Furthermore, reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known adverse reaction may be counted as ‘unexpected’ events (cf. 9.4 Expedited Reporting) . 9.1.4 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) SAEs that are both suspected, i.e. possibly related to IMP , and ‘unexpected’, i.e. the nature and/ or severity of which is not consistent with the RSI are to be classified as Suspected Unexpected Serious A dverse Reactions (SUSARs)."

All SUSARs are subject to an expedited reporting to the responsible ethics committee(s), the competent higher federal authority (BfArM) , and to all participating investigators. 9.2 Period of Observation and Documentation All AEs rep orted by the patient or detected by the investigator are collected during the trial , and must be documented on the appropriate pages of the CRF. AEs must also be documented in the patient ’s medical records. In this trial, all AEs that occur after first adm inistration of the IMP are documented on the pages provided in the CRF. The individual period of observation ends 28 days after the last dose of the IMP for chordoma . All patients who have AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the trial medica tion or not, must be monitored to determine the outcome. The clinical course of the AE is followed up until resolution or normalization of changed laboratory parameters or until it has changed to a stable condition. 9.2.1 Grading of AEs The grading of AEs in this trial is carried out on the basis of the 5 -grade scale defined in the CTCAE v5.0. Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, lo cal or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL* Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL**. Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grad e 5: Death related to AE A Semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) *Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. **Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. The grading of all AEs listed in the CTC AE v5.0 is based on the information contained therein. The grading of all other AEs, i.e. those which are not listed in the CTCAE v 5.0 are performed by a responsible investigator, based on definitions of CTCAE v 5.0 shown in the table above. 9.2.2 Coherenc e between AEs and the IMP The investigator evaluate s each AE that occurred after administration of investigational medicinal product regarding the coherency with the administration of the investigational medicinal product according to the definitio ns of the WHO : Definitely related: There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by IMP. A certain event has a strong temporal relationship and an alternative cause is unlikely. Probably related An AE that has a reasonable possibility that the event is likely to have been caused by IMP. The AE has a timely relationship and follows a known pattern of response, but a potential alternative cause may be present."

The AE has a timely relationship to the IMP; however, the pattern of response is atypical, and another cause seems more likely . Unlikely related : Only a remote connection exists between the IMP and the reported adverse event. Other conditions including concurrent illness, progression or expression of the disease state or reaction of the concomitant medication appear to explain the reported adverse event. Not related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence related to IMP and is likely to have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, other modes of therapy or other known etiology. Unassessable/Unclassified: A report suggesting an AE which cannot be judged because of insufficient or contradictory information, or a report which cannot be supplemented or verified. 9.2.3 Outcome of AEs The outcome of an AE at the time of the last observation is classified as: Recovered/ resolved All signs and symptoms of an AE disappeared without any sequels at the time of the last interrogation. Recovering/ resolving The intensity of signs and symptoms has been diminishing and/or their clinical pattern has been changing up to the time of the last interrogatio n in a way typical for its resolution. Not recovered/ not resolved Signs and symptoms of an AE are mostly unchanged at the time of the last interrogation. Recovered/ resolved with sequel Actual signs and symptoms of an AE disappeared but there are sequels related to the AE. Fatal Resulting in death. If there are more than one AE only the adverse event leading to death (possibly related) is characterized as ‘fatal‘. Unknown The outcome is unknown or implausible and the information cannot be supplemented or verified. 9.2.4 Action taken with the IMP The action taken with IMP is assigned to one of the following categories: Dose not changed No change in the dose of IMP. Dose reduced Reduction in the dose of IMP. Temporary discontinuation Temporary discontinuation of IMP. Drug withdrawn Discontinuation of IMP. Unknown The information is unknown or implausible and it cannot be supplemented or verified. Not applicable The question is implausible (e. g. the patient is dead). 9.2.5 Treatment of SAE The term ‘ Treatment of SAE ’ refers to the specific actions taken to treat or alleviate adverse events or to avoid their sequel ae. The f ollowing categories are used to categorize th is treatment : None No action taken"

The initial report must be as complete as possible , including details of the (serious) adverse eve nt as well as an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the trial medication. The reporting is performed by faxing of a completed ‘SAE Form’ to the KKS Heidelberg . Fax-number: + 49 (0)6221 56 33 687 9.4 Expedited Reporting SUSARs are to be reported to the ethics committee(s), regulatory authorities (BfArM) and to all participating investigators within regulative defined timelines, i.e. they are subject to an expedited reporting. All SAEs are forwarded by e-mail immediately (not later than 24 hours after receipt) by the responsible person at KKS Heidelberg to the coordinating investigator or the scientific coordinator in order to perform a second assessment. The coordinating investigator or the scientific coordinator fills out a ‘Second Assessment Form’ for each SAE and return s it by e-mail to the KKS Heidelberg within 48 hours . E-mail: V-KKS.SAE@med.uni -heidelberg.de The ‘Second Assessment Form’ contain s the following information: I) Assessment of relationship between SAE and IMP II) Assessment of expectedness of SAE (derived from IB which serves as RSI ) III) Statement if the benefit/ risk assessment for the trial did change as a result of SAE , and The expedited reporting is carried out by a responsible person of KKS Heidelberg . Only SUSARs occurring after administration of IMP undergo expedited reporting. 9.5 Emergency Treatment During and following a patient ’s participation in the trial, the investigator should ensure that adequate medical care is provided to a patient for any AE , including clinically significant laboratory values. The investigator should inform a patient when medical care is needed for intercurrent illness(es) of which the investigator becomes aware. 9.6 R eporting Requirements for Pregnancies 9.6.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients Female patients of childbearing potential are instructed to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study. A pregnancy should primarily be reported using an SAE - form. The investigator has to send the SAE -form immediately (i.e. no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy). Fax-number: + 49 (0)6221 56 33 687 The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel t he patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Medical monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any SAEs associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an"

The SAE -form has to be completed by the investigator immediately (i.e. within 24 hours after becoming aware of the pregnancy) and submitted to KKS Heidelberg . Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug. The pregnan t partner need s to sign an authorization for use and disclosure of pregnancy health i nformation to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy. Once the authorization has been signed, the investi gator update s the information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy. An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, to support an informed decision. 10 Statistical Considerations 10.1 Study Design and Research Hypothesis Non-randomized, single -arm, open -label, multicenter phase II trial, designed to gain first evidence of antitumor activity of palbociclib in adult patients with (l ocally) advanced or metastatic chordoma. The primary endpoint is the disease control rate (DCR) after six cycles of palbociclib . Formally, the null hypothesis that the true response rate p is less or equal to a reference rate p0 is tested against a one-sided alternative: H0: p  p0 vs. H 1: p  p1 where p is the true response probability, p0, the (uninteresting) reference response rate, and p1 the (desirable) target level. 10.2 Sample Size Calculation The sample size and power calculation s were based on Simon's optimal two -stage design14, which minimizes the expected sample size under the null hypothesis subject to the error probability constraints . The type I error was set at  = 0.05, the type II error at  = 0.2. Here, t he null hypothesis that the true response rate is less or equal to p0 = 0.1 is tested against a one - sided alternative , where the d esirable level of response is 0.25. The study needs 43 patients evaluable for the primary endpoint to complete. In the first stage, n1 = 18 patients are accrued. If there are r1 = 2 or fewer responses in these 18 patients, the study is stopped and the drug rejected . This occurs with a probability of early termination under H0 of PET(p 0) = 0.73. Otherwise, 25 additional patients are accrued for a total of n = 43 patients . In the final analysis t he null hypothesis is rejected and the drug recommended for further development if 8 or more responses are observed in 43 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of  0.05 and power of  80% when the true response rate is p = 0.25. Impact on Secondary Analyses A sample size of 43 patients is deemed adequate for all secondary /exploratory analyses."

Patients going of f study for other reasons (drop -outs, e. g. lost-to-follow -up, death unrelated to disea se/treatment , retracted IC, etc.) without assessment of the primary outcome are replaced until the goal of 43 is met. Drop -outs The rate of patient drop -out is estimated at 5%. 10.3 Analysis Variables 10.3.1 Primary analysis The primary endpoint is the disease control rate (DCR) after six cycles of palbociclib , which is defined as the presence of at least one confirmed complete response ( CR) or confirmed partial response ( PR) or stable disease ( SD) according to RECIST version 1.1 . 10.3.2 Secondary analyses Tumor response rate (TRR) The TRR is defined as the presence of at least one complete re sponse (CR) or partial re sponse (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1 after six cycles of study medication . Progression -free survival (PFS) PFS is defined as the time from first administration of the IMP to progression of disease or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients without the event are censored on the last date of foll ow-up. [time frame: up to LPLV] Overall survival (OS) OS is defined as the time from first administration of the IMP to time of death from any cause. Patients without the event are censored on the last date of follow -up. [time frame: up to LPLV] 10.3.3 Safety This endpoint includes all AEs, their severity, S AEs, the relation of AEs to the study treatment, dose modifications for toxicity and discontinuation of study treatment during the trial phase. Toxic effects are graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE ) version 5.0. 10.3.4 Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO s) including Health -related quality of life (QoL) o Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are calculated as the new EORTC QLQ -C30 Summary Score recommended by the EORTC Quality of Life Group, which has been recently develo ped and and evaluated .15 In addition, the EORTC QLQ function and symptom scores are calculated according to the actual EORTC Scoring Manual .16 o Fatigue is calculated from the EORTC QLQ -FA12 according to the EORTC Scoring Manual .16 o Sleep problems are calculated from the PSQI according to the corresponding scoring guidelines .17"

Treatment efficacy is evaluated considering the disease control rate (DCR) and best overall response achieved according to RECIST criteria , for which an unbiased estimate and exact 95% CI is computed . Exploratory efficacy analys es may be performed if deemed of clinical relevance. 10.5. 5 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints Tumor response Descriptive statistics and patient data listing are used for the presentation of all response data. Treatment efficacy is evaluated considering the tumor response rate (TRR), for which an unbiased estimate and exact 95% CI is computed. Explorator y efficacy analys es may be performed if deemed of clinical relevance. Survival Analysis Standard methods for right -censored data are used for analyzing PFS and OS. Cox Proportional Hazards Regression is used to examine the influence of covariates on PFS /OS if deemed clinically relevant . Safety Analysis The assessment of safety is based mainly on the frequency of adverse events (see Section 9) and on the number of laboratory values that fall outside of pre -determined ranges and/or show prominent worsening from baseline during the study phase (up to cycle 6 + 4 weeks ). Adverse events are summarized by presenting the number and percentage of patients having any adverse events or serious adverse events, and having each individual adverse event, and by determin ing and summarizing the maximum individual toxicity grade (over all forms of toxicity) for each treatment cycle during the study phase. Furthermore, the most common AEs (those occurring in at least 10% of the treatment group) are determined. Any other inf ormation collected (e.g. severity or relatedness to study drug) is summarized as appropriate. Laboratory data is summarized by presenting shift tables using normal ranges (baseline to most extreme post -baseline value) and by presenting summary statistics o f raw data and change from baseline values (means, medians, standard deviations, ranges).

Summary statistics for baseline values and Follow -up are displayed for QT and QTc B correction methods. 10.5. 6 Handling of Missing Data Missin g values are not replaced or imputed. For patients with incomplete follow -up, time to last follow -up date is used as the censoring time in the analysis of time -to-event data. 10.6 Interim Analyses As defined in section 10.2, one interim analysis of efficacy is performed at the end of the first stage. After accrual of 18 patients, recruitment is interrupted, if necessary, until a decision according to the first stage of Simon's design has been reached. Evaluation take s place after response evaluation of the last patient of the first stage is available. The objective of the interim analysis is to allow the early stopping of the trial in case of an insufficient number of responders ( 2). 10.7 Safety Monitoring Safety monitoring is performed by the IDMC after 18 p atients have finished at least one cycle of the study treatment . Safety assessments consist of evaluating AEs and SAEs . The IDMC provide s the sponsor with recommendations regarding trial modificatio n, continuation or termination. 11 Data Management 11.1 Data Collection As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be understood to refer to an electronic data record. All findings including clinical and laboratory data are documented by the investigator or an authorized member of the study team in the patient 's medical record and in the CRF except the data on PRO . The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all sections of the CRF are completed correctly and entries can be verified by source data. The CRF has to be filled out according to the specified CRF Completion Guidelines. Data collection can only be done by authorized persons. All study data are password -protected. The electronic CRF provides several checks fo r completeness and consistency. Each entry or change of data is tracked with name and exact date. The investigator sign s the CRF electronically as per agreed project process. A copy of the electronic CRF is archived at the study site. PRO questionnaires , which are paper -based, are completed by the patient and serve as source data. Upon completion the questionnaires are sent by the trial site to the NCT trial centre for tracking. Thereafter, they are forwarded to the central unit responsible for Patient -Reported Outcomes. The questionnaires are recorded using the TELEFORM® system (Cardiff) and undergo a compute r assisted manual verification. 11.2 Data Handling Data entries undergo an automatic online check for plausibility and consistency. Further checks for plausibility, consistency, and completeness of data are performed after completion of the study. Queries are generated on the basis of these checks, combined with a visual control by a responsible monitor/data manager. The investigator has to resolve and clarify all queries."
