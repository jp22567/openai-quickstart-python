Eligible subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 mcg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA™dry powder inhaler (DPI) or UMEC (62.5 mcg once daily ) administered via the ELLIPTA DPI or salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily (BID)) administered via the DISKUS™DPI. There will be a total of 5 clinic visits and one follow -up phone call (Visit 6). A pre - screening visit (Visit 0) may be required in order to administer the informed consent before an y changes are made to the subject’s current medication regimen. If no changes in medication are required, V0 (pre -screening) and V1 (screening) may be conducted on the same day .Inhaled long -acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or long-acting beta 2- agonist (LABA) and/or albuterol/salbutamol as needed (rescue medication )are not exclusionary prior to Screening or during the run -in. Eligible subjects at Screening Visit 1 will be current or former smokers, at least 6 weeks ICS and ICS/LABA free with an FEV 1post-albuterol/salbutamol of ≥30% to ≤80% predicted normal and a FEV 1/FVC <0.7 and a CAT score ≥10. 2018N377698_00"
12,page_12,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 13Subjects using inhaled LAMA orLABA medication must withhold thei r morning dose prior to Screening spirometry . Subjects who meet all other eligibility criteria at Screening will enter a run -in period for 4 weeks. During the run -in period ,subjects will continue with their inhaled LAMA orLABA . In addition, subjects wil l be provided with short acting albuterol/salbutamol as needed for relief of COPD sy mptoms (rescue medication) throughout the stud y. Subjects who experience a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run -in period will be deemed run- in failures. Subjects who experience a mild COPD exacerbation, defined as worsening of s ymptoms that requires notreatment with antibiotics or steroids and is self managed b y the patient by an increase of inhaled rescue medication will be able to continue in the study based on the judgment of the investigator and agreement of the sponsor’s medical monitor. At the randomization Visit 2 (Day 1),those subjects who successfull y complete the run- in period ,as well as meet the other pre -defined eligibility and randomization cr iteria ,will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms for 24 weeks. In addition, a subset of subjects (approximately 150 per treatment arm )will undergo assessment of their ph ysical activity measured through a phy sical activit y monitor (Actigraph GT9X) worn for 7 day sfrom Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 day s from Visit 3, and for 7 day s prior to last clinic Visit (Visit 5). The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated throughout the study beginning at Visit 2 (Day 1) and until the follow -up contact (Visit 6). Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected over the same time period as AEs. However, an y SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., study treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, inv asive tests, or change in existing therapy ) or related to a GSK concomitant medication, will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including an y follow up contact. All subjects will be given an electronic diary (eDiary ) for use during the run -in, and the treatment period to complete PRO questionnair es, record COPD daily symptoms and the time they take their COPD medications. Dail y rescue medication usage (number of inhalations taken in the last 24 h) will also b e captured in the eDiary . In addition, and in some countries, rescue medication use will also be captured b y the use of electronic metered dose inhaler (eMDI). At Screening Visit 1, all subjects must be trained on the proper use of their existing COPD medications inhalation devices and instructed to strictly adhere to and record the time they take their COPD medications in the eDiary . At the randomization Visit 2, all subjects must be trained on the proper use of the ELLIPTA and DISKUS inhalation devices a nd instructed to strictly adhere to and record the time they take their study medications in the eDiary . All subjects must be trained on the correct use of the eDiary and instructed to complete the eDiary during the run -in and treatment period. 2018N377698_00"

Type and Number of Subjects Approximately 3232 subjects will be screened, such that 2424 subjects will be randomized and approximately 2181 evaluable subjects complete the study. Analysis The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The null hy pothesis is no difference between treatment groups (H0: μT – μS = 0), with the alternative h ypothesis that there is a difference between treatment groups (H1: μT – μS ≠0), where μ T is the mean change from baseline for UMEC/VI and μS is the mean change from baseline for UMEC. The primary endpoint of mean chang e from baseline in trough FEV 1at the end of Week 24 will be anal ysed using Mixed Models repeated Measures (MMRM) analy sis. The MMRM analy sis will include measurements at Treatment Weeks 4, 12 and 24. Treatment group (a categorical variable) will be fitted as the explanatory variable with appropriate pre-defined variables, stratum (number of bronchodilators per day during run- in) and baseline values, fitted as covariates. Visit (nominal) will be fitted as a categorical variable and visit -by-baseline and visit- by-treatment interaction terms will be included to allow treatment effects to be estimated at each visit separatel y. The variance covariance matrix 2018N377698_00"

The estimated treatment differences between UMEC/VI versus UMEC for each endpoint will be presented with the 95% confidence intervals for the difference and the p -value. 2. INTRODUCTION 2.1. Stud y Rationale Chronic obstructive pu lmonary disease ( COPD) is associated with poor health- related quality of life (HRQoL). Pharmacologic therap y is used to improve lung function, reduce symptoms, frequency and severit y of exacerbations, and improve patients HRQoL [GOL D, 2015]. Umeclidinium/Vilanterol (UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg) is indicated for the maintenance treatment of COPD that contain long- acting muscarinic antagonist (L AMA) and long -acting beta 2-agonist (L ABA) bronchodilators. Umeclidinium (UMEC) is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve s ymptoms in adult patients with COPD . Salmeterol has long been used for s ymptoms management of COPD. However, a direct comparison of these maintenance therapies has not been conducted with respect to HRQoL. The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The ef fect of UMEC/VI , UMEC, and salmeterol with respect to patient HRQoL measured through patient reported outcomes (PROs) questionnaires, sy mptoms and lung function will also be evaluated. 2.2. Brief Background COPD is characterized by an airflow limitation which is not fully reversible, usually progressive and accompanied by a chronic cough, sputum production and dyspnea which can be a major cause of disability and anxiety associated with the disease [ Maleki -Yazdi , 2014] Furthermore, acute exacerbations contribute to the overall severity of disease as thes e episodes are accompanied by worsened s ymptoms and are associated with increased decline in lung function and mortality [Wedzicha , 2013; Schmidt , 2014]. Pharmacologic therap y is used to improve lung function, reduce s ymptoms, reduce the frequency and severit y of exacerbations, and also to improve health status and exercise tolerance. Maintenance treatment is recommended primarily through the use of LABAs or LAMAs. COPD treatment guidelines recommend an incremental approach to pharmacological treatment as the disease state worsens, involving the use of combinations of drug classes with different or complementary mechanisms [ GOL D, 2015]. UMEC/VI inhalation powder is a combination of UMEC (umeclidinium bromide), a LAMA, and VI (Vilanterol), a LABA, delivered via the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler 2018N377698_00"

UMEC (62.5 mcg) inhalation powder is marketed in the United States (US) and Europe under the trade name INCRUSE™ELLIPTA. UMEC (62.5mcg) is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adul t patients with COPD. UMEC (62.5 mcg) improves forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), dyspnea and HRQoL whether used as monotherap y [Trivedi , 2014; Feldman , 2016] or as an add on to fluticasone propionate and vilanterol (FF/VI) [ Siler , 2015]. Salmetrol (50 mcg) DISKUS is a long -acting broncholdilator that has long been used for the maintenance treatment of COPD [ Tashkin, 2010]. Clinically important deterioration (CID) is a novel, exploratory composite endpoint which assesses individual deteriorations in lung function and in patient PROs defined by the accepted minimal clinically important difference (MCID), as well as the incidence of moderate to severe exacerbations [ Singh , 2016], (Section 7.3.5 ). CID will be anal ysed to determine whether UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg) thera py provides greater clinical stability as compared with UMEC and salmeterol monotherapies. 3.

STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This is a multi -centre, randomized, double blind, double -dummy , 3-arm parallel group study . Eligible subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 mcg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA™dry powder inhaler, or UMEC (62.5 mcg once daily ) administered via the ELLIPTA™or salmeterol (50 mcg BID) administered via the DISKUS. There will be a total of 5 clinic visits and one follow -up phone call (Visit 6). A pre - screening visit (Visit 0) may be required in order to administer the informed consent before an y changes are made to the subject’s current medication regime n. If no changes in medication are required, V0 (pre -screening) and V1 (screening) may be conducted on the same day .Inhaled long -acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) orlong-acting beta 2- agonist (LABA) and/or albuterol/salbutamol as needed (rescue medicati on) are not exclusionary prior to Screening or during the run -in. 2018N377698_00"
19,page_19,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 20Eligible subjects at Screening Visit 1 will be current or former smokers, at least 6 weeks ICS and ICS/LABA free with an FEV 1post-albuterol/salbutamol of ≥30% to ≤80% predicted normal and a FEV 1/FVC <0.7 and a CAT score ≥10. Subjects using inhaled LAMA or LABA medication must withhold their morning dose prior to Screening spirometry . Subjects who meet all other eligibility criteria at Screening will enter a run -in period for 4 weeks. During the run -in period ,subjects will continue with their inhaled LAMA orLABA medication . In addition, subjects will be provided with short acting albuterol/salbutamol as needed for relief of COPD sy mptoms (rescue medication) throughout the study . Subjects who experience a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run -in period will be deemed run- in failures. Subjects who experience a mild COPD exacerbation, defined as worsening of s ymptoms that requires notreatment with antibiotics or steroids and i sself managed b y the patient by an increase of inhaled rescue medication , (Appendix 5 ), will be able to continue in the study based on the judgment of the investigator and agreement of the sponsor’s medical monitor. At the randomization Visit 2 (Day 1),those subjects who successfull y complete the run- in period as well as meet the other pre -defined eligibility and randomization criteria will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms for 24 weeks. In addition, a subset of subjects (approximately 150 per treatment arm )will undergo assessment of their ph ysical activity measured through a phy sical activit y monitor (Actigraph GT9X) worn for 7 day sfrom Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 day sfrom Visit 3, and for 7 day s prior to last clinic Visit (Visit 5). The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated throughout the study beginning at Visit 2 (Day 1) and until the follow -up contact (Visit 6). Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected over the same time period as AEs. However, an y SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., study treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK concomitant medication, will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including an y follow up contact ( Appendix 4 ). All subjects will be given an electronic diary (eDiary ) for use during the run -in, and the treatment period to complete PRO questionnaires, record COPD daily symptoms, any medical problems experienced during the stud y and the time they take their COPD medications. Daily rescue medication usage (number of inhalations taken in the last 24h) will also be captured in the eDiary. In addition, and in some countries, rescue medication use will also be captured by the use of electronic metered dose inhaler (eMDI). At Screening Visit 1, all subjects must be trained on the proper use of their existin g COPD medications inhalation devices and instructed to strictly adhere to and record the time they take their COPD medications in the eDiary . 2018N377698_00"

All subjects must be trained on the correct use of the eDiary and instructed to complete the eDiary during the run -in and treatment period. Subjects will be considered to have completed the study upon completion of the follow – up contact b y telephone. There are no plans to routinely provide any of the study treatments for compassionate use following study completion as the study treatment are c ommerciall y available. The study design schematic is illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 1 Study Schematic *Subjects may continue the use of inhaled LAMAs or LABAs and/or study provided albuterol/salbutamol as needed (rescue medication) during the run-in while adhering to the withholding of other COPD medications detailed in the Exclusion Criteria. 4.2. Treatment A rms and Duration Subjects will be stratified based on long- acting bronchodilator usag e during the run -in (none or one long -acting bronchodilator per day ) and randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to either UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg once dail y via ELLIPTA + placebo twice dail y via DISKUS UMEC 62.5 mcg once daily via ELLIPTA + placebo twice dail y via DIS KUS Salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily via DI SKUS + placebo once daily via ELLIPTA 2018N377698_00"
21,page_21,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 22The total duration of subject participation in the study will be approximately 29 to 35 weeks consisting of 6weeks pre -screening if necessary , 4 weeks run- in, 24 week treatment and one week follow -up. 4.3. Type and Number of Subjects Approximately 3232 will be screened globall y in approximately 240sites such that approximately 2424 subjects will be randomized and approximately 2181 evaluable subjects complete the study . 4.4. Design Justification A randomized, double blinded, parallel group study is a standard, well -established design to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of an investigational drug. A salmeterol arm is included to allow a comparison to be made between UMEC/VI , UMEC with sa lmeterol, a standard practice treatment. The double -dumm y design is appropriate when drugs are of different appearance or different administration regimen which is appropriate in this study where the inhalers used have a different appearance and used once daily and twice dail y. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) COPD Guidelines suggest that duration of 12 to 24 weeks is considered adequate for assessment of response of COPD sy mptoms to treatment intervention with bronchodilators ( EMA COPD guidelines, 2012). The primary endpoint is trough FEV 1 at week 24. This endpoint is generally considered to be a robust, well established and an objective means to show the efficacy of a bronchodilator [ Dahl , 2010; Feldman , 2010]. Other endpoints such SAC TDI , E-RS, SGRQ -C, CAT, Subject Global Rating of Change in global impression of disease severity are captured to allow responder analy ses and to provide comparative data on P ROs between the treatment groups. 4.5. Dose Justification This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy of marketed doses of UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg once dail y), UMEC (62.5 mcg once daily ) and salmeterol (50mcg twice daily ) that are approved for the maintenance treatment of COPD, with respect to PRO measures. 4.6. Benefit: Risk A ssessment Summaries of findings from both clinical and non-clinical studies conducted with UMEC/VI and UMEC can be found in the investigator’s brochures (IB) [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2009/00437/07] and [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2006/00835/09] and in the label information sheets. The current safet y profile for UMEC (62.5mcg) and the UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg) based on data available to date, is comparable with other LABAs and LAMAs. Summary safet y data can also be found in the information sheet for salmeterol [ Serevent product information , 2003] .The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol: 2018N377698_00"

Cardiovascular effects such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles.Class effects associated with LABAs and LAMA containing therapy. The clinical significance of these arrhythmias is unknown. Clinical experience with UMEC/VI to date in completed studies did not show any association with major cardiovascular events. Data available in the product label for UMEC/VI Exclusion criteria have been set for subjects with uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease according to the principal investigation’s (PI) opinion where the potential risk may outweigh the benefit. The PI should also determine the clinical significance of abnormal ECG findings at screening and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. Patients with the following abnormalities will be excluded fr om participation: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate >120bpm, sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or second degree heart block Mobitz type II or third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted). Beta agonists and risk of asthma -related death Long -acting beta agonists such as vilanterol when used alone may increase the risk of asthma -related death. A placebo -controlled trial with another LABA (salmeterol) showed an increase in asthma -related death s in subjects receiving salmeterol. This finding with salmeterol is considered a class effect of all LABAs, including vilanterol. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by LABA.Subjects with a cur rent diagnosis of asthma are excluded from participation in the study. Paradoxical bronchospasm As with other inhaled medicines, UMEC/VI can produce paradoxical bronchospasm which may be life threatening.If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosin g with UMEC/VI, this treatment should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy should be instituted. Use in patients with narrow -angle glaucoma or urinary retentionNo association has been found to date, in completed studies with UMEC/VI or UM EC monotherapy, on glaucoma or urinary retention.

Study Procedures Spirometry procedures This may cause difficulty breathing, changes in pulse rate and blood pressure, coughing, wheezing, chest tightness or fainting.Subjects will be monitored during the procedure for these effects and spirometry will be discontinued should these occur. ECG lead placement This may cause skin irritation. It may be necessary to have small patches (about a centimetre in diameter) of hair on the chest shaved to properly attach electrodes to the chest. Blood sampling procedure (optional pharmacogenetic blood sample)Giving blood may make subjects feel faint, or experience mild pain, bruising, irritation or redness at the site. In rare cases, they may get an infectionSubjects will be monitored during the blood draw for these effects and should call their study doctor if any of these effects do not resolve Other Side effects of rescue albuterol/salbutamol.

Benefit A ssessm ent Subjects will receive single or combination of long -acting bronchodilator therapies approved for maintenance treatment of COPD. Participating subjects in this study will contribute to the process of further characterizing the benefit of these long -acting bronchodilators with respect to PROs and sy mptoms in the treatment of COPD. Specific benefits associated with the study design and procedures include the following: Subjects will receive treatments approved for the treatment of COPD that have been show n to be effective in the population under study All subjects will receive albuterol/salbutamol for use “as needed” for relief of COPD sy mptoms The combination of study procedures of spirometry , CAT, SGRQ, TDI, E-RSwill provide the study subjects with a co mprehensive evaluation of their s ymptoms, health status and COPD disease severity . Subjects will also be monitored throughout the stud y for any worsening of COPD symptoms or decline in general health. Finall y smoking cessation counselling will also be pro vided. 4.6.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in this study , the potential risks identified in association with UMEC/VI , UMEC, salmeterol and with study procedures are justified by the anticipated benefits from active treatments that may be afforded to patients with COPD. 5.

Screening/Baseline/Run-in Failures Pre-screen, screen and run -in failures are defined as follows: Pre-screening failures: A subject, who is assigned a subject number at the Pre - screening Visit 0 but does not have an y Screening Visit 1 procedures, will be considered a pre -screen failure. Screening failures: Those subjects that complete at least one Screening Visit 1 procedure but do not enter the run -in period. Run-in failures: Those subjects that enter the run-in period but are not randomized to any of the study treatment arms. Subjects who are pre -screen, screen and run -in failure will be recorded in the eCRF. In order to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects, meet the Consolidated Standa rds of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and respond to queries from Regulatory Authorities, a minimal set of screen failure information is required to be recorded in eCRF including demograph y, screen failure details, eligibility criteria , and serious adverse events (Section 7.4.1 ). 5.5. Withdrawal/Stopping Criteria 5.5.1. Withdrawal from the Study Subjects may be withdrawn from the study at an y time by the Investigator if it is considered to be detrimenta l for them to continue in the study . Reasons for withdrawal from study treatment can include: an AE, clinically significant abnormality, lack of efficacy , sponsor terminated study , pregnancy , or for any other reason. If a subject withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken, and the investigator must document this in the site study records . A reason for the withdrawal from the study must be captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Stopping Criteria A subject mu stbe withdrawn from the stud y, in consultation with the medical monitor and principal investigator, if any of the following stopping criteria are met: Liver Chemistry: Meets any of the Liver chemistry stopping criteria (See Section 5.5.3 ) Note: clinical laboratory assessments are not required for this study . However, laboratory samples may be taken for liver event analy sis, if clinicall y indicated b y the study investigator. Pregnancy: Positive pregnancy test ( see Appendix 7 ) 2018N377698_00"

Subjects who are non- compliant should be re - educated on the requirement for treatment compliance. Every effort will be made to keep subjects in the study and to re -educate those subjects who continue to be non - compliant. Subjects who continue to be non -compliant after m ultiple visit assessments may be permanently discontinued after consultation with the GSK clinical team. Non-Compliance with eDiar y: Subjects must be compliant in completing their eDiary betwee n each pair of on-treatment visits. Subjects who are non- compliant should be re -educated on the requirement for dail y diary entry compliance . Subjects who continue to be non -compliant after multiple visit assessments may be permanentl y discontinued after consultation with the GSK clinical team. Subjects withdrawn from study treatment will not be replaced. The following actions must be taken in relation to a subject who fails to attend the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the subject and re- schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site must counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study . In cases where the subject is deemed ‘lost to follow up’, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and if necessary a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical record. Should the subject continue to be unreachable, only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost t o Follow -up”. 5.5.2. Reason for Study Withdrawal The primary reason for study withdrawal will be recorded in the eCRF. When a subject withdraws consent, the investigator must document the reason (if specified by the subject) in the eCRF. The primary reason for study withdrawal may include: Adverse event 2018N377698_00"

37,page_37,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 38II device) and EU CE mark eting (Class I device). Description of the eMDI and its use will be provided in the SRM . 6.3. Treatment A ssignment Subjects who meet the randomization criteria will be assigned to one of the 3 study treatments in accordance with the randomization schedule generated by Clinical Statistics, prior to the start of the study , using validated internal software. Once a randomization number is assigned to a subject, it cannot be reassig ned to any other subject in the study. This study will utilize RAMOS NG, which will provide a means for central allocation of drug. Each investigator will be supplied with sufficient supplies to conduct the trial. Additional treatment packs will be suppli ed as needed to the sites. Details of how to use the RAMOS NG to randomize subjects is provided in the SRM. The duration of treatment for each subject is 24 weeks. On the morning of each clinic study visit, subjects will refrain from taking their morning dose of study treatment until instructed to do so by clinic personnel. On the other day s during the treatment period (i.e. “non- clinic day s”), s ubjects will be instructed to self -administer their study treatment in the morning and evening . Subjects should enter the time they take their study treatment in the eDiary . Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the blinded study treatment regimens in equal proportion (ratio of 1:1:1): UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg once dail y via ELLIPTA + placebo twice dail y via DISKUS UMEC 62.5 mcg once daily via ELLIPTA + placebo twice dail y via DISKUS Salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily via DI SKUS + placebo once daily via ELLIPTA The randomisation will be stratified based on long-acting bronchodilator usage during the run- in (none or one long-acting bronchodilator per day ). Study treatment/investigational product will be dispensed at Visits 2, 3 and 4. In order to ensure subjects have sufficient doses of study treatment, they must return to clinic within 30 day s from V2 and 60 day s from V3 respectively (see Time and event table Section 7.1). Used study drug and rescue medication will be collected at Visits 3, 4 and 5 or at the Early Withdrawal Visit. 6.4. Planned Dose A djustments No dose adjust ment is allowed for this study 2018N377698_00"
38,page_38,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 396.5. Blinding This will be a double- blind double dummy study and the following will apply . The investigator or treating ph ysician may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency OR in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge of the stud y treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject as judged b y the investigator. Investigators have direct access to the subject’s individual study treatment. Itis preferred (but not required) that the investigator first contacts the Medical Monitor or appropriate GSK study personnel to discuss options before unblinding the subject’s treatment assignment. If GSK personnel are not contacted before the unblinding, the investigator must notify GSK as soon as possible after unblinding, but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded subject, unless that information is important for the safety of subjects currently in the study . The date and reason fo r the unblinding must be fully documented in the eCRF A subject will be withdrawn if the subject’s treatment code is unblinded b y the investigator or treating phy sician. GSK’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treat ment assignment for any subject with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a cop y of the report, identifying the subject’s treatment assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordanc e with local regulations and/or GSK policy . 6.6. Packaging and Labeling The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. 6.7. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability No special preparation of the study treatment is req uired. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study treatment. Only subjects enroll ed in the study may receive study treatment and onl y authorized site staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure environmentally controlled and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study treatment accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e. receipt, reconciliation and final disposition records). 2018N377698_00"
39,page_39,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 40Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the SRM. All ELLIPTA DPI study treatment should be stored up to 25 C (77 F). Each ELLIPTA DPI contains 30 doses and is packaged in a foil pouch with a desiccant sachet and stored in a carton. The inhaler should not be used for more than 30 day s after opening the foil. The sites must maintain a daily temperature log for the investigational product. Salmeterol DI SKUS should be stored up to 25 C. Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study treatment is not expected to pose significant safety risks to site staff . Take adequate precautions to avoid direct ey e or skin contact and the generation of aerosols or mists. In the case of unintentional occupational exposure notify the monitor, Medical Monitor and/or GSK study contact. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational hazard s and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the investigator, where this is required by local laws, or is available upon request from GSK. 6.7.1. Study Treatment Return All used and unused ELLIPTA and DISKUS inhalers and albuterol/salbutamol will be returned to GSK at the end of the study to be available for disposal. In some instances for sites outside the US, study supplies will be disposed of locall y either b y the site, the country medical department or third -party vendor. Detailed instr uctions for the return of the study drug can be found in the SRM. Study treatment will be collected at Visit 3, 4 and 5 or at the Earl y Withdrawal Visit, if applicable. For an y ELLIPTA or DISKUS inhaler that fails to function properl y, the subject should return to the clinic as soon as possible to obtain a new inhaler. The site will contact the RAMOS NG to obtain a new treatment pack number for the subject and dispense a new study treatment kit from the site’s investigational product supply as instructed by the RAMOS NG In addition, any ELLIPTA that fails to function properly must be identified and returned to GSK for testing. 6.8. Compliance with Study Treatment A dministration When subjects self- administer study treatment(s) at home , compliance with study treatment(s) will be assessed through query ing the subject during the site visits and through stud y drug compliance assessed at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 documented in the source documents and eCRF. A record of the number of ELLIPTA and DISKUS dispensed and the number of doses inhaled by each subject must be maintained and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates, including dates for treatment delay s if any will also be recorded in the eCRF. 2018N377698_00"
40,page_40,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 41Compliance with the ELLIPT A inhaler will be determined by reviewing the dose counter on the ELLIPTA. Compliance with the study DISKUS will be determined by reviewing the dose counter on the DISKUS. Subjects should be ≥80% to ≤120% compliant on taking stud y medication between each pair of on -treatment visits. Subjects who fall outside this range should be re -educated on treatment compliance b y their site. This re - education should be documented in the subject’s source document. If medication compliance repeatedly falls outside of acceptable ranges, the stud y sponsor/site monitor must be contacted to discuss subject eligibility for continued participation in the study . 6.9. Treatment of Study Treatment Overdose An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total doses described in Se ction 6.1and Section 6.8which results in clinical signs and s ymptoms. These should be recorded b y the investigator on the AE/SAE pages. In the event of an overdos e of study medication, the investigator should use clinical judgment in treating the overdose and contact the study Medical Monitor. GSK is not recommending specific treatment guidelines for overdose and toxicity management. The investigator is advised t o refer to the relevant document(s) for detailed information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse events, and other significant data pertaining to the stud y drug being used in this study . Such documents may include, but may not be li mited to, the approved product label for salmeterol albuterol, UMEC and UMEC/VI or equivalent document provided by GSK. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject. 6.10. Treatment after the End of the Study Subjects will not receive any additional treatment from GSK after completion of the study , since the stud y treatments are commercially available. The investigator is responsibl e for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the subject’s medical condition, post -study treatment. 6.11. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapies All COPD medications used within 30 day s prior to Pre -Screening (Visit 0) and onwards should be recorded in the eCRF including an y changes in medications. Beginning at Visit 1 and throughout the rest of the stud y, all medications should be recorded in the eCRF including an y changes. Stud y provided albuterol/salbutamol and double -blinded study drug should notbe recorded in the eCRF. The minimum requirement includes but is not limited to drug name, dose, route and the dates of administration. Medications initiated after completion of Visit 5 or the Earl y Withdrawal Visit will not be recorded in the eCRF, with the exception of those used to treat a COPD exacerbation or SAE that occurs between Visit 5 (or the Early Withdrawal Visit) and the follow -up contact at Visit 6. 2018N377698_00"

Pre-screening Visit During the Pre -screening Visit, the study designated personnel must provide informed consent to the study participant. Subjects can perform the Pre- screening Visit (Visit 0) up to 6weeks prior to or on the same day as the Screening Visit (Visit 1) if subject does not take or has not taken any protocol excluded medications. Modification of the subject’s medicati ons prior to study participation is based on the physician’s judgment according to sound medical practice, principles, and each subject’s needs. A subject’s treatment must not be changed merel y for the purpose of enabling the subject’s participation in th e study . A subject number will be assigned at the time the informed consent form (ICF) is signed. No study related procedures may be performed until the informed consent form document has been signed by the subject. Once the informed consent is signed a nd if required, changes can be made to the subject’s current medication regimen. The investigator should exercise clinical judgment, and is discouraged from changing medications only for the purpose of the clinical study . During the pre -screening Visit 0 , the following information is collected: Demographic parameters: y ear of birth, gender, race and ethnicity Concomitant medications review COPD exacerbation assessment From the pre -screening visit onwards concomitant medications, exacerbations and SAEs (considered as related to study participation) must be reported 7.2.2. Critical procedures performed at Screening (Visit 1) The following critical assessments will be conducted at Visit 1: Cardiovascular medical history /risk factors (as detailed in the eCRF) will be assessed at screening Medical history including COPD (including date of diagnosis and COPD ty pe (emphy sema and/or chronic bronchitis), smoking history , COPD exacerbation history , smoking status and previous and/or current medical conditions) Concomitant medication review (COPD and non COPD medications in the 3 months prior to Screening). Height and weight 12-Lead ECG.

Efficacy Assessments 7.3.1. HRQoL assessments: Completion of PRO questionnaires in the Electronic Diary All subjects will be completing PRO questionnaires in the eDiary . It is requested that questionnaires are completed before an y procedures are performed on the subject. All questionnaires will be completed using the eDiary at clinic and at home. Adequate time should be allowed to complete all items of the questionnaires and the questionnaires must be reviewed b y the investigator or designated study staff for completeness and, if necessary , the subject must be encouraged to complete any missing items. Where more than one questionnaire is to be completed at a visit the order should be as follows: 1.Baseline d yspnea index (Visit 2) then Transient dy spnea index at subsequent visits 2.Patient global rating of COPD severit y and global rating of change in COPD 3.St George’s respiratory questionnaire 4. COPD Assessment Test Instructions for completing the questionnaires can be found in the SRM. 7.3.1.1. Self A dministered Computerised Baseline Dy spnea Index/Transitional Dyspnea Index (SA C BDI/TDI) The BD I is used to measure the severity of d yspnea in patients at baseline. The TDI measures changes in the patient’s dyspnea from baseline. The self -administered computerized version of the BDI/TDI (SAC BDI/TDI)[ Mahler , 2004] is used to measure severit y of d yspnea in patients at baseline (SAC BDI) on Day 1 (Visit 2) of treatment and change from the baseline (SAC TDI) at Week 4, 12 and 24 (Visits 3, 4 and 5). The 2018N377698_00"
49,page_49,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 50scores in both indexes depend on ratings for three different categories: functional impairment; magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. SAC BDI/TDI should be completed before performing spirometry . The SAC BDI/TDI was developed to address issues of pot ential bias in the interviewer administered (original) BDI /TDI [ Mahler , 1984]. The SAC BDI/TDI provides a standardized approach to the measurement of d yspnea, equivalent to the original BDI/TDI with advantages over t he interviewer method for grading d yspnea in patients with COPD by standardizing the process for each patient and eliminating individual judgment required b y the interviewers when completing the original BDI/TDI. This also removes the need for the same investigator to conduct all interviews with a subject based on the patient’s responses. SAC TDI provides a continuous measure of change in dy spnea using a visual analogue scale to record responses. Details for the completion of the SAC BDI/TDI are provided i n the SRM. 7.3.1.2. SGRQ -C The St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease specific (SGRQ -C) will be completed by subjects at Randomisation (V2, Day 1), at Week 4, 12 and 24. The SGRQ- C [Meguro , 2007] is a well established, disease -specific questionnaire. It was designed to measure the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on a COPD patient’s HRQoL. As well as producing an overall summary score, scores for the individual domains of sympt oms, activity and impacts are also produced. It has been used in studies of COPD subjects and has been translated and validated for use in most major languages. The SGRQ-C is derived from the original SGRQ, and produces scores equivalent to the SGRQ inst rument [ Meguro , 2007]. 7.3.1.3. COPD A ssessment Test (CA T) The COPD Assessment Test [ Jones, 2009, Jones, 2012] is a validated, short and simple patient completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD. The CAT is an 8- item questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients diagnosed with COPD. When completing the questionnaire, subjects rate their experience on a 6 -point scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment) with a scoring range of 0 -40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. The CAT will be completed in the eDiary by subjects at S creening Visit 1 and Randomisation Visit 2 to assess their eligibility to enter the stud y. CAT is also completed at Weeks 4, 12 and 24 . Additional instructions for completion of the CAT are provided in the SRM. 2018N377698_00"
50,page_50,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 517.3.1.4. EXACT and the Evaluating Respiratory Sympto ms-COPD (E -RS: COPD) EXACT -PRO is a 14 item patient reported outcome instrument designed to capture information on the occurrence, frequency , severity , and duration of exacerbations of disease in patients with COPD [ Leidy, 2011]. EXACT captures information on the severit y of the respiratory and s ystemic manifestations of a COPD exacerbation as reported b y the patient. The instrument is to be completed daily (typically 2 hrs before bedtime) using the electronic diary . The daily recording of information allows an assessment of the underlying day to day variability of a patient's s ymptoms and facilitates the detection of s ymptom worsening indicative of a COPD exacerbation. The total score for EXACT ranges from 0 -100. The entire instrument is intended to be completed in about 3 minutes or less (typically the time required for completion decreases as the patient becomes more familiar with the tool and the electronic diary ). The E- RS: COPD consists of 11 items from the 14 item EXACT instrument [ Leidy, 2014]. E -RS: COPD is intended to capture information related to the respiratory symptoms of COPD, i.e. breathlessness, cough, sputum production, chest congestion and chest tightness. Th e E-RS: COPD has a scoring range of 0 -40 higher scores indicate more severe s ymptoms. Three subscales of the E -RS are used to describe different s ymptoms; dy spnea, cough and sputum and chest sy mptoms. The EXACT questionnaire will be completed b y subjects i n the eDiary , at home every night throughout the entire study , starting from Screening V1 7.3.1.5. Subject Global Rating of COPD Severity and Global Rating of Change in COPD Subjects will complete the Global Rating of COPD Severit y at Randomization Visit 2 and vis its 3, 4 and 5. This single global question will ask subjects to rate their severit y of COPD on a four point scale (mild, moderate, severe, and very severe). This question should be used immediately before the patient completes other visit specific quest ionnaires but after completion of SAC TDI questionnaire. Subjects will also complete a Global Rating of Change in COPD (overall disease) question at Visits 3, 4 and 5. Response options will be on a 7 point L ikert scale ranging from much better to much wo rse. Completing the question at each Visit allows for earl y detection of response as well as continued response. 7.3.2. Spirometry Spirometry measurements will be obtained using spirometry equipment that meets or exceeds the minimal performance recommendations o f the ATS [ Miller , 2005]. All sites will use standardized spirometry equipment provided by an external vendor. All subjects will have spirometry performed at Screening to assess eligibility (see Section 7.2.2.1 ) and at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 during the treatment period. 2018N377698_00"
51,page_51,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 52For FEV 1and FVC determinations, at least 3 acceptable spirometry efforts (with no more than 8) should be obtained. Acceptable spirometry efforts should have a satisfactory start of test and end of test (i.e. a plateau in the volume time curve) and be free from artifacts due to cough, early termination, poor effort, obstructed mouthpiece, equipment malfunction, or other reasons [ Miller , 2005]. The largest FEV 1and FVC from the 3 acceptable efforts should be recorded, even if they do not come from the same effort. Spirometry for FEV 1and FVC assessments that is not obtained as follows will be considered a protocol deviation: Started between 6:00AM and 11:00AM. After withholding albuterol/salbutamol (all visits) for ≥4 hours At Screening Visit 1, after wash out of medications as specified in the exclusion criteria in Section 5.2(Con comitant Medications). At Screening Visit 1, before subject’s morning dose of inhaled LABA or LAMA COPD medication At Visit 2 after withholding the morning dose of inhaled LABA or LAMA COPD medication and prior to administration of study medication At Vis it 3, 4 and 5 after withholding the morning dose of study treatment. Pre dose assessment performed prior to dosing. Subjects should refrain from smoking for 1 hour prior to each pulmonary function test. Trough FEV 1measurements for UME C/VI or UMEC on Weeks 4, 12 and 24 (Visits 3, 4 and 5) should be performed 23 hours and 24 hours after the previous day ’s dose of study medication recorded in the eDiary . This will also provide trough FEV 1measurements for the evening dose of salmeterol. 7.3.3. Inspiratory capacity (IC) Inspiratory capacit y (IC) is the volume of gas that can be taken into the lungs in a normal and full inhalation. Starting from the resting inspiratory position it is equal to the tidal volume plus the inspiratory reserve volume. IC has been widel y used to assess static and dynamic h yperinflation in patients with COPD. ICwill be measured b y spirometry prior to forced manoeuvres pre -dose at Visits 2 (30 and 5 min prior to dosing) and at trough at Visits 3, 4, and 5 (23 and 24 hrs post dosing on the pre vious day ). For I C determination the average of at least three acceptable manoeuvres should be recorded. Subjects should be tested while sitting, relaxed and wearing a nose clip. They should be asked to breathe regularl y for several breaths until the end- expiratory lung volume is stable (this usually requires at least three tidal manoeuvres) then urged to take a deep breath to Total L ung Capacit y (TLC) with no hesitation. 2018N377698_00"
52,page_52,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 53Spirometry for IC determination done in conjunction with FEV 1and FVC assessments that is not obtained as follows will be considered a protocol deviation: Started between 6:00AM and 11:00AM. After withholding albuterol/salbutamol (all visits) ≥4 hours At Visit 2 after discontinuation of run -in LABA or LAMA COPD medication and prior to administration of study medication At Visit 3, 4 and 5 after withholding the morning dose of study drug 7.3.4. COPD E xacerbation A mild exacerbation is defined as worsening of symptoms that require no treatment with antibiotics or steroids, and is self managed b y the patient by an increase of inhaled rescue medications. A moderate COPD exacerbation is defined as worsenin g symptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. A severe exacerbation is defined as worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require in- patient hospitalization or emergency room for longer than 24 hrs. If a subject experiences a mild, moderate or severe COPD exacerbation, the COPD exacerbation page of the eCRF should be completed. COPD exacerbations should not be recorded as an AE, unless they meet the definition of a SAE. Details of COPD exacerbation identification, categorization and treatment guidelines are described in Appendix 5 . Subjects who experience a mild exacerbation during the run- in period will not be withdrawn from the study. However, s ubjects who experience moderate or severe exacerbation during the run -in period will be withdrawn from the study and will not be allowed to be re -screened. Subjects, who experience a mild, moderate or severe exacerbation during the treatment period, will notbe withdrawn from the study unless the investigator or GSK medical monitor thinks it is best for the patient to withdraw from the stud y. Signs and s ymptoms of COPD included on the electronic diary cards will not be considered AEs and will not be recorded in the eCRF. The time period for collection of COPD exacerbations will be from the Pre -Screening (Visit 0) until completion of the follow -up contact. If a subject experiences a COPD exacerbation from the time the I CF is signed until randomization, summary information (yes/no status question) will be collected in the eCRF. COPD exacerbations after randomization through follow -up will be recorded on the COPD exacerbation page of the eCRF. 7.3.5. Clinically important deterioration (CID) Clinically important deterioration (CID) is a composite e ndpoint defined as: 2018N377698_00"

Rescue albuter ol/salbutamol use Subjects will record the number of dail y albuterol/salbutemol puffs they use in the eDiary . In addition, in some countries and selected sites the number of puffs will be collected through the eMDI device (Section 6.2) 7.3.7. Physical activity monitor (study subset) Physical activity limitation is a common feature of COPD and its measures are highl y related to the degree of disease seve rity [Watz , 2009]. Reduced ph ysical activity levels in COPD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality , sustained disability , depression, and social and phy sical isolation [ Shu-Yi, 2014; Gimeno, 2014] Improved activity has been identified as an important factor that may modify morbidity and mortality in COPD [ Moy , 2012 ]. The Actigraph GT9X phy sical activity monitor will be used to measure levels of activity . The activity monitor will be worn by up to approximately 150 subjects per treatment arm for 7 day s from Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 day s from Visit 3 (Week 4) and for 7 day s prior to Week 24 (Visit 5). There will be 4 assessment periods, including a screening assessment in order to provide a reliable estimate of habitual phy sical activity . Each subject will be given an activity monitor and instruction leaflet at the start of each assessment period. Further details of distribution, operation and retrieval of the monitors will be provided in the SRM . 7.4. Safet y Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1) Safety endpoint includes: Incidence of adverse events 7.4.1.

Time period and Frequency for collecting A E and SA E information Any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow -up contact. AEs will be collected from th e start of Study Treatment until the follow -up contact (see Section 7.4.1.3 ), at the timepoints specified in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). Medical occurren ces that begin prior to the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent may be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to GSK within 24 hours, as indicated in (Appendix 4 , Section 12.4.6 ) Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify GSK. NOTE: The method of recording, evaluating a nd assessing causality of AEs and SAEs plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to GSK are provided in (Appendix 4 , Section 12.4.4 to Section 12.4.6 ) 7.4.1.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occu rrence. Appropriate questions include: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact  “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since y our last visit/contact? 7.4.1.3. Follo w-up of AEs and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non -serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 4.6.1 ) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 5.5). 2018N377698_00"

Pneumonia Events Investigators will be required to fill out a pneumonia event specific eCRF within one week of when the pneumonia AE/SAE(s) is first reported. 7.4.1.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in (Section 12.4.3) and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac d eath) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 7.4.1.6. Disease- Relat ed Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es The following disease related events (DREs) are common in subjects with COPD and can be serious/life threatening: COPD exacerbation COPD exacerbations are associated with the disease to be st udied and will not be recorded as AEs unless the exacerbation meets the definition of a ‘serious’ AE. Exacerbations that meet the definition of ‘serious’ AEs will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF section and should be reported to GSK for all subjects re gardless of whether or not they are randomized to study medication. Signs and s ymptoms of COPD included on the electronic diary will not be considered AEs and will not be recorded in the eCRF 7.4.1.7. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification b y the investigator to GSK of SAEs related to study treatment (even for non -interventional post -marketing studies) is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of subjects and the safety of a product under clinical investigation are met. GSK has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authorit y and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. GSK will comply with country specific regulatory requirements r elating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authorit y, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and investigators. 2018N377698_00"
56,page_56,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 57Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local r egulatory requirements and GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with the IB and will notify the I RB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 7.4.1.8. Additional A dverse Event (AE) Reporting Requirements for Canadian investigators Health Canada requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to expeditiously report domesti c cases of unusual failure in efficacy (UFIE) for new drugs to the Marketed Health Products Directorate (MHPD) within 15 day s of first notification. This regulation applies to marketed drugs, and used as directed per the Canadian prescribing information, including those drugs used in Phase IV (non CTA filed) clinical trials. Adverse event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) symptom or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a Medicinal Product. For a marke ted Medicinal Product, this can also include failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy, with or without an adverse event), In order for GSK to comply this Canadian regulatory requirement, Canadian investigators are required to collect, r ecord and report lack of efficacy events as per the table in Appendix 4 Section 12.4.1 . All paper forms are required to be faxed to GSK Canada’s Drug Safety department at within 24 hrs of first awareness. 7.4.2. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female subjects will be collected after the start of Screening and until the follow -up contact. If a pregnancy is reported then the investigator should inform GSK within 2 weeks of l earning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 7 . 7.4.3.

Hypotheses The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjec ts treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The null hy pothesis is no difference between treatment groups (H0: μT – μS = 0), with the alternative h ypothesis that there is a difference between treatment groups (H1: μT – μS ≠0), where μT is the mean change from baseline for UMEC/VI and μS is the mean change from baseline for UMEC. 2018N377698_00"
58,page_58,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 599.2. Sample Size Considerations The pr imary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. As an important aim of the study is to compare UMEC/VI, UMEC and salmeterol with respect to HRQoL the sample size has been calculated to provide sufficient power for the comparison of the pr imary and secondary endpoint TDI , at Week 24. The sample size calculations use a two -sided 5% significance level and an estimate of between subject standard deviation for TDI of 2.94 units. The estimate of SD is based on DB2113373 [ Donohue , 2013], a study which consisted of treatment arms of UMEC/VI 62.5/25, UMEC 62.5 VI (Vilanterol) 25mcg and placebo and is the value at Day 168 in a subgroup of subjects who were ICS free at screening. Based on these data, 727 eva luable subjects per treatment arm will be required to provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference if the true difference is 0.5 units, ½ the MCI D, between UMEC/VI and UMEC. The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statis tically significant difference between treatment groups is 0.31 units. With this number of evaluable subjects per arm, the study will have >99% power assuming a true treatment difference of 80mL between UMEC/VI and UMEC for trough FEV1 at 24 weeks at the two-sided 5% significance level. This calculation uses a SD for trough FEV1 of 240mL, based on prior results for trials comparing dual bronchodilators versus single bronchodilators ( Donohue , 2013; Bateman , 2013). The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statistically significant difference between treatment groups is 25mL . In order to account a for a 10% withdrawal rate , approximately 808 subjects per treatment arm will be randomised. 9.2.1. Sample Size Sensitivity The assumption of a SD of 2.94 units for the TDI total score is based on estimates from previous studies. The following table presents the power achieved with the proposed sample size of 727 randomised subjects per arm, should the assumption around the SD of the data change. The actual assumptions used in the sample size calculation are shaded.

Interim A nalysis No interim an alysis is planned for the stud y. 9.4. Key Elements of A nalysis Plan Treatment Comparisons The primary treatment comparison of UMEC/VI with UMEC will be performed on the ITT population. 2018N377698_00"
60,page_60,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 61The other treatment comparisons of UMEC/VI and UMEC with Salmeterol will be performed on the ITT population and ITT ICS free population. 9.4.1. Primary Analyses The treatment comparison of primary interest will be UMEC/VI versus UMEC for the primary endpoint of change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The primary analyses will be performed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) anal ysis and will be based on a two -sided hy pothesis testing approach on the ITT Population. In order to account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and endpoints, a step - down closed testing procedure will be applied whereby inference for secondary and other endpoints or treatment comparisons are dependent upon statistical significance having been achieved for the primary comparison. If the primary comparison is significant i.e. the associate d p-value for UMEC/VI versus UMEC for change from baseline in trough FEV1 at Week 24 is below 0.05, this will allow inference of treatment comparisons (UMEC/VI versus UMEC on all other endpoints, and UMEC/VI versus Salmeterol and UMEC versus Salmeterol on all endpoints including the primary endpoint), which will be declared statistically significant if the associated p -value is below 0.05. There will be 2 anal yses one for one for the German Federal Joint Committee (G -BA) and one for the rest of the world (ROW). The step-down closed testing procedure onl y applies to the ROW. For the G -BA statistical inference for secondary and other endpoints or treatment comparisons will not be conditional on achieving statistical significance of the primary comparison. The primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 at the end of Week 24 and secondary endpoint change from baseline in TDI score at Week 24 will both be analysed using MMRM analy sis. The MMRM analy sis for change from baseline in trough FEV1 and TDI will include measurements at Treatment Weeks 4, 12 and 24. Treatment group (a categorical variable) will be fitted as the explanatory variable with appropriate pre -defined variables, stratum (number of bronchodilators per day during run-in) and ba seline values, fitted as covariates. Visit (nominal) will be fitted as a categorical variable and visit- by-baseline and visit -by-treatment interaction terms will be included to allow treatment effects to be estimated at each visit separatel y. The variance covariance matrix will be assumed to be unstructured (based on previous experience no issues are expected with fitting models with this matrix structure). While missing data are not explicitly imputed in the primary MMRM analyses, there is an underl ying assumption that the data are missing at random. The estimated treatment differences between UMEC/VI versus UMEC for each endpoint will be presented with the 95% confidence intervals for the difference and the p -value. Full details of the analy ses to be pe rformed on all primary endpoints will be given in the RAP. 2018N377698_00"
61,page_61,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 629.4.2. Other A nalyses The MMRM anal ysis will be repeated for the ITT ICS free population. Estimated differences between UMEC/VI or UMEC and Salmeterol will be presented together with 95% confidence interv als (CI s) for the difference and p- values. Secondary and other efficacy endpoints and treatment comparisons will be adjusted for multiplicity as per Section 9.4.1 . Full details of the analy ses to be performed on the other efficacy endpoints will be given in the RAP. Safety Analyses Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the standard GSK dictionary , Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and grouped by body system. The number and percentage of s ubjects experiencing at least one AE of an y type, AEs within each bod y system and AEs within each preferred term will be presented for each treatment group. Separate summaries will be provided for all AEs, drug related AEs, fatal AEs, non- fatal SAEs, AESI sand AEs leading to withdrawal. Deaths and SAEs will be documented in case narrative format. Full details of the analy ses to be performed on all safet y endpoints will be given in the RAP. 10. STUDY GOVERNANCE CON SIDERATIONS 10.1.

Appendix 3: Genetic Research Genetics –Background Naturall y occurring genetic variation may contribute to inter -individual variability in response to medicines, as well as an individual's risk of developing specific diseases. Genetic factors associated with disease characteristics may also be associated with response to therap y, and could help to explain some clinical study outcomes. For example, genetic variants associated with age- related macular degeneration (AMD) are reported to account for much of the risk for the condition [ Gorin , 2012] with certain variants reported to in fluence treatment response [ Chen, 2012]. Thus, knowledge of the genetic etiology of disease may better inform understanding of disease and the development of medicines. Additionally , genetic variability may impact the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination), or pharmacod ynamics (relationship between concentration and pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) of a specific medicine and/or clinical outcomes (efficac y and/or safet y) observed in a clinical study. Genetic Research Objectives and A nalyses The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate the relationship between genetic variants and: Response to medicine, including an y concomitant medicines; COP D susceptibility , severity , and progression of related conditions Genetic data may be generated while the study is underway or following completion of the study . Genetic evaluations may include focused candidate gene approaches and/or examination of a la rge number of genetic variants throughout the genome (whole genome analyses). Genetic anal yses will utilize data collected in the study and will be limited to understanding the objectives highlighted above. Analy ses may be performed using data from multip le clinical studies to investigate these research objectives. Planned anal yses and results of genetic investigations will be reported either as part of the clinical RAP and study report, or in a separate genetics RAP and report, as appropriate. Study Popul ation Any subject who is enrolled in the study can participate in genetic research. Any subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from the genetic research. Study Assessments and Procedures A key component of successful genetic research is the collection of samples during clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori hypothesis has been identified, may enable future genetic anal yses to be conducted to help understand variability in disease and medicine response. 2018N377698_00"
73,page_73,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 74A 6 ml blood sample will be taken for Deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. A blood sample is collected at the baseline visit, after the subject has been randomized and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collecti on and shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory manual. The DNA from the blood sample may undergo quality control analy ses to confirm the integrit y of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality of the sample, then the sam ple may be destroy ed. The blood sample is taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to an inabilit y to utilize the original sample. The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same stud y specific number used to label o ther samples and data in the study . This number can be traced or linked back to the subject by the investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or social security number). Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 y ears after the last subject completes the study , or GSK may destroy the samples sooner. GSK or those working with GSK (for example, other researchers) will only use samples collected from the study for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form. Samples may be used as part of the development of a companion diagnostic to support the GSK medicinal product. Subjects can request their sample to be destro yed at any time. Informed Consent Subjects who do not w ish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study . Genetic informed consent must be obtained prior to any blood being taken. Subject Withdrawal from Study If a subject who has consented to participate in genetic research withdr aws from the clinical study for any reason other than being lost to follow -up, the subject will be given a choice of one of the following options concerning the genetic sample, if already collected: Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA sample is retained Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy the genetic DNA sample If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for an y reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within the timeframe specified b y GSK and maintain the documentation in the site study records . Genoty pe data may be generated during the study or after completion of the study and may be anal yzed during the study or stored for future anal ysis. 2018N377698_00"
74,page_74,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 75If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research and genot ype data has not been analyzed, it will not be analy zed or used for future research. Genetic data that has been anal yzed at the time of withdr awn consent will continue to be stored and used, as appropriate. Screen and Baseline Failures If a sample for genetic research has been collected and it is determined that the subject does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the study , then t he investigator should instruct the subject that their genetic sample will be destro yed. No forms are required to complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample reconciliation process. In this instance a sample destruction form will not be available to include in the site files. Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality of Subject’s Genetic Data GSK may summarize the genetic research results in the clinical study report, or separately and may publish the results in sci entific journals. GSK may share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific understanding in alignment with the informed consent. GSK does not inform the subject, family members, insurers, or employ ers of individual genoty ping result s that are not known to be relevant to the subject’s medical care at the time of the study , unless required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic studies is generally preliminary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific validity of the results are undetermined. Further, data generated in a research laboratory may not meet regulatory requirements for inclusion in clinical care. 2018N377698_00"

Definition of A dverse Events Adverse Event Definition: An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Reporting Specific to Canada : For a marketed m edicinal product, this can also include failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy , with or without associated signs or s ymptoms or clinical sequelae) . NOTE: An AE can therefore be an yunfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Events meeting AE definition include: Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment a dministration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a conco mitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae). Excluding Canada, ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Reporting Specific t o Canada: ""Lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" will be reported as an AE or SAE as per the table below 2018N377698_00"

Definition of Serious A dverse Events If an event is not an AE per definition above, th en it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease, etc). Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at an y dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening NOTE: 2018N377698_00"
77,page_77,"2016N277425_03 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 78The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hypothetically migh t have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills anyother serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseli ne is not considered an AE. d.Results in disability/incapacity NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medica l significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospit alization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancer s, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse g.

Evaluating AEs and SA Es Assessment of Intensity The inves tigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and will assign it to one of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with e veryday activities. Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal every day activities Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. -an AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severit y is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre -defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE. Assessment o f Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rath er than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underly ing diseases, concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relatio nship of the event to the study treatment will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial rep ort to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 2018N377698_00"

COPD Exacerbation Severity Each COPD exacerbation will be categorized based on severit y as follows: Moderate : Worsening sy mptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. Severe : Worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require treatment with in -patient hospitalization or 24 hrs in the emergency room. Chest X -Ray for pneumonia and/or moderate/severe exacerbation is not mandated but can be performed if required b y the investigator as part of standard care of subjects. Details of an exacerbation should be recorded in the exacerbation page of the eCRF. However, exacerbations should not be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF unless they meet the definition of an SAE. (Pneumonia must be recorded in the AE or SAE section of the eCRF and on the Pneumonia page of the eCRF.) Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections will not be considered a COPD exacerbation unless the subject experiences worsening s ymptoms of COPD which match the definition of an exacerbation as given above. 12.5.3. Treatment of COPD Exacerbations All medications used for the tr eatment of exacerbations must be recorded in the source documents and the exacerbation page of the eCRF. All sites should follow the protocol treatment guidelines (as outlined below), but an y medications deemed medically necessary may be used to treat a C OPD exacerbation. However, caution is advised in using a LABA or LAMA to treat a subject currently taking IP as these additional medications may increase the risk of overdose. If necessary the PI or other health care personnel may stop the subject’s IP te mporaril y in order to treat the COPD exacerbation. 12.5.4. Guidelines for Treatment with Corticosteroids If in the opinion of the Investigator/treating ph ysician the exacerbation is severe enough to warrant the need for oral or sy stemic corticosteroids (with or wi thout antibiotics) the following guidelines should be used. The duration of treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids should be 14 day s (dose and t ype according to local practice) The duration of treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids should no t exceed 14 days unless approval is given by the sponsor or representative Any course of oral/s ystemic corticosteroids started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation 2018N377698_00"

Guidelines for Treatment w ith A ntibiotics If there is evidence of respiratory infection that in the opinion of the Investigator or treating ph ysician warrants the need for antibiotics the following guidelines should be followed: The duration of treatment with antibiotics should not exceed 14 day s (dose and ty pe according to local practice). If first line antibiotic treatment fails and additional antibiotics are used, the total duration of antibiotic treatment should not exceed 30 days unless approval is given by the sponsor or repre sentative Any course of antibiotics started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections is not considered a COPD exacerbation unless the subject experiences worsening of sy mptoms of COPD 12.5.6. Onset and Resolution of COPD Exacerbations For each mild, moderate and severe exacerbation, the date of onset and the date of resolution will be recorded in the study source documents and eCRF. The date of onset is the first day (of at least 2 consecutive day s) of worsening s ymptoms of COPD as described in Section 12.5.1. The date of resolution should be based on when the Investigator and/ or subject determines that the COPD sy mptoms have returned to pre -exacerbation levels or to a new baseline. In determining this resolution date, consideration should be given to diary recorded s ymptoms and/or study subject evaluation. 12.5.7. Guideline for assess ing multiple mild exacerbations Two mild exacerbations can be combined into one, per the Investigator’s judgement, if a subject’s diary reveals that the two mild COPD exacerbations are separated by no more than three exacerbation free day s. 12.5.8. Guideline for a ssessing exacerbations that increase in severity If an exacerbation starts off as mild, but becomes moderate or severe or starts off as moderate and becomes severe, the exacerbation should be captured as one exacerbation and classified b y its highest level of severity . 2018N377698_00"

All sites will use standardized spirometry equipment provided by an external vendor. All subjects will have spirometry performed at Screening to assess eligibility (see Section 7.2.2.1) and at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 during the treatment period. For FEV 1and FVC determinations, at least 3 acceptable spirometry efforts (with no more than 8) should be obtained. Acceptable spirometry efforts should have a satisfactory start of test and end of test (i.e. a plateau in the volume time curve) and be free from artifacts due to cough, early termination, poor effort, obstructed mouthpiece, equipment malfunction, or other reasons [ Miller , 2005]. The largest FEV 1and FVC from the 3 acceptable efforts should be recorded, even if they do not come from the same effort. Spirometry for FEV 1and FVC assessments that is not obtained as follows will be considered a protocol deviation: Started between 6:00AM and 11:00AM. After withholding albuterol/salbutamol (all visits) for ≥4 hours At Screening Visit 1, after wash out of medications as specified in the exclusion criteria in Section 5.2 (Concomitant Medications). At Screening Visit 1, before the morning dose of usual COPD medications At Visit 2 after discontinuing inhaled COPD medications and prior the first dose of study treatment At Visit 3, 4 and 5 after withholding the morning dose of study treatment. Pre dose assessment performed prior dosing. Subjects should refrain from smoking for 1 hour prior to each pulmonary function test. Trough FEV 1measurements for UMC/VI or UMEC on Weeks 4, 12 and 24 (Visits 3, 4 and 5) should be performed 23 hours and 24 hours after the previous day ’s dose of study medication recorded in the eDiary .

Physical activity monitor (study subset) Rationale for changes: Ensure consistency of the wording bet ween Section 1 and Section 4.1 “overall design” and Section 7.3.7. per treatment arm added to paragraph 4. Revised Text : Physical activity monitor (study subset) “Phy sical activity limitation is a common feature of COPD and its measures are highl y relate d to the degree of disease severity [Watz, 2009]. Reduced ph ysical activity levels in COPD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality , sustained disability , depression, and social and phy sical isolation [ Shu-Yi, 2014; Gimeno, 2014] Improved act ivity has been identified as an important factor that may modify morbidity and mortality in COPD [ Moy , 2012 ]. The Actigraph GT9X phy sical activity monitor will be used to measure levels of activity . The activity monitor will be worn by up to approximately 150 subjects per treatment arm for 7 day s from Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 day s from Visit 3 (Week 4) and for 7 day s prior to Week 24 (Visit 5). There will be 4 assessment periods, including a screening assessment in ord er to provide a reliable estimate of habitual phy sical activity . Each subject will be given an activity monitor and instruction leaflet at the start of each assessment period.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS FOR STUDY 201749 Rationale The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function in subjects treated with Umeclidinium/Vilanterol (UMEC/VI ) compared with Umeclidinium (UMEC) f or 24 weeks. A further important aspect of the study is to evaluate the effect of UMC/VI , UMEC, and salmeterol with respect to health- related quality of life (HRQoL), measured through patient reported outcomes (PROs) questionnaires, and lung function . Additional assessments to further evaluate other measures of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) efficacy and sy mptoms control will be performed.

Analysis The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung func tion for subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The null hy pothesis is no difference between treatment groups (H0: μT – μS = 0), with the alternative h ypothesis that there is a difference between treatment groups (H1: μT – μS ≠0), where μ T is the mean change from baseline for UMEC/VI and μS is the mean change from baseline for UMEC. The primary endpoint of mean chang e from baseline in trough FEV 1at the end of Week 24 will be anal ysed using Mixed Models repeated Measures (MMRM) analy sis. The MMRM analy sis will include measurements at Treatment Weeks 4, 12 and 24. Treatment group (a categorical variable) will be fitted as the explanatory variable with appropriate pre-defined variables, stratum (number of bronchodilators per day during run- in) and baseline values, fitted as covariates. Visit (nominal) will be fitted as a categorical variable and visit -by-baseline and visit- by-treatment interaction terms will be included to allow treatment effects to be estimated at each visit separatel y.

Stud y Rationale Chronic obstructive pu lmonary disease ( COPD) is associated with poor health- related quality of life (HRQoL). Pharmacologic therap y is used to improve lung function, reduce symptoms, frequency and severit y of exacerbations, and improve patients HRQoL [GOL D, 2015]. Umeclidinium/Vilanterol (UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg) is indicated for the maintenance treatment of COPD that contain long- acting muscarinic antagonist (L AMA) and long -acting beta 2-agonist (L ABA) bronchodilators. Umeclidinium (UMEC) is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve s ymptoms in adult patients with COPD . Salmeterol has long been used for s ymptoms management of COPD. However, a direct comparison of these maintenance therapies has not been conducted with respect to HRQoL. The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The ef fect of UMC/VI , UMEC, and salmeterol with respect to patient HRQoL measured through patient reported outcomes (PROs) questionnaires, sy mptoms and lung function will also be evaluated. 2.2. Brief Background COPD is characterized by an airflow limitation which is not fully reversible, usually progressive and accompanied by a chronic cough, sputum production and dyspnea which can be a major cause of disability and anxiety associated with the disease [ Maleki -Yazdi , 2014] Furthermore, acute exacerbations contribute to the overall severity of disease as these episodes are accompanied by worsened s ymptoms and are associated with increased decline in lung function and mortality [Wedzicha , 2013; Schmidt , 2014]. Pharmacologic therap y is used to improve lung function, reduce s ymptoms, reduce the frequency and severit y of exacerbations, and also to improve health status and exercise tolerance. Maintenance treatment is recommended primarily through the use of LABAs or LAMAs. COPD treatme nt guidelines recommend an incremental approach to pharmacological treatment as the disease state worsens, involving the use of combinations of drug classes with different or complementary mechanisms [ GOL D, 2015]. UMEC /VI inhalation powder is a combination of UMEC (umeclidinium bromide), a LAMA, and VI (Vilanterol), a LABA, delivered via the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler 2018N377698_00"
122,page_122,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 15(DPI). UMEC/VI at a dose of 62.5/25mcg once- daily is marketed in the United States (US) and Europe unde r the trade name ANORO™ELLIPTA. UMEC (62.5 mcg) inhalation powder is marketed in the United States (US) and Europe under the trade name INCRUSE™ELLIPTA. UMEC (62.5mcg) is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with COPD. UMEC (62.5 mcg) improves forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), dyspnea and HRQoL whether used as monotherap y [Trivedi , 2014; Feldman , 2016] or as an add on to fluticasone propionate and vilanterol (FF/VI) [ Siler , 2015]. Salmetrol (50 mcg) DISKUS is a long - acting broncholdilator that has long been used for the maintenance treatment of COPD [ Tashkin, 2010]. Clinically important deterioration (CID) is a novel, exploratory composite endpoint which assesses individual deteriorations in lung function and in patient PROs defined by the accepted minimal clinically important differenc e (MCID), as well as the incidence of moderate to severe exacerbations [ Singh , 2016], (Section 7.3.5 ). CID will be anal ysed to determine whether UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg) therap y provides greater clinical stability as compared with UMEC and salmeterol monotherapies. 3.

STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This is a multi -centre, randomized, double blind, double -dummy , 3-arm parallel group study . Eligible subjects will be stratified based on long -acting bronchodilator usage during the run- in (none, one or 2 long -acting bronchodilators per day ) and randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 mcg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA inhaler, or UMEC (62.5 mcg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA or salmeterol (50 mcg BID) administered via the DISKUS. There will be a total of 5 clinic visits and one follow-up phone call (Visit 6). The Pre - screening Visit (Visit 0) can occur on the same day as the Screening Visit (Visit 1) if subject does not take or has not taken an y excluded protocol medications, but must be completed prior to initiating an y Visit 1 procedures. Subjects, who meet all the eligibility criteria at Screening, will enter a run -in period for 4 weeks in order to continue to assess the subject’s eligibility for the stud y. During the run- in period subjects will continue with their inhaled COPD medications (excluding ICS and 2018N377698_00"
125,page_125,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 18any exclusionary medications). I n addition, subjects will be provided with short acting albuterol/salbutamol to be used on as needed basis for relief of COPD s ymptoms (rescue medication) throughout the study . Subjects who experience a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run -in period will be deemed run- in failures. Subjects who experience a mild COPD exacerbation, defined as worsening of s ymptoms that requires notreatment with antibiotics or steroids and is self managed b y the patient by an increase of inhaled rescue medication , (Appendix 5 ), will be able to continue in the study based on the judgment of the investigator and agreement of the sponsor’s m edical monitor. At the randomization Visit 2 (Day 1) those subjects who successfull y complete the run- in period as well as meet the other pre -defined eligibility and randomization criteria will discontinue their inhaled COPD medications and will be randomi zed to one of the 3 treatment arms for 24 weeks. During the run-in and treatment period, subjects will be completing PRO questionnaires in the eDiary and performing slow and forced spirometry at specific clinic visits. In addition, a subset of subjects up to 150 per treatment arm will undergo assessment of their phy sical activity measured through a phy sical activity monitor (Actigraph GT9X) worn for 7 day sfrom Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 days from Visit 3, and for 7 day s prior to last clinic Visit (Visit 5). Concurrent use of COPD maintenance medications including LAMAs, LABAs, oral beta - agonists, theoph yllines, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids and L ABA combination and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors will not be allowed during the stud y (Section 6.11.2 ) . The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated throughout the study beginning at Visit 2 (Day 1) and until the follow -up contact (Visit 6). Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected over the same time period as AEs. However, an y SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., study treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GS K concomitant medication, will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including an y follow up contact ( Appendix 4 ). All subjects will be given an electronic diary (eDiary ) for use during the run- in, and the treatment period to complete PRO questionnaires, record COPD daily symptoms, any medical problems experienced during the stud y and the time they take their COPD medications. Daily rescue medication usage (number of inhala tions taken in the last 24h) will also be captured in the eDiary . In addition, and in some countries, rescue medication use will also be captured by the use of electronic metered dose inhaler (eMDI). At Screening Visit 1, all subjects must be trained on t he proper use of their existing COPD medications inhalation devices and instructed to strictly adhere to and record the time they take their COPD medications in the eDiary . 2018N377698_00"

127,page_127,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 20The total duration of subject participation in the study will be approximately 29 to 31 weeks consisting of 2 weeks pre- screening if necessary , 4 weeks run- in, 24 week treatment and one week follow -up. 4.3. Type and Number of Subjects Approximately 3232 will be screened globall y in approximately 205 sites such that approximately 2424 subjects will be randomized and approximately 2181 evaluable subjects complete the study . 4.4. Design Justification A randomized, double blinded, parallel group study is a standard, well- established design to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of an investigational drug. A salmeterol arm is included to allow a comparison to be made between UMEC/VI , UMEC with salmeterol, a standard pr actice treatment. The double -dumm y design is appropriate when drugs are of different appearance or different administration regimen which is appropriate in this study where the inhalers used have a different appearance and used once daily and twice dail y. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) COPD Guidelines suggest that duration of 12 to 24 weeks is considered adequate for assessment of response of COPD sy mptoms to treatment intervention with bronchodilators ( EMA COPD guidelines, 2012). The primary endpoint is trough FEV 1 at week 24. This endpoint is generally considered to be a robust, well established and an objective means to show the efficacy of a bronchodilator [ Dahl , 2010; Feldman , 2010]. Other endpoints such SAC TDI , E-RS, SGRQ -C, CAT, Subject Global Rating of Change in global impression of disease severity are captured to allow responder analy ses and to provide comparative data on PROs between the treatme nt groups. 4.5. Dose Justification This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy of marketed doses of UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg once dail y), UMEC (62.5 mcg once daily ) and salmeterol (50mcg twice daily ) that are approved for the maintenance treatment of COPD, with respect to PRO measures. 4.6. Benefit: Risk A ssessment Summaries of findings from both clinical and non-clinical studies conducted with UMEC/VI and UMEC can be found in the investigator’s brochures (IB) [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2009/00437/07] and [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2006/00835/09] and in the label information sheets. The current safet y profile for UMEC (62.5mcg) and the UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg) based on dat a available to date, is comparable with other LABAs and LAMAs. Summary safet y data can also be found in the information sheet for salmeterol [ Serevent product information , 2003].The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol: 2018N377698_00"

Cardiovascular effects such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. supraventricular tachycardia and extrasysto les.Class effects associated with LABAs and LAMA containing therapy. The clinical significance of these arrhythmias is unknown. Clinical experience with UMEC/VI to date in completed studies did not show any association with major cardiovascular events. Data available in the product label for UMEC/VI Exclusion criteria have been set for subjects with uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease according to the principal investigation’s (PI) opinion where the potential risk may outweigh the benefit. T he PI should also determine the clinical significance of abnormal ECG findings at screening and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. Patients with the following abnormalities will be excluded from participation: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate >120bpm, sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or second degree heart block Mobitz type II or third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted). Beta agonists and risk of asthma -related death Long -acting beta agonists such as vilanterol when used alone may increase the risk of asthma -related death. A placebo -controlled trial with another LABA (salmeterol) showed an increase in asthma -related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol. This finding with salmeterol is considered a class effect of all LABAs, including vilanterol. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by LABA.Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthm a are excluded from participation in the study. Paradoxical bronchospasm As with other inhaled medicines, UMEC/VI can produce paradoxical bronchospasm which may be life threatening.If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with UMEC/VI, this tr eatment should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy should be instituted. Use in patients with narrow -angle glaucoma or urinary retentionNo association has been found to date, in completed studies with UMEC/VI or UMEC monotherapy, on glau coma or urinary retention.

Study Treatment Return All used and unused ELLIPTA and DISKUS inhalers and albuterol/salbutamol will be returned to GSK at the end of the study to be available for disposal. In some instances for sites outside the US, study supplies will be disposed of locall y either b y the site, the country medical department or third -party vendor. Detailed instructions for the return of the study drug can be found in the SRM. Study treatment will be collected at Visit 3, 4 and 5 or at the Earl y Withdrawal Visit, if applicable. For an y ELLIPTA or DISKUS inhaler that fails to function properly , the subject should return to the clinic as soon as possible to obtain a new inhaler. The site will contact the RAMOS NG to obtain a new treatment pack number for the subject and dispense a new study treatment kit from the site’s investigational product supply as instructed by the RAMOS NG In addition, any ELLIPTA that fails to function properly must be identified and returned to GSK for testing. 6.8. Compliance with Study Treatment A dministration When subjects self- administer study treatment(s) at home , compliance with study treatment(s) will be assessed through querying the subject during the site visits and through stud y drug compliance assessed at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 documented in the source documents and eCRF. A record of the number of ELLIPTA and DISKU S dispensed and the number of doses inhaled by each subject must be maintained and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates, including dates for treatment delay s if any will also be recorded in the eCRF. Compl iance with the ELLIPTA inhaler will be determined by reviewing the dose counter on the ELLIPTA. Compliance with the study DISKUS will be determined by reviewing the dose counter on the DISKUS. Subjects should be ≥80% to ≤120% compliant on taking stud y me dication between each pair of on- treatment visits. Subjects who fall outside this range should be re -educated on treatment compliance b y their site. This re - education should be documented in the subject’s source document. If medication compliance repeate dly falls outside of acceptable ranges, the study sponsor/site monitor must be contacted to discuss subject eligibility for continued participation in the study . 6.9. Treatment of Study Treatment Overdose An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total doses described in Section 6.1and Section 6.8which results in clinical signs and s ymptoms. These should be recorded b y the investigator on the AE/SAE pages. In th e event of an overdose of study medication, the investigator should use clinical judgment in treating the overdose and contact the study Medical Monitor. GSK is not recommending specific treatment guidelines for overdose and toxicity management. The investigator is advised to refer to the relevant document(s) for detailed 2018N377698_00"

Such documents may inclu de, but may not be limited to, the approved product label for salmeterol albuterol, UMEC and UMEC/VI or equivalent document provided by GSK. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject. 6.10. Treatment after the End of the Study Subjects will not receive any additional treatment from GSK after completion of the study , since the stud y treatments are commercially available. The inves tigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the subject’s medical condition, post- study treatment. 6.11. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapies All COPD medications used within 30 day s prior to Pre -Screening (Visit 0) and onwards should be recorded in the eCRF including an y changes in medications. Beginning at Visit 1 and throughout the rest of the stud y, all medications should be recorded in the eCRF including an y changes. Stud y provided albuterol/sa lbutamol and double -blinded study drug should notbe recorded in the eCRF. The minimum requirement includes but is not limited to drug name, dose, route and the dates of administration. Medications initiated after completion of Visit 5 or the Earl y Withd rawal Visit will not be recorded in the eCRF, with the exception of those used to treat a COPD exacerbation or SAE that occurs between Visit 5 (or the Early Withdrawal Visit) and the follow -up contact atVisit 6. 6.11.1.

Pre-screening Visit During the Pre -screening Visit, the study designated personnel must provide informed consent to the study participant. Subjects can perform the Pre- screening Visit (Visit 0) up to 2 weeks prior to or on the same day as the Screening Visit (Visit 1) if subject does not take or has not taken any protocol excluded medications. Modification of the subject’s medications prior to study participation is based on the physician’s judgment according to sound medical practice, principles, and each subject’s needs. A subject’s treatment must not be changed merel y for the purpose of enabling the subject’s participation in the study . A subject number will be assigned at the time the informed consent form (ICF) is signed. No study related procedures may be performed until the informed consent form document has been signed by the subject. Once the informed consent is signed and if requir ed, changes can be made to the subject’s current medication regimen. The investigator should exercise clinical judgment, and is discouraged from changing medications only for the purpose of the clinical study . During the pre -screening Visit 0, the follow ing information is collected: Demographic parameters: y ear of birth, gender, race and ethnicity Concomitant medications review COPD exacerbation assessment From the pre -screening visit onwards concomitant medications, exacerbations and SAEs (considered as related to study participation) must be reported 7.2.2. Critical procedures performed at Screening (Visit 1) The following critical assessments will be conducted at Visit 1: Cardiovascular medical history /risk factors (as detailed in the eCRF) will be assessed at screening Medical history including COPD (including date of diagnosis and COPD ty pe (emphy sema and/or chronic bronchitis), smoking history , COPD exacerbation history , smoking status and previous and/or current medical conditions) Concomitant medication r eview (COPD and non COPD medications in the 3 months prior to Screening). Height and weight 12-Lead ECG.

Albuterol/Salbutamol Reversibility Assessment At Visit 1, both pre -and post -albuterol/salbutamol spirometry will be obtained to determine subject eligibility . Reversibility assessment should be performed as follows: Perform pre -bronchodilator spirometry and record FEV 1and FVC Subject to self -administer 4 Inhalations (4X100 g) of albuterol/salbutamol MDI Perform post -bronchodilator spirometry and record FEV 1and FVC approximately 10 to 30 minutes after albuterol/salbutamol administration The results of the spirometry must meet the ATS/ERS criteria [ Miller , 2005] for the subject to continue in the study . 7.2.3.

Efficacy Assessments 7.3.1. HRQoL assessments: Completion of PRO questionnaires in the Electronic Diary All subjects will be completing PRO questionnaires in the eDiary . It is requested that questionnaires are completed before an y procedures are performed on the subject. All questio nnaires will be completed using the eDiary at clinic and at home. Adequate time should be allowed to complete all items of the questionnaires and the questionnaires must be reviewed b y the investigator or designated study staff for completeness and, if necessary , the subject must be encouraged to complete any missing items. Where more than one questionnaire is to be completed at a visit the order should be as follows: 1.Baseline d yspnea index (Visit 2) then Transient dy spnea index at subsequent visits 2. Patien t global rating of COPD severit y and global rating of change in COPD 3.St George’s respiratory questionnaire 4. COPD Assessment Test Instructions for completing the questionnaires can be found in the SRM. 7.3.1.1. Self A dministered Computerised Baseline Dy spnea Index/T ransitional Dyspnea Index (SA C BDI/TDI) The BD I is used to measure the severity of d yspnea in patients at baseline. The TDI measures changes in the patient’s dyspnea from baseline. The self -administered computerized version of the BDI/TDI (SAC BDI/TDI)[ Mahler , 2004] is used to measure severit y of d yspnea in patients at baseline (SAC BDI) on Day 1 (Visit 2) of treatment and change from the baseline (SAC TDI) at Week 4, 12 and 24 (Visits 3, 4 and 5). The 2018N377698_00"
155,page_155,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 48scores in both indexes depend on ratings for three different categories: functional impairment; magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. SAC BDI/TDI should be completed before performing spirometry . The SAC BDI/TDI was developed to address issues of potential bias in the interviewer administered (original) BDI /TDI [ Mahler , 1984]. The SAC BDI/TDI provides a standardized approach to the measurement of d yspnea, equivalent to the original BDI/TDI with advantages over the interview er method for grading d yspnea in patients with COPD by standardizing the process for each patient and eliminating individual judgment required b y the interviewers when completing the original BDI/TDI. This also removes the need for the same investigator to conduct all interviews with a subject based on the patient’s responses. SAC TDI provides a continuous measure of change in dy spnea using a visual analogue scale to record responses. Details for the completion of the SAC BDI/TDI are provided in the SRM. 7.3.1.2. SGRQ-C The St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease specific (SGRQ -C) will be completed by subjects at Randomisation (V2, Day 1), at Week 4, 12 and 24 or at the Early Withdrawal Visit (where applicable). The SGRQ- C [Meguro , 2007] is a well established, disease -specific questionnaire. It was designed to measure the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on a COPD patient’s HRQoL. As well as producing an overall summary score, sco res for the individual domains of symptoms, activity and impacts are also produced. It has been used in studies of COPD subjects and has been translated and validated for use in most major languages. The SGRQ- C is derived from the original SGRQ, and prod uces scores equivalent to the SGRQ instrument [ Meguro , 2007]. 7.3.1.3. COPD A ssessment Test (CA T) The COPD Assessment Test [ Jones, 2009, Jones, 2012] is a validated, short and simple patient completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD. The CAT is an 8- item questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients dia gnosed with COPD. When completing the questionnaire, subjects rate their experience on a 6 -point scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment) with a scoring range of 0 -40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. The CAT will be c ompleted in the eDiary by subjects at Screening Visit 1 and Randomisation Visit 2 to assess their eligibility to enter the stud y. CAT is also completed at Weeks 4, 12 and 24 . Additional instructions for completion of the CAT are provided in the SRM. 2018N377698_00"
156,page_156,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 497.3.1.4. EXACT and the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms -COPD (E -RS: COPD) EXACT -PRO is a 14 item patient reported outcome instrument designed to capture information on the occurrence, frequency , severity , and duration of exacerbations of disease in patients with COPD [ Leidy, 2011]. EXACT captures information on the severit y of the respiratory and s ystemic manifestations of a COPD exacerbation as reported b y the patient. The instrument is to be completed daily (typically 2 hrs before bedtime) using the electronic diary . The daily recording of information allows an assessment of the underlying day to day variability of a patient's s ymptoms and facilitates the detection of s ymptom worsening indicative of a COPD exacerbation. The tot al score for EXACT ranges from 0 -100. The entire instrument is intended to be completed in about 3 minutes or less (typically the time required for completion decreases as the patient becomes more familiar with the tool and the electronic diary ). The E- RS: COPD consists of 11 items from the 14 item EXACT instrument [ Leidy, 2014]. E -RS: COPD is intended to capture information related to the respiratory symptoms of COPD, i.e. breathlessness, cough, sputum production, ch est congestion and chest tightness. The E -RS: COPD has a scoring range of 0 -40 higher scores indicate more severe s ymptoms. Three subscales of the E -RS are used to describe different s ymptoms; dy spnea, cough and sputum and chest sy mptoms. The EXACT questi onnaire will be completed b y subjects in the eDiary , at home every night throughout the entire study , starting from Screening V1 7.3.1.5. Subject Global Rating of COPD Severity and Global Rating of Change in COPD Subjects will complete the Global Rating of COPD Se verity at Randomization Visit 2 and visits 3, 4 and 5 or Early Withdrawal Visit. This single global question will ask subjects to rate their severity of COPD on a four point scale (mild, moderate, severe, and very severe). This question should be used im mediately before the patient completes other visit specific questionnaires but after completion of SAC TDI questionnaire. Subjects will also complete a Global Rating of Change in COPD (overall disease) question at Visits 3, 4 and 5 or Earl y Withdrawal Vis it. Response options will be on a 7 point L ikert scale ranging from much better to much worse. Completing the question at each Visit allows for early detection of response as well as continued response. 7.3.2. Spirometry Spirometry measurements will be obtained using spirometry equipment that meets or exceeds the minimal performance recommendations of the ATS [ Miller , 2005]. All sites will use standardized spirometry equipment provided by an external vendor. 2018N377698_00"
157,page_157,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 50All subjects wi ll have spirometry performed at Screening to assess eligibility (see Section 7.2.2.1 ) and at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 during the treatment period. For FEV1and FVC determinations, at least 3 acceptable spirometry efforts (with no more than 8) should be obtained. Acceptable spirometry efforts should have a satisfactory start of test and end of test (i.e. a plateau in the volume time curve) and be free from artifacts due to cough, early termination, poor effort, obstructed mouthpiece, equipment malfunction, or other reasons [ Miller , 2005]. The largest FEV1and FVC from the 3 acceptable efforts should be recorded, even if they do not come from the same effort. Spirometry for FEV 1and FVC assessments that is not obtained as follows will be considered a protocol deviation: Started between 6:00AM and 11:00AM. After withholding albuterol/salbutamol (all visits) for ≥4 hours At Screening Visit 1, after wash out of medications as specified in the exclusion criteria in Section 5.2(Concomitant Medications). At Screening Visit 1, before the morning dose of usual COPD medications At Visit 2 after discontinuing inhaled COPD medications and prior the first dose of study treatment At Visit 3, 4 and 5 after withholding the morning dose of study treatment. Pre dose assessment performed prior dosing. Subjects should refrain from smoking for 1 hour prior to each pulmonary function test. Trough FEV 1measure ments for UMC/VI or UMEC on Weeks 4, 12 and 24 (Visits 3, 4 and 5) should be performed 23 hours and 24 hours after the previous day ’s dose of study medication recorded in the eDiary . This will also provide trough FEV 1measurements for the evening dose of s almeterol. 7.3.3. Inspiratory capacity (IC) Inspiratory capacit y (IC) is the volume of gas that can be taken into the lungs in a normal and full inhalation. Starting from the resting inspiratory position it is equal to the tidal volume plus the inspiratory reser ve volume. IC has been widel y used to assess static and dynamic h yperinflation in patients with COPD. IC will be measured b y spirometry prior to forced manoeuvres pre -dose at Visits 2 (30 and 5 min prior to dosing) and at trough at Visits 3, 4, and 5 (23 and 24 hrs post dosing on the previous day ). For I C determination the average of at least three acceptable manoeuvres should be recorded. Subjects should be tested while sitting, relaxed and wearing a nose clip. They should be asked to breathe regularl y for several breaths until the end- expiratory lung volume is stable (this usually requires at least three tidal manoeuvres) then urged to take a deep breath to Total L ung Capacit y (TLC) with no hesitation. 2018N377698_00"
158,page_158,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 51Spirometry for IC determination done in conjunction with FEV 1and FVC assessments that is not obtained as follows will be considered a protocol deviation: Started between 6:00AM and 11:00AM. After withholding albuterol/salbutamol (all visits) ≥4 hours At Visit 2 after discontinuation of run -in medication At Visit 3, 4 and 5 after withholding the morning dose of study drug 7.3.4. COPD Exacerbation A mild exacerbation is defined as worsening of s ymptoms that require no treatment with antibiotics or steroids, and is self managed b y the patient by an increase of inhaled rescue medications. A moderate COPD exacerbation is defined as worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral/sy stemic co rticosteroids and/or antibiotics. A severe exacerbation is defined as worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require in- patient hospitalization or emergency room for longer than 24 hrs. If a subject experiences a mild, moderate or severe COPD exacerbation, the COPD exacerbation page of the eCRF should be completed. COPD exacerbations should not be recorded as an AE, unless they meet the definition of a SAE. Details of COPD exacerbation identification, categorization and treatment guidelines are described in Appendix 5 . Subjects who experience a mild exacerbation during the run- in period will not be withdrawn from the study. However, Subjects who experience moderate or severe exacerbation during the run -in period will be withdr awn from the study and will not be allowed to be re -screened. Subjects who experience a mild, moderate or severe exacerbation during the treatment period, will notbe withdrawn from the study unless the investigator or GSK medical monitor think it is best for the patient to withdraw from the study. Signs and s ymptoms of COPD included on the electronic diary cards will not be considered AEs and will not be recorded in the eCRF. The time period for collection of COPD exacerbations will be from the Pre -Screen ing (Visit 0) until completion of the follow -up contact. If a subject experiences a COPD exacerbation from the time the I CF is signed until randomization, summary information (yes/no status question) will be collected in the eCRF. COPD exacerbations after randomization through follow -up will be recorded on the COPD exacerbation page of the eCRF. 7.3.5. Clinically important deterioration (CID) Clinically important deterioration (CID) is a composite endpoint defined as: A decrease of 100 mL from baseline in trou gh FEV 1 2018N377698_00"
159,page_159,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 52A deterioration in HRQoL defined as 4 units increase from baseline in SGRQ The occurrence of an on -treatment moderate/severe COPD exacerbation In addition, this study will explore CAT and TDI PROs as part of the composite endpoint. 7.3.6. Rescue albuter l/salbutamol use Subjects will record the number of dail y albuterol/salbutemol puffs they use in the eDiary . In addition, in some countries and selected sites the number of puffs will be collected through the eMDI device (Section 6.2) 7.3.7. Physical activity monitor (study subset) Physical activity limitation is a common feature of COPD and its measures are highl y related to the degree of disease severity [Watz , 2009]. Reduced phy sical activity levels in COPD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality , sustained disability , depression, and social and phy sical isolation [ Shu-Yi, 2014; Gimeno, 2014] Improved activity has been identified as an important factor that may modify morbidity and mortality in COPD [ Moy , 2012 ]. The Actigraph GT9X phy sical activity monitor will be used to measure levels of activity . The activity monitor will be worn by up to approximately 150 subjects per treatment arm for 7 day s from Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 day s from Visit 3 (Week 4) and for 7 day s prior to Week 24 (Visit 5). There will be 4 assessment periods, including a screening assessment in order to provide a reliable estimate of habitual phy sical activity . Each subject will be given an activity monitor and instruction leaflet at the start of each assessment period.

Time period and Frequency for collecting A E and SA E information Any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol- mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow -up contact. AEs will be collected from the start of Study Treatment until the follow -up contact (see Sectio n 7.4.1. 3), at the timepoints specified in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent may be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to GSK within 24 hours, as indicated in (Appendix 4 , Section 12.4.6 ) Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify GSK. NOTE: The method of recording, evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to GSK are provided in (Appendix 4 , Section 12.4.4 to Section 12.4.6 ) 7.4.1.2. Method of Detecting AEs a nd SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact  “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since y our last visit/contact? 7.4.1.3. Follo w-up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non -serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 4.6.1 ) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 5.5). 2018N377698_00"

Pneumonia Events Investigators will be required to fill out a pneumonia event specific eCRF within one week of when the pneumonia AE/SAE(s) is first reported. 7.4.1.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in (Section 12.4.3) and all deaths, whether or not they are consid ered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non- cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 7.4.1.6. Disease- Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es The following disease related events (DREs) are common in subjects with COPD and can be serious/life threatening: COPD exacerbation COPD exacerbations are associated with the disease to be studied and will not be recorded as AEs unless the exacerbation meet s the definition of a ‘serious’ AE. Exacerbations that meet the definition of ‘serious’ AEs will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF section and should be reported to GSK for all subjects regardless of whether or not they are randomized to study medication . Signs and s ymptoms of COPD included on the electronic diary will not be considered AEs and will not be recorded in the eCRF 7.4.1.7. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to GSK of SAEs related to study treatment (even for non -interventional post -marketing studies) is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of subjects and the safety of a product under clinical investigation are met. GSK has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authorit y and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. GSK will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Instituti onal Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and investigators. 2018N377698_00"
162,page_162,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 55Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with the IB and will notify the I RB/IEC, if appropriate accord ing to local requirements. 7.4.1.8. Additional A dverse Event (AE) Reporting Requirements for Canadian investigators Health Canada requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to expeditiously report domestic cases of unusual failure in efficacy (UFIE) for new drugs to the Marketed Health Products Directorate (MHPD) within 15 day s of first notification. This regulation applies to marketed drugs, and used as directed per the Canadian prescribing information, including those drugs used in Phase IV (non CTA filed) clinical tri als. Adverse event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) symptom or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a Medicinal Product. For a marketed Medicinal Product, this can also include failure to produce ex pected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy, with or without an adverse event), In order for GSK to comply this Canadian regulatory requirement, Canadian investigators are required to collect, record and report lack of efficacy events as per the table in Appendix 4 Section 12.4.1 . All paper forms are required to be faxed to GSK Canada’s Drug Safety department at within 24 hrs of first awareness. 7.4.2. Pregnancy Details of all pregnanci es in female subjects will be collected after the start of Screening and until the follow -up contact. If a pregnancy is reported then the investigator should inform GSK within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 7 . 7.4.3. Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions) Procedures for documenting medical device incidents are provided in Appendix 6 . 7.4.4. Electrocardiogram (ECG) A Single 12- lead ECG will be obtained at Screening using an ECG machine provided by the investigational site that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. 2018N377698_00 PP"

ECG measurement should be obtained after subjects have rested for approximately 5 minutes then the subjects should be placed in the supine position for the ECG measurements. An ECG is only required at Screening Visit 1 fo r eligibility assessment only . The investigator, a designated sub -investigator, or other appropriatel y trained site personnel will be responsible for performing and interpreting the 12 -lead ECG at Screening Visit 1. The investigator must provide his/her d ated signature on the original paper tracing, attesting to the authenticity of the ECG machine interpretation. 7.5. Genetics Information regarding genetic research is included in Appendix 3 8. DATA MANAG EMENT For this study subject data will be entered into GSK defined CRFs, transmitted electronically to GSK or designee and combined with data provided from other sources in a validated data sy stem. Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable GSK standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrit y of the data, e.g., removing errors and inconsistencies in the data. Adverse events and concomitant medications terms will be coded using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) and an internal validated medication dictionary , GSKDrug. CRFs (including queries and audit trails) will be retained b y GSK, and copies will be sent to the investigator to maintain as the investigator cop y. Subject initials will not be collected or tra nsmitted to GSK according to GSK policy . 9. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND DA TA ANALYSES 9.1. Hypotheses The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The prim ary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The null hy pothesis is no difference between treatment groups (H0: μT – μS = 0), with the alternative h ypothesis that there is a difference between treatment groups (H1: μT – μS ≠0), where μ T is the mean change from baseline for UMEC/VI and μS is the mean change from baseline for UMEC. 2018N377698_00"
164,page_164,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 579.2. Sample Size Considerations The pr imary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. As an important aim of the study is to compare UMEC/VI, UMEC and salmeterol with respect to HRQoL the sample size has been calculated to provide sufficient power for the comparison of the pr imary and secondary endpoint TDI , at Week 24. The sample size calculations use a two -sided 5% significance level and an estimate of between subject standard deviation for TDI of 2.94 units. The estimate of SD is based on DB2113373 [ Donohue , 2013], a study which consisted of treatment arms of UMEC/VI 62.5/25, UMEC 62.5 VI (Vilanterol) 25mcg and placebo and is the value at Day 168 in a subgroup of subjects who were ICS free at screening. Based on these data, 727 eva luable subjects per treatment arm will be required to provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference if the true difference is 0.5 units, ½ the MCI D, between UMEC/VI and UMEC. The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statis tically significant difference between treatment groups is 0.31 units. With this number of evaluable subjects per arm, the study will have >99% power assuming a true treatment difference of 80mL between UMEC/VI and UMEC for trough FEV1 at 24 weeks at the two-sided 5% significance level. This calculation uses a SD for trough FEV1 of 240mL, based on prior results for trials comparing dual bronchodilators versus single bronchodilators ( Donohue , 2013; Bateman , 2013). The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statistically significant difference between treatment groups is 25mL . In order to account a for a 10% withdrawal rate , approximately 808 subjects per treatment arm will be randomised. 9.2.1. Sample Size A ssumptions 9.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity The assumption of a SD of 2.94 units for the TDI total score is based on estimates from previous studies. The following table presents the power achieved with the proposed sample size of 727 randomised subjects per arm, should the assumption around the SD of the data change. The actual assumptions used in the sample size calculation are shaded.

Interi m Analysis No interim anal ysis is planned for the stud y. 9.4. Key Elements of A nalysis Plan Treatment Comparisons The primary treatment comparison of UMEC/VI with UMEC will be performed on the ITT population. 2018N377698_00"
166,page_166,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 59The other treatment comparisons of UMEC/VI and UMEC with Salmeterol will be performed on the ITT population and ITT ICS free population. 9.4.1. Primary Analyses The treatment comparison of primary interest will be UMEC/VI versus UMEC for the primary endpoint of change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The primary analyses will be performed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) anal ysis and will be based on a two -sided hy pothesis testing approach on the ITT Population. In order to account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and endpoints, a step- down closed testing procedure will be applied whereb y inference for secondary and other endpoints or treatment comparisons are dependent upon statistical significance having been achieved for the primary comparison. If the primary comparison is signif icant i.e. the associated p-value for UMEC/VI versus UMEC for change from baseline in trough FEV1 at Week 24 is below 0.05, this will allow inference of treatment comparisons (UMEC/VI versus UMEC on all other endpoints, and UMEC/VI versus Salmeterol and UMEC versus Salmeterol on all endpoints including the primary endpoint), which will be declared statistically significant if the associated p -value is below 0.05. There will be 2 anal yses one for one for the German Federal Joint Committee (G -BA) and one fo r the rest of the world (ROW). The step-down closed testing procedure onl y applies to the ROW. For the G -BA statistical inference for secondary and other endpoints or treatment comparisons will not be conditional on achieving statistical significance of t he primary comparison. The primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 at the end of Week 24 and secondary endpoint change from baseline in TDI score at Week 24 will both be analysed using MMRM analy sis. The MMRM analy sis for change from baseline in trough FEV1 and TDI will include measurements at Treatment Weeks 4, 12 and 24. Treatment group (a categorical variable) will be fitted as the explanatory variable with appropriate pre -defined variables, stratum (number of bronchodilators per d ay during run-in) and baseline values, fitted as covariates. Visit (nominal) will be fitted as a categorical variable and visit- by-baseline and visit -by-treatment interaction terms will be included to allow treatment effects to be estimated at each visit s eparatel y. The variance covariance matrix will be assumed to be unstructured (based on previous experience no issues are expected with fitting models with this matrix structure). While missing data are not explicitly imputed in the primary MMRM analy ses, there is an underl ying assumption that the data are missing at random. The estimated treatment differences between UMEC/VI versus UMEC for each endpoint will be presented with the 95% confidence intervals for the difference and the p -value. Full details of the analy ses to be performed on all primary endpoints will be given in the RAP. 2018N377698_00"
167,page_167,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 609.4.2. Other A nalyses The MMRM anal ysis will be repeated for the ITT ICS free population. Estimated differences between UMEC/VI or UMEC and Salmeterol will be presented together wi th 95% confidence intervals (CI s) for the difference and p- values. Secondary and other efficacy endpoints and treatment comparisons will be adjusted for multiplicity as per Section 9.4.1 . Full details of the ana lyses to be performed on the other efficacy endpoints will be given in the RAP. Safety Analyses Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the standard GSK dictionary , Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and grouped by body system. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one AE of an y type, AEs within each bod y system and AEs within each preferred term will be presented for each treatment group. Separate summaries will be provided for all AEs, drug related AEs, fatal AEs, non- fatal SAEs, AESI s and AEs leading to withdrawal. Deaths and SAEs will be documented in case narrative format. Full details of the analy ses to be performed on all safet y endpoints will be given in the RAP. 10. STUDY GOVERNANCE CON SIDERATIONS 10.1.

Appendix 3: Genetic Research Genetics –Background Naturall y occurring genetic variation may contribute to inter -individual variability in response to medicines, as well as an individual's risk of developing specific diseases. Genetic factors associated with disease characteristics may also be associated with response to therap y, and could help to explain some clinical study outcomes. For example, genetic variants associated with age- related macular degeneration (AMD) are reported to account for much of the risk for the condition [ Gorin , 2012] with certain variants reported to in fluence treatment response [ Chen, 2012]. Thus, knowledge of the genetic etiology of disease may better inform understanding of disease and the development of medicines. Additionally , genetic variability may impact the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination), or pharmacod ynamics (relationship between concentration and pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) of a specific medicine and/or clinical outcomes (efficac y and/or safet y) observed in a clinical study. Genetic Research Objectives and A nalyses The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate the relationship between genetic variants and: Response to medicine, including an y concomitant medicines; COP D susceptibility , severity , and progression of related conditions Genetic data may be generated while the study is underway or following completion of the study . Genetic evaluations may include focused candidate gene approaches and/or examination of a la rge number of genetic variants throughout the genome (whole genome analyses). Genetic anal yses will utilize data collected in the study and will be limited to understanding the objectives highlighted above. Analy ses may be performed using data from multip le clinical studies to investigate these research objectives. Planned anal yses and results of genetic investigations will be reported either as part of the clinical RAP and study report, or in a separate genetics RAP and report, as appropriate. Study Popul ation Any subject who is enrolled in the study can participate in genetic research. Any subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from the genetic research. Study Assessments and Procedures A key component of successful genetic research is the collection of samples during clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori hypothesis has been identified, may enable future genetic anal yses to be conducted to help understand variability in disease and medicine response. 2018N377698_00"
179,page_179,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 72A 6 ml blood sample will be taken for Deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. A blood sample is collected at the baseline visit, after the subject has been randomized and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collecti on and shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory manual. The DNA from the blood sample may undergo quality control analy ses to confirm the integrit y of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality of the sample, then the sam ple may be destroy ed. The blood sample is taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to an inabilit y to utilize the original sample. The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same stud y specific number used to label o ther samples and data in the study . This number can be traced or linked back to the subject by the investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or social security number). Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 y ears after the last subject completes the study , or GSK may destroy the samples sooner. GSK or those working with GSK (for example, other researchers) will only use samples collected from the study for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form. Samples may be used as part of the development of a companion diagnostic to support the GSK medicinal product. Subjects can request their sample to be destro yed at any time. Informed Consent Subjects who do not w ish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study . Genetic informed consent must be obtained prior to any blood being taken. Subject Withdrawal from Study If a subject who has consented to participate in genetic research withdr aws from the clinical study for any reason other than being lost to follow -up, the subject will be given a choice of one of the following options concerning the genetic sample, if already collected: Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA sample is retained Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy the genetic DNA sample If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for an y reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within the timeframe specified b y GSK and maintain the documentation in the site study records . Genoty pe data may be generated during the study or after completion of the study and may be anal yzed during the study or stored for future anal ysis. 2018N377698_00"
180,page_180,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 73If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research and genot ype data has not been analyzed, it will not be analy zed or used for future research. Genetic data that has been anal yzed at the time of withdr awn consent will continue to be stored and used, as appropriate. Screen and Baseline Failures If a sample for genetic research has been collected and it is determined that the subject does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the study , then t he investigator should instruct the subject that their genetic sample will be destro yed. No forms are required to complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample reconciliation process. In this instance a sample destruction form will not be available to include in the site files. Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality of Subject’s Genetic Data GSK may summarize the genetic research results in the clinical study report, or separately and may publish the results in sci entific journals. GSK may share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific understanding in alignment with the informed consent. GSK does not inform the subject, family members, insurers, or employ ers of individual genoty ping result s that are not known to be relevant to the subject’s medical care at the time of the study , unless required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic studies is generally preliminary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific validity of the results are undetermined. Further, data generated in a research laboratory may not meet regulatory requirements for inclusion in clinical care. 2018N377698_00"

Definition of A dverse Events Adverse Event Definition: An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. For a marketed medicinal product, this can also include failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy , with or without associated signs or sy mptoms or clinical sequelae). NOTE: An AE can therefore be anyunfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Events meeting AE definition include: Any abnormal laboratory test result s (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgeme nt of the investigator. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it m ay have been present prior to the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae). ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" will be rep orted as an AE or SAE as per the table below Adverse Event criteriaElectronic case record form (eCRF) onlyPaper form only Electronic case record form (eCRF) + Paper form Non serious Non drug related lack of efficacy reports with associated signs or symptoms or clinical Drug related lack of efficacy reports without associated signs or s ymptoms or Drug related lack of efficacy with associated signs or symptoms or 2018N377698_00"

Drug related lack of efficacy reports with associated signs or symptoms or clinical sequelae Events NOT meeting definition of an AE include: Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expe cted for the subject’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endos copy, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or co ndition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 12.4.2. Definition of Serious A dverse Events If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/ symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease, etc). Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the def inition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of e xisting hospitalization NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are 2018N377698_00"
183,page_183,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 76AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalizatio n” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in disability/incapacity NOTE: The term disability mea ns a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , influenza, and a ccidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse g. Is associated with liver injury andimpaired liver function defined as: ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin*2xUL N (>35% direct), or ALT 3xULN and I NR**> 1.5. * Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available; if unavailable, measure urinary bilirubin via dipstick. I f fractionation is unavailable and ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin  2xULN, then the event is still to be reported as an SAE. ** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants. If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be recorded on the SAE form. 12.4.3. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias 2018N377698_00"

Recording of A Es and SA Es AEs and SAE Recording: When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsib ility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the electronic CRF and/or pa per form as applicable .It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK, AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this instance, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission of to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event bas ed on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis will be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms. Subject -completed Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaires and the collection of AE data are i ndependent components of the study . Responses to each question in the Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaire will be treated in accordance with standard scoring and statistical procedures detailed b y the scale’s developer. The use of a single question f rom a multidimensional health survey to designate a cause -effect relationship to an AE is inappropriate. 12.4.5. Evaluating AEs and SA Es Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and will assign it to one of the following categories: 2018N377698_00"
185,page_185,"2016N277425_02 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 78Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere wit h normal every day activities Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. -an AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre -defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatme nt and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underly ing diseases, concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will be considered and investigated. The investig ator will also consult the I nvestigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE data collection tool accordingl y. The causality assessment i s one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested b y GSK to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. 2018N377698_00"

This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other h ealth care professionals. If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a copy of any post -mortem findings, including histopathology . New or updated information will be r ecorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within the designated reporting time frames. 12.4.6. Reporting of SA Es to GSK SAE reporting to GSK via electronic data collection tool Primary mechanism for report ing SAEs to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool For lack of efficacy reports , the paper form will be used to submit to GSK as per the table in Section 12.4.1 above. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for greate r than 24 hours, the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool and fax it to the Medical Monitor Site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic s ystem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator will be required to confirm review of the SAE causality by ticking the ‘reviewed’ box at the bottom of the eCRF page within 72 hours of submission of the SAE. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool (e.g., InForm s ystem) will be taken off- line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study subject or receives updated data on a previousl y reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off-line, the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or to the Medical Monitor by telephone. Contacts for SAE receipt can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page. 2018N377698_00"

Details of an e xacerbation should be recorded in the exacerbation page of the eCRF. However, exacerbations should not be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF unless they meet the definition of an SAE. (Pneumonia must be recorded in the AE or SAE section of the eCRF and on the Pneumonia page of the eCRF.) Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections will not be considered a COPD exacerbation unless the subject experiences worsening s ymptoms of COPD which match the definition of an e xacerbation as given above. 12.5.3. Treatment of COPD Exacerbations All medications used for the treatment of exacerbations must be recorded in the source documents and the exacerbation page of the eCRF. All sites should follow the protocol treatment guidelines ( as outlined below), but any medications deemed medically necessary may be used to treat a COPD exacerbation. However, caution is advised in using a LABA or LAMA to treat a subject currently taking IP as these additional medications may increase the risk of overdose. If necessary the PI or other health care personnel may stop the subject’s IP temporaril y in order to treat the COPD exacerbation. 12.5.4. Guidelines for Treatment with Corticosteroids If in the opinion of the Investigator/treating ph ysician the exacerb ation is severe enough to warrant the need for oral or sy stemic corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) the following guidelines should be used. The duration of treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids should be 14 day s (dose and t ype according to local practice) The duration of treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids should not exceed 14 days unless approval is given by the sponsor or representative Any course of oral/s ystemic corticosteroids started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation 2018N377698_00"

Guidelines for Treatment with A ntibiotics If there is evidence of respiratory infection that in the opinion of the Investigator or treating ph ysician warrants the need for antibiotics the fol lowing guidelines should be followed: The duration of treatment with antibiotics should not exceed 14 day s (dose and ty pe according to local practice). If first line antibiotic treatment fails and additional antibiotics are used, the total duration of antibiotic treatment should not exceed 30 days unless approval is given by the sponsor or representative Any course of antibiotics started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections is not considered a COPD exacerbation unless the subject experiences worsening of sy mptoms of COPD 12.5.6. Onset and Resolution of COPD Exacerbations For each mild, moderate and severe exacerbation , the date of onset and the date of resolution will be recorded in the study source documents and eCRF. The date of onset is the first day (of at least 2 consecutive day s) of worsening s ymptoms of COPD as described in Section 12.5.1. The date of resolution should be based on when the Investigator and/or subject determines that the COPD sy mptoms have returned to pre -exacerbation levels or to a new baseline. In determining this resolution date, consideration shoul d be given to diary recorded s ymptoms and/or study subject evaluation. 12.5.7. Guideline for assessing multiple mild exacerbations Two mild exacerbations can be combined into one, per the Investigator’s judgement, if a subject’s diary reveals that the two mild COP D exacerbations are separated by no more than three exacerbation free day s. 12.5.8. Guideline for assessing exacerbations that increase in severity If an exacerbation starts off as mild, but becomes moderate or severe or starts off as moderate and becomes severe, the exacerbation should be captured as one exacerbation and classified b y its highest level of severity. 2018N377698_00"

Definitions of a Medical Device Incident The detection and documentat ion procedures described in this protocol apply to all GSK medical devices provided for use in the stud y (see Section 6.2 for the list of GSK medical devices). Medical Device Incident Definition: Incident –Any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directl y or indirectly , might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient/user/other pe rsons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The non- occurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of health car e personnel. It is sufficient that:  an incident associated with a device happened and  the incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious deterioration in health.  A serious deterioration in state of health can include:  life-threatening illness  permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to a bod y structure  a condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above  fetal distress, fetal death or an y congenital abnormality or birth defe cts Examples of incidents a patient, user, care giver or professional is injured as a result of a medical device failure or its misuse a patient’s treatment is interrupted or compromised by a medical device failure misdiagnosis due to medical device failur e leads to inappropriate treatment a patient’s health deteriorates due to medical device failure 2018N377698_00"

Revised text: Salmeterol , salbutamol “This is a multi -centre, randomized, double blind, double- dummy , 3-arm parallel group study . Eligible subjects will be stratified based on long -acting bronchodilator usage during the run- in (none, one or 2 long -acting bronchodilators per day ) and randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 mcg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA inhaler, or UMEC (62.5 mcg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA or salmeterol (50 mcg BID) administered via the DISKUS. There will be a total of 5 clinic visits and one follow -up phone call (Visit 6). The Pre - screening Visit (Visit 0) can occur on the same day as the Screening Visit (Visit 1) if subject does not take or has not taken an y excluded protocol medications, but must be completed prior to initiating an y Visit 1 procedures. Subjects, who meet all the eligibility criteria at Screening, will enter a run -in period for 4 weeks in order to continue to assess the subject’s eligibility for the stud y. During the run- in period subjects will continue with their inhaled COPD medications (excluding ICS and any exclusionary medications). I n addition, subjects will be provided with short acting albuterol/ salmeterol salbutamol to be used on as needed basis for relief of COPD symptoms (rescue medication) throughout the study ”.

All sites will use standardized spirometry equipment provided by an external vendor. All subjects will have spirometry performed at Screenin g to assess eligibility (see Section 7.2.2.1) and at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 during the treatment period. For FEV1and FVC determinations, at least 3 acceptable spirometry efforts (with no more than 8) should be obtained. Acceptable spirometry efforts should have a satisfactory start of test and end of test (i.e. a plateau in the volume time curve) and be free from artifacts due to cough, early termination, poor effort, obstructed mouthpiece, equipment malfunction, or other reasons [ Miller , 2005]. The largest FEV1and FVC from the 3 acceptable efforts should be recorded, even if they do not come from the same effort. Spirometry for FEV 1and FVC assessments that is not obtained as follows will be considered a protocol deviation: Started between 6:00AM and 11:00A M. After withholding albuterol/salbutamol (all visits) for ≥4 hours At Screening Visit 1, after wash out of medications as specified in the exclusion criteria in Section 5.2 (Concomitant Medications). At Screening Visit 1, before the morning dose of usual COP D medications At Visit 2 after discontinuing inhaled COPD medications and prior the first dose of study treatment At Visit 3, 4 and 5 after withholding the morning dose of study treatment. Pre dose assessment performed prior dosing. Subjects should refrai n from smoking for 1 hour prior to each pulmonary function test. Trough FEV 1measurements for UMC/VI or UMEC on Weeks 4, 12 and 24 (Visits 3, 4 and 5) should be performed 23 hours and 24 hours after the previous day ’s dose of study medication recorded in t he eDiary .

Revised Text : Physical activity monitor (study subset) “Phy sical activity limitation is a common feature of COPD and its measures are highl y related to the degree of disease severity [Watz, 2009]. Reduced physical activity levels in COPD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality , sustained disability , depression, and social and phy sical isolation [ Shu-Yi, 2014; Gimeno, 2014] Improved activity has been identified as an important factor that may modify morbidity and mortality in COPD [ Moy , 2012 ]. The Actigraph GT9X phy sical activity monitor will be used to measure levels of activity . The activity monitor will be worn by up to approximately 150 subjects per treatment arm for 7 day s from Screening ( Visit 1), for 7 days from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 day s from Visit 3 (Week 4) and for 7 day s prior to Week 24 (Visit 5). There will be 4 assessment periods, including a screening assessment in order to provide a reliable estimate of habitual phy sical act ivity. Each subject will be given an activity monitor and instruction leaflet at the start of each assessment period. Further details of distribution, operation and retrieval of the monitors will be provided in the SRM” . Country -specific Protocol A mendmen t 2 for Canada Amendment 02 applies to Canada onl y.

Eligible subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 mcg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA®dry powder inhaler (DPI), or UMEC (62.5 mc g once daily ) administered via the ELLIPTA DPI or salmeterol (50 mcg twice dail y (BID)) administered via the DI SKUS®DPI. Eligible subjects at Screening will enter a run -in period for 4 weeks during which they continue taking their inhaled COPD medications (excluding ICS and an y exclusionary medications). In addition, subjects will be provided with short acting albuterol/sal butamol to be used on as needed basis (rescue medication) throughout the study . Subjects who experience a moderate or severe COPD exa cerbation during the run -in period will be deemed run- in failures. Subjects experiencing a mild exacerbation, defined as worsening of symptoms that requires notreatment with antibiotics or steroids and is self managed b y the patient b y an increase of inh aled rescue medication , will be allowed to continue in the study . At the randomization Visit 2 (Day 1) those subjects who successfull y complete the run- in period as well as meet the other pre -defined eligibility and randomization criteria will discontinue their inhaled COPD medications and will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms for 24 weeks. 2018N377698_00"
215,page_215,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 13All subjects will be given an eDiary for use during the run- in, and treatment period to complete PRO questionnaires and record medical problems experienced d uring the study . Subjects will be performing slow and forced spirometry at specific visits. In addition, a subset of subjects up to 150 per treatment arm will undergo assessment of their phy sical activity measured through a phy sical activity monitor (Acti graph GT9X) worn for 7 day sfrom Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 days from Visit 3, and for 7 day s prior to last clinic Visit (Visit 5).

ICS alone or in combination with a bronchodilator or any exclusionary medications are not allowed. Type and Number of Subjects Approximately 3232 subjects will be screene d, such that 2424 subjects will be randomized and approximately 2181 evaluable subjects complete the study. Analysis The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The null hy pothesis is no difference between treatment groups (H0: μT – μS = 0), with the alternative h ypothesis that there is a difference between treatment groups (H1: μT – μS ≠0), where μ T is the mean change from baseline for UMEC/VI and μS is the mean change from baseline for UMEC. The primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in trough FEV 1at the end of Week 24 will be anal ysed using Mixed Models repeated Measures (MMRM) analy sis. The MMRM analy sis will include measurements at Treatment Weeks 4, 12 and 24. Treatment group (a categorical variable) will be fitted as the explanatory variable with appropriate pre-defined variables, stratum (number of bronchodilators pe r day during run- in) and baseline values, fitted as covariates. Visit (nominal) will be fitted as a categorical variable and visit -by-baseline and visit -by-treatment interaction terms will be included to allow treatment effects to be estimated at each visi t separately. The variance covariance matrix 2018N377698_00"
217,page_217,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 15will be assumed to be unstructured (based on previous experience no issues are expected with fitting models with this matrix structure). The estimated treatment differences between UMEC/VI versus UMEC for each endpoint will be presented with the 95% confidence intervals for the difference and the p -value. 2. INTRODUCTION 2.1. Stud y Rationale Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is associated with poor health- related quality of life (HRQoL). Pharmacologic ther apy is used to improve lung function, reduce symptoms, frequency and severit y of exacerbations, and improve patients HRQoL [GOL D, 2015]. Umeclidinium/Vilanterol (UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg) is indicated for the maintenance tr eatment of COPD that contain long -acting muscarinic antagonist (L AMA) and long -acting beta 2-agonist (L ABA) bronchodilators. Umeclidinium (UMEC) is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve s ymptoms in adult patients with COPD . Salmet erol has long been used for s ymptoms management of COPD. However, a direct comparison of these maintenance therapies has not been conducted with respect to HRQoL. The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjec ts treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The ef fect of UMC/VI , UMEC, and salmeterol with respect to patient HRQoL measured through patient reported outcomes (PROs) questionnaires, sy mptoms and lung function will also be evaluated. 2.2. Brief Ba ckground COPD is characterized by an airflow limitation which is not fully reversible, usually progressive and accompanied by a chronic cough, sputum production and dy spnea which can be a major cause of disability and anxiety associated with the disease [ Maleki -Yazdi , 2014] Furthermore, acute exacerbations contribute to the overall severity of disease as these episodes are accompanied by worsened s ymptoms and are associated with increased decline in lung function and mortality [Wedzicha , 2013; Schmidt , 2014]. Pharmacologic therap y is used to improve lung function, reduce s ymptoms, reduce the frequency and severit y of exacerbations, and also to improve health status and exercise tolerance. Maintenance treatment is recommended primarily through the use of LABAs or LAMAs. COPD treatment guidelines recommend an incremental approach to pharmacological treatment as the disease state worsens, involving the use of combinations of drug classes with different or complementary mechanisms [ GOL D, 2015]. UMEC/VI inhalation powder is a combination of UMEC (umeclidinium bromide), a LAMA, and VI (Vilanterol), a LABA , delivered via the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler 2018N377698_00"
218,page_218,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 16(DPI). UMEC/VI at a dose of 62.5/25mcg once- daily is marketed in the United States (US) and Europe under the trade name ANORO®ELLIPTA. UMEC (62.5 mcg) inhalation powder is marketed in the United States (US) and Europe under the trade name INCRUSE®ELLIPTA. UMEC (62.5mcg) is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with COPD. UMEC (62.5 mcg) improves forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), dyspnea and HRQoL whether used as monotherap y [Trivedi , 2014; Feldman , 2016] or as an add on to fluticasone propionate and vilanterol (FF/VI) [ Siler , 2015 ]. Salmetrol (50 mcg) DISKUS is a long -acting broncholdilator that has long been used for the maintenance treatment of COPD [ Tashkin, 2010]. Clinically important deterioration (CID) is a novel, exploratory composite endpoint which assesses individual deteriorations in lung function and in patient PROs defined by the accepted minimal clinically important difference (MCID), as well as the incidence of moderate to severe exacerbations [ Singh , 2016], (Section 7.3.5 ). CID will be anal ysed to determine whether UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg) therapy provides greater clinical stability as compared with UMEC and salmeterol monotherapies. 3.

STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This is a multi -centre, randomized, double blind, double -dummy , 3-arm parallel group study . Eligible subjects will be stratifi ed based on long -acting bronchodilator usage during the run- in (none, one or 2 long -acting bronchodilators per day ) and randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 mcg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA inhaler, or UMEC (62.5 mcg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA or salmeterol (50 mcg BID) administered via the DISKUS. There will be a total of 5 clinic visits and one follow -up phone call (Visit 6). The Pre - screening Visit (Visit 0) can occur on the same day as the Scree ning Visit (Visit 1) if subject does not take or has not taken an y excluded protocol medications, but must be completed prior to initiating an y Visit 1 procedures. Subjects, who meet all the eligibility criteria at Screening, will enter a run -in period for 4 weeks in order to continue to assess the subject’s eligibility for the stud y. During the run- in period subjects will continue with their inhaled COPD medications (excluding ICS and 2018N377698_00"
221,page_221,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 19any exclusionary medications). I n addition, subjects will be provided with short acting albuterol/sal butamol to be used on as needed basis for relief of COPD s ymptoms (rescue medication) throughout the study . Subjects who experience a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run -in period will be deemed run-in failur es. Subjects who experience a mild COPD exacerbation, defined as worsening of s ymptoms that requires notreatment with antibiotics or steroids and is self managed b y the patient by an increase of inhaled rescue medication , (Appendix 5 ), will be able to continue in the study based on the judgment of the investigator and agreement of the sponsor’s medical monitor. At the randomization Visit 2 (Day 1) those subjects who successfull y complete the run- in period as well as m eet the other pre -defined eligibility and randomization criteria will discontinue their inhaled COPD medications and will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms for 24 weeks. During the run- in and treatment period, subjects will be completing PRO que stionnaires in the eDiary and performing slow and forced spirometry at specific clinic visits. In addition, a subset of subjects up to 150 per treatment arm will undergo assessment of their phy sical activity measured through a phy sical activity monitor (Ac tigraph GT9X) worn for 7 day sfrom Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 days from Visit 3, and for 7 day s prior to last clinic Visit (Visit 5). Concurrent use of COPD maintenance medications including LAMAs, LABAs, oral beta - agonists, theophy llines, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids and L ABA combination and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors will not be allowed during the stud y (Section 6.11.2 ) . The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated throughout the study beginning at Visit 2 (Day 1) and until the follow -up contact (Visit 6). Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected over the same time period as AEs. However, an y SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., study treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK concomitant medication, will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow up contact ( Appendix 4 ). All subjects will be given an electronic diary (eDiary ) for use during the run -in, and the treatment period to complete PRO questionnaires, record COPD daily symptoms, any medical p roblems experienced during the stud y and the time they take their COPD medications. Daily rescue medication usage (number of inhalations taken in the last 24h) will also be captured in the eDiary .

Treatment A rms and Duration Subjects will be stratified based on long-acting bronchodilator usage during the run- in (none, one or 2 long- acting bronchodilators per day) and randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to either UMEC/VI inhalat ion powder (62.5/25 mcg once daily) administered via the ELLIPTA DPI) or UMEC (62.5 mcg once daily ) administered via the ELLIPTA DPI or Salmeterol (50 mcg BID) administered via DISKUS 2018N377698_00"
223,page_223,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 21The total duration of subject participation in the study will be appr oximately 29 to 31 weeks consisting of 2 weeks pre- screening if necessary , 4 weeks run- in, 24 week treatment and one week follow -up. 4.3. Type and Number of Subjects Approximately 3232 will be screened globall y in approximately 205 sites such that approximatel y 2424 subjects will be randomized and approximately 2181 evaluable subjects complete the study . 4.4. Design Justification A randomized, double blinded, parallel group study is a standard, well -established design to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of an inves tigational drug. A salmeterol arm is included to allow a comparison to be made between UMEC/VI , UMEC with salmeterol, a standard practice treatment. The double -dumm y design is appropriate when drugs are of different appearance or different administration regimen which is appropriate in this study where the inhalers used have a different appearance and used once daily and twice dail y. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) COPD Guidelines suggest that duration of 12 to 24 weeks is considered adequate for asses sment of response of COPD sy mptoms to treatment intervention with bronchodilators (EMA COPD guidelines, 2012). The primary endpoint is trough FEV 1 at week 24. This endpoint is generally considered to be a robust, well e stablished and an objective means to show the efficacy of a bronchodilator [ Dahl , 2010; Feldman , 2010]. Other endpoints such SAC TDI , E-RS, SGRQ -C, CAT, Subject Global Rating of Change in global impression of disease severity are captured to allow responder analy ses and to provide comparative data on PROs between the treatment groups. 4.5. Dose Justification This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy of marketed doses of UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg once dail y), UMEC (62.5 mcg once daily ) and salmeterol (50mcg twice daily ) that are approved for the maintenance treatment of COPD, with respect to PRO measures. 4.6. Benefit: Risk A ssessment Summaries of findings from both clinical and non- clinical studies conducted with UMEC/VI and UMEC can be found in the investigator’s brochures (IB) [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2009/00437/07] and [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2006/00835/09] and in the label information sheets. The current safet y profile for UMEC (62.5mcg) and the UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg) based on data available to date, is comparable with other LABAs and LAMAs. Summary safet y data can also be found in the information sheet for salmeterol [ Serevent product information , 2003].The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol: 2018N377698_00"

Cardiovascular effects such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles.Class effects associated with LABAs and LAMA containing therapy. The clinical significance of these ar rhythmias is unknown. Clinical experience with UMEC/VI to date in completed studies did not show any association with major cardiovascular events. Data available in the product label for UMEC/VI Exclusion criteria have been set for subjects with uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease according to the principal investigation’s (PI) opinion where the potential risk may outweigh the benefit. The PI should also determine the clinical significance of abnormal ECG findings at screening and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. Patients with the following abnormalities will be excluded from participation: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate >120bpm, sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or second degree heart block Mobitz type II or third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted). Beta agonists and risk of asthma -related death Long -acting beta agonists such as vilanterol when used alone may increase the risk o f asthma- related death. A placebo -controlled trial with another LABA (salmeterol) showed an increase in asthma -related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol. This finding with salmeterol is considered a class effect of all LABAs, including vilanterol. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by LABA.Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma are excluded from participation in the study. Paradoxical bronchospasm As with other inhaled medicines, U MEC/VI can produce paradoxical bronchospasm which may be life threatening.If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with UMEC/VI, this treatment should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy should be instituted. Use in patients w ith narrow -angle glaucoma or urinary retentionNo association has been found to date, in completed studies with UMEC/VI or UMEC monotherapy, on glaucoma or urinary retention.

Study Procedures Spirometry proced ures This may cause difficulty breathing, changes in pulse rate and blood pressure, coughing, wheezing, chest tightness or fainting.Subjects will be monitored during the procedure for these effects and spirometry will be discontinued should these occur. ECG lead placement This may cause skin irritation. It may be necessary to have small patches (about a centimetre in diameter) of hair on the chest shaved to properly attach electrodes to the chest. Blood sampling procedure (optional pharmacogenetic blood sample)Giving blood may make subjects feel faint, or experience mild pain, bruising, irritation or redness at the site. In rare cases, they may get an infectionSubjects will be monitored during the blood draw for these effects and should call their stud y doctor if any of these effects do not resolve Other Side effects of rescue albuterol/salbutamol.

Benefit A ssessment Subjects will receive single or combination of long -acting bronchodilator therapies approved for maintenance treatment of COPD. Participating subjects in this study will contribute to the process of further characterizing the benefit of these long -acting bronchodilators with respect to PROs and sy mptoms in the treatment of COPD. Specific benefits associated with the study design and procedures include the following: Subjects will receive treatments approved for the treatment of COPD that have been shown to be effective in the population under study All subjects will receive albuterol/salbutamol for use “as needed” for relief of COPD sy mptoms The combination of study procedures of spirometry , CAT, SGRQ, TDI, E-RSwill provide the study subjects with a comprehensive evaluation of their s ymptoms, health status and COPD disease severity . Subjects will also be monitored throughout the s tudy for any worsening of COPD sy mptoms or decline in general health. Finall y smoking cessation counselling will also be provided. 4.6.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in this study, the potential risks identified in association with UMEC/VI , UMEC, salmeterol and with study procedures are justified by the anticipated benefits from active treatments that may be afforded to patients with COPD. 5.

On the other day s during the treatment period (i.e. “non- clinic day s”), s ubjects will be instructed to self -administer their study treatment in the morning and evening. Subjects shou ld enter the time they take their study treatment in the eDiary . Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the blinded study treatment regimens in equal proportion (ratio of 1:1:1): UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg once dail y via ELLIPTA + placebo twice dail y via DISKUS UMEC 62.5 mcg once daily via ELLIPTA + placebo twice dail y via DISKUS Salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily via DI SKUS + placebo once daily via ELLIPTA The randomisation will be stratified based on long-acting bronchodilator usage during the run- in (none, on e or 2 long-acting bronchodilators per day ). Study treatment/investigational product will be dispensed at Visits 2, 3 and 4. In order to ensure subjects have sufficient doses of study treatment, they must return to clinic within 30 day s from V2, 60 and 90 day s from V3 and V4 respectively (see Time and event table Section 7.1). Used study drug and rescue medication will be collected at Visits 3, 4 and 5 or at the Early Withdrawal Visit. 6.4. Planned Dose A djustmen ts No dose adjustment is allowed for this study 6.5. Blinding This will be a double- blind double dummy study and the following will apply . The investigator or treating ph ysician may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency OR i n the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge of the stud y treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject as judged b y the investigator. Investigators have direct access to the subject’s individual stu dy treatment. It is preferred (but not required) that the investigator first contacts the Medical Monitor or appropriate GSK study personnel to discuss options before unblinding the subject’s treatment assignment. If GSK personnel are not contacted befor e the unblinding, the investigator must notify GSK as soon as possible after unblinding, but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded subject, unless that information is important for the safety of subjects currently in the study . 2018N377698_00"
240,page_240,"2016N277425_ 01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 38The d ate and reason for the unblinding must be fully documented in the eCRF A subject will be withdrawn if the subject’s treatment code is unblinded b y the investigator or treating phy sician. GSK’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treatment assignment for an y subject with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a cop y of the report, identifying the subject’s treatment assignment, may be sent to investiga tors in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy . 6.6. Packaging and Labeling The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. 6.7. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability No special preparation of the study treatment is required. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study treatment. Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and onl y authorized site staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure environmentally controlled and monitored (manual or automated) area in ac cordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study treatment accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e. receipt, reconciliation and final disposition records). Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the SRM. All ELLIPTA DPI study treatment should be stored up to 25C (77F). Each All ELLIPTA DPI contains 30 doses and is packaged in a foil pouch with a desiccant sachet and stored in a carton. The inhaler should not be used for more than 30 day s after opening the foil. The sites must maintain a daily temperature log for the investigational product. Salmeterol DI SKUS should be stored up to 25 C. Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study treatment is not expected to pose significant safety risks to site staff . Take adequate precautions to avoid direct ey e or skin contact and the generation of aerosols or mists.

Study Treatment Return All used and unused ELLIPTA and DISKUS inhalers and albuterol/salbutamol will be returned to GSK at the end of the study to be available for disposal. In some instances for sites outside the US, study supplies will be disposed of locall y either b y the site, the country medical department or third -party vendor. Detailed instructions for the return of the study drug can be found in the SRM. Study treatment will be collected at Visit 3, 4 and 5 or at the Earl y Withdrawal Visit, if applicable. For an y ELLIPTA or DISKUS inhaler that fails to function properly , the subject should return to the clinic as soon as possible to obtain a new inhaler. The site will contact the RAMOS NG to obtain a new treatment pack number for the subject and dispense a new study treatment kit from the site’s investigational product supply as instructed by the RAMOS NG In addition, any ELLIPTA that fails to function properly must be identified and returned to GSK for testing. 6.8. Compliance with Study Treatment A dministration When subjects self- administer study treatment(s) at home , compliance with study treatment(s) will be assessed through querying the subject during the site visits and through stud y drug compliance assessed at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 documented in the source documents and eCRF. A record of the number of ELLIPTA and DISKU S dispensed and the number of doses inhaled by each subject must be maintained and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates, including dates for treatment delay s if any will also be recorded in the eCRF. Compl iance with the ELLIPTA inhaler will be determined by reviewing the dose counter on the ELLIPTA. Compliance with the study DISKUS will be determined by reviewing the dose counter on the DISKUS. Subjects should be ≥80% to ≤120% compliant on taking stud y me dication between each pair of on- treatment visits. Subjects who fall outside this range should be re -educated on treatment compliance b y their site. This re - education should be documented in the subject’s source document. If medication compliance repeate dly falls outside of acceptable ranges, the study sponsor/site monitor must be contacted to discuss subject eligibility for continued participation in the study . 6.9. Treatment of Study Treatment Overdose An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total doses described in Section 6.1and Section 6.8which results in clinical signs and s ymptoms. These should be recorded b y the investigator on the AE/SAE pages. In th e event of an overdose of study medication, the investigator should use clinical judgment in treating the overdose and contact the study Medical Monitor. 2018N377698_00"

Pre-screening Visit During the Pre -screening Visit, the study designated personnel must provide informed consent to the study participant. Subjects can perform the Pre- screening Visit (Visit 0) up to 2 weeks prior to or on the same day as the Screening Visit (Visit 1) if subject does not take or has not taken any protocol excluded medications. Modification of the subject’s medications prior to study participation is based on the physician’s judgment according to sound medical practice, principles, and each subject’s needs. A subject’s treatment must not be changed merel y for the purpose of enabling the subject’s participation in the study . A subject number will be assigned at the time the informed consent form (ICF) is signed. No study related procedures may be performed until the informed consent form document has been signed by the subject. Once the informed consent is signed and if requir ed, changes can be made to the subject’s current medication regimen. The investigator should exercise clinical judgment, and is discouraged from changing medications only for the purpose of the clinical study .

It is requested that questionnaires are completed before an y procedures are performed on the subject. All questio nnaires will be completed using the eDiary at clinic and at home. Adequate time should be allowed to complete all items of the questionnaires and the questionnaires must be reviewed b y the investigator or designated study staff for completeness and, if necessary , the subject must be encouraged to complete any missing items. Where more than one questionnaire is to be completed at a visit the order should be as follows: 1.Baseline d yspnea index (Visit 2) then Transient dy spnea index at subsequent visits 2. Patien t global rating of COPD severit y and global rating of change in COPD 3.St George’s respiratory questionnaire 4.

Self A dministered Computerised Baseline Dy spnea Index/T ransitional Dyspnea Index (SA C BDI/TDI) The BD I is used to measure the severity of d yspnea in patients at baseline. The TDI measures changes in the patient’s dyspnea from baseline. The self -administered computerized version of the BDI/TDI (SAC BDI/TDI)[ Mahler , 2004] is used to measure severit y of d yspnea in patients at baseline (SAC BDI) on Day 1 (Visit 2) of treatment and change from the baseline (SAC TDI) at Week 4, 12 and 24 (Visits 3, 4 and 5). The 2018N377698_00"
251,page_251,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 49scores in both indexes depend on ratings for three different categories: functional impairment; magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. SAC BDI/TDI should be completed before performing spirometry . The SAC BDI/TDI was developed to address issues of potential bias in the interviewer administered (original) BDI /TDI [ Mahler , 1984]. The SAC BDI/TDI provides a standardized approach to the measurement of d yspnea, equivalent to the original BDI/TDI with advantages over the interview er method for grading d yspnea in patients with COPD by standardizing the process for each patient and eliminating individual judgment required b y the interviewers when completing the original BDI/TDI. This also removes the need for the same investigator to conduct all interviews with a subject based on the patient’s responses. SAC TDI provides a continuous measure of change in dy spnea using a visual analogue scale to record responses. Details for the completion of the SAC BDI/TDI are provided in the SRM. 7.3.1.2. SGRQ-C The St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease specific (SGRQ -C) will be completed by subjects at Randomisation (V2, Day 1), at Week 4, 12 and 24 or at the Early Withdrawal Visit (where applicable). The SGRQ- C [Meguro , 2007] is a well established, disease -specific questionnaire. It was designed to measure the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on a COPD patient’s HRQoL. As well as producing an overall summary score, sco res for the individual domains of symptoms, activity and impacts are also produced. It has been used in studies of COPD subjects and has been translated and validated for use in most major languages. The SGRQ- C is derived from the original SGRQ, and prod uces scores equivalent to the SGRQ instrument [ Meguro , 2007]. 7.3.1.3. COPD A ssessment Test (CA T) The COPD Assessment Test [ Jones, 2009, Jones, 2012] is a validated, short and simple patient completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD. The CAT is an 8- item questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients dia gnosed with COPD. When completing the questionnaire, subjects rate their experience on a 6 -point scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment) with a scoring range of 0 -40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. The CAT will be c ompleted in the eDiary by subjects at Screening Visit 1 and Randomisation Visit 2 to assess their eligibility to enter the stud y. CAT is also completed at Weeks 4, 12 and 24 . Additional instructions for completion of the CAT are provided in the SRM. 2018N377698_00"
252,page_252,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 507.3.1.4. EXACT and the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms -COPD (E -RS: COPD) EXACT -PRO is a 14 item patient reported outcome instrument designed to capture information on the occurrence, frequency , severity , and duration of exacerbations of disease in patients with COPD [ Leidy, 2011]. EXACT captures information on the severit y of the respiratory and s ystemic manifestations of a COPD exacerbation as reported b y the patient. The instrument is to be completed daily (typically 2 hrs before bedtime) using the electronic diary . The daily recording of information allows an assessment of the underlying day to day variability of a patient's s ymptoms and facilitates the detection of s ymptom worsening indicative of a COPD exacerbation. The tot al score for EXACT ranges from 0 -100. The entire instrument is intended to be completed in about 3 minutes or less (typically the time required for completion decreases as the patient becomes more familiar with the tool and the electronic diary ). The E- RS: COPD consists of 11 items from the 14 item EXACT instrument [ Leidy, 2014]. E -RS: COPD is intended to capture information related to the respiratory symptoms of COPD, i.e. breathlessness, cough, sputum production, ch est congestion and chest tightness. The E -RS: COPD has a scoring range of 0 -40 higher scores indicate more severe s ymptoms. Three subscales of the E -RS are used to describe different s ymptoms; dy spnea, cough and sputum and chest sy mptoms. The EXACT questi onnaire will be completed b y subjects in the eDiary , at home every night throughout the entire study , starting from Screening V1 7.3.1.5. Subject Global Rating of COPD Severity and Global Rating of Change in COPD Subjects will complete the Global Rating of COPD Se verity at Randomization Visit 2 and visits 3, 4 and 5 or Early Withdrawal Visit. This single global question will ask subjects to rate their severity of COPD on a four point scale (mild, moderate, severe, and very severe). This question should be used im mediately before the patient completes other visit specific questionnaires but after completion of SAC TDI questionnaire. Subjects will also complete a Global Rating of Change in COPD (overall disease) question at Visits 3, 4 and 5 or Earl y Withdrawal Vis it. Response options will be on a 7 point L ikert scale ranging from much better to much worse. Completing the question at each Visit allows for early detection of response as well as continued response. 7.3.2. Spirometry Spirometry measurements will be obtained using spirometry equipment that meets or exceeds the minimal performance recommendations of the ATS [ Miller , 2005]. All sites will use standardized spirometry equipment provided by an external vendor. 2018N377698_00"
253,page_253,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 51All subjects wi ll have spirometry performed at Screening to assess eligibility (see Section 7.2.2.1 ) and at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 during the treatment period. For FEV1and FVC determinations, at least 3 acceptable spirometry efforts (with no more than 8) should be obtained. Acceptable spirometry efforts should have a satisfactory start of test and end of test (i.e. a plateau in the volume time curve) and be free from artifacts due to cough, early termination, poor effort, obstructed mouthpiece, equipment malfunction, or other reasons [ Miller , 2005]. The largest FEV1and FVC from the 3 acceptable efforts should be recorded, even if they do not come from the same effort. Spirometry for FEV 1and FVC assessments that is not obtained as follows will be considered a protocol deviation: Started between 6:00AM and 11:00AM. After withholding albuterol/salbutamol (all visits) for ≥4 hours At Screening Visit 1, after wash out of medications as specified in the exclusion criteria in Section 5.2(Concomitant Medications). At Screening Visit 1, before the morning dose of usual COPD medications At Visit 2 after discontinuing inhaled COPD medications and prior the first dose of study treatment At Visit 3, 4 and 5 after withholding the morning dose of study treatment. Pre dose assessment performed prior dosing. Subjects should refrain from smoking for 1 hour prior to each pulmonary function test. Trough FEV 1measure ments for UMC/VI or UMEC on Weeks 4, 12 and 24 (Visits 3, 4 and 5) should be performed 23 hours and 24 hours after the previous day ’s dose of study medication recorded in the eDiary . This will also provide trough FEV 1measurements for the evening dose of s almeterol. 7.3.3. Inspiratory capacity (IC) Inspiratory capacit y (IC) is the volume of gas that can be taken into the lungs in a normal and full inhalation. Starting from the resting inspiratory position it is equal to the tidal volume plus the inspiratory reser ve volume. IC has been widel y used to assess static and dynamic h yperinflation in patients with COPD. IC will be measured b y spirometry prior to forced manoeuvres pre -dose at Visits 2 (30 and 5 min prior to dosing) and at trough at Visits 3, 4, and 5 (23 and 24 hrs post dosing on the previous day ). For I C determination the average of at least three acceptable manoeuvres should be recorded. Subjects should be tested while sitting, relaxed and wearing a nose clip. They should be asked to breathe regularl y for several breaths until the end- expiratory lung volume is stable (this usually requires at least three tidal manoeuvres) then urged to take a deep breath to Total L ung Capacit y (TLC) with no hesitation. 2018N377698_00"
254,page_254,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 52Spirometry for IC determination done in conjunction with FEV 1and FVC assessments that is not obtained as follows will be considered a protocol deviation: Started between 6:00AM and 11:00AM. After withholding albuterol/salbutamol (all visits) ≥4 hours At Visit 2 after discontinuation of run -in medication At Visit 3, 4 and 5 after withholding the morning dose of study drug 7.3.4. COPD Exacerbation A mild exacerbation is defined as worsening of s ymptoms that require no treatment with antibiotics or steroids, and is self managed b y the patient by an increase of inhaled rescue medications. A moderate COPD exacerbation is defined as worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral/sy stemic co rticosteroids and/or antibiotics. A severe exacerbation is defined as worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require in- patient hospitalization or emergency room for longer than 24 hrs. If a subject experiences a mild, moderate or severe COPD exacerbation, the COPD exacerbation page of the eCRF should be completed. COPD exacerbations should not be recorded as an AE, unless they meet the definition of a SAE. Details of COPD exacerbation identification, categorization and treatment guidelines are described in Appendix 5 . Subjects who experience a mild exacerbation during the run- in period will not be withdrawn from the study. However, Subjects who experience moderate or severe exacerbation during the run -in period will be withdr awn from the study and will not be allowed to be re -screened. Subjects who experience a mild, moderate or severe exacerbation during the treatment period, will notbe withdrawn from the study unless the investigator or GSK medical monitor think it is best for the patient to withdraw from the study. Signs and s ymptoms of COPD included on the electronic diary cards will not be considered AEs and will not be recorded in the eCRF. The time period for collection of COPD exacerbations will be from the Pre -Screen ing (Visit 0) until completion of the follow -up contact. If a subject experiences a COPD exacerbation from the time the I CF is signed until randomization, summary information (yes/no status question) will be collected in the eCRF. COPD exacerbations after randomization through follow -up will be recorded on the COPD exacerbation page of the eCRF. 7.3.5. Clinically important deterioration (CID) Clinically important deterioration (CID) is a composite endpoint defined as: A decrease of 100 mL from baseline in trou gh FEV 1 2018N377698_00"
255,page_255,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 53A deterioration in HRQoL defined as 4 units increase from baseline in SGRQ The occurrence of an on -treatment moderate/severe COPD exacerbation In addition, this study will explore CAT and TDI PROs as part of the composite endpoint. 7.3.6. Rescue albuter l/salbutamol use Subjects will record the number of dail y albuterol/salbutemol puffs they use in the eDiary . In addition, in some countries and selected sites the number of puffs will be collected through the eMDI device (Section 6.2) 7.3.7. Physical activity monitor (study subset) Physical activity limitation is a common feature of COPD and its measures are highl y related to the degree of disease severity [Watz , 2009]. Reduced phy sical activity levels in COPD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality , sustained disability , depression, and social and phy sical isolation [ Shu-Yi, 2014; Gimeno, 2014] Improved activity has been identified as an important factor that may modify morbidity and mortality in COPD [ Moy , 2012 ]. The Actigraph GT9X phy sical activity monitor will be used to measure levels of activity . The activity monitor will be worn by up to approximately 150 subjects per treatment arm for 7 day s from Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 day s from Visit 3 (Week 4) and for 7 day s prior to Week 24 (Visit 5). There will be 4 assessment periods, including a screening assessment in order to provide a reliable estimate of habitual phy sical activity . Each subject will be given an activity monitor and instruction leaflet at the start of each assessment period. Further details of distrib ution, operation and retrieval of the monitors will be provided in the SRM . 7.4. Safet y Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1) Safety endpoint includes: Incidence of adverse events 7.4.1.

Time period and Frequency for collecting A E and SA E information Any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol- mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow -up contact. AEs will be collected from the start of Study Treatment until the follow -up contact (see Sectio n 7.4.1.3 ), at the timepoints specified in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent may be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to GSK within 24 hours, as indicated in (Appendix 4 , Section 12.4.6 ) Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify GSK. NOTE: The method of recording, evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to GSK are provided in (Appendix 4 , Section 12.4.4 to Section 12.4.6 ) 7.4.1.2. Method of Detecting AEs a nd SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact  “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since y our last visit/contact? 7.4.1.3. Follo w-up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non -serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 4.6.1 ) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 5.5). 2018N377698_00"

Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in (Section 12.4.3) and all deaths, whether or not they are consid ered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non- cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 7.4.1.6. Disease- Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es The following disease related events (DREs) are common in subjects with COPD and can be serious/life threatening: COPD exacerbation COPD exacerbations are associated with the disease to be studied and will not be recorded as AEs unless the exacerbation meet s the definition of a ‘serious’ AE. Exacerbations that meet the definition of ‘serious’ AEs will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF section and should be reported to GSK for all subjects regardless of whether or not they are randomized to study medication . Signs and s ymptoms of COPD included on the electronic diary will not be considered AEs and will not be recorded in the eCRF 7.4.1.7. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to GSK of SAEs related to study treatment (even for non -interventional post -marketing studies) is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of subjects and the safety of a product under clinical investigation are met. GSK has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authorit y and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. GSK will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Instituti onal Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and investigators. 2018N377698_00"
258,page_258,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 56Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with the IB and will notify the I RB/IEC, if appropriate accord ing to local requirements. 7.4.2. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female subjects will be collected after the start of Screening and until the follow -up contact. If a pregnancy is reported then the investigator should inform GSK within 2 weeks of learnin g of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 7 . 7.4.3.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) A Single 12- lead ECG will be obtained at Screening using an ECG machine provided by the investigational site that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. The 12- lead ECG measurement and rh ythm strip (10 seconds) will be obtained before spirometry testing. ECG measurement should be obtained after subjects have rested for approximately 5 minutes then the subjects should be placed in the supine position for the ECG m easurements. An ECG is only required at Screening Visit 1 for eligibility assessment only . The investigator, a designated sub -investigator, or other appropriatel y trained site personnel will be responsible for performing and interpreting the 12 -lead ECG at Screening Visit 1. The investigator must provide his/her dated signature on the original paper tracing, attesting to the authenticity of the ECG machine interpretation. 7.5.

Hypotheses The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjects tre ated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The null hy pothesis is no difference between treatment groups (H0: μT – μS = 0), with the alternative h ypothesis that there is a difference between treatment groups (H1: μT – μS ≠0), where μ T is the mean change from baseline for UMEC/VI and μS is the mean change from baseline for UMEC. 9.2. Sample Size Considerations The pr imary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. As an important aim of the study is to compare UMEC/VI, UMEC and salmeterol with respect to HRQoL the sample size has been calculated to provide sufficient power for the comparison of the pr imary and secondary endpoint TDI , at Week 24. The sample size calculations use a two -sided 5% significance level and an estimate of between subject standard deviation for TDI of 2.94 units. The estimate of SD is based on DB2113373 [ Donohue , 2013], a study which consisted of treatment arms of UMEC/VI 62.5/25, UMEC 62.5 VI (Vilanterol) 25mcg and placebo and is the value at Day 168 in a subgroup of subjects who were ICS free at screening. Based on these data, 727 eva luable subjects per treatment arm will be required to provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference if the true difference is 0.5 units, ½ the MCI D, between UMEC/VI and UMEC. The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statis tically significant difference between treatment groups is 0.31 units. With this number of evaluable subjects per arm, the study will have >99% power assuming a true treatment difference of 80mL between UMEC/VI and UMEC for trough FEV1 at 24 weeks at the two-sided 5% significance level. This calculation uses a SD for trough FEV1 of 240mL, based on prior results for trials comparing dual bronchodilators versus single bronchodilators ( Donohue , 2013; Bateman , 2013). The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statistically significant difference between treatment groups is 25mL . 2018N377698_00"
260,page_260,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 58In order to account a for a 10% withdrawal rate , approximately 808 subjects per treatment arm will be randomised. 9.2.1.

Key Elements of A nalysis Plan Treatment Comparisons The primary treatment comparison of UMEC/VI with UMEC will be performed on the ITT population. The other treatment comparisons of UMEC/VI and UMEC with Salmeterol will be performed on the ITT population and ITT ICS free population. 9.4.1. Primary Analyses The treatment comparison of primary interest will be UMEC/VI versus UMEC for the primary endpoint of change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The primary analyses will be performed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) anal ysis and will be based on a two -sided hy pothesis testing approach on the ITT Population. In order to account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and endpoints, a step- down closed testing procedure will be applied whereb y inference for secondary and other endpoints or treatment comparisons are dependent upon statistical significance having been achieved for the primary comparison. If the primary comparison is signi ficant i.e. the associated p-value for UMEC/VI versus UMEC for change from baseline in trough FEV1 at Week 24 is below 0.05, this will allow inference of treatment comparisons (UMEC/VI versus UMEC on all other endpoints, and UMEC/VI versus Salmeterol and UMEC versus Salmeterol on all endpoints including the primary endpoint), which will be declared statistically significant if the associated p -value is below 0.05. 2018N377698_00"
262,page_262,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 60There will be 2 anal yses one for one for the German Federal Joint Committee (G -BA) and one f or the rest of the world (ROW). The step-down closed testing procedure onl y applies to the ROW. For the G -BA statistical inference for secondary and other endpoints or treatment comparisons will not be conditional on achieving statistical significance of the primary comparison. The primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 at the end of Week 24 and secondary endpoint change from baseline in TDI score at Week 24 will both be analysed using MMRM analy sis. The MMRM analy sis for change fro m baseline in trough FEV1 and TDI will include measurements at Treatment Weeks 4, 12 and 24. Treatment group (a categorical variable) will be fitted as the explanatory variable with appropriate pre -defined variables, stratum (number of bronchodilators per day during run-in) and baseline values, fitted as covariates. Visit (nominal) will be fitted as a categorical variable and visit- by-baseline and visit -by-treatment interaction terms will be included to allow treatment effects to be estimated at each visit separatel y. The variance covariance matrix will be assumed to be unstructured (based on previous experience no issues are expected with fitting models with this matrix structure). While missing data are not explicitly imputed in the primary MMRM analy ses,there is an underl ying assumption that the data are missing at random. The estimated treatment differences between UMEC/VI versus UMEC for each endpoint will be presented with the 95% confidence intervals for the difference and the p -value. Full details of the analy ses to be performed on all primary endpoints will be given in the RAP. 9.4.2. Other A nalyses The MMRM anal ysis will be repeated for the ITT ICS free population. Estimated differences between UMEC/VI or UMEC and Salmeterol will be presented together w ith 95% confidence intervals (CI s) for the difference and p- values. Secondary and other efficacy endpoints and treatment comparisons will be adjusted for multiplicity as per Section 9.4.1 . Full details of the an alyses to be performed on the other efficacy endpoints will be given in the RAP. Safety Analyses Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the standard GSK dictionary , Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and grouped by body system. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one AE of an y type, AEs within each bod y system and AEs within each preferred term will be presented for each treatment group. Separate summaries will be provided for all AEs, drug related AEs, fatal AEs, non -fatal SAEs, AESI s and AEs leading to withdrawal. 2018N377698_00"

275,page_275,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 7312.3. Appendix 3: Genetic Research Genetics –Background Naturall y occurring genetic variation may contribute to inter -individual variability in response to medicines, as well as an individual's risk of developing specific diseases. Genetic factors associated with disease characteristics may also be associated with response to therap y, and could help to explain some clinical study outcomes. For example, genetic variants associated with age- related macular degeneration (AMD) are reported to account for much of the risk for the condition [ Gorin , 2012] with certain variants reported to in fluence treatment response [ Chen, 2012]. Thus, knowledge of the genetic etiology of disease may better inform understanding of disease and the development of medicines. Additionally , genetic variability may impact the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination), or pharmacod ynamics (relationship between concentration and pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) of a specific medicine and/or clinical outcomes (efficac y and/or safet y) observed in a clinical study. Genetic Research Objectives and A nalyses The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate the relationship between genetic variants and: Response to medicine, including an y concomitant medicines; COP D susceptibility , severity , and progression of related conditions Genetic data may be generated while the study is underway or following completion of the study . Genetic evaluations may include focused candidate gene approaches and/or examination of a la rge number of genetic variants throughout the genome (whole genome analyses). Genetic anal yses will utilize data collected in the study and will be limited to understanding the objectives highlighted above. Analy ses may be performed using data from multip le clinical studies to investigate these research objectives. Planned anal yses and results of genetic investigations will be reported either as part of the clinical RAP and study report, or in a separate genetics RAP and report, as appropriate. Study Popul ation Any subject who is enrolled in the study can participate in genetic research. Any subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from the genetic research. Study Assessments and Procedures A key component of successful genetic research is the collection of samples during clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori hypothesis has been identified, may enable future genetic anal yses to be conducted to help understand variability in disease and medicine response. 2018N377698_00"
276,page_276,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 74A 6 ml blood sample will be taken for Deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. A blood sample is collected at the baseline visit, after the subject has been randomized and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collecti on and shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory manual. The DNA from the blood sample may undergo quality control analy ses to confirm the integrit y of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality of the sample, then the sam ple may be destroy ed. The blood sample is taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to an inabilit y to utilize the original sample. The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same stud y specific number used to label o ther samples and data in the study . This number can be traced or linked back to the subject by the investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or social security number). Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 y ears after the last subject completes the study , or GSK may destroy the samples sooner. GSK or those working with GSK (for example, other researchers) will only use samples collected from the study for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form. Samples may be used as part of the development of a companion diagnostic to support the GSK medicinal product. Subjects can request their sample to be destro yed at any time. Informed Consent Subjects who do not w ish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study . Genetic informed consent must be obtained prior to any blood being taken. Subject Withdrawal from Study If a subject who has consented to participate in genetic research withdr aws from the clinical study for any reason other than being lost to follow -up, the subject will be given a choice of one of the following options concerning the genetic sample, if already collected: Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA sample is retained Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy the genetic DNA sample If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for an y reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within the timeframe specified b y GSK and maintain the documentation in the site study records . Genoty pe data may be generated during the study or after completion of the study and may be anal yzed during the study or stored for future anal ysis. 2018N377698_00"
277,page_277,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 75If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research and genot ype data has not been analyzed, it will not be analy zed or used for future research. Genetic data that has been anal yzed at the time of withdr awn consent will continue to be stored and used, as appropriate. Screen and Baseline Failures If a sample for genetic research has been collected and it is determined that the subject does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the study , then t he investigator should instruct the subject that their genetic sample will be destro yed. No forms are required to complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample reconciliation process. In this instance a sample destruction form will not be available to include in the site files. Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality of Subject’s Genetic Data GSK may summarize the genetic research results in the clinical study report, or separately and may publish the results in sci entific journals. GSK may share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific understanding in alignment with the informed consent. GSK does not inform the subject, family members, insurers, or employ ers of individual genoty ping result s that are not known to be relevant to the subject’s medical care at the time of the study , unless required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic studies is generally preliminary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific validity of the results are undetermined. Further, data generated in a research laboratory may not meet regulatory requirements for inclusion in clinical care. 2018N377698_00"

Definition of A dverse Events Adverse Event Definition: An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an yunfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Events meeting AE definition include: Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions dete cted or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected over dose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae). ""Lack o f efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SA E. Events NOT meeting definition of an AE include: Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than ex pected for the subject’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 2018N377698_00"

Definition of Serious A dverse Events If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for sign s/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease, etc). Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalizat ion” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in disability/incapacity NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 2018N377698_00"

These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse g. Is associated with liver injury andimpaired liver function defined as: ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin*2xUL N (>35% direct), or ALT 3xULN and INR**> 1.5. * Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available; if unavailable, measure urinary bilirubin via dipstick. I f fractionation is unavailable and ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin  2xULN, then the event is still to be reported as an SAE. ** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants. If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be recorded on the SAE form. 12.4.3. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension 2018N377698_00"

Recording of A Es and SA Es AEs and SAE Recording: When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the respons ibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the CRF It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK, AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this instance, all subj ect identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission of to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinic al information. I n such cases, the diagnosis will be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms. Subject -completed Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaires and the collection of AE data are independent components of the study . Respon ses to each question in the Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaire will be treated in accordance with standard scoring and statistical procedures detailed b y the scale’s developer. The use of a single question from a multidimensional health survey to de signate a cause -effect relationship to an AE is inappropriate. 12.4.5. Evaluating AEs and SA Es Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and will assign it to one of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. 2018N377698_00"
282,page_282,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 80Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal every day activities Severe: An e vent that prevents normal every day activities. -an AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined a s ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre- defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative ca uses, such as natural history of the underly ing diseases, concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator Br ochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE data collection tool accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determinin g regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate as fully as possib le the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health 2018N377698_00"

Subjects with worsening respiratory symptoms will be classified as having: A mild/moderate/severe exacerbation and/or pneumonia OR A Lower Respiratory Tract I nfection (L RTI) 2018N377698_00"
285,page_285,"2016N277425_01 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 83Background variability of COPD A non- respiratory related disease Other respiratory related disease 12.5.2. COPD Exacerbation Severity Each COPD exacerbation will be categorized based on severit y as follows: Moderate : Worsening sy mptoms of COPD that require treat ment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. Severe : Worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require treatment with in -patient hospitalization or 24 hrs in the emergency room. Every effort should be made to conduct a chest x- ray within 48 hours of identification of a moderate or severe exacerbation. Details of an exacerbation should be recorded in the exacerbation page of the eCRF. However, exacerbations should not be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF unless they meet the definition of an SAE. (Pneumonia must be recorded in the AE or SAE section of the eCRF and on the Pneumonia page of the eCRF.) Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections will not be considered a COPD exacerbation unless the subject exper iences worsening s ymptoms of COPD which match the definition of an exacerbation as given above. 12.5.3. Treatment of COPD Exacerbations All medications used for the treatment of exacerbations must be recorded in the source documents and the exacerbation page of th e eCRF. All sites should follow the protocol treatment guidelines (as outlined below), but an y medications deemed medically necessary may be used to treat a COPD exacerbation. However, caution is advised in using a LABA or LAMA to treat a subject currentl y taking IP as these additional medications may increase the risk of overdose. If necessary the PI or other health care personnel may stop the subject’s IP temporaril y in order to treat the COPD exacerbation. 12.5.4. Guidelines for Treatment with Corticosteroids If in the opinion of the Investigator/treating ph ysician the exacerbation is severe enough to warrant the need for oral or sy stemic corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) the following guidelines should be used. The duration of treatment with oral/s ystemic corticosteroids should be 14 day s (dose and t ype according to local practice) The duration of treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids should not exceed 14 days unless approval is given by the sponsor or representative Any course of oral/s ystemic corticosteroids started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation 2018N377698_00"

Guidelines for Treatment with A ntibiotics If there is evidence of respiratory infection that in the opinion of the Investig ator or treating ph ysician warrants the need for antibiotics the following guidelines should be followed: The duration of treatment with antibiotics should not exceed 14 day s (dose and ty pe according to local practice). If first line antibiotic treatment f ails and additional antibiotics are used, the total duration of antibiotic treatment should not exceed 30 days unless approval is given by the sponsor or representative Any course of antibiotics started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections is not considered a COPD exacerbation unless the subject experiences worsening of sy mptoms of COPD 12.5.6. Onset and Resolution o f COPD Exacerbations For each mild, moderate and severe exacerbation, the date of onset and the date of resolution will be recorded in the study source documents and eCRF. The date of onset is the first day (of at least 2 consecutive day s) of worsening s ymptoms of COPD as described in Section 12.5.1. The date of resolution should be based on when the Investigator and/or subject determines that the COPD sy mptoms have returned to pre -exacerbation levels or to a new baseline. In determining this resolution date, consideration should be given to diary recorded s ymptoms and/or study subject evaluation. 12.5.7. Guideline for assessing multiple mild exacerbations Two mild exacerbations can be combined into one, per the Investig ator’s judgement, if a subject’s diary reveals that the two mild COPD exacerbations are separated by no more than three exacerbation free day s. 12.5.8. Guideline for assessing exacerbations that increase in severity If an exacerbation starts off as mild, but becom es moderate or severe or starts off as moderate and becomes severe, the exacerbation should be captured as one exacerbation and classified b y its highest level of severity. 2018N377698_00"

Definitions of a Medical Device Incident The detection and documentation procedures described in this protocol apply to all GSK medical devices provided for use in the stud y (see Section 6.2 for the list of GSK m edical devices). Medical Device Incident Definition: Incident –Any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directl y or indirectly , mig ht lead to or might have led to the death of a patient/user/other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The non- occurrence of such a result might have been due t o other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of health care personnel. It is sufficient that:  an incident associated with a device happened and  the incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious deterioration in he alth.  A serious deterioration in state of health can include:  life-threatening illness  permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to a bod y structure  a condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above  fetal distress, fetal death or any congenital abnormality or birth defects Examples of incidents a patient, user, care giver or professional is injured as a result of a medical device failure or its misuse a patient’s treatment is interrupted or compromised b y a medical device failure misdiagnosis due to medical device failure leads to inappropriate treatment a patient’s health deteriorates due to medical device failure 2018N377698_00"

All sites will use standardized spirometry equipment provided by an external vendor. All subjects will have spirometry performed at Screening to assess eligibility (see Section 7.2.2.1) and at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 during the treatment period. For FEV1and FVC determinations, at least 3 acceptable spirometry efforts (with no more than 8) should be obtained. Acceptable spirometry efforts should have a satisfactory start of test and end of test (i.e. a plateau in the volume time curve) and be free from artifacts due to cough, early termination, poor effort, obstructed mouthpiece, equipment malfunction, or other reasons [ Miller , 2005]. The largest FEV1and FVC from the 3 ac ceptable efforts should be recorded, even if they do not come from the same effort.

Revised Text : Physical activity monitor (study subset) “Phy sical activity limitation is a common feature of COPD and its measures are highl y related to the degree of disease severity [Watz, 2009]. Reduced ph ysical activity leve ls in COPD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality , sustained disability , depression, and social and phy sical isolation [ Shu-Yi, 2014; Gimeno, 2014] Improved activity has been identified as an important factor that may modify morbidity and mortality in COPD [ Moy , 2012 ]. The Actigraph GT9X phy sical activity monitor will be used to measure levels of activity . The activity monitor will be worn by up to approximately 150 subjects per treatment arm for 7 day s from Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 day s from Visit 3 (Week 4) and for 7 day s prior to Week 24 (Visit 5). There will be 4 assessment periods, including a screening assessment in order to provide a reliable estimate of habitual phy sical activity . Each subject will be given an activity monitor and instruction leaflet at the start of each assessment period. Further details of distribution, operation and retrieval of the monitors will be provided in the SRM” . 2018N377698_00"

Eligible subjects will be r andomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 mcg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA®dry powder inhaler (DPI) , or UMEC ( 62.5 mcg once daily ) administered via the ELLIPTA DPI or salmeterol (50 mcg twice dail y (BID) ) administered via the DI SKUS®DPI. Eligible subjects at Screening will enter a run- in period for 4 weeks during which they continue taking their inhaled COPD medications (excluding ICS and any exclusionary medications) . In addition ,subjects will be provided with shor t acting albuterol/salmeterol to be used on as needed basis (rescue medication) throughout the study . Subjects who experience a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run- in period will be deemed run- in failures.

ICS alone or in combination with a bronchodilator or any exclusionary medications are not allowed. Type and Number of Subjects Approximately 3232 subjects will be screened, such that 2424 subjects will be randomized and approximately 2181 evaluable subjects complete the stud y. Analysis The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The null hypothesis is no difference between treatment groups (H0: μT – μS = 0), with the alternative h ypothesis that there is a difference between treatment groups (H1: μT – μS ≠0), where μ T is the mean change from baseline for UMEC/VI and μS is the mean change from baseline for UMEC. The primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in trough FEV 1at the end of Week 24 will be anal ysed using Mixed Models repeated Measures ( MMRM) analysis. The MMRM analy sis will include measurements at Treatment Weeks 4, 12 and 24. Treatment group (a categorical variable) will be fitted as the explanatory variable with appropriate pre-defined variables, stratum (number of bronchodilators per day during run- in) and baseline values, fitted as covariates. Visit (nominal) will be fit ted as a categorical variable and visit -by-baseline and visit -by-treatment interaction terms will be included to allow treatment effects to be estimated at each visit separatel y.

Pharmacologic therap y is used to improve lung function, reduce symptoms, frequency and severit y of exacerbati ons, and improve patients HRQoL [GOL D, 2015]. Umeclidinium/Vilanterol (UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg )is indicated for the maintenance treatment of COPD that contain long- acting muscarinic antagonist (L AMA) and long -acting beta 2-agonist (L ABA) bronchodilators. Umeclidinium (UME C)is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve s ymptoms in adult patients with COPD . Salmeterol has long been used fo r symptoms management of COPD. However, a direct comparison of these maintenance therapies has not been conducted with respect to HRQoL . The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. The ef fect of UMC/VI , UMEC, and s almeterol with respect to patient HRQoL measured through patient reported outcomes (PRO s)questionnaires, sy mptoms and lung function will also be evaluated. 2.2. Brief Background COPD is characterized by an airflow limitation which is not fully reversible, usua lly progressive and accompanied by a chronic cough, sputum production and dy spnea which can be a major cause of disability and anxiety associated with the disease [ Maleki -Yazdi , 2014] Furthermore, acute exacerbat ions contribute to the overall severity of disease as these episodes are accompanied by worsened s ymptoms and are associated with increased decline in lung function and mortality [Wedzicha , 2013;Schmidt , 2014 ]. Pharmacologic therap y is used to improve lung function, reduce s ymptoms, reduce the frequency and severit y of exacerbations, and also to improve health status and exercise tolerance. Maintenance treatment is recommended primarily through the use of LABAs or LAMAs .COPD treatment guidelines recommend an incremental approach to pharmacological treatment as the disease state worsens, involving the use of combinations of drug classes with different or comp lementary mechanisms [ GOL D, 2015]. UMEC/VI inhalation p owder is a combination of UMEC (umeclidinium bromide) , a LAMA, and VI (V ilanterol) , a LABA, delivered via the ELLIPTA®dry powder inhaler (DPI). UMEC/VI at a dose of 62.5/25mcg once- daily is marketed in the United States (US) and Europe under the trade name ANORO®ELLIPTA®. UMEC (62.5 mcg) inhalation powder is marketed in the United States (US) and Europe under the trade name INCRUSE®ELLIPTA®. UMEC (62.5mcg) is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with COPD . UMEC (62.5 mcg) improves forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), dyspnea 2018N377698_00"
314,page_314,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 16andHRQoL whether used as monotherap y [Trivedi , 2014; Feldman , 2016] or as an add on to fluticasone propionate and vilanterol (FF/VI ) [Siler , 2015]. Salmetrol (50 mcg) DISKUS®is a long -acting broncholdilator that has long been used for the maintenance treatment of COPD [ Tashkin, 2010].

STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This is a multi -centre, r andomized, double blind, double -dummy , 3-arm parallel group study . Eligible subjects will be stratified based on long -acting bronchodilator usage during the run- in (none, one or 2 long -acting bronchodilators per day ) and randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 mcg once daily) administered via the ELLIPTA inhaler, or UMEC (62.5 m cg once dail y) administered via the ELLIPTA or salmeterol (50 mcg BID) administered via the D ISKUS. There will be a total of 5 clinic visits and one follow -up phone call (Visit 6). The Pre - screening Visit (Visit 0) can occur on the same day as the Screeni ng Visit (Visit 1) if subject does not take or has not taken an y excluded protocol medications , but must be completed prior to initiating an y Visit 1 procedures. Subjects, who meet all the eligibility criteria at Screening , will enter a run- in period for 4 weeks in order to continue to assess the subject’s eligibility for the stud y. During the run- in period subjects will continue with their inhaled COPD medications (excluding ICS and any exclusionary medications) . In addition ,subjects will be provided wi th short acting albuterol/salmeterol to be used on as needed basis for relief of COPD s ymptoms (rescue medication) throughout the study . 2018N377698_00"
317,page_317,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 19Subjects who experience a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run- in period will be deemed run-in failures . Subjects who experience a mild COPD exacerbation, defined as worsening of s ymptoms that require s notreatment with antibiotics or steroids and is self managed b y the patient by an increase of inhaled rescue medication , (Appendix 5), will be able to continue in the study based on the judgment of the investigator and agreement of the sponsor ’smedical monitor . At the randomization Visit 2 ( Day 1) those subjects who successfull y complete the run- in period as well as mee t the other pre -defined eligibility and randomization criteria will discontinue the ir inhaled COPD medications and will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms for 24 weeks. During the run- inand treatment period , subjects will be completing PRO questionnaires in the eDiary and performing slow and forced spirometry at specific clinic visits . In addition, a subset of subjects up to 150 per treatment arm will undergo assessment of their phy sical activity measured through a phy sical activity monitor (Acti graph GT9X) worn for 7 day sfrom Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2), 7 days from Visit 3, and for 7 day s prior to last clinic Visit (Visit 5). Concurrent use of COPD maintenance medications including LAMAs, LABAs, oral beta - agon ists, theophy llines, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids and L ABA combination and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors will not be allowed during the stud y (Section 6.11.2 ) . The occurrence of adverse ev ents(AEs) will be evaluated throughout the study beginning at Visit 2 (Day 1) and until the f ollow -up contact (Visit 6). Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected over the same time period as AEs. However, an y SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., study treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK concomitant medication, will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including an y follow up contact ( Appendix 4). All subjects will be given an electronic diary (eDiary ) for use during the run -in, and the treatment period to complete PRO questionnaires, record COPD daily symptom s,any medical pro blems experienced during the study and the time they take their COPD medications. Daily rescue medication usage (number of inhalations taken in the last 24h) will also be captured in the eDiary . In addition, and in some countries, rescue medication use w ill also be captured by the use of electronic metered dose inhaler (eMDI). At Screening V isit 1,all subjects must be trained on the proper use of their existing COPD medications inhalation devices and instructed to strictly adhere to and record the time t hey take their COPD medications in the eD iary. At the randomization Visit 2 ,all subjects must be trained on the proper use of the ELLIPTA and DISKUS inhalation devices and instructed to strictly adhere to and record the time they take their study medicati ons in the eDiary . 2018N377698_00"

Subjects will be considered to have completed the study upon completion of the follow – up contact by telephone. There are no plans to routinely provide any of the study treatments for compassionate use following stud y completion as the study treatment are commerciall y available . The study design schematic is illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 1 Study Schematic *Inhaled COPD medications including LABAs, LAMAs or LABA/LAMA combination products are allowed in run-in.

Type and Number of Subjects Approximately 3232will be screened globall y in approximately 205sites such that approximately 2424subjects will be randomized andapproximately 2181 evaluable subjects complete the study . 4.4. Design Justification A randomized, double blinded, parallel group study is a standard, well -established design to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of an investi gational drug. A salmeterol arm is included to allow a comparison to be made between UMEC/VI , UMEC with salmeterol, a standard practice treatment. The double -dumm y design is appropriate when drugs are of different appearance or different administration regimen which is appropriate in this study where the inhalers used have a different appearance and used once daily and twice dail y. The European Medicines Agency (EMA )COPD Guidelines suggest that duration of 12 to 24 weeks is considered adequate for assessm ent of response of COPD sy mptoms to treatment intervention with bronchodilators (EMA COPD guidelines, 2012). The primary endpoint is trough FEV 1 at week 24 . This endpoint is generally considered to be a robust, well est ablished and an objective means to show the efficacy of a bronchodilator [ Dahl , 2010; Feldman , 2010]. Other endpoints such SAC TDI , E-RS,SGRQ -C,CAT ,Subject Global Rating of Ch ange in global impression of disease severity are captured to allow responder analy ses and to provide comparative data on PROs between the treatment groups. 4.5. Dose Justification This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy of marketed doses of UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg once dail y), UMEC ( 62.5 mcg once daily )andsalmeterol (50mcg twice daily ) that are approved for the maintenance treatment of COPD, with respect to PRO measures. 4.6. Benefit: Risk Assessment Summaries of findings from both clinical and non- clinical studies conducted with UMEC/VI and UMEC can be found in the investigator’s brochures (IB) [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2009/00437/07] and [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2006/00835/09 ] and in the label information sheet s. The current safet y profile for UMEC (62.5mcg) and the UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg) based on data available to date, is comparable with other LABAs and LAMAs. Summary safet y data can also be found in the i nformation sheet for salmetero l [Serevent product information 2003 ].The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigati on strategy for this protocol: 6 2018N377698_00"

Cardiovascular effects such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles.Class effects associated with LABAs and LAMA containing therapy. The clinical significance of these arrhythmias is unkn own. Clinical experience with UMEC/VI to date in completed studies did not show any association with major cardiovascular events. Data available in the product label for UMEC/VI Exclusion criteria have been set for subjects with uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease according to the principal investigation’s (PI) opinion where the potential risk may outweigh the benefit. The PI should also determine the clinical significance of abnormal ECG findings at screening and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. Patients with the following abnormalities will be excluded from participation: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate >120bpm, sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or second degree heart block Mobitz type II or third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted). Beta agonists and risk of asthma -related death Long -acting beta agonists such as vilanterol when used alone may increase the risk of asthma -related death. A placebo -controlled trial with another LABA (salmeterol) showed an increase in asthma -related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol. This finding with salmeterol is considered a class effect of all LABAs, including vilanterol. Data are not avai lable to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by LABA.Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma are excluded from participation in the study. Paradoxical bronchospasm As with other inhaled medicines, UMEC/VI can produc e paradoxical bronchospasm which may be life threatening.If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with UMEC/VI, this treatment should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy should be instituted. Use in patients with narrow -angle glaucoma or urinary retentionNo association has been found to date, in completed studies with UMEC/VI or UMEC monotherapy, on glaucoma or urinary retention.

Benefit A ssessment Subjects will receive single or combination of long -acting bronchodilator therapies approved for maintenance treatment of COPD . Participating s ubjects in this study will contribute to the process of further characterizing the benefit of these long -acting bronchodilators with respect to PROs and sy mptoms in thetreatment of COPD. Specific benefits associated with the study design and procedures in clude the following: Subjects will receive treatments approved for the treatment of COPD that have been shown to be effective in the population under study All subjects will receive albuterol /salbutamol for use “as needed” for relief of COPD sy mptoms The c ombination of study procedures of spirometry , CAT, SGRQ, TDI , E-RSwill provide the study subjects with a comprehensive evaluation of their symptoms, health status and COPD disease severity .

A moderate exacerbation is defined as worsening of s ymptoms of COPD requiring the use of antibiotics or sy stem ic corticosteroids. A severe exacerbation is defined as worsening sy mptoms of COPD requiring hospitalization. 2.CAT score : A CAT score of ≥10 at Visit 2 3.Prohibited Medications: No use of an y prohibited medications during the run -in period or at Visit 2, including an y ICS or ICS/LABA combination 4.Any change to COPD medications :Including dosage and regimen during the run -in 5.Completion of electronic diary: Must have completed the electronic diary for at least 80% of day s during the run- in period Subjects who do not meet the required criteria for randomization at Visit 2 will not be randomized. 5.4. Screening/Baseline/Run-in Failure s Pre-screen, screen and run- in failures are defined as follows: Pre-screening failures: A subject ,who is assigned a subject number at the Pre - screening Visit 0 but does not have any Screening Visit 1 procedures ,will be considered a pre -screen failure. 2018N377698_00"
329,page_329,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 31Screening failures: Those subjects that complete at least one Screening Visit 1 procedure but do not enter the run -in period. Run-in failures: Those subjects that enter the run- in period but are not randomized to any of the study treatment arms. Subjects w ho are pre -screen, screen and run -in failure will be recorded in the eCRF. In order to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects, meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and respond to queries f rom Regulatory Authorities, a minimal set of screen failure information is required to be recorded in eCRF including demograph y, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and serious adverse events (Section 7.4.1 ). 5.5. Withdrawal/Stopping Criteria 5.5.1. Withdrawal from the Study Subjects may be withdrawn from thestudy at an y time by the Investigator if it is considered to be detrimental for them to continue in the study . Reasons for withdrawal from study treatment c an include: an AE, clinically significant abnormality , lack of efficacy , sponsor terminated study , pregnancy , or for any other reason. If a subject withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken, and the investigator must do cument this in the site study records . A reason for the withdrawal from the study must be captured in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). A subject will also be withdrawn from the study , in consultation with the medical monitor and principal investiga tor, if any of the following stopping criteria are met: Liver Chemistry: Meets any of the Liver chemistry stopping criteria (See Section 5.5.3 ) Note: clinical laboratory assessments are not required for this st udy. However, laboratory samples may be taken for liver event analy sis, if clinicall y indicated b y the study investigator. Pregnancy: Positive pregnancy test (see Appendix 7) Subjects withdrawn from study treatment wi ll not be replaced. Note: Withdrawal from study treatment requires withdrawal from the study . The following actions must be taken in relation to a subject who fails to attend the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the subj ect and re -schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site must counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study . 2018N377698_00"
330,page_330,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 32In cases wher e the subject is deemed ‘lost to follow up’, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and if necessary a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical record. Should the subject continue to be unreachable, only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow -up”. 5.5.2. Reason for Study Withdrawal The primary reason for study withdrawal will be recorded in the eCRF. When a subject withdraws consent, the investigator must document the reason (if specified by the subject) in the eCRF. The primary reason for study withdrawal may include : Adverse event Lost to follow -up Withdrew consent osubject relocated ofrequency of visits oburden of procedures oother (specify ) Protocol deviation Lack of efficacy COPD exacerbation Study closed/terminated Subject reached protocol -defined stopping criteria oLiver event oPregnancy Investigator discretion 5.5.3.

Study Treatment Return All used and unused ELLIPTA and D ISKUS inhalers an d albuterol/salbutamol will be returned to GSK at the end of the study to be available for disposal. In some instances for sites outside the US, study supplies will be disposed of locall y either b y the site, the country medical department or third -party vendor. Detailed instructions for the return of the study drug can be found in the SRM. Study treatment will be collected at Visit 3, 4 and 5 or at the Earl y Withdrawal V isit, if applicable. For an y ELLIPTA or DISKUS inhaler that fails to function properl y, the subject should return to the clinic as soon as possible to obtain a new inhaler. The site will contact the RAMOS NG to obtain a new treatment pack number for the subject and dispense a new study treatment kit from the site’s investigational product supply as instructed by the RAMOS NG In addition, any ELLIPTA that fails to function properly must be identified and returned to GSK for testing. 6.8. Compliance with Study Treatment A dministration When subjects self- administer study treatment(s) at home , com pliance with study treatment(s) will be assessed through querying the subject during the site visits and through study drug compliance assessed at Visits2,3, 4 and 5documented in the source documents and eCRF. A record of the number of ELLIPTA and DISK US dispensed and the number of doses inhaled by each subject must be maintained and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates, including dates for treatment delay sif any will also be recorded in the eCRF. Comp liance with the ELLIPTA inhaler will be determined by reviewing the dose counter on the ELLIPTA. Compliance with the study DISKUS will be determined by reviewing the dose counter on the D ISKUS . Subjects should be ≥80% to ≤120% compliant on taking stud y medication between each pair of on -treatment visits. Subjects who fall outside this range should be re -educated on treatment compliance b y their site. This re - education should be documented in the subject’s source document. If medication compliance repeat edly falls outside of acceptable ranges, the study sponsor/site monitor must be contacted to discuss subject eligibility for continued participation in the study . 6.9. Treatment of Study Treatment Overdose An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total doses described in Section 6.1and Section 6.8which results in clinical signs and s ymptoms. These should be recorded b y the investigator on the AE/SAE pages. In the event of an overdose of study medication, the investigator should use clinical judgment in treating the overdose and contact the study Medical Monitor . 2018N377698_00"

Pre-screening Visit During the Pre -screening Visit, the study designated personnel must provide informed consent to thestudy participant. Subjects can perform the Pre -screening Visit (Visit 0) up to 2 weeks prior t o or on the same day as the Screening Visit (Visit 1) if subject does not take or has not taken any protocol excluded medications. Modification of the subject’s medications prior to study participation is based on the physician’s judgment according to sound medical practice, principles, and each subject’s needs. A subject’s treatment must not be changed merel y for the purpose of enabling the subject’s participation in the study . A subject number will be assigned at the time the informed consent form (ICF ) is signed. No study related procedures may be performed until the informed consent form document has been signed by the subject. Once the informed consent is signed and if required , changes can be made to the subject’s current medication regimen. The i nvestigator should exercise clinical judgment, and is discouraged from changing m edications only for the purpose of the clinical study . During the pre -screening Visit 0, t he following information is collected: Demographic parameters: y ear of birth, gende r, race and ethnicity Concomitant medications review COPD exacerbation assessment From the pre -screening visit onwards concomitant medications, exacerbations and SAEs (considered as related to study participation) must be reported 7.2.2. Critical procedures perfo rmed at Screening (Visit 1) The following critical assessments will be conducted at Visit 1: Cardiovascular medical history /risk factors ( as detailed in the eCRF) will be assessed at screening Medical history including COPD (including date of diagnosis and COPD ty pe (emphy sema and/or chronic bronchitis), smoking history , COPD exacerbation history , smoking status and previous and/or current medical conditions) Concomitant medication review (COPD and non COPD medications in the 3 months prior to Screening ). 12-Lead ECG. (Note: ECG is performed at screening Visit 1 to test for eligibility only. See Section 7.4.4 ). Urine pregnancy test if applicable 2018N377698_00"

PRO questionnaires should be completed by subjects before an y other assessments at a clinic visit, in the order specif ied in Section 7.3.1 7.2.2.1. Albuterol/Salbutamol Reversibility Assessment At Visit 1, both pre -and post -albuterol/salbutamol spirometry will be obtained to determine subject eligibility . Reversibility assessment should be performed as follows: Perform pre -bronchodilator spirometry and record FEV 1and FVC Subject to self -admi nister 4 Inhalations (4X100 g) of albuterol/salbutamol MDI Perform post -bronchodilator spirometry and record FEV 1and FVC approximately 10 to 30 minutes after albuterol/salbutamol administration The results of the spirometry must meet the ATS/ERS criteria [Miller , 2005] for the subject to continue in the study . 7.2.3.

Efficacy Assessments 7.3.1. HRQoL assessments : Completion of PRO questionnaires in the Electronic Diary All subjects will be completing PRO questionnaires in the eDiary . It is requested that questionnaires are completed before an y procedures are performed on the subject. All questionnaires will be completed using the eDiary at clinic and at home. Adequate time should be a llowed to complete all items of the questionnaires and the questionnaires must be reviewed b y the investigator or designated study staff for completeness and, if necessary , the subject must be encouraged to complete any missing items. Where more than one questionnaire is to be completed at a visit the order should be as follows: 1.Baseline d yspnea index ( Visit 2 ) then Transient dyspnea index at subsequent visits 2.Patient global rating of COPD severit y and global rating of change in COPD 3.St George’s respiratory questionnaire 4.COPD Assessment Test Instructions for completing the questionnaires can be found in the SRM. 7.3.1.1. Self A dministered Computerised Baseline Dy spnea Index/Transitional Dyspnea Index (SA C BDI/TDI) The BD I is used to measure the severity of d yspnea i n patients at baseline. The TDI measures changes in the patient’s dyspnea from baseline. The self -administered computerized version of the BDI/TDI (SAC BDI /TDI)[ Mahler , 2004 ] is used to measure severit y of d yspnea in patients at baseline ( SAC BDI) on Day 1 (Visit 2) of treatment and change from the baseline (SAC TDI) at Week 4, 12 and 24 (Visits 3, 4 and 5). The scores in both indexes depend on ratings for three different categories: functional 2018N377698_00"
347,page_347,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 49impairment; magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. SAC BDI/TDI should be completed before performing spirometry . The SAC BDI/TDI was developed to address issues of potential bias in the interviewer administered (original) BDI /TDI [Mahler , 1984 ]. The SAC BDI/TDI provides a standardized approach to the measurement of d yspnea, equivalent to the original BDI/TDI with advantages over the interviewer method for grading d yspnea in patients with COPD by standardizing the process for each pa tient and eliminating individual judgment required b y the interviewers when completing the original BDI/TDI. This also removes the need for the same investigator to conduct all interviews with a subject based on the patient’s responses. SAC TDI provides a continuous measure of change in d yspnea using a visual analogue scale to record responses. Details for the completion of the SAC BDI/TDI are provided in the S RM. 7.3.1.2. SGRQ -C The St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease specif ic (SGRQ- C) will be completed by subjects at Randomisation ( V2, Day 1), at Week 4, 12 and 24 or at the Early Withdrawal Visit (where applicable). The SGRQ- C [Meguro , 2007] is a well established, disease -specific questionn aire. It was designed to measure the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on a COPD patient’s HRQoL. As well as producing an overall summary score, scores for the individual domains of symptoms, activity and impacts are also produced. It has been used in studies of COPD subjects and has been translated and validated for use in most major languages. The SGRQ-C is derived from the original SGRQ, and produces scores equivalent to the SGRQ instrument [ Meguro , 2007]. 7.3.1.3. COPD A ssessment Test (CA T) The COPD Assessment Test [Jones, 2009, Jones, 2012 ]is a validated, short and simple patient completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD. The CAT is an 8 -item questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients diagnosed with COPD. When completing the questionnaire, subjects rate their experience on a 6 -point scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment) with a scoring range of 0 -40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. The CAT will be completed in the eDiary by subjects at Screening Visit 1 and Randomisation Visit 2 to assess their eligibility to enter the stud y.CAT is also completed at Weeks 4, 12 and 24. Additional instructions for completion of the CAT are provided in the SRM. 7.3.1.4. EXACT and the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms -COPD (E -RS: COPD) EXACT -PRO is a 14 item patient reported outcome instrument designed to capture information on the occurrence, frequency , severity , and duration of exacerbations of 2018N377698_00"
348,page_348,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 50disease in patients with COPD [ Leidy, 2011]. EXACT captures information on the sever ity of the respiratory and sy stemic manifestations of a COPD exacerbation as reported b y the patient. The instrument is to be completed daily (typically 2 hrs before bedtime) using the electronic diary .The daily recording of information allows an assess ment of the underly ing day to day variability of a patient's s ymptoms and facilitates the detection of s ymptom worsening indicative of a COPD exacerbation. The total score for EXACT ranges from 0 -100. The entire instrument is intended to be completed in about 3 minutes or less (typically the time required for completion decreases as the patient becomes more familiar with the tool and the electronic diary ). The E- RS: COPD consists of 11 items from the 14 item EXACT instrument [ Leidy, 2014]. E-RS: COPD is intended to capture information related to the respiratory symptoms of COPD, i.e. breathlessness, cough, sputum production, chest congestion and chest tightness. The E -RS: COPD has a scoring range of 0 -40 higher score s indicate more severe s ymptoms. Three subscales of the E -RS are used to describe different s ymptoms; dy spnea, cough and sputum and chest sy mptoms. The EXACT questionnaire will be completed b y subjects in the eDiary , at home every night throughout the enti re study , starting from Screening V1 7.3.1.5. Subject Global Rating of COPD Severity and Global Rating of Change in COPD Subjects will complete the Global Rating of COPD Severit y at Randomization Visit 2 and visits 3, 4 and 5 or Early Withdrawal Visit . This singl e global question will ask subjects to rate their severity of COPD on a four point scale (mild, moderate, severe, and very severe). This question should be used immediately before the patient completes other visit specific questionnaires but after complet ion of SAC TDI questionnaire . Subjects will also complete a Global Rating of Change in COPD (overall disease) question at Visits 3, 4 and 5or Earl y Withdrawal Visit. Response options will be on a 7 point L ikert scale ranging from much better to much wor se. Completing the question at each Visit allows for early detection of response as well as continued response. 7.3.2. Spirometry Spirometry measurements will be obtained using spirometry equipment that meets or exceeds the minimal performance recommendations of the ATS [ Miller , 2005]. All sites will use standardized spirometry equipment provided by an external vendor. All subjects will have spirometry performed at Screening to assess eligibility (see Section 7.2.2.1 ) and at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5during the treatment period. For FEV1and FVC determinations, at least 3 acceptable spirometry efforts (with no more than 8) should be obtained. Acceptable spirometry efforts should have a satisfactory 2018N377698_00"
349,page_349,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 51start of test and end of test (i.e. a plateau in the volume time curve) and be free from artifacts due to cough, early termination, poor effort, obstructed mouthpiece, equipment malfunction, or other reasons [ Miller , 2005]. The largest FEV1and FVC from the 3 acceptable efforts should be recorded, even if they do not come from the same effort. Spirometry for FEV 1and FVC assessments that is not obtained as follows will be considered a protocol deviation: Started between 6:00AM and 11:00AM. After withholding albuterol/salbutamol (all visits) for ≥4 hours At Screening Visit 1, after w ash out of medications as specified in the exclusion criteria in Section 5.2(Conc omitant Medications). At Visit 2 after discontinuing inhaled COPD medications and prior the first dose of study treatment At Visit 3, 4 and 5 after withholding the morning dose of study treatment . Pre dose assessment performed prior dosing. Subjects shoul d refrain from smoking for 1 hour prior to each pulmonary function test. Trough FEV 1measurements for UMC/VI or UMEC on Weeks 4, 12 and 24 (Visits 3, 4 and 5) should be performed 23 hours and 24 hours after the previous day ’s dose of study medication recor ded in the eDiary . This will also provide trough FEV 1measur ements for the evening dose of salmeterol. 7.3.3. Inspiratory capacity (IC) Inspiratory capacit y (IC)is the volume of gas that can be taken into the lungs in a normal and full inhalation. Starting from the resting inspiratory position it is equal to the tidal volume plus the inspiratory reserve volume. IC has been widel y used to assess static and dynamic h yperinflation in patients with COPD. IC will be measured b y spirometry prior to forced manoeuvres pre-dose at Visits 2 (30 and 5 min prior to dosing) and at trough at Visits 3, 4, and 5 (23 and 24 hrs post dosing on the previous day ). For I C determination the average of at least three acceptable manoeuvres should be recorded. Subjects should be tested while sitting, relaxed and wearing a nose clip. They should be asked to breathe regularl y for several breaths until the end- expiratory lung volume is stable (this usually requires at least three tidal manoeuvres) then urged to take a deep breath to Total Lung Capacit y(TLC) with no hesitation. Spirometry for IC determination done in conjunction with FEV 1and FVC assessments that is not obtained as follows will be considered a protocol deviation: Started between 6:00AM and 11:00AM. After withholding albute rol/salbutamol (all visits) ≥4 hours 2018N377698_00"
350,page_350,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 52At Visit 2 after discontinuation of run -in medication At Visit 3, 4 and 5 after withholding the morning dose of study drug 7.3.4. COPD Exacerbation A mild exacerbation is defined as worsening of s ymptoms that require no treatme nt with antibiotics or steroids, andis self managed by the patient by an increase of inhaled rescue medications. A moderate COPD exacerbation is defined as worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids and/or antibio tics. A severe exacerbation is defined as worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require in- patient hospitalization or emergency room for longer than 24 hrs. If a subject experiences a mild, moderate or severe COPD exacerbation, the COPD exacerbation page of the eCRF should be completed. COPD exacerbations should not be recorded as an AE, unless they meet the definition of a SAE .Details of COPD exacerbation identification, categorization and treatment guidelines are described in Appendix 5. Subjects who experience a mild exacerbation during the run- in period will not be withdrawn from the study. However, Subjects who experience moderate or severe exacerbation during the run -in period will be withdrawn from the study and will not be allowed to be re -screened. Subjects who experience a mild, moderate or severe exacerbation during the treatment period, will notbe withdrawn from the study unless the investigator or GSK medical monitor think it is best for the patient to withdraw from the study . Signs and s ymptoms of COPD included on the electronic diary cards will not be considered AEs and will not be recorded in the eCRF. The time period for collection of COPD exacerbations will be from the Pre -Screening (Visit 0) until completi on of the follow -up contact. If a subject experiences a COPD exacerbation from the time the I CF is signed until randomization, summary information (yes/no status question) will be collected in the eCRF . COPD exacerbations after randomization through follo w-up will be recorded on the COPD exacerbation page of the eCRF. 7.3.5. Clinically important deterioration (CID) Clinically important deterioration ( CID)is a composite endpoint defined as: A decrease of 100 mL from baseline in trough FEV 1 A deterioration in HRQoL defined as 4 units increase from baseline in SGRQ The occurrence of an on -treatment moderate/severe COPD exacerbation In addition, this study will explore CAT and TDI PROs as part of the composite endpoint. 2018N377698_00"

In addition, in some countries and selected sites the number of puffs will be collected through the e MDI device (Section 6.2) 7.3.7. Physical activity monitor (study subset) Physical activity limitation is a common feature of COPD and its measures are highl y related to the degree of disease severity [Watz , 2009]. Reduced ph ysical activity levels in C OPD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality , sustained disability , depression, and social and phy sical isolation [ Shu-Yi, 2014; Gimeno, 2014] Improved activity has been identified as an important factor that may modify morbidity and mortality in COPD [ Moy , 2012 ]. The Actigraph GT9X phy sical activity monitor will be used to measure levels of activity . The activity monitor will be wor n by up to approximately 150 subjects for 7 day s from Screening (Visit 1), for 7 day s from Randomisation (Visit 2) ,7 day s from Visit 3 ( Week 4)and for 7 day s prior to Week 24 (Visit 5). There will be 4 assessment periods, including a screening assessment in order to provide a reliable estimate of habitual phy sical activity .Each subject will be given an activity monitor and instruction leaflet at the start of each assessment period. Further details of distribution, operation and retrieval of the monitors will be provided in the SRM . 7.4.

However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonab ly related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify GSK. NOTE: The method of recording ,evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to GSK are provided in (Appendix 4, Section 12.4.4 to Section 12.4.6 ) 7.4.1.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bi as when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact  “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since y our last visit/contact ? 7.4.1.3. Follo w-up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each subject a t subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs ,and non- serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 4.6.1 )will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise expl ained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 5.5). 7.4.1.4. Pneumonia Events Investigators will be required to fill out a pneumonia event specific eCRF within one week of when the pneumonia AE /SAE(s) is first reported. 2018N377698_00"

Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in (Section 12.4.3 )and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and De ath sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non- cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 7.4.1.6. Disease- Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es The following disease related events (DREs) are common in subjects with COPD and can be serious/life threatening: COPD exacerbation COPD exacerbations are associated with the disease to be studied and will not be recorded as AEs unless the exacerbation meets the definition of a ‘serious’ AE. Exacerbati ons that meet the definition of ‘serious’ AEs will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF section and should be reported to GSK for all subjects regardless of whether or not they are randomized to study medication. Signs and s ymptoms of COPD included on the e lectronic diary will not be considered AEs and will not be recorded in the eCRF 7.4.1.7. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to GSK of SAEs related to study treatment (even for non -interventional post-marketing studie s)is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of subjects and the safety of a product under clinical investigation are met. GSK has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authorit y and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. GSK will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authorit y, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Com mittee (IEC) and investigators. Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary . 2018N377698_00"

Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female subjects will be collected after the start of Screening and until the follow -up contact. If a pregnancy is reported then the investigator should inform GSK within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the proce dures outlined in Appendix 7. 7.4.3. Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions) Procedures for documenting medical device incidents are provided in Appendix 6. 7.4.4. Electrocardiogram (E CG) A Single 12- lead ECG will be obtained at Screening using an ECG machine provided b y the investigation alsite that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS , QT, and QTc intervals. The 12- lead ECG measurement and rh ythm strip (10 seconds) will be obtained before spirometry testing. ECG measurement should be obtained after subjects have rested for approximately 5 minutes then the subjects should be placed in the supine position for the ECG measurements. An ECG is only required at Scree ning Visit 1 for eligibility assessment only. The investigator, a designated sub -investigator, or other appropriatel y trained site personnel will be responsible for performing and interpreting the 12 -lead ECG at Screening Visit 1 . The investigator must pr ovide his/her dated signature on the original paper tracing, attesting to the authenticity of the ECG machine interpretation. 7.5.

Hypotheses The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 we eks. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The null hy pothesis is no difference between treatment groups (H0: μT – μS = 0), with the alternative h ypothesis that there is a difference between treatment groups (H1: μT – μS ≠0), where μ T is the mean change from baseline for UMEC/VI and μS is the mean change from baseline for UMEC. 9.2. Sample Size Considerations The pr imary endpoint is change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. As an important aim of the study is to compare UMEC/VI, UMEC and salmeterol with respect to HRQoL the sample size has been calculated to provide sufficient power for the comparison of the pr imary and secondary endpoint TDI ,at Week 24. The sample size calculations use a two -sided 5% significance level and an estimate of between subject standard deviation for TDI of 2.94 units. The estimate of SD is based on DB2113373 [Donohue , 2013] , a study which consisted of treatment arms of UMEC/VI 62.5/25, UMEC 62.5 VI (Vilanterol) 25mcg and placebo and is the value at Day 168 in a subgroup of subjects who were ICS free at screening. Based on these data, 727 eva luable subjects per treatment arm will be required to provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference if the true difference is 0.5 units, ½ the MCI D, between UMEC/VI and UMEC. The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statis tically significant difference between treatment groups is 0.31 units. With this number of evaluable subjects per arm, the study will have >99% power assuming a true treatment difference of 80mL between UMEC/VI and UMEC for trough FEV1 at 24 weeks at the two-sided 5% significance level. This calculation uses a SD for trough FEV1 of 240mL, based on prior results for trials comparing dual bronchodilators versus single bronchodilators ( Donohue , 2013; Bateman , 2013). The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statistically significant difference between treatment groups is 25mL . In order to account a for a 10% withdrawal rate , approximately 808 subjects per treatment arm will be randomised. 2018N377698_00"

Interim Analy sis No interim anal ysis is planned for the stud y. 9.4. Key Elements of A nalysis Plan Treatment Comparisons The primary treatment comparison of UMEC/VI with UMEC will be performed on the ITT population. The other treatment comparisons of UMEC/VI and UMEC with Salmeterol will be performed on the ITT population and ITT ICS free population. 9.4.1. Primary Analyses The treatment comparison of primary interest will be UMEC/VI versus UMEC for the primary endpoint of change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 24. The primary analyses will be performed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) anal ysis and will be based on a two -sided hy pothesis testing approach on the ITT Population. In order to account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and endpoints, a step- down closed testing procedure will be applied whereb y inference for secondary and other endpoints or treatment comparisons are dependent upon statistical significance having been achieved for the primary comparison. If the primary comparison is signi ficant i.e. the associated p-value for UMEC/VI versus UMEC for change from baseline in trough FEV1 at Week 24 is below 0.05, this will allow inference of treatment comparisons (UMEC/VI versus UMEC on all other endpoints, and UMEC/VI versus Salmeterol and UMEC versus Salmeterol on all endpoints including the primary endpoint), which will be declared statistically significant if the associated p -value is below 0.05. 2018N377698_00"
358,page_358,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 60There will be 2 anal yses one for one for the German Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) andone f or the rest of the world (ROW). The step-down closed testing procedure onl y applies to the ROW. For the G -BA statistical inference for secondary and other endpoints or treatment comparisons will not be conditional on achieving statistical significance of the primary comparison. The primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 at the end of Week 24 and secondary endpoint change from baseline in TDI score at Week 24 will both be analysed using MMRM analy sis. The MMRM analy sis for change f rom baseline in trough FEV1 and TDI will include measurements at Treatment Weeks 4, 12 and 24. Treatment group (a categorical variable) will be fitted as the explanatory variable with appropriate pre -defined variables, stratum (number of bronchodilators per day during run-in) and baseline values, fitted as covariates. Visit (nominal) will be fitted as a categorical variable and visit- by-baseline and visit -by-treatment interaction terms will be included to allow treatment effects to be estimated at each visit separatel y. The variance covariance matrix will be assumed to be unstructured (based on previous experience no issues are expected with fitting models with this matrix structure). While missing data are not explicitly imputed in the primary MMRM analy ses,there is an underl ying assumption that the data are missing at random. The estimated treatment differences between UMEC/VI versus UMEC for each endpoint will be presented with the 95% confidence intervals for the difference and the p -value. Full details of the analy ses to be performed on all primary endpoints will be given in the RAP. 9.4.2. Other A nalyses The MMRM anal ysis will be repeated for the ITT ICS free population. Estimated differences between UMEC/VI or UMEC and Salmeterol will be presented together w ith 95% confidence intervals (CI s) for the difference and p- values. Secondary and o ther efficacy endpoints and treatment comparisons will be adjusted for multiplicity as per Section 9.4.1 . Full details of the an alyses to be performed on the other efficacy endpoints will be given in the RAP. Safety Analyses Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the standard GSK dictionary , Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and grouped by body system. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one AE of an y type, AEs within each bod y system and AEs within each preferred term will be presented for each treatment group. Separate summaries will be provided for all AEs, drug related AEs, fatal AEs, non -fatal SAEs, AESI s and AEs leading to withdrawal. 2018N377698_00"

Appendix 3:Genetic Research Genetics –Background Naturall y occurring genetic variation may contribute to inter -individual variability in response to medicines, as well as an individual's risk of developing specific diseases. Genetic factors associated with disease characteristics may also be associated with response to therap y, and could help to explain some clinical study outcomes. For example, genetic variants associated with age- related macular degeneration (AMD) are reported to account for much of the risk for the condition [ Gorin , 2012] with certain variants reported to in fluence treatment response [ Chen, 2012]. Thus, knowledge of the genetic etiology of disease may better inform understanding of disease and the development of medicines. Additionally , genetic variability may impact the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination), or pharmacod ynamics (relationship between concentration and pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) of a specific medicine and/or clinical outcomes (efficac y and/or safet y) observed in a clinical study. Genetic Research Objectives and A nalyses The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate the relationship between genetic variants and: Response to medicine, including an y concomitant medicines; COP Dsusceptibility , severity , and progression ofrelated conditions Genetic data may be generated while the study is underway or following completion of the study . Genetic evaluations may include focused candidate gene approaches and/or examination of a la rge number of genetic variants throughout the genome (whole genome analyses). Genetic anal yses will utilize data collected in the study and will be limited to understanding the objectives highlighted above. Analy ses may be performed using data from multip le clinical studies to investigate these research objectives. Planned anal yses and results of genetic investigations will be reported either as part of the clinical RAP and study report, or in a separate genetics RAP and report, as appropriate. Study Popul ation Any subject who is enrolled in the study can participate in genetic research. Any subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from the genetic research. Study Assessments and Procedures A key component of successful genetic research is the collection of samples during clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori hypothesis has been identified, may enable future genetic anal yses to be conducted to help understand variability in disease and medicine response. 2018N377698_00"
372,page_372,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 74A 6 ml blood sample will be taken for Deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. A blood sample is collected at the baseline visit, after the subject has been randomized and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collecti on and shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory manual. The DNA from the blood sample may undergo quality control analy ses to confirm the integrit y of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality of the sample, then the sam ple may be destroy ed. The blood sample is taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to an inabilit y to utilize the original sample. The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same stud y specific number used to label o ther samples and data in the study . This number can be traced or linked back to the subject by the investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or social security number). Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 y ears after the last subject completes the study ,or GSK may destroy the samples sooner. GSK or those working with GSK (for example, other researchers) will only use samples collected from the study for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form. Samples may be used as part of the development of a companion diagnostic to support the GSK medicinal product. Subjects can request their sample to be destro yed at any time. Informed Consent Subjects who do not w ish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study . Genetic informed consent must be obtained prior to any blood being taken. Subject Withdrawal from Study If a subject who has consented to participate in genetic research withdr aws from the clinical study for any reason other than being lost to follow -up, the subject will be given a choice of one of the following options concerning the genetic sample, if already collected: Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA sample is retained Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy the genetic DNA sample If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for an y reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within the timeframe specified b y GSK and maintain the documentation in the site study records . Genoty pe data may be generated during the study or after completion of the study and may be anal yzed during the study or stored for future anal ysis. 2018N377698_00"
373,page_373,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 75If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research and genot ype data has not been analyzed, it will not be analy zed or used for future research. Genetic data that has been anal yzed at the time of withdr awn consent will continue to be stored and used, as appropriate. Screen and Baseline Failures If a sample for genetic research has been collected and it is determined that the subject does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the study , then t he investigator should instruct the subject that their genetic sample will be destroy ed. No forms are required to complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample reconciliation process. In this instance a sample destruction form will not be available to include in the site files. Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality of Subject’s Genetic Data GSK may summarize the genetic research results in the clinical study report, or separately andmay publish the results in sci entific journals. GSK may share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific understanding in alignment with the informed consent. GSK does not inform the subject, family members, insurers, or employ ers of individual genoty ping result s that are not known to be relevant to the subject’s medical care at the time of the study , unless required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic studies is generally preliminary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific validity of the results are undetermined. Further, data generated in a research laboratory may not meet regulatory requirements for inclusion in clinical care. 2018N377698_00"

Definition of A dverse Events Adverse Event Definition: An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an yunfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Events meeting AE definition include: Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions dete cted or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected over dose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae). ""Lack o f efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SA E. Events NOT meeting definition of an AE include: Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than ex pected for the subject’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 2018N377698_00"
375,page_375,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 77condition. Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., end oscopy , appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 12.4.2. Definition of Serious A dverse Events If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for sign s/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease, etc). Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalizat ion” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in disability/incapacity NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 2018N377698_00"
376,page_376,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 78This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , influenza, andaccidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in de ciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse g. Is associated with liver injury andimpaired liver function defined as: ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin*2xUL N (>35% direct), or ALT 3xULN and INR**> 1.5. * Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available; if unavailable, measure urinary bilirubin via dipstick. I f fractionation is unavailable and ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin  2xULN, then the event is still to be reported as an SAE. ** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants. If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be recorded on the SAE form. 12.4.3. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension 2018N377698_00"

Recording of A Es and SA Es AEs and SAE Recording: When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the respons ibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the CRF It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK, AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this instance, all subj ect identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission of to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinic al information. I n such cases, the diagnosis will be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms. Subject -completed Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaires and the collection of AE data are independent components of the study . Respon ses to each question in the Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaire will be treated in accordance with standard scoring and statistical procedures detailed b y the scale’s developer. The use of a single question from a multidimensional health survey to de signate a cause -effect relationship to an AE is inappropriate. 12.4.5. Evaluating AEs and SA Es Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and will assign it to one of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. 2018N377698_00"
378,page_378,"2016N277425_00 CONFIDENTIA L 201749 80Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal every day activities Severe: An e vent that prevents normal every day activities. -an AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined a s ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre- defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative ca uses, such as natural history of the underly ing diseases, concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator Br ochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE data collection tool accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determinin g regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate as fully as possib le the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health 2018N377698_00"

COPD Exacerbation Severity Each COPD exacerbation will be categorized based on severit y as follows: Moderate : Worsening sy mptoms of COPD that require treat ment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. Severe : Worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require treatment with in -patient hospitalization or 24 hr sin the emergency room . Every effort should be made to conduct a chest x- ray within 48 hours of identification of a moderate or severe exacerbation. Details of an exacerbation should be recorded in the exacerbation page of the eCRF. However, exacerbations should not be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF unless they meet the definition of an SAE. (Pneumonia must be recorded in the AE or SAE section of the eCRF and on the Pneumonia page of the eCRF.) Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections will not be considered a COPD exacerbation unless the subject exper iences worsening s ymptoms of COPD which match the definition of an exacerbation as given above. 12.5.3. Treatment of COPD Exacerbations All medications used for the treatment of exacerbations must be recorded in the source documents and the exacerbation page of th e eCRF. All sites should follow the protocol treatment guidelines (as outlined below), but an y medications deemed medically necessary may be used to treat a COPD exacerbation. However, caution is advised in using a LABA or LAMA to treat a subject currentl y taking IP as these additional medications may increase the risk of overdose. If necessary the PI or other health care personnel may stop the subject’s IP temporaril y in order to treat the COPD exacerbation. 12.5.4. Guidelines for Treatment with Corticosteroids If in the opinion of the Investigator/treating ph ysician the exacerbation is severe enough to warrant the need for oral or sy stemic corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) the following guidelines should be used. The duration of treatment with oral/s ystemic corticosteroids should be 14 day s (dose and t ype according to local practice) The duration of treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids should not exceed 14 days unless approval is given by the sponsor or representative Any course of oral/s ystemic corticosteroids started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation 2018N377698_00"

Guidelines for Treatment with A ntibiotics If there is evidence of respiratory infection that in the opinion of the Investig ator or treating ph ysician warrants the need for antibiotics the following guidelines should be followed: The duration of treatment with antibiotics should not exceed 14 day s (dose and ty pe according to local practice). If first line antibiotic treatment f ails and additional antibiotics are used, the total duration of antibiotic treatment should not exceed 30 days unless approval is given by the sponsor or representative Any course of antibiotics started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections is not considered a COPD exacerbation unless the subject experiences worsening of sy mptoms of COPD 12.5.6. Onset and Resolution o f COPD Exacerbations For each mild, moderate and severe exacerbation, the date of onset and the date of resolution will be recorded in the study source documents and eCRF. The date of onset is the first day (of at least 2 consecutive day s) of worsening s ymptoms of COPD as described in Section 12.5.1 . The date of resolution should be based on when the Investigator and/or subject determines that the COPD sy mptoms have returned to pre -exacerbation levels or to a new baseline. In determining this resolution date, consideration should be given to diary recorded s ymptoms and/or study subject evaluation. 12.5.7. Guideline for assessing multiple mild exacerbations Two mild exacerbations can be combined into one, per the Investig ator’s judgement, if a subject’s diary reveals that the two mild COPD exacerbations are separated by no more than three exacerbation free day s. 12.5.8. Guideline for assessing exacerbations that increase in severity If an exacerbation starts off as mild, but becom es moderate or severe or starts off as moderate and becomes severe, the exacerbation should be captured as one exacerbation and classified b y its highest level of severity. 2018N377698_00"

Definitions of a Medical Device Incident The detection and documentation procedures described in this protocol apply to all GSK medical devices provided for use in the stud y (see Section 6.2for the list of GSK m edical devices). Medical Device Incident Definition: Incident –Any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directl y or indirectly , mig ht lead to or might have led to the death of a patient/user/other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The non- occurrence of such a result might have been due t o other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of health care personnel. It is sufficient that:  an incident associated with a device happened and  the incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious deterioration in health.  A serious deterioration in state of health can include:  life-threatening illness  permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to a bod y structure  a condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above  fetal distress, fetal death or an y congenital abnormality or birth defects Examples of incidents a patient, user, care giver or professional is injured as a result of a medical device failure or its misuse a patient’s treatment is interrupted or compromised by a medical device failure misdiagnosis due to medical device failure leads to inappropriate treatment a patient’s health deteriorates due to medical device failure 2018N377698_00"
