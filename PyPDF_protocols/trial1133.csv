Treatment -emergent adverse events will be analyzed after treatment start on D ay1through the end of the study. Sample Size Calculation : A sample size of 2 18randomized participants per treatment group will provide at least 98% power t o detect the treatment difference between each of the 3atogepant doses (assumed equally effective) and placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint. This sample size was selected to provide sufficient pow er for each of the prim ary and first 3 secondary endpo ints. The power calculations are based on the following assumptions: 1) the standard deviation and treatment difference from placebo will be similar to the average value across the migraine prevention studies for atogepant (Phase 2/3 Study CGP -MD-01), telcagepant (Ho2014 ) and monoclonal antibodies ( Dodick 2014a; Dodick 2014b; Bigal 2015 ). In particular, the assumed treatment differen ce from placebo in change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12 -week treatment period is –1.5 days, and the standard deviation is 3.5 days; and 2) the study statistical testing plan controls the overall type I error at 5%. The pow er cal culations of the primary and secondary endpoints have taken the multiple comparisons into consideration by testing each dose versus placebo at a 0.0167 significance level, 2 -sided.

Back ground and Clinical Rationale 1.1 Back ground Migraine affects 18% of women and 6% of men in the United S tates with peak prev alence occurring between the ages of 25 to55 years. Approximately one-third of patients with migraines have 3 or more migraine headaches per month, and over half report severe impairment or the need for bed rest ( Lipton 2007). In the United States alone,work loss due to migraine is estimated to cost ~ $13 billion annually (Hu 1999 ).Prevalence is similar in Europe, with migraine headache affecting on average 17.6% of women and 8% of men (Stovn er2010). The Global Burden of Disease Sur vey 2010 (GBD2010) estimated the global prevalence of migraine to be 14.7%, making it the third most common disease in the world in both males and females. Migraine was ranked seventh highest among specific causes of disability globally ( Steiner 2013). Migraine is ty pically characterized by attacks of throbbing, unilateral headache of moderate or severe pain intensity , associ ated with nausea, vomit ing, a nd/or sensitivity to light (photophobia), and sound (phonophobia). In about 25% of individuals, the migraine headache is preceded b y focal neurological d ysfunction (aura). Improving diagnosis and optimizing treatments for migraine have been recognize d as c ritically important to overcoming current barriers to reduce the global burden of migraine. Because there are no biological markers for migraine, diagnosis is based on clinical history, examination , and the exclusion of other headache disorders. Phy sicians apply clinical criteria to guide diagnoses and subsequent treatment. Episodic migraine is a s yndrome diagnosis applied to patients with migraine (with or without aura) who have 1 to14 headache days per month. Chronic migraine is a specific ICHD-3 diagnosis applied to a subset of patients with ≥ 15 headache day s per month ( Katsarava 2012; Olesen 2004; ICHD -3,2018 ). This study will evaluate the ef ficacy , safet y and to lerability of atogepant in participants with EM. 1.2 Overview of Atogepant Atogepant is a potent, selective oral CGRP receptor antagonist being developed for migraine prevention. CGRP is a neuropeptide implicated in the pathophy siology of migraine. CGRP levels in the cranial venous outflow (ie, external jugular vein) are increased during a migraine attack and exogenously administered CGRP has been shown to trigger migraine -like headache in people with migraine. The majority (80 to 90%) of trigeminal Aδ fibers that innervate the dura con tain CGRP , suggesting that these fibers may be involved in sterile neurogenic inflammation and migraine pain transmission. Furthermore, the CGRP Approval Date: 15-May-2020 16:33:54 (GMT)"
20,page_20,"Aller gan Protocol 3101 -301-002, Amendment 3 20receptor is present on human meningeal and cerebral blood vessels. These o bservations suggest that activation of the trigeminovascular system, with release of CGRP , may play a key roleinmigraine pathogenesis andthat inhibition of CGRP mayyieldanovel therapeutic approach totreating migraine. Theabilit y of CGR Pinhibition to in duce pain relief inthe acute treatment of migraine was initially observed with an IVformulation of olcegepant (Olesen 2004 ),andreplicated by Merck & Co.,Incwith anoral formulation o f MK-0974 (telcagepant ), ahighly selective CGRP receptor antagonist. In P hase 3studie s,telcagepant was superior to placebo in the primary endpoints of 2-hour pain freedom, 2- hour pain relief, and the absence of associated symptom s (photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea), aswell asthekey secondar yendpoint of 24-hour sustained pain freedom (Connor 2009 ).However , serum ALTincreases w ere observed with telcagepant. For this reason, the development of these oral CGRP receptor antagonists was stopped. A Phase 2/3 clinical study (Stud y CGP- MD-01) was conducted, which compared atogepant 10mg once a day , atogepant 30 mg once a day , atogepant 30 mg BID, atogepant 60 mg once a day and atogepant 60 mg BID to placebo in EM prevention. Overall, all the atogepant doses tested were well tolerated and the AE profile of all atogepant doses did not significantl y differ from placebo. For the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in mean monthly migraine day s across the 12-week treatment period, all atogepant doses demonstrated a statistically significant reduction compared to placebo in patients with EM. Additional information on non- clinical pharmacology , toxicology , and PK properties of atogepant can be found in the IB. 1.3 Study Rationale Based on the r esults of the P hase 2/3 S tudy CGP- MD-01, the present study is being performed to prospectively assess the safet y, tolerability and ef ficacy of atogepant 10 mg, atogepant 30 mg, and atogepant 60 mg compared with placebo in the prevention of EM. This randomized, do uble-blind, placebo-controlled P hase 3 study is designed to be a pivotal trial to confirm the efficacy of these doses and dose regimens and will be used to support registration applications.

Randomization will be stratified based on prior exposure (yes/no) to a migraine prevention medication with proven efficacy (see Attachment 12.3). Participant participation will begin with a 4-week s creening/ baseline period. Participants who complete the 4-week screening/baseline period and meet all entry criteria will be random ized to the double- blind treatment period of the study at Visit 2 ( Randomization V isit). The double-blind treatment period will last 12 weeks, with a subsequent f ollow -up period of 4 additional week s. There will be 8 scheduled clinic visits: Visit 1 (Scree ning/Baseline), Visit2 (Randomization), Visit 3 (W eek 2), V isit 4 (W eek 4), V isit 5 (W eek 6), V isit6 (Week8), V isit 7/ET (Week 12), and V isit 8 ( Follow- up). For details, please see Table1 (Schedule of V isit and Procedures for In -Person V isits Conducted Prior to or During the COVID -19 Pandemic). To eliminate immediate potential hazards to participants and study staff due to the COVID-19 pandemic while ensuring participant safety and maintaining data integr ity, the protocol was updated to allow investigators/appropriately designated study staff to perform stud y visits remotely (as described in Table2Schedule of Visits and Procedures for V isits Conducted Remotely Due to the COVID -19 Pandemic). Participants completing the double -blind treatment period in this study may be elig ible to continue in Study 3 101-309-002, a longterm extension safety study in participants with EM, if they are at a participating site. For these rollover participants, a V isit 8 is not required in the present study , as the Follow -up Visit will be performed in the longterm safet y study .For participants who screen fail for the longterm safety study , the Follow -up V isit must be completed. If Visit7 is conducted remotel y due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the participant will not be eligible to roll over into Study 3101 -309-002; therefore, V isit8 (Follow -up/End of Study) should be conducted remotel y as part of Study 3101-301-002. 3.1 Data Safety Monitoring Board Anindepend ent DSMB will be established to review unblinded safet y data and summary reports, identify any safety issues and trend s, and make recommendations to Allergan , including modification or earl y termination of the trial, if emerging data show unexpected and cl inicall y significant AEs of treatment.

The Headache version is administered on day s when a participan t reports a headache and the Non-Headache version is administered on day s when a participant does not report having a headache. The AIM-D instructs participants to answer each question based on the level of difficult y experienced in the past 24 hours for both versions, with “during your headache” indicated for the AIM-D Headache version. In addition to the two domain scores, a total score using all 11 items can also be calculated. Each raw daily domain score, as well as the raw dail y total s core, are transf ormed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating greater impact of migraine (ie, higher disease burden) . 6.2.2 Activity Level and Activity Limitation Two items based on a 24-hour recall will be administered dail y using Headache and Non-heada che versions as additional health outcome measures and for evaluation of the AIM-D. The first item will be used to assess activity level within the past 24 hours with a 5-level response scale ranging from “No activity –Spent all day lying down” to “Exerci sed – Brisk walk, r unning, jogging, biking or other activity for 30 or more minutes.” The second item will be used to evaluate activity limitation with a 5 -level response scale ranging from “Not at all limited – I could do everything” to “Extremely limited ”.

Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5-item scale: 1 (wish to be dead), 2(nonspecifi c active suicidal thoughts), 3 (active suicidal ideation with any methods [not plan] without intent to act), 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan), and 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent). The C- SSRS also captures information about the intensity of ideation, specifically the frequency , duration, controllability , deterrents, and reasons for the most severe types of ideation. Suicidal behavior is classified on a 5-item scale: 0 (no suicidal behavior ), 1 (prepa ratory acts or behavior), 2 (aborted attempt), 3 (interrupted attempt), and 4 (actual attempt). More than 1classification can be selected provided they represent separate episodes. For actual attempts only, the actual or potential lethality is classified for the initial, most lethal, and most recent attempts. The C -SSRS will be completed at all study visits. At V isit 1 (Screening), the C-SSRS will be completed for the participant ’s lifetime history and for the 6 months prior to screening.

Therefore, for data analysis purposes, the number of migraine days during the last 28 day sprior to the randomization date , will serve as the “baseline”, and change from baseline will b e calculated for consecutive 28- day periods beginning wit h the date of first dose of study intervention . In order to be randomized, a participant should be in the baseline phase for at least 28 days and must report eDiary data for at least 20 days (includin g missing recall) during the 28- day baseline period. If less th an 28 day s of baseline data are reported, the number of headache days and other such counting variables for “baseline” will be prorated to standardize the count to a 28- day equivalent. Subsequent to treatment start, the number of headach e day s will be counted in successive and non-overlapping 4 -week (ie, 28- day) windows. Headaches that continue into a subsequent 4-week period will be counted (with recorded severit y and duration) as occurring in each period. If any postbaseline eDiary window for a par ticipa nt has at least 14 but less than 28 day s of reported data, the prorated approach will be used. If a participant reports less than 14 days of headache data, the participant ’s observed counts in that particular 28- day eDiary window will be set to missi ng for that window. These prorating rules will be applied to all ef ficacy analyses of eDiary data unless otherwise stated. 7.2.1 Primary Efficacy Variable The primary efficacy variable is the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12- week treatment period. Baseline is defined as the number of migraine days during the last 28 days of the baseline phase, ie, Day –28 to –1. 7.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables The secondary efficacy variables for the United S tates and the EU : Change from baseline in mean m onthly headache day s across the 12-week treatment period. Change from baseline in mean monthly acute medication use day s across the 12-week treatment period. At least a 50% reduction in 3-month average of monthly migraine days.

For safet y data anal yses, the participants will be analy zed according to actual treatment received (rather than a s randomized). 7.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period. The primary null h ypothesis is that atogepant treatment doses ( atogep ant10 mg, atogepant 30 mg, and atogepant 60 mg once a day ) are each equall y effective to placebo in mean change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period. The alternative h ypothesis is that at least 1 of the 3 doses of atogepant has a different effect than placebo. The primary comparison between treatment groups will be done by a mixed -effects model for repeated measures ( MMRM ) of the change from baseline. The statistical model will include treatment group, visit, prior e xposure (y es/no) to a migraine prevention medication with proven ef ficacy ,and treatment group b y visit interaction as categorical fixed ef fects. It will also include the baseline score and baseline- by-visit interaction as covariates. An unstructured covar iance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within- participant repeated measurements. The Kenward -Roger approximation (Kenward 1997 ) will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. The analys is will beperformed b ased o n all postbaseline values using only the observed cases without imputation of missing values. Pairwise contrasts in the MMRM model will be used to make the pairwise comparisons of each atogepant dose to placebo. Approval Date: 15-May-2020 16:33:54 (GMT)"

Details of the sensitivity anal yses will be provided in the statistical analysis plan. ANCOVA Model Based on 3- mon th Average of the Monthly M igraine Days The response variable for the ANCOV A model is the change from baseline in 3 -month average of monthl y migraine days for each participant. The ANCOV A model includes terms for treatment, prior exposure (y es/no) to a migra ine preventi on medicati on with proven efficac y, and baseline score. The treatment difference for atogepant doses versus placebo will be estimated and reported along with the corresponding 95% CI and nominal p-value for superiority testing. This analy sisisalso termed as “support iveanalysis”. Within -group Imputation Based on Observed Data A sensitivity analy sis will be performed based on imputation using participants from the same treatment group with observed data under the MAR assumption. Missing d atafor participant s who pre maturely discontinued are assumed to copy the profile of participants in the same treatment group with observed data. Copy-reference Approach The Copy -reference Approach will be performed on the primary endpoint to assess the robustness of the MMRM analysis to possible violation of the missing -at-random (MAR ) assumption. This sensitivity anal ysis is one t ype of pattern- mixture model s(PMM) , under which data could be missing -not- at-random (MNAR) , with repeated analyses combined via the reference based multiple imputation ( MI)procedure . Participants who discontinued in the Atogepant groups are assumed to have no treatment effect after the discontinuation. Participants are assumed to copy the profile of placebo arm and missing valu es are imputed based on the dis tribution estimated from the placebo group under the MAR using copy- reference approach.

The residuals are scaled by the inverse Cholesky root of its estimated variance- covariance matrix. The Kolmogorov -Smirnov test for normality is applied to the de-correlated and sca ledresiduals and no rmality test is rejected if p-value from the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test is less than 0.01. If the normality test is rejected, the sensitivity analysis uses MI in conjunction with robust regression to assess the robustness of the primary MMRManalysis to the possible violation of normality assumption.

The sample size of this study was selected to provide sufficient power for the primary efficacy endpoint and the first 3 secondary endpoints as shown in Table7-1. The power calculations are based on the following assumptions: 1) The treatment dif ference from placebo will be similar to the average valu e across the migraine prevention studies for atogepant (Phase 2/3 Study CGP- MD-01), telcagepant (Ho2014) and monoclonal antibodies (Dodick 2014a ; Dodick 2014b; Bigal 2015). The standard deviation of each endpoint was est imated from an internal stud y that randomized approximately 800 participants . In particular, the assumed treatment difference from placebo in change from baseline in mean mo nthly migraine days across the 12-w eek treatment period is -1.5 days, and the standard deviation is 3.5 days. Detailed treatment difference and standard deviation assumptions are listed in Table7-1. 2) The study statistical testing plan controls theoverall ty pe I error at 5% . The power calculations of the primary and secondary endpoints have taken the multiple comparisons into consideration by testing each dose versus placebo at a 0.0167 significa nce level ,2-sided.

Study center personnel must report every preg nancy on the pregnancy form within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy to the SAE/p regnancy fax number , even if no AE has occurr ed. The pregna ncy must be followed to term and the outcome reported b y completing a follow- up pregnancy form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, feta l death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs. Elective abor tions can be SAEs or AEs depending on the reason for the elective abortion (eg, fetal death, still birth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy, which would make the elective abortion an SAE). For pregnancy -related SAEs, in addition to the pregn ancy form, a separate SAE form must be filed as descri bed in Section 9.3with the appropriate serious criterion (eg, hospitalization) indicated. 9.5 ALT or AST Elevations A treatment- emergent ALT ≥ 3 × ULN and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN is cons idered an AE of special interest. Any participant with this laboratory result after study intervention was taken must have repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the abnormality. For this repeat testing, the following laboratory tests must be drawn: hematology and chemistry panels, INR, serum acetaminophen level, urine drugs of abuse screen, and blood alcohol level. An extra blood serology sample must be collected and sent to the central laboratory for further diagnostic testing a t a lat erdate if needed.

General comment Primary or secondary headache or both? Three rules apply to migraine -like headache, according to circumstances. 1.When a new headache with the characteristics of migraine occurs for the ﬁrst time in close temporal relation to anothe r disorder known to cause head ache, or fulﬁls other criteria for causation by that disorder, the new headache is coded as a secondary headache attributed tothecausative disorder. 2.When pre-existing migraine becomes chronic in close temporal relation to such a causative disorder, both the initial migraine diagnosis and the secondary diagnosis should be given. 8.2 Medication -overuse headache is a particularly important example of this: both the migraine diagnosis (episodic or chronic) and the diagnosis 8.2Medication -overuse headache should be given when medication overuse is present. 3.When pre-existing migraine is made signiﬁcan tly worse (usually meaning a twofold or greater increase in frequency and/or severity) in close temporal relation to such a causative disorder, both the initial migraine diagnosis and the secondary headache diagnosis should be given, provided that there is good evidence that the disorder can cause headache. Introduction Migraine is a common disabling primary headache disorder. Many epidemiological studies have documented its high prevalence and socio -economic and personal impacts. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD2010), it was ranked as the third most prevalent disorder in the world. In GBD2015, it was ranked the third-highest cause of disability worldwide in both males and females under the age of 50 years. Migraine has two major types: 1.1 Migraine without aura is a clinical syndrome characterized by headache with speci ﬁc features and associated symptoms; 1.2 Migraine with aura is primarily characterized by the transient focal neurological symptoms that usually precede or sometimes accompany the headache. Some patients also experience a prodromal phase, occurring hours or days before the headache, and/or a postdromal phase following headache resolution. Prodromal and postdromal symptoms include hyperactivity, hypoactivity, depression, cravings for particular foods, repetitive yawning, fatigue and neck stiffness and/or pain. When a p atient fulﬁls criteria for more than one type, subtype or subform of migraine, all should be diagnosed and coded. For example, a patient who has frequent attacks with aura but also some attacks without aura should be coded as 1.2 Migraine with aura and1.1Migraine without aura .However, since the diagnostic criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine subsume attacks of all types, subtypes or subforms, additional coding is unnecessary for episodic subtypes ofmigraine. 1.1 Migraine without aura Previously used terms: Common migraine; hemicrania simplex Description: Recurrent headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting 4 –72 hours Typical characteristics of the headache are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity and association with nausea and/or photophobia and phonophobia.

85,page_85,"Aller gan Protocol 3101 -301-002, Amendment 3 85Diagnostic criteria: A. At least ﬁve attacks1fulﬁlling criteria B–D B. Headache attacks lasting 4–72 hours (when untreated or unsuccessfully treated)2,3 C. Headache has at least two of the following four characteristics: 1. unilateral location 2. pulsating quality 3. moderate or severe pain intensity 4. aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (e.g. walking orclimbing stairs) D. During headache at least one ofthe following: 1. nausea and/or vomiting 2. photophobia and phonophobia E. Not better accounted for by another ICHD -3 diagnosis. Notes: 1.One or a few migraine attacks may be difficult to distinguish from symptomatic migraine -like attacks. Furthermore, the nature of a sin gle or a few attacks may be difficult to understand. Therefore, at least ﬁve attacks are required. Individuals who otherwise meet criteria for 1.1 Migraine without aura but have had fewer than ﬁve attacks should be coded 1.5.1 Probable migraine without aura. 2.When the patient falls asleep during a migraine attack and wakes up without it, duration of the attack isreckoned until the time ofawakening. 3.In children and adolescents (aged under 18years), attacks may last 2–72 hours (the evidence for untreated durations of less than two hours in children has not been substantiated). Comments: Migraine headache in children and adolescents (aged under 18years) ismore often bilateral than isthe case inadults; unilateral pain usually emerges in late adolescence orearly adult life. Migraine headache is usually frontotemporal. Occipital headache in children is rare and calls for diagnostic caution. A subset of otherwise typical patients have facial location of pain, which is called ‘facial migraine’ in the literatur e; there is no evidence that these patients form a separate subgroup of migraine patients. Prodromal symptoms may begin hours or a day or two before the other symp toms of a migraine attack without aura. They include various combinations of fatigue, diffculty in concentrating, neck sti ffness, sensitivity to light and/or sound, n ausea, blurred vision, yawning and pallor. Postdromal symptoms, most commonly feeling tired or weary, difficulty with concentration and neck stiffness, may follow resolution of the headache, persisting for up to 48 hours; these are less well studied. Migraine attacks can be associated with cranial autonomic symptoms and symptoms of cutaneous allodynia. In young children, photophobia and phonophobia may be inferred from their behaviour. A minority (<10%) of women have attacks of migraine in association with the majority of their menstrual cycles; most of such attacks are without aura. Attacks during menstruation tend to be longer and accompanied by more severe nausea than attacks outside the menstrual cycle. ICHD -3 offers criteria for A1.1.1 Pure menstrual migraine without aura , A1.1.2 Menstrually related migraine without aura and A1.1.3 Non- menstrual migraine without aura , but in the Appendix because of uncertainty over whether they shou ld be regarded as separate entities. Criteria are also offered for A1.2.0.1 Pure menstrual migraine with aura , A1.2.0.2 Menstrually related migraine with aura and A1.2.0.3 Non-menstrual migraine with aura to encourage better characterization of these uncommon subforms if they are separate entities. Very frequent migraine attacks are distinguished as 1.3 Chronic migraine . When there is associatedmedication overuse, both ofthediagnoses 1.3Chronic migraine and 8.2 Medication -overuse headache should be applied. 1.1 Migraine without aura isthedisease most prone toaccelerate with frequent useofsymptomatic medication. Regional cerebral blood ﬂow imaging shows nochanges suggestive of cortical spreading depression (CSD) during attacks of 1.1 Migraine withou taura ,although blood ﬂow changes inthe brainstem may occur, as may cortical changes secondary topain activation. This contrasts with the pathognomonic spreading oligaemia of1.2Migraine with aura .While thebulk oftheliterature suggests that CSD doe s not occur in 1.1Migraine without aura , some recent studies disagree. Furthermore, ithasbeen suggested that glial waves orother cortical phenomena may be involved in1.1Migraine without aura . The messenger molecules nitric oxide (NO), serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) areinvolved. While the disease was previously regarded asprimarily vascular, the importance of sensitization of pain path ways, and thepossibility that attacks may originate inthecentral nervous system, have gainedincreasing attention over the last decades. At the same time, the circuitry of migraine pain, thetrigeminovascular system, andseveral aspects of its neurotransmission peripherally and inthe trigeminal nucleus caudalis, centr al mesencephalic grey and thalamus, have been recognized.

86,page_86,"Aller gan Protocol 3101 -301-002, Amendment 3 86(triptans), 5 -HT 1Freceptor agonists andCGRP receptor antagonists have demonstrated efficacy inthe acute treatment of migraine attacks. Because of their high receptor -speciﬁcity, their mechan isms ofaction provide new insight into migraine mechanisms. It is now clear that1.1 Migraine without aura isaneurobiological disorder, while clinical aswell asbasic neuroscience studies continue to advance our knowledge of migraine mechanisms. 1.2 Migraine with aura Previously used terms: Classic or classical migraine; ophthalmic, hemiparaesthetic, hemiplegic or aphasic migraine; migraine accompagne e; complicated migraine. Description: Recurrent attacks, lasting minutes, of unilateral fully reversible visual, sensory or other central nervous system symptoms that usually develop gradually and are usually followed by headache and associated migraine symptoms. Diagnostic criteria: A. Atleast two attacks fulﬁlling criteria BandC B. One or more of the following fully reversible aura symptoms: 1. visual 2. sensory 3. speech and/or language 4. motor 5. brainstem 6. retinal C. Atleast three ofthefollowing six characteristics: 1. at least one aura symptom spreads gradually over ≥5minutes 2. two or more aura symptoms occur in succession 3. each individual aura symptom lasts 5 –60 minutes1 4. at least one aura symptom is unilateral2 5. atleast oneaura symptom ispositive3 6. the aura is accompanied, or followed within 60 minutes, by headache D. Not better accounted for by another ICHD -3 diagnosis. Notes: 1.When, for example, three symptoms occur during an aura, the acceptable maximal duration is 3 x 60 minutes. Motor symptoms may lastup to72hours. 2.Aphasia is always regarded as a unilateral symptom; dysarthria may or may not be.3.Scintillations and pins and needles are positive symptoms of aura. Comments: Many patients who have migraine attacks with aura also have attacks without aura; they should be coded as both 1.2 Migraine with aura and 1.1 Migraine without aura . Field testing has compared the diagnosti c criteria for 1.2 Migraine with aura in the main body of ICHD -3 beta with those for A1.2 Migraine with aura in the Appendix. The latter performed better in distinguishing migraine with aura from transient ischaemic attacks . These are now adopted in ICHD -3, which no longer has Appendix criteria for this disorder. The aura is the complex of neurological symptoms that occurs usually before the headache of 1.2 Migraine with aura , but it may begin after the headache phase has commenced or continue into the head ache phase. Visual aura is the m ost common type of aura, occur ring in over 90% of patients with 1.2 Migraine with aura , at least in some attacks. It often presen ts as a fortiﬁcation spectrum: a zigzag ﬁgure near the point of ﬁxation that may gradually spread right or left and assume a laterally convex shape with an angulated scintillating edge, leaving absolute or variable degrees of relative scotoma in its wake. In other cases, scotoma without positive phenomena may occur; this is often perceived as being of acute onset but, on scrutiny, usually enlarges gradually. In children and adolescents, less typical bilateral visual symptoms occur that may represent an aura . A visual aura rating scale with high speciﬁcity and sensitivity has been developed and validated. Next in frequency are sensory disturbances, in the form of pins and needles moving slowly from the point of origin and a ffecting a greater or smaller part of one side of the body, face and/or tongue. Numbness may occur in its wake, but numbness may also be the only symptom. Less frequent are speech disturbances, usually aphasic but often hard to categorize. Systematic studies have demonstrated that many patients with visual aura occasionally have symptoms in the extremities and/or speech symptoms. Conversely, patients with symptoms in the extremities and/or speech or language symptoms almost always also experience visual a ura symptoms at least during some atta cks. A distinction between migraine with visual aura, migraine with hemiparaesthetic aura and migraine with speech and/or language aura is probably arti ﬁcial, and therefore not recognized in this classiﬁcation: they are all coded as 1.2.1 Migraine with typ ical aura.

87,page_87,"Aller gan Protocol 3101 -301-002, Amendment 3 87When aura symptoms are multiple, they usually follow one another in succession, beginning with visual, then sensory, then aphasic; but the reverse and other orders have been noted. The accepted duration for most aura symptoms is one hour, but motor symptoms are often longer lasting. Patients with aura symptoms arising from the brain stem arecoded as1.2.2 Migraine with brainstem aura ,but they almost always have additional typical aura symptoms. When the aura includes motor weakness, the disorder should be coded as 1.2.3 Hemiplegic migraine or one of its subforms. 1.2.3 Hemiplegic migraine is classi ﬁed as a separate subtype because of genetic and patho physiological differences from 1.2.1 Migraine with typical aura . Patients with 1.2.3 Hemiplegic migraine often have brainstem symptoms inaddition. Patients often ﬁnd ithard todescribe their aura symptoms, in which case they should be instructed to time and record them prospectively. The clinical picture then becomes clearer. Common mistakes are incorrect reports of lateralization, of sudden rather than gradual onset and of monocular rather than homonymous visual disturbances, as well as of duration of aura and mistaking sensory loss for weakness. After an initial consult ation, use ofan aura diary mayclarify thediagnosis. Migraine aura is sometimes associated with a headache that does notfulﬁll criteria for1.1Migraine without aura , but this is still regarded as a migraine headache because of its relation to the aura. In other cases, migraine aura may occur without headache. Before or simultaneously with the onset of aura symptoms, regional ce rebral blood ﬂow is decreased in the cortex corresponding to the clinically affected area and often over a wider area. Blood ﬂow reduction usually starts posteriorly and spreads anteriorly, and is usually above the ischaemic threshold. After one to sever al hours, grad ual transition into hyperaemia occurs in the same region. Cortical spreading depression ofLeaoisthelikely underlying mechanism. The previously deﬁned syndromes, migraine with prolonged aura and migraine with acute -onset aura , have been abandon ed. It is not rare for aura to last more than one hour but, in most such cases, patients have at least two of the other characteristics of criterion C. Even when most of a patient’s attacks do not fulﬁl criterion C, it is usual that other attacks fulﬁl criteria for one of the recognized subtypes or subforms of 1.2 Migraine with aura , and this should be the diagnosis. The few other cases should be coded to 1.5.2 Probable migraine with aura, specifying the atypical feature (prolonged aura or acute -onset aura) in parenthesis. The diagnosis is usually evident after a careful history alone, although there are rare secondary mimics i ncluding carotid dissection, arteriovenous malformation andseizure.Prodromal symptoms may begin hours oradayortwo before the other symptoms of a migraine attack with aura. They include various combinations of fatigue, difﬁculty in concentrating, neck stiﬀness, sensitivity to light and/or sound, nausea, blurred vision, yawning and pallor. The term ‘prodrome’, which has replace d ‘premonitory phase’ or ‘premonitory symptoms’, does not include aura. Postdromal symptoms, most commonly feeling tired or weary, difficulty with concentration and neck stiffness, may follow resolution of the headache, persisting for up to 48 hours; these are less well studied. 1.2.1 Migraine with typical aura Description: Migraine with aura, in which aura consists of visual and/or sensory and/or speech/language symptoms, but no motor weakness, and is characterized by gradual development, duration of each symptom no longer than one hour, a mix of positive and negative features and complete reversibility Diagnostic criteria: A. Attacks ful ﬁlling criteria for 1.2 Migraine with aura and criterion B below B. Aura with both of the following: 1. fully reversible visual, sensory and/or speech/ language symptoms 2. no motor, brainstem or retinal symptoms. 1.2.1.1 Typical aura with headache Description: Migraine with typical aura in which aura is accompanied or followed within 60minutes by head ache with or without migraine characteristics. Diagnostic criteria: A. Attacks ful ﬁlling criteria for 1.2.1 Migraine with typical aura and criterion B below B. Headache, with orwithout migraine characteristics, accompanies orfollows the aura within 60minutes. 1.2.1.2 Typical aura without headache Description: Migraine with typical aura in which aura is neither accompanied nor followed by headache of any sort.

No headache accompanies or follows the aura within 60 minutes. Comments: In some patients, a typical aura is always followed by migraine headache, but many patients have, in addition, attacks with aura followed by a less distinct headache or even without headache. A number of patients have, exclusively, 1.2.1.2 Typica l aura with out headache . In the absence of headache ful ﬁlling criteria for 1.1 Migraine without aura ,theprecise diagnosis ofaura and its distinction from mimics that may signal serious dis ease (e.g. transient ischaemic attack) becomes more dif ﬁcult and often requires investigat ion. When aura occurs for the ﬁrst time after age 40, when symptoms are exclusively negative (e.g. hemianopia) or when aura is prolonged or very short, other causes, particularly transient ischaemic attacks, should beruled out. 1.2.2 Migraine with brainstem aura Previously used terms: Basilar artery migraine; basilar migraine; basilar -type migraine. Description: Migraine with aura symptoms clearly originating from the brainstem, but no motor weakness. Diagnostic criteria: A. Attacks ful ﬁlling criteria for 1.2 Migraine with aura and criterion B below B. Aura with both of the following: 1. at least two of the following fully reversible brainstem symptoms: a. dysarthria1 b. vertigo2 c. tinnitus d. hypacusis3 e. diplopia4 f.ataxia not attributable to sensory deﬁcit g. decreased level of co nsciousness (GCS ≤13)5 2. no motor6or retinal symptoms. Notes: 1.Dysarthria should be distinguished from aphasia. 2.Vertigo does not embrace and should be distinguished from dizziness. 3.This criterion is not fulﬁlled by sensations of ear fullness. 4.Diplopia does n ot embrace (or exclude) blurred vision. 5.The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score may have been assessed during admission; alternatively, deficits clearly described by the patient allow GCS estimation. 6.When motor symptoms are present, code as 1.2.3 Hemiplegic mig raine . Comments: Originally the terms basilar artery migraine or basilar migraine were used but, since involvement of the basilar artery is unlikely, the term migraine with brainstem aura ispreferred. There are typical aura symptoms in addition to the brainstem symptoms during most attacks. Many patients who have attacks with brainstem aura also report other attacks with typical aura and should be coded forboth 1.2.1 Migraine with typical aura and 1.2.2 Migraine with brainstem aura . Many of the symptoms l isted under criterion B1 may occur with anxiety and hyperventilation, and are therefore subject to misinterpretation. 1.2.3 Hemiplegic1migraine Description: Migraine with aura including motor weakness. Diagnostic criteria: A. Attacks ful ﬁlling criteria for 1.2 Migraine with aura and criterion B below B. Aura consisting ofboth ofthefollowing: 1. fully reversible motor weakness2 2. fully reversible visual, sensory and/or speech/ language symptoms. Notes: 1.The term plegic means paralysis in most languages, but most attacks are characterized by motor weakness. 2.Motor symptoms generally last less than 72hours but, in some patients, motor weakness may persist for weeks. Comment: It may be difficult to distinguish weakness from sensory loss. Approval Date: 15-May-2020 16:33:54 (GMT)"

Diagnostic criteria: A. Attacks ful ﬁlling criteria for 1.2.3 Hemiplegic migraine B. At least one ﬁrst-or second -degree relative has had attacks fulﬁlling criteria for 1.2.3 Hemiplegic migraine . Comments: New genetic data have allowed amore precise deﬁnition of 1.2.3.1 Familial hemiplegic migraine than was previously possible. Speci ﬁc genetic subforms have been identiﬁed: in FHM1 there are mutations in the CACNA1A gene (coding for a calcium channel) on chromosome 19; in FHM2 there are mutations in the ATP1A2 gene (codin g for a K/Na -ATPase) on chromo some 1; and in FHM3 there are mutations in the SCN1A gene (coding for a sodium channel) on chromosome 2. There may beother loci notyet identiﬁed. When genetic testing isdone, the genetic subform (if discovered) should be speci ﬁedattheﬁfth digit. It has been shown that 1.2.3.1 Familial hemiplegic migraine very often presents with brainstem symptoms in addition to the typical aura sympt oms, and that headache almost always occurs. Rarely, during FHM attacks, disturbances of consciousness (sometimes including coma), confusion, fever and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) pleocytosis can occur. 1.2.3.1 Familial hemiplegic migraine may bemistaken forepilepsy and treated (unsuccessfully) as such. FHM attacks can be triggered by (mild) head trauma. In approximately 50% of FHM families, chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia occurs independently of the migraine attacks. 1.2.3.1.1 Familial hemiplegic migr aine type 1 (FHM1) Diagnostic criteria: A.

Comments: Epidemiological studies have shown that sporadic cases occur with approximately the same prevalence as familial cases. The attacks in 1.2.3.2 Sporadic hemiplegic migraine have the same clinic al characteristics as those in 1.2.3.1 Familial hemiplegic migraine .

A lumbar puncture may be necessary to rule out 7.3.5 Syndrome of transient headache andneurologi cal deﬁcits with cerebrospinal ﬂuid lymphocytosis (HaNDL) . 1.2.4 Retinal migraine Description: Repeated attacks of monocular visual disturbance, including scintillations, scotomata or blindness, associated with migraine headache. Diagnostic criteria: A. Attacks f ulﬁlling criteria for 1.2 Migraine with aura and criterion B below B. Aura characterized byboth ofthefollowing: 1. fully reversible, monocular, positive and/or negative visual phenomena (e.g. scintillations, scotomata or blindness) conﬁrmed during an attack byeither or both ofthefollowing: a. clinical visual ﬁeld examination b. the patient’s drawing of a monocular ﬁeld defect (made after clear instruction) 2. at least two of the following: a. spreading gradually over ≥5 minutes b. symptoms last 5 –60minutes c. accompanied, or followed within 60 minutes, by headache C. Not better accounted for by another ICHD -3 diagnosis, and other causes of amaurosis fugax have been excluded. Comments: Some patients who complain of monocular visual disturbance in fact have hemianopia. Some cases without headache have been reported, but migraine as the underlying aetiology cannot be ascertained. 1.2.4 Retinal migraine is an extremely rare cause of transient monocular visual loss. Cases of permanent monocular visual loss associated with migraine ha ve been described. Appropriate investigations are required to exclude other causes of transient monocular blindness. 1.3 Chronic migraineDescription: Headache occurring on 15 or more days/ month for more than three months, which, on at least eight days/mo nth, hasthefeatures of migraine headache.

Not bette r accounted for by another ICHD -3 diagnosis.3–5 Notes: 1.The reason forsingling out1.3Chronic migraine from types of episodic migraine is that it is impossible to distinguish the individual episodes of headache in patients with such frequent or continuous headaches. In fact, the charact eristics of the headache may change not only from day to day but even within the same day. Such patients are extremely diﬃcult to keep medication -free in order t o observe the natural history of the headache. In this situation, attacks with and those without aura are both counted, as are both migraine -like and tension -type-like headaches (but not secondary headaches). 2.Characterization of frequently recurring headache generally requires a headache diary torecord information on pain and associated symptoms day by day for at least one month. 3.Because tension -type-like headache is within the diagnostic criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine , this diagnosis excludes the diagnosis of 2. Tension - type headache or its types. 4.4.10 New daily persistent headache may have features suggestive of1.3Chronic migraine .The latter disorder evolves over time from 1.1 Migraine without aura and/ or 1.2Migraine with aura ; therefore, when these criteria A–C are fulﬁlled by headache that, unambiguously, is daily and unremitting from <24 hours after its ﬁrst onset, code as4.10 New daily persistent head ache .When themanner ofonset isnot Approval Date: 15-May-2020 16:33:54 (GMT)"
91,page_91,"Aller gan Protocol 3101 -301-002, Amendment 3 91remembered or isotherwise uncertain, code as 1.3Chronic migraine . 5.The most common cause of symptoms suggestive ofchronic migraine is medication overuse, asdeﬁned under 8.2Medication -overuse headache .Around 50% of patients apparently with 1.3 Chronic migraine revert to an episodic migraine type after drug withdrawal; such patients are in a sense wrongly diagnosed as 1.3 Chronic migraine . Equally, many patients apparently overusing medication do not improve after drug withdrawal; the diagnosis of 8.2 Medication -overuse headache may be inappropriate for these (assuming that chronicity induced by drug overuse is always reversible). For these reasons, and because of the general rule to apply all relevant diagnoses, patients meeting criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine and for8.2 Medication -overuse headache should be coded for both. After drug withdrawal, migraine will either revert to an episodic type or remain chronic and should be re -diagnosed accordingly; in the latter case, the diagnosis of 8.2 Medication -overuse headache mayberescinded. 1.4 Complications of migraine Comment: Code separately for both the migraine type, subtype or subform and for the complication. 1.4.1 Status migrainosus Description: A debilitating migraine attack lasting for more than 72 hours. Diagnost ic criteria: A. A headache attack ful ﬁlling criteria B and C B. Occurring in a patient with 1.1 Migraine without aura and/or 1.2 Migraine with aura , and typical of previous attacks except forits duration andseverity C.

Notes: 1.Remissions of up to 12 hours due to medication or sleep are accepted. 2.Milder cases, notmeeting criterion C2, are coded 1.5.1 Probable migraine without aura.Comment: Headache with the features of 1.4.1 Status migrainosus may often be caused by medication overuse. When headache in these circumstances meets the criteria for 8.2 Medication -overuse headache , code for this disorde r and the relevant type or subtype of migraine but not for 1.4.1 Status migrainosus . When overuse of medication is of shorter duration than three months, code for the appropriate migraine type or subtype(s) only. 1.4.2 Persistent aura without infarction Description: Aura symptoms persisting for one week or more without evidence of infarction on neuroimaging. Diagnostic criteria: A. Aura ful ﬁlling criterion B B. Occurring in a patient with 1.2 Migraine with aura and typical of previous auras except that one or more aura symptoms persists for ≥1week C. Neuroimaging shows no evidence of infarction D. Not bette r accounted for by another ICHD -3 diagnosis. Comments: Persistent aura symptoms are rare but well documented. They are often bilateral and may last for months or years. The one-week minimum in criterion B is based on the opinion of experts and should be formally studied. Diagnostic work -up must distinguish 1.4.2 Persistent aura without infarction from 1.4.3 Migrainous infarction and exclude symptomatic aura due t o cerebral infarction of other causes. Attacks with prolonged aura lasting less than one week and not ful ﬁlling criteria for 1.2.1 Migraine with typical aura are coded 1.5.2 Probable migraine with aura. 1.4.3 Migrainous infarction Description: One or more migraine aura symptoms occurring in association with an ischaemic brain lesion in the appropriate territory demonstrated by neuroimaging, with onset during the course of a typical migraine with aura attack.

Neuroimaging demonstrates ischaemic infarction in a relevant area D. Not bette r accounted for by another ICHD -3 diagnosis. Note: 1. There may be additional symptoms attributable to the infarction. Comments: Ischaemic stroke in a migraine sufferer may be categorized as cerebral infarction of other cause coexisting with 1. Migraine , cerebral infarction of other cause presenting with symptoms resembling 1.2 Migraine with aura , or cereb ral infarction occurring during the course of a typical attack of 1.2 Migraine with aura. Only the last fulﬁls criteria for 1.4.3 Migrainous infarction . 1.4.3 Migrainous infarction mostly occurs in the posterior circulation and in younger women. A twofold increased risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with 1.2 Migraine with aura has been demonstrated in several population- based studies. However, it should be noted that these infarctions are not migrainous infarctions. The mechanisms of the increased risk ofischaemic stroke in migraine sufferers remain unclear; likewise, the relationship between increased risk and frequency of aura and the nature of aura symptoms denoting the increase in risk are unknown. Most studies have shown a lack of association between 1.1 Migraine without aura and ischaemic stroke. 1.4.4 Migraine aura-triggered seizure Description: A seizure triggered by an attack of migraine with aura. Diagnostic criteria: A. A seizure ful ﬁlling diagnostic criteria for one type of epileptic attack, and criterion B below B. Occurring inapatient with 1.2Migraine with aura , and during or within one hour after an attack of migraine with aura C. Not bette r accounted for by another ICHD -3 diagnosis.Comment: Migraine and epilepsy are prototypical examples of parox ysmal brain disorders. While migraine -like headaches are quite frequently seen in the epileptic post-ictal period, sometimes aseizure occurs during or following a migraine attack. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as migralepsy , is a rare event, originally described in patients with 1.2 Migraine with aura . Evidence of an association with 1.1 Migraine without aura islacking. 1.5 Probable migraine Previously used term: Migrainous disorder. Coded elsewhere: Migraine -like headache secondary to another disorder (symptomatic migraine ) is coded according to that disorder. Description: Migraine -like attacks missing one of the features required to ful ﬁl all criteria for a type or subtype of migraine coded above, and not fulﬁlling criteria for another headache disorder. Diagnostic criteria: A. Attacks fulﬁlling allbutone ofcriteria A-D for1.1Migraine without aura ,orallbut one of criteria A –C for 1.2 Migraine with aura B. Not fulﬁlling ICHD -3 criteria for any other headache disorder C. Not better accounted for by another ICHD -3 diagnosis. Comment: In making a headache diagnosis, attacks that fulﬁl criteria for both 2. Tension -type headache and 1.5 Probable migraine are coded as the former in accordance with the general rule that a deﬁnite diagnosis always trumps a probable diagnosis. However, in patients who already have a migraine diagnosis, and where the issue is to count the number of attacks they are having (e.g. as an outcome measure in a drug trial), attacks fulﬁlling criteria for 1.5 Probable migraine should be counted as migraine. The reason for this is that mild migraine attacks, or attacks treated early, often do not achieve all characteristics necessary for a migraine attack diagnosis but nevertheless respond to speciﬁc migraine treatments. 1.5.1 Probable migraine without aura Diagnostic criteria: A.

Comments: This group of disorders occurs in patients who also have 1.1 Migraine without aura or 1.2 Migraine with aura , or who have an increased likelihood to develop either of these disorders. Althou gh historicall y noted to occur in childhood, they may also occur in adults. Additional conditions that may also occur in these patients include episodes of motion sickness and periodic sleep disorders including sleep walking, sleep talking, night terrors and bruxism. 1.6.1 Recurrent gastrointestinal disturbance Previously used terms: Chronic abdominal pain; functional abdominal pain; functional dyspepsia; irritable bowel syndrome; functional abdominal pain syndrome. Description: Recurrent episodic attacks of abdominal pain and/or discomfort, nausea and/or vomiting, occurring infrequently, chronically or at predictable intervals, that may be associated with migraine. Diagnostic criteria: A. At least ﬁve attacks with distinct episodes of abdominal pain and/or dis comfort and/or nausea and/or vomiting B. Normal gastrointestinal examination and evaluation C. Not attributed to another disorder.1.6.1.1 Cyclic vomiting syndrome Description: Recurrent episodic attacks of intense nausea and vomiting, usually stereotypical in the individual and with predictable timing of episodes.

All of the following: 1. nausea and vomiting occur at least four times per hour 2. attacks lastfor≥1 hour, up to 10days 3. attacks occur ≥ 1 week apart D. Complete freedom from symptoms between attacks E. Not attributed to another disorder.1 Note: 1. In particular, history and physical examination do not show signs of gastrointestinal disease. Comments: 1.6.1. 1 Cyclic vomiting syndrome is typically a self -limiting episodic condition occurring in child hood, with periods of complete normality between episodes. The cyclic nature is the hallmark, and attacks are predictable. This disorder was ﬁrst included as a chi ldhood periodic syndrome in ICHD- II. The clinical features of this syndrome resemble those found in association with migraine headaches, and multiple threads of research over the last years have suggested that 1.6.1.1 Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a conditio n related to migraine. 1.6.1.2 Abdominal migraine Description: An idiopathic disorder seen mainly in children as recurrent attacks of moderate to severe midline abdominal pain, associated with vasomotor symptoms, nausea and vomiting, lasting 2 –72 hours and with normality between episodes. Headache does not occur during these episodes. Approval Date: 15-May-2020 16:33:54 (GMT)"
94,page_94,"Aller gan Protocol 3101 -301-002, Amendment 3 94Diagnostic criteria: A. At least ﬁve attacks of abdominal pain, fulﬁlling criteria B–D B. Pain has at least two of the following three characteristics: 1. midline location, periumbilical or poorly localized 2. dull or ‘just sore’ quality 3. moderate or severe intensity C. At least two of the following four associated symptoms or signs: 1. anorexia 2. nausea 3. vomiting 4. pallor D. Attacks last2–72 hours when untreated or unsuccessfully treated E. Complete freed om from symptoms between attacks F. Not attributed to another disorder.1 Note: 1.In particular, history and physical examination do not show signs of gastrointestinal or renal disease, or such disease has been ruled out by appropriate investigations. Comments: Pain of 1.6.1.2 Abdominal migraine is severe enough to interfere with normal daily activities. In young children, the presence of headache is often overlooked. A careful history of presence or absence of headache must be taken and, when headache or head pain during attacks is identiﬁed, a diagnosis of 1.1 Migraine without aura should be considered.Children may ﬁnd it difficult to distinguish anorexia from nausea. Pallor is often accompanied by dark shadows under the eyes. In a few patients, ﬂushing is the predominant vasomotor phenomenon.Most children with abdominal migraine will develop migraine headache later in life. 1.6.2 Benign paroxysmal vertigo Description: A disorder characterized by recurrent brief attacks of vertigo, occurring without warning and resolving spontaneously, in otherwise healthy children.Diagnostic criteria: A. Atleast ﬁve attacks fulﬁlling criteria BandC B. Vertigo1occurring without warning, maximal at onset and resolving spontaneously after minutes to hours without loss of consciousness C. At least one of the following ﬁve associated symptoms or signs: 1. nystagmus 2. ataxia 3. vomiting 4. pallor 5. fearfulness D. Normal neurological examination and audiometric and vestibular functions between attacks E. Not attributed to another disorder.2 Notes: 1.Young children with vertigo may not be able to describe vertiginous symptoms. Parental observatio n of episodic periods of unsteadiness may be interpreted as vertigo in young children. 2.In particular, posterior fossa tumours, seizures and vestibular disorders have been excluded. Comment: The relationship between 1.6.2 Benign paroxysmal vertigo and A1.6. 6 Vestibular migraine (see Appendix) needs to be further examined. 1.6.3 Benign paroxysmal torticollis Description: Recurrent episodes of head tilt to one side, perhaps with slight rotation, which remit spontaneously. The condition occurs in infants and small children, with onset in the ﬁrst year. Diagnostic criteria: A. Recurrent attacks1in a young child, fulﬁlling criteria B and C B. Tilt of the head to either side, with or without slight rotation, remitting spontaneously after minutes to days C. At least one of the following ﬁve associated symptoms or signs: 1. pallor 2. irritability 3. malaise 4. vomiting 5. ataxia2 D. Normal neurological examination between attacks E. Not attributed to another disorder.3 Approval Date: 15-May-2020 16:33:54 (GMT)"
95,page_95,"Aller gan Protocol 3101 -301-002, Amendment 3 95Notes: 1.Attacks tend to recur monthly. 2.Ataxia is more likely in older children within the affected age group. 3.The differe ntial diagnosis includes gastro -oesophageal reﬂux, idiopat hic torsional dystonia and complex partial seizure, but particular attention must be paid to the posterior fossa and craniocervical junction where congenit al or acquired lesions may produce torticollis. Comments: The child’s head can be returned to the neutral position during attacks: some resistance may be encountered but can be overcome. These observations need further validation by patient diaries, structu red interviews and longitudinal data collection. 1.6.3 Benign paroxysmal torticollis may evolve into 1.6.2 Benign paroxysmal vertigo or 1.2 Migraine with aura (particularly 1.2.2 Migraine with brainstem aura ) or cease without further symptoms.

The criteria below should be used to determine eligibility related to the number of prior failed migraine- preventive medications with unique mechanisms of action. For ef ficacy : Failure is defined as a < 50% reduction in migraine day s per month per investigator judgment and participant interview. Medications must have been started within the past 7 years. For tolerability : Failure is defined as discontinuation of a drug treatment due to adverse effects. Inassessing failure of a migraine preventive drug on the basis of inadequate tolerability, the entire medical history can be considered. For example, a participant who tried and discontinued topiramate 10 years ago for cognitive clouding should be considere d to have failed this treatment. Approval Date: 15-May-2020 16:33:54 (GMT)"
