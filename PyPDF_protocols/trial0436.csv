Amendment 3 (15-Jun-2020) This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Overall rationale for the amendmentThe main reason for the amendment is to modify the statistical analyses to account for the unusually high number of missing information due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in this trial. Statistical analysis was therefore revisited to ensure an unbiased evaluation of the treatment effect in the trial. The contingency measures to minimise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this trial are already implemented by 2 addendums. The first addendum gives an opportunity for the subjects to continue treatment with tralokinu mab via home-use (self-injection) to provide continued therapy and ensure the safety of the subjects ( Appendix 8, COVID-19). The second addendum includes the possibility of remote a ssessments related to efficacy via a mobile application ( Appendix 9, Imagine for Studies). The second addendum has been submitted to the Ethics Committees in Poland and Spain. TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe and/or more extensive condition. 2IGA (Investigator’s Global Assessment) is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject ’s global AD and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). 3SCORAD (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis) is a validated tool to evaluate the extent and severity of AD lesions, along with subjective symptoms. The maximum total score is 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease. 4 Subjects will assess their worst itch severity over the past 24 hours using an 11-point numeric rating scale ( ‘Worst Daily Pruritus NRS ’) with 0 indicating ‘no itch ’and 10 indicating ‘worst itch imaginable ’. 5DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. It consists of 10 items addressing the subject ’s perception of the impact of their skin disease on different aspects of their health-related quality of life (HRQ oL) over the last week such as dermatology- related symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4- point Likert scale (0 = not at all ⁄ not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; 3 =very much). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor HRQoL. Final collection of data for the primary endpointWeek 16 TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

Duration of treatmentEach subject’s trial participation will be up to 46 weeks, divided into a screening period (including washout, if applicable) of up to 6 weeks, a treatment period of 26 weeks, and a follow-up period of 14 weeks. Eligible subjects may be invited to enter a long -term exten sion trial conducted under a separate protocol (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND). Subjects who transfer to ECZTEND must have had their last visit in the treatment period (Week 26 under the current protocol). Number of subjectsA total of 250 subjects will be randomised 1:1 to treatment with tralokinumab 300 mg+TCS or placebo+TCS. Number and distribution of trial sitesUp to 40 clinical sites in Europe are anticipated. Distribution between countries will be based on feasibility. Inclusion of subjects from Germany is prioritised. Statistical methodsAnalysis of primary endpoint : For each of 100 imputed data sets, the difference in response rates between treatment groups will be analysed using the Mantel -Haenszel risk difference stratified by prior CSA use (yes/no) and baseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 4). The estimates and standard errors from the 100 analyses will be pooled to one estimated treatment difference and associated standard error using Rubin’s rule to draw inference. From these pooled estimates, the 95% CI for the treatment difference will be calculated.

In its severe form, AD is characterised by widespread skin lesions, intractable itch, as well as increas ed susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and fungal skin infections ( 1-4). AD is associated with a substantial patient burden that typically inc ludes poor quality of life and sleep disturbance ( 5). AD is characterised by an activated T -helper -2 (Th2) pathway with increased expression of key Th2 cytok ines including interleukin (IL) -13 (6,7). The expression of IL-13 is increased in lesional skin compared to non -lesional skin, and the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing IL-13 is upregulated in AD patients compared to ind ividuals without AD ( 6, 8). IL-13 acts on keratinocytes to release C -C motif chemokine ligand 22 and recruit more IL-13 expressing Th2 cells, decrease differentiati on, and contribute to decreased barrier function ( 9). IL-13 also drives immunoglobulin E (IgE) production and contributes to mast cell activation status and, once allergen cross -links IgE on the cell surface, drives histamine release and induc es itch ( 10, 11). Indeed, itch is a key issue in AD, which drives sig nificant mechanical damage to the skin and further facilitates allergen and pathogen entry. These effects together drive and exacerbate the disease phenotype. A review of the available preclinical literature from mouse and human ex vivo models suggests IL -13 as a, if not the, central mediator of the AD skin phenotype. Indeed, there is evidence that b locking the IL -4 receptor (which is part of the receptor complex that also binds IL -13) with the monoclonal antibody dupilumab leads to clinical improvement in subjects with AD ( 12). 5.2 Experience with investigational medicinal product Tralokinumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass that specifically binds to human IL -13 and blocks interaction with the IL -13 receptors ( 13–15). A compilation of clinical and nonclinical data on tralokinumab including pharmacokinetics (PK) is given in the current version of the Investigator ’s Brochure. In total, more than 4,340 subjects have been treated with tralokinumab (cut -off date: 18-Oct-2018 ) as determined from actual exposure data from completed clinical trials and the enrolment/randomisation schemes for ongoing trials. A phase 3 development program me is ongoing in AD , and o ther clinical trials with tralokinumab have bee n conducted in subjects with asthma, ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and in healthy subjects.

36,page_36,"Trial ID: LP0162-1346 Date: 15-Jun-2020 Version: 4.0 Page 36 of 170 doses studied so far have had an acceptable be nefit/risk profile and no major safety concerns have been identified. Possible risks associat ed with use of traloki numab are summarised in Section 5.6. In a phase 2b trial (D2213C00001), adults with moderate -to-severe AD on a background of mild to moderate topical corticosteroids (TCS) were treated with 3 different regimens of tralokinumab (45mg every other week [Q2W], 150 mg Q2W, or 300 mg Q2W) or placebo to evaluate the safety and efficacy over a treat ment period of 12 weeks. The primary endpoints were change from baseline in Eczema Area a nd Severity Index (EASI) at Week 12 and the percen tage of subjects achieving Investigator ’s Global Assessment (IGA) response of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 12. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in EASI and Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) scores, and the percentage of subjects achieving at least 50% reduction from baseline in EASI and SCORAD scores (EASI50 and SCORAD50). In the overall intent -to-treat phase 2b population, an improvement in EASI score at Week 12 was seen in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group versus placebo. 26% of subjects achieved an IGA of 0 or 1 in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group versus 12% in the placebo group. The most commonly reported causally related treatment -emergent adverse event (AE) was upper respiratory tract infection (6 subjects [3.9%] in the comb ined tralokinumab group [45 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg] and 2 subjects [3.9%] in the placebo group). 5.3 Trial rationale Treatment recommendations for AD include topical therapies, the main being TCS. Unfortunately, TCS and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) ha ve limited efficacy in patients with moderate -to-severe disease. TCS and non -biologic systemic therapies (e.g. CSA, azathioprine) are all associated with toxicities with long -term use ( 16-18). Patients that are unresponsive or unable to use topical treatments or CSA therefore have few treatment options. The recently approved biological agent dupilumab exhibits an acceptable benef it-risk ratio in clinical trials investigating subjects with moderate -to-severe AD, however there is limited experience with long -term dupilumab use in the post -marketing setting. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of tralokinu mab in combination with TCS compared to placebo in combination with TCS in treating severe AD in subjects who are not adequately controlled with or having contraindications to oral CSA . In addition, secondary endpoints addressing symptom scores and extent of AD (IGA, SCORAD), itch - related sleep loss and it ch severity, and health -related quality of life (HRQoL) measures related to AD are also included.

37,page_37,"Trial ID: LP0162-1346 Date: 15-Jun-2020 Version: 4.0 Page 37 of 170 Thus , the trial will contribute to the characterisation of the benefit -risk profile of tralokinumab by considering a more difficult to treat patient population where treatment options are few . 5.4 Justification for dose The dose selected for the tralokinumab phase 3 development programme is 300 mg Q2W administered subcutaneously. All subjects randomised to treatment with tralokinumab will get an initial loading dose of 600 mg on D ay 0 (baseline). The administration of the loading dose of tralokinumab will allow system ic concentrations to reach steady state faster, and potentially reduce the time to onset of clinical effect. The serum concentrations of tralokinumab after the 600mg loading dose will not exceed the serum tralokinumab concentrations at steady state for th e 300 mg Q2W. The tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W dose was chosen based on the results of the phase 2b trial in subjects with moderate -to-severe AD (trial D2 213C00001) described in Section 5.2. The subjects were treated with 3 different fixed dose regimens o f tralokinumab (45, 150, or 300mg Q2W) or placebo to evaluate safety and efficacy over a treatment period of 12 weeks. In the overall intention -to-treat phase 2b population, a statistically significant improvement in EASI change from baseline at Week 12 was observed in the tralokinumab 30 0mg group versus placebo; however, formal statistical significance was not demonstrated for the c o- primary endpoint IGA. The key secondary a nd exploratory endpoint results from trial D2213C00001 also supported the selection of the traloki numab Q2W 300 mg dose for phase 3 development; and overall, larger numeric al differences were observed for 300 mg tralokinumab dose than for 150 mg compared to placebo for most of the trial endpoints. Since the safety profile in trial D2213C00001 was acceptable in all trea tment cohorts and no clear safety -related dose -response pattern was identified, the dose of 300 mg Q2W has been selected for evaluation in the phase 3 deve lopment programme for tralokinumab in AD. 5.5 Ethical considerations No children or other vulnerable subj ects incapable of giving informed consent will be enrolled in this clinical trial. Furthermore, women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to become pregnant will not be enrolled in this clinical trial. Women of child -bearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of c ontraception to prevent pregnancy during the clinical trial and until 16 weeks af ter discontinuation of treatment with the investigational medicinal product (IMP) . In addition, all female subjects of child -bearing potentia l will have a pregnancy test performed before, during , and at end -of-treatment to ensure that no foetuses are exposed to the IMP.

Coupled with the negligible exposure risk for drugs and antibodies by way of semen to achieve meaningful pharmacological levels in a pregnant woman or in the conceptus ( 19), it is not considered necessary to impose restrictions on fathering a child or sperm donation in clinical trials with tralokinumab. In this trial in adult subjects with severe AD who are otherwise healthy, the efficacy of tralokinumab in combination with TCS therapy will be compared with a placebo control group on TCS therapy. The choice of placebo (on the background of TCS) as control is appropriate for addressing the objectives of this trial and it will pr ovide information regarding treatment with tralokinumab in combination with TCS. Subjects will be under supervision by a dermatologist or allergist every second week for the duration of the treatment period, which is more frequent than standard clinical pr actice. All subjects will be treated with TCS (Europe: Class 3 [potent]) as needed, and rescue treatment may be given to the subjects at the investigator’s discretion for the duration of the trial. Altogether, the risks associated with participating in thi s clinical trial are considered very low and outweighed by the benefit of a potential futu re treatment option for severe AD. In accordance with the current version of th e International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines , qualified medical personnel employed by LEO will be readily available to advise on trial -related medical questions. Medical monitoring will be performed throughout the trial and safety data will be reviewed regularly by medically qualified staff at LEO t o ensure that prompt action is taken, if neede d, to maximise patient safety. In conclusion, the trial design chosen is regarded as ethically justified and adherent with ethical requirements. 5.6 Benefit/ risk assessment Tralokinumab is a new biological therapy under investigation for the treatment of moderate - to-severe AD in both the adult and paediatric age groups. Tralokinumab has already demonstrated efficacy in moderate -to-severe AD ,and the e vidence discussed in Section 5.2 further supports the hypothesis that tralokinumab may benefit individuals with severe AD who are not adequately controlled with or have contraindications to oral CSA. An important aspect in t he benefit/risk evaluation is the reassuring safety profile of tralokinumab in AD, asthma, ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and in trials with healthy subjects.

39,page_39,"Trial ID: LP0162-1346 Date: 15-Jun-2020 Version: 4.0 Page 39 of 170 no safety c oncern has been identified with the use of tralokinumab, and tralokinumab was well-tolerated. The AE profile for tralokinumab has been comparable to that for placebo in controlled clinical trials. Injection site reactions have generally been mild ,and anti-drug antibodie s(ADA )have been detected in very few subj ects exposed to tralokinumab for up to one year. A number of theoretical potential risks have been identified that are described in the current version of the Investigator's Brochure, including hype rsensitivity reactions, immune complex disease, severe infections, malignanc ies, and interference with reproductive function. Measures are in place in this trial to protect participating subjects as follows: xClose monitoring of subjects during the trial wi th trial visits every 2 weeks during the treatment period as described in the schedul e of trial procedures (Section 4). xClose monitoring of subject s during the post-dosing period (at the first 3 IMP dosing visits in the treatment period )as a precautionary measure against hypersensitivity reactions (further detail s are given in Section 9.2). xMonitoring of subjects for clinical manifestations that may be associated with the development of specific antibodies to tralokin umab (i.e., immune complex disease). xExclusion of subjects with untreated systemic helminth infestations or subjects who have failed to respond to standard of care therapy (neutralisation of IL -13)might theoretically cause a worsening of parasitic infesta tion, in particular, prevention of expulsion of gastrointe stinal worms (helminths [20]). xExclusion of subjects with a history of tuberculosi s requiring treatment within 12months prior to the screening visit. xExclusion of subjects with a history of a clinically significant infection (defined as a systemic or serious skin infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, antiviral, or antifungal medication, see Section 8.3) within 4 weeks prior to baseline which, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor's medical expert, may compromise the safety of the subject in the trial. In conclusion, previous clinical experience with tralokinumab shows no major safety or tolerability concerns and appropriate measures have been instituted in this trial to protect subjects from possible risks that have been previously identified and to clos ely monitor each subject. The current benefit/risk profile is considered favourable and supports the administration of tralokinumab for the purposes of achieving the objectives of this trial. TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

The trial will consist of a screening period, a treatment period , and a safety follow -up period. The primary endpoint is assessed at Week 16, and the final efficacy assessment will be cond ucted at Week 26. A schematic of the trial design is provided in Panel 1. Screening period (Week -6 to Week 0) The screening period has a minimum duration of 2 weeks and a planned maximum duration of 6weeks . The exact duration of the screening period for the indi vidual subject depends on the length of any washout period needed (as also specified in the excl usion criteria in Section 8.3): x6 weeks for subjects using tanning beds or phototherapy. x4weeks for subjects using systemic immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs, systemic corticosteroid use, or ≥3bleach baths during any week within the 4 weeks . x2 weeks for subjects using topical PDE -4 inhibitors. If no washout or a 2-week washout period is required, screening will be reduced to 2 weeks and reduced to 1 visit (Week -2; visit 2), i.e., the 2 planned screening visits will be merged. Eligibility will be assessed at the (first) screening visit and on Day 0 (hereinafter “baseline ”) prior to randomisation. All subjects will attend a screening visit 14 days before baseline (Week -2; visit 2) where they will receive electronic diary (eDiary) training and start completion of the elec tronic patient - reported outcome (ePRO) questi onnaires in the eDiary. Data entered into the eDiary during the 2 weeks before randomisation will be used to calculate baseline values of the patient - reported outcomes (PROs). All subjects will use an emollient twice daily (o r more, as needed) for at least 14 days before randomisation and will continue this treatmen t throughout the trial (including safety follow - up). Subjects will initiate emollient treatment no later than the W eek -2 visit . On lesional skin, TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

Refer to Appendix 3B for details on the informed consent process. Once informed consent is obtained, a subject identification number (subject ID) will be assigned by a central IRT system and the screening evaluation s to assess eligibility criteria may begin . The subject ID will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout trial participation, if applicable. Subjects who have given written informed consent to participate in the trial and who have been assigned a subject ID are considered ‘screened ’ subjects. The investigator will maintain a log of all consented subjects at the trial site (subject identification list). This log will include each subject ’s identity, date of consent , and corresponding subject ID so that any subject may be identified if required for any reason. The log must not be copied or retained by LEO. In addition, the investigator will maintain a log of all subjects considered for screening, whether they have provide d written informed consent or not (screening log) . This log will be anonymous and will include the reason(s) for not entering the trial, if applicable, or the allocated subject ID.

Abbreviations: IMP, investigational medicinal product No active comparators will be used in this trial. 9.1.2 Auxiliary medicinal product (AxMP) Each subject will be prescribed a n auxiliary medicinal product ( AxMP): the subjects will receive a TCS cream (Europe: Class 3 [potent] ) from randomisation (Week 0) to Week 26. This will be provided as mometasone furoate, 0.1% cream in kit sizes of 180–225g every 2weeks. This should be the only TCS product applied to the body during this period, excluding areas of the body where the supplied TCS is not advisable or where continued use is considered unsafe (see Section 9.2.2 for further details).

Dosing visits are shown in the schedule of trial procedures (Section 4). The last administration of IMP will occur at Week 24. To ensure blinding, both treatment groups w ill receive the same number of injections at each visit . The first day of dosing is considered Day 0 (visit 3 , baseline ). Each subject will receive 4 SC injections (each of 1 mL) to receive a loading dose of tralokinumab or placebo. At subsequent visits in the treatment period, each subject will receive 2 SC injections (each of 1mL). Hence, subjects in the treatment period will receive either: xTralokinumab 300 mg Q2W: tralokin umab 600 mg (4 mL) at baseline, then tralokinumab 300mg (2 mL) Q2W. xPlacebo Q2W: placebo (4 mL) at baseline, then placebo (2 mL) Q2W. IMP will be administered by a qualified, unblinded health care professional (HCP; see Section 9.3.1 for blinding details). A minimum interval of 7 days is required between 2 dosing visits. No specific treatment for an overdose is recommended . The investigator will use clinical judg ement to treat any overdose if necessary. See Section 13.6.2 for further details regarding overdose. The injections will be administer ed into the SC tissue of the u pper arm, anterior thigh, or abdomen, separated by at least 3 cm. The injection site must be recorded in the source documents at each treatment visit and recorded in the eCRF. Further details on IMP administration are provided in the trial product handling manual. IMP administration must be carried out according to these instructions. After IMP administration For the f irst 3 IMP dosing visits in the treatment period (i.e., Weeks 0, 2, and 4), subjects will be monitored after IMP administration for immediate drug reactions for a minimum of 30minutes with vital signs taken at 30 minutes or until stable, whichever is later . Vital signs will be documented in the eCRF. As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. The World Allerg y Organization has categorised anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups: allergic anaphylaxis TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis for this trial are listed in Appendix 5. Appropriate drugs, s uch as epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc., and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available at the trial sites, and trial personnel should be trained to recognise and respond to anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, a blood sample will be drawn from the subject as soon as possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minut es after the event, and at discharge, for analysis of serum tryptase at the central laborat ory. Conditions requiring rescheduling of IMP administration If any of the following should occur, the investigator should reschedule the visit and IMP should not be administered until the rescheduled visit: xThe subject has an intercurrent illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety of the subject in the trial (e.g., viral illnesses). xThe subject is febrile (defined as ≥38°C) within 72 hours prior to IMP administration. If the trial visit cannot be rescheduled to maintain min imum of 7 days to subsequent dose, the sponsor ’s medical expert should be contacted. LEO does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. The investigator will use clinical judg ement to treat any overdose if necessary. 9.2.2 Administration of AxMP The IRT will assign the required AxMP (TCS) kit numbers for each subject at each dispensing visit. The TCS will be provided as mometasone fu roate, 0.1% cream in kit sizes of 180–225g Q2W . If needed, additional TCS kit(s) may be dispensed to the subject at a sche duled or unscheduled visit at the investigator ’s discretion. The amount of additional TCS dispensed must be recorded in the eCRF. Subjects will be instructed to apply a thin film of the dispensed TCS (Europe: Class 3 [potent] ) once daily to active lesion s, as needed. The TCS should be discontinued when control is achieved ; discontinuation should preferably be gradual and the m aximum duration of treatment should not exceed 3 weeks. The safety and appropriateness of continued or repeated courses of TCS therap y will be monitored and supervised by site staff. TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

The subjects must be instructed by the site staff on the importance of returning all used and unused TCS tubes. The site staff will return used and unused TCS tubes to the contract manufacturing organisation (CMO). The TCS tubes will be weighed at the CMO before shipment to the trial sites and again upon return. An additional, lower potency TCS or TCI may be used at the investigator ’s discretion on areas of the body where use of the supplied TCS is not advisable such as areas of thin skin (face, skin fold areas, genital areas, etc.) or on areas where continued treatment is considered unsafe. The low er potency TCS and TCI will not be provide d by LEO and will not be weighed, but must be registered in the eCRF as concomitant medicatio ns (see Section 9.6). Further details on TCS dispensing are provided in the trial product handling manual. TCS administration must be carried out according to these instructions. 9.3 Treatment assignment Randomisation Subjects who have been found to comply with all the inclusion criteria and not to violate any of the exclusion criteria will be randomised centrally at baseline (Day 0) to receive treatment with either tralokinumab 300mg+TCS or placebo +TCS, stratified by prior CSA use (yes/no), country (Germany: yes/no), and baseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 4) . The IRT will be used to control randomisation and stratification factors, along with trial product supply chain and expiry tracking. 9.3.1 Blinding This is a double -blinded trial in which tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct from each other. Neither the subject , nor the investigator or LEO staff who a re involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received. The packaging and labelling of the IMPs will contain no trace of identity. IMP is packed in identical boxes, with non -sequential kit numbers to ensure that unblinding does not occur during shipment and handling of the drug. Since tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct and not matched for viscosity, IMP will be handled and administered by a qualified, unblinded HCP (trained site staff) at the site who TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

If treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other trial staff involved in the management of tri al subjects, LEO must be notified immediately. Should an issue arise with the IMP (e.g., damaged kit or syringe that has been assigned to a subject prior to administration, or any other unex pected event with the kit or syringe [e.g., a malfunction during I MP administration]), the unblinded HCP at the site will contact the clinical research associate (CRA) to deter mine whether any specific actions are required. See Section 9.10 for details on reporting of product complaints. The trial site will maintain a written plan de tailing which staff members are blinded/unblinded and the process of IMP administration used to maintain the blind. 9.3.2 Emergency unblinding of individual subject treatment While the safety of a subject always comes first, it is still important to carefully consider if unblinding is necessary to ensure a subject ’s safety. An emergency unblinding request can be made by the investigators, HCPs who ar e not members of the trial staff, or authorised LEO personnel. Provisions are in place for 24 -hour emergency unblinding of individual subject treatment. If emergency unblinding is required, the investigator can unblind a subject ’s treatment in the IRT. For a requester who is not a member of the tria l staff and who does not have access to the IRT (e.g., a physician at an emergency room), a local contact number for the emergency unblinding contract research organisati on (CRO) is provided on the subject card ( see Appendix 3B) to be used if the investigator or de legated site staff cannot be reached. The requester will provide the trial ID and subject ID to the eme rgency unblinding CRO who will immediately reveal the individual treatment allocation. The emergency unblinding CRO will clarify that the requester requires immediate unblinding without further medical consultation. Should the requester wish to discuss whe ther unblinding is necessary, the emergency unblinding CRO will divert the requester to the medical cover. 9.4 Background treatment All subjects must use an emollient twice daily (or more, as needed) for at least 14 days before randomisation; the background treatment should preferably be an additive free, basic bland emollient. Subjects must continue their b ackground emollient treatment throughout the trial. TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

If possible, investigators should attempt to limit the first step of rescue therapy to topical medications (i.e. higher potency TCS, Europe class >3), and escalate to systemic m edications only for subjects who do not respond adequately after at leas t 14days of topical treatment. The subject will be monitored for signs of local or systemic TCS to xicity and the safety and appropriateness of continued use will be supervised by site staff. Subjects who receive topical rescue treatment (higher potency TCS , Europe class >3) will continue IMP treatment. If a subject receives rescue treatment with systemic corticosteroids or non -steroidal systemic immunosuppressive drugs (methotrexate, m ycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine , etc.), IMP will be immediately discontinued (see Section 10.2.2 ). After the treatment with these medications is completed, IMP may be resumed if deemed appropriate by the investigator, but not sooner than 5 half -lives after the last dose of systemic rescue treatment . The use of biological rescue treatment will be disal lowed for the entire trial duration. Investigators should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safety assessments (at least disease severity scores [IGA and EASI] , concomitant medications / procedures , and AEs) immediately before administering any res cue treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose, if necessary. In the primary efficacy analyses, subjects who receive higher potency TCS (Europe Class>3) or systemic rescue treatment during the treatment period will be considered as non -responders. 9.6 Concomitant medication and concurrent procedures Any medication or vaccine that the subject receives from 3 months prior to screening through safety follow -up (Week 40) must be recorded in the subject ’s medical record and the eCRF along with details such as: xMedication name. xIndication. xStart and stop date of administration (it will also be recorded if the medication is ongoing). xDosage information, including dose, unit, and frequency. xRoute of administration.

In order to obtain the most representative efficacy evaluation o f tralokinumab , it is key to assess the efficacy status of each trial participant at the planned primary and secondary endpoint s (nominal Week 16 and 26 visits ), irrespective of whether the subject has discontinued IMP or not (see Panel 2). Hence, permanent discontinuation of IMP and withdrawal from trial are considered to be ( potentially ) 2 separate occurrences : xPermanent discontinuation of IMP occurs when all further trial treatment is stopped. The subject will continue to participate in selected trial visit activities as outlined in Section 10.3 (see Panel 6 for additional visits required following permanent discontinuation of IMP ). xWithdrawal from trial occurs when stop of all trial activities takes place before the last planned safety follow -up visit (Week 40). This may either happen at the time of permanent discontinuation of IMP or later. Subjects who permanently discontinue IMP and subjects who withdraw from the trial will not be replaced. 10.2 IMP discontinuation rules 10.2.1 Reasons for permanent discontinuation of IMP Subjects will permanently discontinue IMP in the event of: xAnaphylactic reaction or other seve re systemic reaction to IMP injection. xAn AE that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor ’s medical expert, contraindicates further dosing. xDiagnosis of a malignancy during the trial, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or localised squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. xEvidence of pregnancy. xAny infection that is opportunistic, such as acti ve tuberculosis and other infections whose nature or course may suggest an immuno -compromised status.

After the treatment with these medications is completed, IMP may be resumed if deemed appropriate by the investigator, but not sooner than 5 half -lives after the last dose of systemic therapy. 10.3 Early termination assessments Permanent discontinuation of IMP Subjects who permanently discontinue IMP for any reason will be asked to attend additional visits as indicated below (Panel 6). See the schedule of tria l procedures for data to be collected a t these visits (Section 4).

Withdrawal from trial A subject may withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason. Subjects who withdraw from the trial should attend an early termination visit (if applicable), see the schedule of trial procedures (Section 4) for data to be collected at an early termination visit. The investigator will review any AEs which will be followed up according to Section 13.7, if the subject agrees. If a subject withdraws from the trial, they may request destruction of any samples taken and not test ed, and the investigator must document this in the site ’s trial records. Data to be recorded in the eCRF and medical records The reason for permanent discontinuation of IMP must be recorded in the medical records and in the eCRF ( on the end-of-treatment fo rm and end -of-trial form ). The reason for subject withdrawal must be recorded in the medical records and in the eCRF ( end-of-trial form ). For subjects who do not attend the nominal visits at Week 16 or Week 26 or the safe ty follow -up visit, the reason for not attending will be recorded in the medical records and in the eCRF .

The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the trial site for a required visit: xThe trial site must attempt to contact the subj ect and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to continue in the trial. xBefore a subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject ’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject ’s medical record.

The HADS will be completed electronically on the device supplied to the trial site according to the schedule of trial procedures (Section 4). 11.4 Safety assessments 11.4.1 Vital signs Vital signs (resting blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature) must be assessed according to the schedule of trial procedures (Section 4). Vital signs will be measured in a supine or sitting position following at least 5 minutes of rest. For the first 3 IMP dosing visits (i.e., Weeks 0, 2, and 4) , subjects will be monitored af ter IMP administration for immediate drug reactions for a minimum of 30 minutes with vital signs taken at 30 minutes or until stab le, whichever is later (Section 9.2.1 ). If an abnormal vital sign at screening is considered to be clinically significant by the investigator, it will be at the discretion of the investigator if the subject should be randomised into the trial (respecting exclusion criterion no.26). In case of abnormal findings, the vital sign measurement can be repeated approximately 15minutes later with subjects resting in a supine position to verify the first measurement. Should the repeated measurement result in a normal value, the measurement must be repeated once more. If the third measurement verifies th e second (normal) value, the first measurement should be considered false. If the third measurement confi rms the first measurement (abnormal), the second measurement should be considered false. Only the last value measured and considered correct will be recorded in the eCRF. Reporting in eCRF Vital signs and the date and time they were measured will be record ed in the eCRF; if vital signs were not assessed, a reason should be given. Clinically significant abnormal vital signs at the screening visit will be documented as medical history in the eCRF. At subsequent visits, any clinically significant deterioration of a pre -existing condition as well as any new clinically significant sign, symptom, or illness w ill be reported as an AE in accordance with Section 13.3.

The trial endpoints have been selected to evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab in improving the severity and extent of AD including both objective signs of disease and subjective symptoms (e.g. itch) as well as HRQoL. The planned trial design is considered appropriate for evaluating the trial objectives, as the double -blind conditions regarding the subject ’s trea tment (tralokinumab or placebo combined with TCS) are maintained and the possible observer bias regarding treatment effects is minimised. By using a placebo -controlled parallel -group design for the treatment period, superiority of tralokinumab in combinati on with TCS versus placebo in combination with TCS can be investigated, hereby adding to the knowledge needed for positioning tralokinumab in the AD treatment pathway. Stratification by prior CSA use (yes/no), country (Germany: yes/no), and baseline diseas e severity (IGA 3 or 4) in this multi -centre trial will provide a strong basis for generalisation of the findings to the target patient population. Further, the trial population will comprise male and female subjects to explore differences in effects betwe en genders and across the included age range. Among the key inclusion criteria for entry into the trial are a diagnosis of AD (as defined by the Hanifin a nd Rajka 1980 criteria for AD , see Appendix 4) at screening and a history of AD for at least one year, to ensure correct diagnosis and rule out differential diagnos es. A prerequisite for inclusion into the trial is also a documented history of treatment failure with CSA or not being a candidate for CSA . Appropriateness of assessments The clinical efficacy of tralokinumab treatme nt will be assessed by IGA, EASI, and SCORAD: xIGA is a key instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject ’s global AD (26).

Several validated pa tient-reported questionnaires ( SF-36, POEM, DLQI, EQ-5D-5L, and HADS) have been included to asse ss the efficacy of tralokinumab on PROs and HRQoL. Blood concentrations of tralokinumab will be an alysed using validated bioanalytical methods and standard PK parameters will be deri ved to evaluate the tralokinumab e xposure . Data on antibodies against tralokinumab (ADA) will be collected and the potential for immunogenicity will be evaluated until 16 week s after the last dose of tralokinumab, to ensure adequate washout (approximately 5 times the half -life). The serum samples for determination of presence or absence of ADA will be analysed using a validated bioanalytical method.

If ongoing, the (S)AE will also be recorded as medical history in ECZTEND. AEs mu st be assessed by medically qualified personnel. At all visits, the subject will be asked a non -leading question by the investigator about AEs, for example: “How have you felt since I saw you last? ” No specific symptoms should be asked for. It is important that the investigator also observes the subject for any changes not reported by the subject and records these changes. Refer to Sections 11.4.1 to 11.4.4 for principles for data entry in the eCRF . 13.3 Reporting of adverse events AEs reported by the subject or observed by the investigator must be recorded on the AE form of the eCRF and should be described in the following manner: The AE term must be in precise English medical terminology (i.e. not necessarily the exact words used by the subject). Whenever possible, a specific diagnosis should be stated (for example ‘allergic contact dermatitis ’). The duration of the AE must be reported by the start date and stop date of the event (it will also be recorded if the event is ongoing) .

Once a subject leaves the clinical trial, the investigator should follow up on the outcome of all non -serious AEs classified as of possible/probable relationship to the IMP for 2weeks or until the final outcome is det ermined, whichever comes first. SAEs must be followed up until a final outcome has been established, that is, the follow -up may continue beyond the end of the clinical tria l. For SAEs which have stabilised and cannot be expected to recover during the trial or the safety follow -up periods, for example chronic or stabilised conditions, ‘not recovered ’ should be reported as a final outcome. In addition, a statement that the SAE has stabilised or is chronic should be added to the narrative description of the SAE on the SAE form. 13.8 Handling of an urgent safety measure An urgent safety measure is a measure taken to implement an action/protocol deviation under an emergency. This is defined as “…the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or th e development of the investigational me dicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. ”(36). If the investigator becomes aware of information that necessitates an immediate change in the clinical trial procedure or a temporary halt to the clinical trial in order to protect clinical trial subjects from any immediate hazard to their health and safety, the investigator can do so without prior approval from LEO, regulatory authorities, or IRBs/IECs. The investigator must immediately inform LEO – by cont acting the clinical project manager or medical expert – of this change in the clinical trial procedure or of the temporary halt providing full details of the information and the decision -making process leading to the implementation of the urgent safety mea sure.

All subjects randomised to treatment and exposed to the IMP will be included in the full analysis set (FAS) and will be analysed for efficacy. Exclusions from the FAS can be considered in special cases as described in the ICH E9 guideline, Section 5.2.1 (37). If it is decided to exclude a randomised subject from the FAS, a justification addressing ICH E9 will be given. The following safety analysis sets are applied : x‘safety analysis set ’ for all subjects exposed to IMP within the tr eatment period . x‘safety follow -up analysis set ’ for all subjects exposed to IMP within the safety follow -up period . The decisions regarding incl usion/exclusion of subjects from the trial analysis sets will be docume nted in the analysis set definition document before breaking the randomis ation code . 14.3 Statistical analysis 14.3.1 Aspects related to the COVID -19 pandemic As the implications of the COVID -19 pandemic will, extraordinarily, influence trial events and data in manners not forese en by the protocol, this section is introduced to elaborate on the COVID -19 pandemic related aspects that may require special handling depending on the original research question .

This interpretation is not app ropriate when permanent discontinuation of IMP is caused by an external circumstance related to the COVID -19 pandemic. The causal relationship to the COVID -19 pandemic will be documented in the eCRF . The handling of permanent discontinuation of IMP will de pend on whether it is due to the COVID -19 pandemic or not. The date of this event will be the date of permanent discontinu ation of IMP. xUse of rescue treatment due to unavailability of IMP related to the COVID -19 pandemic : Analogous to the handling of permanent discontinuation of IMP, interpretation of rescue treatment as lack of efficacy of IMP is not appropriate if rescue treatment is administered to compensate for unavailability of IMP due to the COVID -19 pandemic . It is therefore likewise relevant to determine whether this is the case . The collection of concomitant medication does not allow for directly linking rescue treatment to the COVID -19 pandemic . Instead, rescue treatment will be attributed to the COVID -19 pandemic if it is administered while IMP dosing is missing due to the COVID -19 pandemic or if it is given after permanent discontinuation of IMP due to the COVID -19 pandemic (these underlying conditions may both be fulfilled). Hence, rescue treatment will be attributed to the COVID -19 pandemic if it is administered in a time period where IMP is unavailable due to the COVID -19 pandemic . Such periods can be one of the following: 1.From the date of a conducted scheduled visit without IMP dosing due to the COVID -19 pandemic until the date of the next administered dose. 2.From 3 days prior to the planned date of a scheduled visit which is not conducted due to the COVID -19 pandemic until the date of the next administered dose. 3.From the da te of permanent discontinuatio n of IMP due to the COVID -19 pandemic.

At the first occurrenc e, for which a subject misses IMP doses in one of the 4 following scenarios , the subject will be defined as having a prolonged interruption of IMP due to the COVID -19 pandemic: 1.3 consecutive missed IMP doses , for which at least one of them is due to the COVID -19 pandemic. 2.2 consecutive missed IMP doses , for which at least one of t hem is due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the third consecutive IMP dose is delayed for more than 7 days beyond the planned date of the IMP dosing. 3.Week 22 and Week 24 IMP doses and the Week 26 visit are missed , for which at least one of them is due to the COVID -19 pandemic. 4.Week 22 and Week 24 IMP doses are missed , for which at least one of them is due to the COVID -19 pandemic , and the Week 26 visit is delayed for more than 7 days beyond the planned date. In scenarios 1 and 3, the start date of the event will be the planned date of the third consecutive missed IMP dose or the Week 26 visit.

In the context of some of the efficacy analyses, data recorded missing due to the COVID - 19 pandemic will be handled differently from data missing for other re asons. As an example, it may not be reasonable to impute missing binary responder values as a non - response if the missingness is due to the COVID -19 pandemic .

This can be at the subject ’s own initiative, at the investigator ’s discretion, or if the subject is lost to follow -up. The timing of the event is defined as the date of the early termi nation visit for withdrawn subjects or –in the case of a subject lost to follow -up–the date of t he last known visit to the clinic. As for the rescue treatment , the event is used to modify an applied endpoint value. xSubject -onset of the COVID -19 pandemic : This event is introduced to mitigate the external influence that the occurrence of the COVID -19 pandemic could have on the compliance of a subject with planned trial procedures and on the resulting interpretation of the trial . The event reflects the first occasion when the COVID -19 pandemic prevents a subject from complying with the protocol in a sub stantial manner. As described in Section 14.3.1 , the circumstances arising from the COVID -19 pandemic might for example prevent a subject from receiving IMP or from c onducting visits to the site, whereby planned assessments and procedures could become missing. For a given subject , this event is defined as the first occurrence of either of the 3 underlying COVID -19 pandemic -related scenarios defined in Section 14.3.1 : oPermanent discontinuation of IMP due to the COVID -19 pandemic. oUse of rescue treatment due to unavailability of IMP related to the COVID -19 pandemic . oProlonged interruption of IMP dosing due to the COVID -19 pandemic .

Primary analysis for the primary estimand Subjects who prior to the Week 16 visit have received rescue treatment or permanently discontinued IMP , without subject -onset of the COVID -19 pandemic, will be considered non-responders at all visits after the relevant event occur s (Panel 13). The non -responder imputation reflects a n assumption that such initiation of rescue treatment and permanent discontinuation of IMP indicates failure of the randomised treatment to achieve res ponse . Furthermore, this reflects that a (possible) observed positive response after initiation of rescue treatment or permanent disc ontinuation of IMP is not attributable to the randomised treatment.

The procedure for imputing values according to th e rules described will be implemented in a 2-step procedure, where all mis sing or ignored data (irrespectively of reason) initially will be imputed using MAR based on available data from all subjects. The non -responder imputation of data not affected by the COVID -19 pandemic will be handled subsequently. The initial MAR imputati on will be implemented using the same multiple stepwise imputation method as specified in Section 14.3.8.4 for the primary analysis of the hypothetical binary estimand . The multiple imputation (MI) procedure sequentially builds 100 complete data set s by stepwise use of an ANCOV A model from Week 2 to Week 16 assuming MAR within treatment group s. When building the 100 complete data sets, available data from all subjects will be used, excluding individual subject data cap tured after initiation of rescue treatment , permanent discontinuation of IMP , or subject -onset of the COVID -19 pandemic . Once the 100 complete data sets have been generated by MI, non -responder imputation of relevant data points not affected by the COVID -19 pandemic will be applied according to the rules described above .

A tipping -point analysis using MI will be performed. The procedure will be as follows: subjects in the tralokinumab +TCS group with missing Week 16 data will per default be considered non -responders , while missing Week 16 data for subjects in the placebo +TCS group who did not use rescue treatment or permanently discontinued IMP will be imputed from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p (ranging from 0 to 1). By varying the parameter p, different p ercentages of subjects in the placebo+TCS group will be assumed to be responders (deviating from the default 0 % of the primary analysis of the secondary estimand). The tipping -point is then found as the value of p which changes the conclusion of the primar y analysis from significant to non -significant. Tipping -points will be judged from a clinical point of view . The MI procedure will include the following steps for each value of p: x100 copies of the dataset will be generated (seed=111099 46) and missing Week 16 data will be imputed for subjects in the placebo +TCS group from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p. xFor each of the 100 complete data sets, the difference in response rates will be analysed as specified for the primary estimand . 14.3.8.3 Tertiary estima nd: ‘treatment policy ’ The tertiary estimand for the primary endpoint will be: TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

Primary analysis for the tertiary estimand Data retrieved at Week 16 for subjects who prior to Week 16 have permanently discontinued IMP for other reasons than the COVID -19 pandemic will be included in the analysis. For s ubjects who have subject -onset of the COVID -19 pandemic prior to Week 16 and prior to any permanent discontinuation of IMP not due to the COVID -19 pandemic , any observed data from these subjects will be ignored and treated as missing in the same manner as missing data from not discontinued subjects in the analysis (Panel 13). Imputation of missing data at Week 16 will be done using multiple imputations within 4groups defined accord ing to randomised treatment group and whether or not subjects have permanently discontinued IMP prior to Week 16 . Within a given treatment group , retrieved data from discontinued subjects will be used to impute missing data for other discontinued subjects. Similarly, the available data from not discontinued subjects will be used to impute data for such subjects where the Week 16 value is missing /treated as missing . For not discontinued subjects, the stepwise multiple imputations procedure will be conducted in the same way , using the same seeds, as specified for the primary analysis of the quaternary ‘hypothetical ’ estimand described in Section 14.3.8.4 . For discontinu ed subjects, it is expected that the number of subjects with retrieved data at Week 16 will be too small to facilitate th e same imputation model as mentioned above. Consequently, a separate imputation model at Week 16 with only prior CSA use (yes/no) and baseline disease effects (IGA as a factor and EASI as a covariate) will be applied for discontinued subjects . Some factors may have to be omit ted, depending on the observed data, e.g. if all subjects have the same baseline disease severity. In that cas e the preferred order of elimination of the effects from the imputation model will be: prior CSA use and baseline disease effects (seed=12576546 ).

The assumption reflects that discontinued subjects without retrieved data at Week 16 are more likely to be non -responders than resembling discontinued subjects with retrieved data at Week 16. Missing observations due to either subject -onset of the COVID -19 pandemic or missing due to the COVID -19 pandemic , will be imputed as described in the primary analysis of the tertiary estimand.

Analysis of Week 16 response For each of the 100 complete data sets, the difference in response rates between treatment groups will be analysed using the Mantel -Haenszel risk difference stratified by prior CSA use (yes/no) and baseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 4 ). The estimates and standard errors from the 100 analyses will be pooled to one estimated tre atment difference and associated standard error using Rubin ’s rule to draw inference. From these pooled estimates, the 95% CI for the treatment difference will be calculated. Sensitivity analysis for the quaternary estimand Rather than assuming that observations are MAR within each treatment group , it is assumed that missing data from subjects who had any of the intercurrent events in the tralokinumab+TCS group will resemble missing data from subjects from the placebo +TCS group who had none of the intercurrent events . The underlying assumption is that the effect of tralokinumab following rescue treatment , permanent treatment discontinuation , or subject - onset of the COVID -19 pandemic is similar to the effect of placebo .

Imputation of missing data at Week 16 will be done using a pattern mixture model where missing data in the tralokinumab+TCS group as well as the placebo+TCS group will be imputed from observed data in the placebo+TCS group (using a so -called copy -reference approach). With this exemption, the stepwise MI procedure and subsequent analysis will be conducted in the same way as specified for the primary analysis of the quaternary estimand. 14.3.9 Analysis of secondary endpoin ts The secondary endpoints evaluate the impact of 16 and 26 weeks of treatment on (i) itch, (ii)severity and extent of AD , and (iii) HRQoL. The corresponding endpoints are (i)reduction (yes/no ) of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS average score for the past week (hereinafter ‘Worst Daily Pruritus NRS weekly average ’) of at least 4 from baseline to Week 16/ Week 26 , (ii)the change from baseline to Week 16 / Week 26 in SCORAD, the (iii)change from baseline to Week 16/ Week 26 in DLQI score , (ii)IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16/ Week 26 , (ii)EASI75 at Week 26 . Worst Daily Pruritus NRS over the last week prior to baseline (Day -6 to 0) will be used to calculate the baseline itch ( see also inclusion criterion no.9). EASI75 at Week 26 is a bina ry endpoint and it will be analysed as described for the primary endpoint (EASI75 at Week 16) using all 4 estimands with the modification that the imputation algorithm will be applied until Week 26. Reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS weekly average of at least 4 from baseline to Week 16/ Week 26 is a binary endpoint, and it will be analysed as described for the primary endpoint (EASI75 at Week 16) using all 4 estimands with the modification of the ANCOV A imputation model that reduction of Worst Daily Pr uritus NRS weekly average replaces EASI where preceding values are used as covariates . Only subjects with an average Worst Daily Pruritus NRS score of 4 or above at baseline will be included in these analyses. For each of the binary secondary endpoints, tipping -point analyses using the method described for the tipping -point analyses of the binary primary endpoint (EASI75 at Week 16) will be added as sensitivity analyses for the primary estimand. Subgroup analysis of binary endpoints Subgroup analyses will b e applied for the primary analyses of the primary and tertiary estimands for the groups: sex, prior CSA use (yes/no) , baseline disease severity ( IGA 3 or 4) , TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and u nintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. (ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidel ine for Good Clinical Practice, E6 (R1)). This definition includes: xAccidental injuries. xEvents related to trial procedures. xReasons for any unfavourable and unplanned change in medication (drug and/or dose). xClinically significant worsening of pre -existin g conditions. xReasons for admission to hospital or surgical procedures unless these were planned before the subject consented to trial participation . xAEs commonly observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the IMP. xAny laboratory abnormality assessed as clinically significant by the investigator (see Section 11.4.4.2 ). Serious a dverse event definition An SAE is any untoward med ical occurrence that xResults in death . xIs life -threatening . xRequires in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation. Elective hospitalisation or elective prolonged hospitalisation do not fulfil the criteria for being an SAE but should be documented in the subject ’s medical record. xResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .

Mild An AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. Severe An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. If the severity of an AE worsens, a new AE should be recorded. Causality The causal relation of the AE to the use of the IMP shou ld be described in terms of probable, possible , or not related according to the investigator ’s clinical judgement . The categories are defined below. Probably relatedxFollows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. xCould not be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors or other therapies administered to the subject. xFollows a known pattern of response to the IMP. xDisappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the IMP. xReappears or worsens upon re-challenge. Possibly relatedxFollows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the IMP. xCould also be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors or other therapies administered to the subject. xFollows a known pattern of response to the IMP. Not relatedxDoes not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. xIs better explained by other factors like the subjec t’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors or other therapies administered to the subject. xDoes not reappear or worsen upon re-challenge. xDoes not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP.

130,page_130,"Trial ID: LP0162-1346 Date: 15-Jun-2020 Version: 4.0 Page 130 of 170 For events not considered related to IMP using the criteria above, the causal relationship to the use of AxMP should be evaluated using the same definitions as for the IMP . Outcome The outcome of the ev ent according to the investigator ’s clinical judgement should be classified using the categories below. Recovered/ resolvedxThe event has stopped. The stop date of the event must be recorded. Recovering/ resolvingxThe subject is clearly recovering from an event. The event is not yet completely resolved. Not recovered/ not resolvedxEvent is still ongoing. Recovered/ resolvedwith sequelaexThe event has reached a state where no further changes are expected and the residual symptoms are assumed to persist. An example is hemiparesis after stroke. xThe stop date of the event must be recorded. In case of a SAE, the sequelae should be specified. Fatal xThe subject has died as a consequence of the event. Date of death is recorded as stop date for the AE. Unknown xUnknown to investigator, e.g. subject lost to follow-up. Note that as per the above definition, LEO uses “RECOVERED/RESOLVED” only if an event has actually stopped. According to the CDISC defini tion, the category “RECOVERED/RESOLVED” also includes events which have improved. However, following the LEO definitions above, such an improved event will instead be classified as “NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED” or “RECOVERING/RESOLVING”. Similarly, it should be noted that as per the above definition, LEO uses “RECOV ERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE” only if an event has reached a state where the residual symptoms are assumed to persist. According to CDISC, an event is c onsidered “WITH SEQUELAE”, if it has “retained pathological conditions”. Cons equently, it is likely that some of the events classified by LEO with the outcome “RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE” could have been classified with the outcome “RECOVERED/RESOLVED” according to the CDISC definition. For SAEs which have stabilised and cannot be expected to recover during trialor safety follow -up periods, for example chronic illnesses, the final outcome should be considered to ‘not recovered’. In addition, a statement that the SAE has stabilised or is chronic should be added to the narrative description of the SAE on the SAE form. TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

Trial monitoring During the course of the trial ,CRA(s) will visit the trial site. These visits have the following objectives: (i) to continually verify source data to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by authorised site personnel are accurate, complete, a nd verifiable from source documents; (ii) to confirm that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected; and (iii) to confirm that the trialis being conducted in accordance with th e currently approved protocol and any other trial agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the trial site ’s recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site with the protocol and ICH GCP. In order to perform their role effectively, CRAs and persons involved in quality assurance and inspections will need direct access to source data, e.g. medical records, laboratory reports, appointment books, etc. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the CRA with signed and dated printouts. In addition, relevant site staff should be available for discussions at monit oring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. by telephone). Protocol compliance Protocol deviations will be documented and notified to the investigator . Protocol deviations will be assessed by LEO and critic al protocol deviation s will be described in the CTR. Sponsor audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections The clinical trial will be subject to audits conducted by LEO or inspections from domestic or foreign regulatory authorities or from IRBs/IECs.

135,page_135,"Trial ID: LP0162-1346 Date: 15-Jun-2020 Version: 4.0 Page 135 of 170 during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as LEO staff have an obligation to cooperate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving auditors and inspectors direct a ccess to all source documents and other documents at the trial site relevant to the clinical trial. This includes permission to examine, verify and reproduce any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the trial site is co ntacted for an inspection by competent authorities, LEO must be notified immediately. Risk assessment In this trial , the risks to critical trial processes and data have been evaluated . To ensure consistent data capture with respect to investigator assessment of efficacy (IGA, EASI , SCORAD), all investigators will receive training and whenever possible, the efficacy assessments will be made by the same investigator at each visit to reduce inter -rater variability. To ensure subject safety, SAE reporti ng will be followed closely and medical monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis throughout the trial. Data quality review meetings will be held during the trial to ensure that improvements in data collection can be made and that mistakes are preve nted on an ongoing basis. During monitoring, the CRA will verify that investigators work according to the protocol. Data handling Data will be collected by means of electronic data capture unless transmitted to LEO or designee electronically (e.g. laborato ry data). The investigator or staff authorised by the investigator will enter subject data into e lectronic CRFs (eCRFs). Data recorded in the eCRFs will be accessible to the trial site and LEO pe rsonnel immediately after entry. The eCRFs must be maintained in an up -to-date state by the trial site at all times. The investigator must verify the correctness of the data entered by the site by electronically dating and signing all eCRFs used. This signature information will be kept in the audit trail and cannot be altered. Any correction(s) made by the investigator or authorised site staff to the eCRF after original entry will be documented in the audit trail. Changes to data already approved will require the re -signature by the investigator. The person making th e change to the data, and the date, time , and reason for the change will be identified in the audit trail. TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"
136,page_136,"Trial ID: LP0162-1346 Date: 15-Jun-2020 Version: 4.0 Page 136 of 170 Subject data should be entered into the eCRF no later than 5 working days after each visit , unless a different deadline is stated in the Clinical Trial Agreement. Queries for discrepant data will be generated automatically by the system upon entry or manually by the CRA , sponsor ’s medical expert, or the data manager. All queries will be raised electronically within the electronic data capture system. This systematic validation will ensure that a clean and consistent database is provided for the statistical analysis. An e lectronic ePRO solution will be used to capture patient -reported data ( data from questionnaires completed at the trial site and eDiary data ). By the use of an ePRO solution , data will be available immediately after data entry and available for monitors and site personnel, including the investigator, with read access only. The ePRO system is a separate application from the eCRF and data captured from the eCRF and the ePRO will be stored on different servers during data capture. Data from both systems will be included in the final trial database. External data transfers from vendors to LEO will be transmitt ed and handled via a secure file transfer protocol site.

Essential trial documents must be stored until LEO informs the investigator that the documents are no longer to be retained , or longer if required by local regulations. In addition, the inv estigator is responsible for the archiving of all relevant source documents so that the trial data can be compared agai nst source data after the completion of the trial ( for example in case of an inspection from regulatory authorities). The investigator is required to ensure the continued storage of the documents even if the investigator leaves the trial site or retires before the end of the required storage period. No documents may be destroyed during the retenti on period without the written approval of LEO. No documents may be transferred to another location or party without written acceptance from LEO . The destruction process must ensure confidentiality of data and must be done in accordance with local regulatory requirements. For archiving purposes, each inves tigator will be supplied with an electronic copy of the eCRFs and ePRO data for all screened and randomised subjects enrolled at the trial site. This is done after completion of the trial and befor e access to the eCRF/ePRO is revoked.

This make visits to the sites challenging, and in some cases impossible. To follow authorities restrictions and to safeguard the subjects in ECZTRA 7 as well as provid ing continued therapy to secure the scientific integrity , this clinical trial protocol addendum is installed to provide an opportunity for subjects to continue tr eatment with tralokinumab via home -use (self -injection). No safety issues have been observed in subjects who applied home -use of IMP after training by site staff in previous or ongoing clinical trials with tralokinumab. Therefore, no safety issues are expe cted regarding home -use of IMP in ECZTRA 7. 2 GCP statement Normal GCP procedures are followed for this protocol addendum. Subjects will be verbally informed and verbally consent to providing contact details (name, address, and telephone number) for shippi ng purposes. 3 eCRF recording It must be recorded in the eCRF if the visit was conducted as a home -visit. If the subject is reached by telephone/video contact and collection of AEs, concomitant medication and pregnancy test result (if applicable) are assessed , “Visit date ” must be documented in the eCRF. All other assessments should be marked “Not done ”. The log line “If not done, specify reason ” must be answered with “COVID -19”. In addition, in the “Comments log ”, one log line per visit should be ente red with “COVID -19” – as reason for only partly performed assessments at the visit. If no contact can be established between site and subject at a given visit, this must be recorded as a missed visit in the eCRF (“Not done ”). The log line “If not done, specify reason ” must be answered with “COVID -19”. 4 Description of visit scenarios Without compromising the safety of subjects and site personn el, it is expected that efforts are made to secure attendance at sites for the Week 16 and Week 26 visits, securi ng important efficacy and safety assessments for the trial .

This makes visits to the sites challenging, and in some cases impossible. This clinical trial protocol addendum is installed for subj ects who cannot come to the site for the Week 26 visit and who have provided informed consent for using the mobile application called ‘Imagine for Studies ’ for remote collection of data related to efficacy of tralokinumab. No safety issues are expected as a consequence of this clinical trial addendum. 2 GCP statement Normal GCP procedures are followed for this protocol addendum. Subjects will be verbally informed and verbally consent to the site staff providing contact details (name, address, and telephone number) for sending the necessary information about Imagine for Studies to subjects via courier. The subjects sign the Participant Information Sheet after having ample time to consider participation. The site staff will not sign the Participant Information Sheet. Precautionary steps have been taken to secure the integrity of the trial and the confidentiality of the identity of the subjects via a controlled data transfer between two separate units of LEO Pharma: LEO iLab (including a team of certified dermat ologists) and LEO Clinical Operations. In this manner, the GCP adherence described in the clinical trial protocol and the ICF signed at screening remains intact and unchanged. The procedures described in this addendum are considered well -balanced and propo rtionate, taking into account the legitimate interest of trial sites in avoiding further burden in terms of time and staffing during the COVID -19 pandemic (1).

Furthermore, the photos are to be taken in a prioritised order as follows: xIf there are multiple skin lesions of eczema in one body area, the lesion with the most redness should be chosen. xIf there are multiple lesions with the same level of redness in one body area, the lesion with the most redness and oozing should be chosen. If the photo is of substandard quality, LEO iLab will ask the NL -CRA to inform the site staff, who then contacts the subject and asks for a new photo to be upload. Figure 2 illustrates how the subject selects one body area at a time and captures a photo of the skin.

Each body area accounts for 100%. The subjects will be presented for the following text in the app provided in local language. Figure 3 shows the questionnaire with guiding illustrations of the relevant body parts. Figure 3 Questionnaire about the extent of atopic derm atitis The texts of the screens (A -G) are copied below. A-B Thank you for taking four photos! Now we would like to know the extent of your eczema. To accurately assess how much of your body is covered by eczema, and to what degree you are affected, we need to know the extent of eczema on your body. TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"
159,page_159,"Trial ID: LP0162-1346 Date: 15-Jun-2020 Version: 4.0 Page 159 of 170 We assess the extent of your eczema, by viewing your body as four separate areas. The head and neck, the trunk, the arms, and the legs. Below, you w ill see four drawings, one of each area. For each area, you need to assess, and then enter, how many percentages are covered by eczema. For instance, if one of your arms is fully covered by eczema, from hand to shoulder, but the other arm is not, you should enter 50% in the arms field. That is because 50%, is half of th e arms’ area. Similarly, if only the lower arm and hand of one of your arms is affected, you should enter 25%. We know that many people suffering from eczema, have multiple smaller lesions, and that it might be difficult to sum up the area, but we ask you to try your best. A rule of thumb is that your palm area, including fingers will cover 10% of your head, 5% of your arms, 3% of your trunk and back, and 3% of your legs. So for instance, if you have an eczema lesion on your leg, that is the same size as your hand, but no other lesions on the legs, you would enter 3%. If you have a lesion that is only just covered by both of your hands, you would enter 6%. So, here is a 3 -step summary (1) For each of the areas, you should estimate how many percentages of your body is covered by eczema. Each area equals 100% (2) Remember that the body parts ha ve both a front, and a back (3) If you do not have eczema in an area, please in put 0%. There are examples for each area in the submission fields below. C Subject ID. Do not change this valu e. This is your unique Subject ID. For your head and neck, please specify percentages of your eczema from 0 -100. For example; If you do not have any eczema on your head, you put in “0” in the field. D For your arms and hands, please specify percentages of your eczema from 0-100. For example; If you have eczema on the back of both of your hands, but nowhere else on your arms, you should put in 10%, as the back of the hands equal about 10% of the area of your arms and hands. E For your groin, stomach, chest and back, please specify percentages of your eczema from 0-100. For example; If you have eczema on your stomach, but not on your chest, or your lower or upper back, you should put in 25%, as the stomach is about 25% of the trunk. F For your legs, feet, and buttocks please specify percentages of your eczema from 0-100. For example; If your entire left leg is covered by eczema , but the other leg is perfectly clear, you should put in 50%, as half of the leg area is covered by eczema. G Thank you for submitting your information. We appreciate you taking part in this trial. 5.4 Data flow The key principles for how data flows from the subject using the Imagine for Studies app to the reporting in the CTR are showed in Figure 4 and briefly explained below. All data collected via the Imagine for Studies app are stored on secure (GDPR and HIPAA compliant) AWS servers managed by LEO iLab. The data captured will include potential subject identifiers, such as photos of the fac ial region as well as information about the extent of AD. Therefore, precautionary steps have been taken to ensure that LEO Clinical Operations at no point in time will have access to data with pot ential subject identifiers. The photos will be evaluated by a team of certified dermatologists within LEO iLab who have no connections to LEO Clinical Operations. The outcome of the evaluation will be a remote TMF-000064964 - Version 5. 0"

The EASI principles used to assess a remote EASI score is based on the HOME working group definitions (2). The remote EASI scores and the questionnaire data will together form the data transfer that does not include photos (i.e. pote ntial subject identifiers). The data transfer delivered by LEO iLab to the SDTM database within LEO Clinical Operations will take place before database lock. An ADAM dataset is then de rived from the SDTM database and used for statistical reporting. The dat a generated from the Imagine for Studies app will not be part of the pre -specified analysis, but rather serve as a supplement to handling the missing data at Week 26. All data obtained from Imagine for Studies will be deleted from the LEO iLab secure serve r before finalisation of the CTR.

Overall rationale for the amendment The main reason for the amendment is to introduce the possibility for eligible subjects in selected countri es to participate in a long -term extension trial (conduc ted under a separate protocol [LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND]) without completing the safety follow -up period in the present trial. Indeed, a new anti -drug antibodies (ADA) assay has been developed with improv ed tralokinumab tolerance. This means th at the presence or absence of ADA can be determined in serum samples with tralokinumab pr esent. Previously, this was not possible and therefore ADA sampling at the end of the 14 -week off -treatment safety follow -up wa s originally required for the ADA evaluation. Thus, in selected countries, the new ADA assay will allow eligible subjects who have completed the treatment periods of the present trial to continue into the long -term extension trial without completing the sa fety follow -up period in the present trial. These subjects will have their safety follow -up period after end of treatment in the long -term extension trial. Additional changes included in the amendment are also presented in the table below.
