Background & Rationale Each year in the UK approximately 35,000 women develop diabetes during pregnan cy, a condition called gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which increases the risk of adverse out comes for both mother and child1. Complications for the mother incl ude increased risk of hypertensive diseases of pr egnancy, including preeclampsia2, and higher rates of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabete s mellitus (T2DM) in later life3–5. Aside from hyperglycaemia, GDM is further complicated by maternal dyslipidae mia. Specifically, triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations are increased in maternal blood, whilst high density lipoprote in (HDL) -cholesterol is reduced6,7. Modern metabolomic studies show disturbances of lipid metabolism, particularly intermediary metabolites (e.g. acyl - carnitines, phospholipids)7,8. Early decline in plasma adiponectin, an indicator of poorer mitochondrial oxidation in overweight and obese women, is an almost universal finding in GDM pregnancy9. Thus, GDM is a potentially vasculoto xic condition, associated with abnormal lipid and glucose metabolism10. GDM is also associated with accelerated fetal growth and increased risk of being large for gestational age (LGA), defined as birth weight above the 90th percentile for sex and gestati onal age1,11. GDM is also complicated by higher rates of preterm birth, caesarean section and birth injuries, including shoulder dystocia, which is particularly increased with LGA1,2,12. Due to the complications of preterm delivery and LGA, GDM offspring a re more likely to require admission to neonatal intensive care units for treatment of hypoglycaemia, jaundice and respiratory distress11. GDM causes fetal dyslipidaemia, with increased free fatty acids and triglycerides in the umbilical cord blood; this is also associated with increased risk of LGA13–15. The children of women with GDM have increased rates of obesity, childhood cardiovascular disease and T2DM in later life, likely related to exposure both to maternal hyperglycaemia and maternal hyperlipidaem ia in utero16,17. 3.1 Effectiveness of current treatments In the UK, women with risk factors for GDM have a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24 -28 weeks’ gestation. Those that test positive (fasting glucose concentration ≥5.6 and/or 2 -hr ≥7.8mmol/L) start self -monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and are given dietary and lifestyle advice. If unable to achieve the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended glucose control targets (fasting glucose <5.3, 1hr <7.8mmol/L and/or 2hr <6.7mmol/L), they are prescribed either pharmacological oral glucose lowering medications, e.g. metformin/glibenclamide, or subcutaneous insulin injections. Metformin is the most commonly used first line pharmacological treatment. However, there is increasing concern about its widespread use during pregnancy, both because of its limited efficacy and because of potential safety concerns. Metformin crosses the placenta, has growth inhibitory properties and suppresses mitochondrial respiration which could theoretically adversely affect the developing fetus18,19. The Metformin in Gestational Diabetes (MiG) trial demonstrated that mothers randomised to metformin, compared to insulin, had reduced maternal weight ga in and gestational hypertension20. Howe ver, the rate of LGA was not affected and the offspring had more subcutaneous fat at 2 years of age21. A study of maternal metformin treatment for women"
8,page_8,"EudraCT Number 2019 -002880 -82, IRAS Number 1003208 GUARD protocol V1.0 11Mar 20 Page 9 of 53 with polycystic ovary syndrome also did not show an impact on LGA, and the offspring were heavier at 1 year of age22. Thus, the current data have raised concerns that metformin, currently used by many women with GDM, does not adequately prevent adverse outcomes such as LGA, and may have negative long -term effects on the metabolic health of the children23,24. This may be, at least in part, because metformin has less effect on serum triglyceride concentrat ions than insulin20. It is noteworthy that in the MiG trial, metformin alone was inadequate for achieving glycaemic targets in approximately 50% of women, ne cessitating supplementary treatment with insulin20. Indeed, even insulin treatment (the “gold standard” pharmacological approach) was not shown to be of definitive benefit for GDM offspring in the most recent Cochrane review, and was thought to possibly in crease the risk of raised blood press ure compared to oral treatments25. Glibenclamide is the other oral hypoglycaemic agent used to treat GDM. It has not been shown to be superior to insulin treatment used in randomised trials26, or as an add -on therapy to metformin27. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for additional therapies that improve maternal -fetal glucose and lipid metabolism, and the longer -term health outcomes of GDM exposed offspring. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently not an established /licensed treatment for GDM. However, a meta -analysis that included data from 7 trials that reported the impact of UDCA on glycaemic markers showed that it improved fasting glucose, insulin and HbA1c concentrations55. Furthermore, our pilot data from studies of UDCA treatment of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy have demonstrated improved insulin resistance, indicating that it has the potential to be an effective treatment to improve glycaemic control in GDM (see Appendix 2 for mor e details). UDCA is commonly used in pregnancy for the treatment of ICP, and a recent randomised, placebo -controlled trial did not show any increase in adverse events, including gastrointestinal symptoms, in women treated with UDCA compared to placebo56. Our pilot data also show that UDCA improves fetal serum lipid parameters (see Appendix 2), so it may be more effective than metformin at reduction of the frequency of large for gestational age infants in GDM. 3.2 Rationale Our trial will compare the impact of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) -a drug with pilot data to support its effectiveness to treat GDM - to metformin on glycaemic control (primary outcome) in women with GDM (see Appendix 1) . We will evaluate maternal and fetal lipid and gl ucose metabolism, and maternal vascular outcomes, using biochemical and imaging assays and simple arterial measures. Neonatal health outcomes will also be studied, including the proportion of LGA offspring . Table 1 summarises the mechanisms by which UDCA a nd metformin influence glucose and lipid metabolism. Table 1. Proposed mechanisms of action of UDCA and metformin in GDM UDCA Metform in Inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1; leads to activation of hepatic AMPK, reducing SRBEP1c which controls glucose - stimulated genes associated with lipid, glucose and protein formation, and stimulates fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake X ✓"

When faeces from pregnant women were transplanted into germ - free mice there were phenotypic differences in mice receiving faeces from women in the 3rd vs 1st trimester of pregnancy. The 3rd trimester faeces had a greater abundance of the pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria and the recipients had more weight gain and insulin resistance29. Women with GDM also have alterations in the gut microbiota. At the time of diagnosis, there is enrichment w ith a number of microbes, e.g. Desulfovibrio, the prevalence of which is also higher in T2DM30. Similar changes in the composition of the gut microbiota occur in women who are overweight i n pregnancy31. Studies of the gut microbiota in T2DM have reported r eductions in butyrate -producing bacteria in untreated compare d to metformin -treated patients32. Butyrate is a metabolically -active short chain fatty acid (SCFA), increased levels of which are associate d with improved glucose control33. We propose that U DCA is a new potential treatment for GDM. UDCA alters gut metabolites (via microbial modification of the drug). We hypothesise that this will result in increased release of gut hormones (GLP -1 and FGF19) that improve maternal/fetal blood concentrations of lipids, e.g. triglycerides, glycaemic control and reduce rates of obstetric and neonatal complications. We have pilot data to support this hypothesis from studies of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) treated with UDCA. 3.3 Pilot dat a UDCA treatment improves HOMA -IR and GLP -1 secretion in the mother in women with ICP Women with ICP have increased rates of GDM (odds ratio 2.81, 95% CI 2.32 -3.41)34. Using continuous glucose monitoring, we demonstrated ICP -associated elevations in prandial glucose concentrations, abnormal glucose tolerance and reduced secretion of the gut hormone glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1)35, which acts to enhance glucose -mediate d insulin secretion36. We have shown improvement in GLP-1 in women with ICP treated with"

Of note, GLP -1 is thought responsible for 70% of the insulin release following meals, and levels are lower in GDM than unaffected pregnancies28. Research to s upport study of the gut microbiome To understand the mechanism of action of UDCA treatment in ICP, we have performed a pilot study of faecal gut microbiota and bile acid profiles see Appendix 1 . UDCA treatment improves ICP -associated maternal and fetal dyslipidaemia Women with ICP have dyslipidaemia in addition to increased susceptibility to ICP - associated GDM. This is characterised by elevated serum concentrations of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol. Our pilot data show improvement in maternal total cholesterol and LDL -cholesterol following UDCA treatment (see Appendix 2) A recent study of UDCA treatment of 20 people with T2DM and hepatic impairment showed reduce d weight and HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) after treatment for 12 weeks (a similar duration to that proposed for this study)38. Furthermore, a recently published meta -analysis in people with non -alcoholic fatty liver disease (a disorder that is commonly associated with T2DM, previous GDM)39,40 reported that UDCA treatment was associated with significant reduction in fasting glucose, HbA1c and plasma insulin concentration. UDCA is therefore a biologically plausible treatment but has not yet been evaluated in GDM. We believe it is important and timely to evaluate the impact of UDCA on maternal and fetal outcomes in GDM. Dose rationale The dose of UDCA taken by most women with ICP is 500mg BD, including those from whom the pilot data in Appendix 2 were obtained. Similarly, the recent PITCHES trial that compared UDCA to placebo treatment for ICP proposed a starting dose of 500mg BD that could be increased to a maximum of 2g daily56. There was no increase in adverse outcomes in women treated with UDCA comp ared to those that received placebo. The reason for increasing the dose in women with ICP is typically due to severity of the symptom of pruritus or worsening liver function tests. There is no evidence that an increase of UDCA dose will improve glycaemic c ontrol more than treatment with 500mg BD, and therefore we propose to only use a UDCA dose of 500mg BD for the GUARD Trial. This does not need to be increased as the lower dose was sufficient to have an impact on maternal insulin sensitivity and serum lipi ds. 3.4. Rationale for using continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ), dietary assessment and vascular studies CGM will be used in this trial alongside conventional capillary glucose monitoring to compare the impact of UDCA and metformin on maternal glycaem ic control. CGM measures interstitial glucose concentration every five minutes through a sensor that is placed subcutaneously. With 288 glucose measurements/day, CGM provides detailed glucose information about overnight and post -prandial glucoses, providin g direct insight into f oetal exposure to maternal glycaemia41. A recent large international consensus paper"
11,page_11,"EudraCT Number 2019 -002880 -82, IRAS Number 1003208 GUARD protocol V1.0 11Mar 20 Page 12 of 53 highlighted CGM as a robust research tool and emphasised the accuracy of contemporary sensors, the detailed information they provide and non -invasive nature compared to frequent capillary glucose monitoring42. There is evidence that the diet composition of pregnant women influences their susceptibility to GDM57. Therefore women will be asked to complete a 4 day dietary assessment at 36 weeks’ gestation. This will enable evaluation of diet composition and wheth er this could influence treatment response. The diet will also affect the gut microbiota, so the 4 day diet questionnaire will be completed by all participants in the GUARD MEC study. For vascular studies we will use a calibrated cuff -based blood pressure instrument, the Arteriograph, as recently used in a maternal hypertension trial46. We include vascular health as a secondary outcome of the proposed trial because arterial function measures are more powerful than, and independent of, standard blood pressu re for later prognosis47– 49. The arteriograph works by a minor supra -systolic inflation so that the cuff senses the waveform from each heartbeat for 4 -6 beats, thereby providing both a BP measure and for arterial stiffening through sensing the waveforms. I t has a British Hypertension Society (BHS) A/A grading for its BP measurement. 3.5 Future work If we generate convincing evidence that UDCA improves maternal glycaemic control we intend to apply for funds to perform a large multicentre trial where we can personalise decisions about which women will respond to UDCA to improve maternal and baby outcomes. Many women with GDM are susceptible to T2DM, a condition with a higher rate of the adverse outcomes associated with GDM and also increased risk of stillb irth. The underlying pathology is similar in many cases. At present not all women of reproductive age are aware that they have T2DM and some are only diagnosed in early pregnancy. If UDCA is effective in GDM, we will also apply to study UDCA as a potential therapy for treatment of women with established T2DM in pregnancy. The children of women with GDM have increased rates of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in later life. If UDCA improves fetal metabolic parameters, e.g. umbilical cord blood LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides or free fatty acids, we also intend apply for future funds to evaluate offspring metabolic health as the drug may not only improve perinatal outcomes but also the future health of the children that were treated in utero. 4.

Trial Medication 5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product The Pharmacy Manufacturing Unit, Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust (GSTFT PMU) Pharmace uticals are licensed to support clinical trials under an MIA (IMP) licence granted by the MHRA license. They have a long standing history of servicing the clinical trials market, and are specialised in the manufacture, storage and distribution for trials. GSTFT PMU will supply , re-package , label and distribute both IMPs for this clinical trial. Analytical testing, Annex 13 compliant labelling, and temperature controlled and monitored storage and shipment will be implemented. 5.1.1 UDCA Ursodeoxycholic acid 500mg film -coated tablets (Ursofalk®, Dr Falk) will be pack ed into packs of 28 tables (2 weeks’ supply) in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE ) container with child -resistant, tamper evident closure . 5.1.2 Metformin Metformin 500 mg tablets (Medley) will be packed into packs of 56 table ts (2 weeks’ supply) in an HDPE container with child -resistant, tamper -evident closure with integrated silica gel desiccant tablets. The investigator should ensure that the participant has sufficient tables of the allocated treatment to last until the following scheduled appointment. Patients will return unused doses at the final visit. 5.2 Dosing Regimen Starting treatment for U DCA is 500 mg twice a day (BD) orally with the morning and evening meals . Metformin will be started following a dose escalation scheme to minimise side effects, until a dose of 1000 mg BD is reached: - Days 1 & 2: 500 mg with evening meal - Days 3 & 4: 500 mg with breakfast and 500 mg with evening meal - Days 5 & 6: 500 mg with breakfast and 1000 mg with evening meal - Day 7 and remaining: 1000 mg with breakfast and 1000 mg with evening meal In both cohorts, p articipants will take the first dose within 2 da ys of the baseline visit, and will contin ue self -administration at home, while they undergo regular glucose control checks in line with current clinical practice . The glucose control targets will follow NICE pregnancy guidelines (i.e. aiming to maintain all capillary glucose levels between 3.9 -7.8mmol/l). The specific pre - and post -meal"
16,page_16,"EudraCT Number 2019 -002880 -82, IRAS Number 1003208 GUARD protocol V1.0 11Mar 20 Page 17 of 53 SMBG targets are ≤5.3mmol/L before breakfast, ≤7.8mmol/L 1 -hr post meal and ≤6.7mmol/L 2-hr post meal. All participants will be given education regarding diet and lifestyl e as part of their standard clinical care pathway . Insulin may be added as a rescue medication if oral treatment does not control blood glucose levels, in accordance with standard antenatal clinical practice. Insulin will constitute a non -investigational m edicinal product (nIMP). Also following clinical practice, doses could be reduced or temporarily discontinued if deemed appropriate by the patient’s clinician. Compliance will be checked with study participants at follow up visits by reviewing diary ca rds. Last dose will be taken at the time of delivery, as per clinician instructions. 5.3 IMP Risks For a list of up -to-date risks, latest Summary of Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) should be consulted . None of the two IMP are licensed for use in pregnancy, therefore this data is not based in pregnancy data. Frequen cy of occurrence is defined as follows: very common: 1/10; common>1/100, <1/10; uncommon>1/1,000, <1/100; rare>1/10,000, <1/1,000; very rare<1/10,000, not known. Metformin : The most co mmon adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite (very common) and taste disturbance (common) , which usually resolve spontaneously. To prevent these a gradual dose increase is used. Very r are effects are skin reactio ns, lactic acidosis and liver function tests abnormalities or hepatitis . UDCA : Pasty stools or diarrhoea are common adverse reactions. Nausea, vomiting and pruritus might be effects but the frequency is unknown. Very r are effects are: calcification of gallstones and u rticaria. Should the research team have concerns about any new symptoms when taking the IMP, they will act on it as per clinical standard, which might need consulting with the investigator. 5.4 Drug Accountability The Co -Sponsors will a rrange transfer of active IMP from GST FT PMU to the participating sites ’ pharmacies . The Principal Investigator will then take responsibility for IMP accountability by ensuring that: the IMP is stored in a secure location, segregated from other medicines, used and returned medication is kept separate from unused medication, storage conditions are monitored and recorded, IMP is dispensed to participants in accordance with the trial protocol and any randomization list, and unused medication is returned to the study team or destroyed if requested by the sponsor. Full accountability records will be kept for all"

IMP accountability records will be monitored by the Clinical Research Associate ( CRA ). 5.5 Storage of IMP Both IMPs will be stored by pharmacy , kept at 15 -25oC and dispensed after each study visit. Temperatures will be monitored within the pharmacy departments but this data will not be collected. 5.6 Participant Compliance Participant attendance and compliance will be recorded for all visits. Women will receive a diary card to record taken/not taken doses. Drug accountability will be conducted at each study visit by asking patients if they missed any doses and reviewing the diary card . If discrepancies are identified, this should be discussed with the participant. Any reported missed doses will be recorded in the eCRF. 5.7 Concomitant Medication A complete listing of all concomitant medication received from baseline to birth or study discontinuation must be recorded in the medical notes and eCRF, with the exception of standard medications given during labour . Avoidance of the following concomitant medications is recommended: - Metformin: Trimethoprim and vancomycin, which could theor etically cause acidosis - Ursodeoxycholic acid should not be administered concomitantly with charcoal, colestyramine, colestipol or antacids containing aluminium hydroxide and/or smectite (aluminium oxide), because these preparations bind ursodeoxycholic a cid in the intestine and thereby inhibit its absorption and efficacy Each drug’s SmPC should be reviewed for current information about management of concomitant medications. 6. Selection and Withdrawal of Partic ipants 6.1 Inclusion Criteria 1. Women between 16 and 45 years of age with GDM diagnosed at 26+0 to 30+6 weeks’ gestation in accordance with the NICE guidelines (one or more glucose concentrations of ≥5.6 mmol/l fasting or ≥7.8 mmol/l 2 hours after a standard 75g OGTT, and requiring pharmacolog ical treatment )."

Once a participant has provided inform ed written consent , baseline details will be entered into the eCRF. As soon as eligibility has been confirmed, treatment allocation will be assigned via the database , and the study ID created . All parties will be aware of the participants ’ allocation . The pharmacy department will be informed so they can supply the appropriate IMP for the participant . Emergency code break ing is not required as the treatment is open label. 6.5 Withdrawal of Subjects Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The investigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study drug in the event of inter- current illness, AEs, SAE’s, SUSAR’s, protocol violations, cure, administrative reasons or other reasons. It is understood by all concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study un -interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided. Should a patient decide to withdraw from the study, all efforts will be made to report the reason for withdrawal as thoroughly as possible . Should a patient withdraw from study drug only (and not from trial partic ipation), efforts will be made to continue to obtain follow -up data, with the permission of the patient. Participants who withdraw from trial medication will be asked to confirm whether they are still willing to provide : i) trial specific data , including samples at delivery , ii) data collected as per routine clinical practice . In case of withdraw n participants , they will be asked to return all unused IMP to the study team."

Note 1: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the comparator. Note 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. Adverse Reaction (AR): Any untoward an d unintended response in a subject to an investigational medicinal product which is related to any dose administered to that subject. Unexpected Adverse Reaction (UAR): An adverse reaction the nature and severity of which is not consistent with the informa tion about the medicinal product in question set out in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for metformin and UDC A Serious adverse Event (SAE), Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR) or Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (USAR) : Any adverse event, adverse reaction or unexpected adverse reaction, respectively, that Results in death (including neonatal) ; Is life -threatening; Required hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; Consists of a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Important Medical Events (IME) Events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to prevent on e of the other outcomes listed in the definition above should also be considered serious. 9.2.1 Reporting Responsibilities KCL & GSTFT have delegated the delivery of the Sponsor’s responsibility for Pharmacovigilance (as defined in Regulation 5 of the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 to the King’s Health Partners Clinical Trials Office ( KHP-CTO). All Adverse Events will be recorded in the medical notes. All SAEs, SARs and SUSARs (excepting those specified in this protocol as not requiring reporting) will be reported immediately (and certainly no later than 24hrs) by the Investigator to the KHP-CTO and CI for review in accordance with the current Pharmacovigilance Policy , and subsequently recorded in the eCRF . All SAEs will be reported using MedDRA coding , in liaison with the study CRA ."

The Chief Investigator will report t o the relevant Ethics Committee . Reporting timelines are as follows: - SUSARs w hich are fatal or life -threatening must be reported not later than 7 days after the sponsor is first aware of the reaction. Any additional relevant information must be reported within a further 8 days. - SUSARs that are not fatal or life -threatening must b e reported within 15 days of the sponsor first becoming aware of the reaction. - The Chief Investigator and KHP-CTO (on behalf of the co-sponsors ), will submit a Developm ent Safety Update Report (DSUR) relating to this trial IMP, to the MHRA and REC annually. 9.2.2 Definition of causality The assignment of the causality should be made by the investigator responsible for the care of the pa rticipant as: definitely, likely, possibly, unlikely , not related or related to other study procedure . An AE whose causal relationship to the study drug or study procedure is assessed by the investigator as “possibly”, “likely” or “ definitely ” is an Adverse Drug Reaction. All events judged by the investigator to be “possibly”, “likely” or “ definitely ” related to the therapy or study procedure, graded as serious and unexpected should be reported as a SUSAR . 9.2.3 Severity Regardless of the classification of an AE as serious or not, its severity must be assessed according to medical criteria alone using the f ollowing categories: Mild: does not interfere with routine activities Moderate : interferes with routine activities Severe : very difficult or impossible to perform routine activities 9.2.4 Expectedness If there is a t least a possible involvement of the trial medications, the investigator and sponsor must assess the expectedness of the event. An unexpected adverse reaction is one that is not reported in the current SPC, or one that is more frequently reported or more severe than previously reported. See SPC for a list of expected toxicities associated with the drugs being used in this trial. If a SAR is assessed as being unexpected, it becomes a SUSAR and it must be reported to the competent authority by the sponsor. 9.2.5 Adverse events that do not require reporting All adverse events will be reported from baseline until discharge from hospital for mother and infant ."

This includes but is not limited to: - Birth by C-Section - Planned h ospital admission s (including to give birth ), includi ng for treatment planned prior to trial entry, or for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition. - Post-partum haemorrhage - Genital tract trauma - Antepartum haemorrhage (approx. > 100 ml) - Postpartum haemorrhage (approx. > 500 ml) - Neonatal admission to high level of neonatal care for less than 48 hours - Shoulder dystocia - Neonatal hypoglycaemia, neonatal jaundice, respiratory distress or birth trauma Those events will only be reported to the sponsor if the investigator believes the event is a result of the GUARD intervention. All unexpected SAR will be reported. Further information in the reporting of AE for participants of GUARD MEC are described in section 19.7. 9.3 Trial Stopping Rules The trial may be prematurely discontinued by the Sponsor, Chief Investigator or Regulatory Authority on the basis of new safety information or for other reasons given by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee / Trial Steering Committee , regulatory authority or Ethics Committee concerned. If the trial is prematurely discontinued, active participants will be informed and no further participant data will be collected. The Competent Authority and Research Ethics Committee will be informed within 15 days of the early termination of the trial. 10. Statistics Appropriate summary statistics (means, medians, percentages and measures of dispersion such as the standard deviation and interquartile range) will be generated according to treatment assignment for important baseline covariates and for primar y and secondary outcomes. At all follow -up visits, summary statistics for the observed values and for changes from baseline will be computed and tabulated for all primary, secondary and safety outcomes. In the event that a participant stops the interventi on, they will be encouraged to continue to be part of the study. These participants will form part of the final analysis on an intention to treat basis."

This gives 90% power to detect the primary outcome of a difference in maternal fasting glucose at 36 weeks of 6% (0.28mmol/L). This sample size calculation was performed using data obtained from a previous study that reported differences with UDCA treatment for non -alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a population of similar body mass index and age to our study group44, and the difference in glucose level is thought clinically relevant as it is equivalent to the differ ence in glucose categories between which differences in LGA, primary caesarean section, cord blood serum C-peptide level >90th centile and clinical neonatal hypoglycaemia were evident in the HAPO study43. Using two -sided calculations with alpha 0. 05, 63 women per arm would be required to determine this reduction with 90% power. Thus, allowing for approximately 20% dropouts, the numbers rise to 158 women in total. 10.2 Randomisation Randomisation will be minimised in groups by four variables: BMI, by previous history of GDM , severity and by centre . Due to the large pill size and different dosage , this will be an open label study . 10.3 Analysis Interim analysis will be conducted as described in section 11.4.The stopping rule will be based on the Peto principle53, that the trial should continue except in the face of overwhelming evidence (P<0.0001), sufficient to make a recommendation affecting all future obese or overweight pregnant women. The main analysis will follow the intention to treat ( ITT) principle, using all available data on randomised women, according to the intended treatment option (The ITT database). Should there be a large number of women (over 20%) not following the randomised treatment, a per protocol (PP) dataset limited to women following the intended treatment will also be established and a secondary PP analysis will be conducted. All comparisons by treatment group will be adjusted for all variables used in the randomisation. Data derived from the CGM will be analysed at 3 6 weeks. The differences caused by the randomised treatment, adjusting for the baseline randomisation measurements by multiple regression. This method (also known as ANCOVA) will increase the power and accuracy of these comparisons. UDCA will be declared non-inferior to metformin if metformin does not have a significant advantage, and the largest plausible advantage (by 95% Confidence Interval) is less than 0.28 mmol/L. If neither treatment shows a significant advantage , and the difference and CI are less than 0.28 mmol/L, the treatment s will be regarded as equivalent54."

We will follow a four -point framework for dealing with incomplete observations which will allow the correct method to be chosen and subsequently implemented 52. 1. Attempt to follow up all randomized participants, even if they withdraw from allocated trea tment 2. Perform a main analysis of all observed data that is valid under a plausible assumption about the missing data. Specifically, we will assume data is missing at random (MAR). Under this assumption, imbalances between treatment groups due to dropou t can be corrected by appropriate multiple regression models. 3. Perform a sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of departures from the assumption made in the main analysis. The MNAR (missing not at random) analysis will use the method of White et al. (2011)52 as implemented in the Stata command rctmiss. 4. Account for all randomized participants, at least in the sensitivity analyses This framework highlights the importance of using plausible assumptions with regards to the nature of the missing d ata. These assumptions will then be tested using appropriate sensitivity analyses on observed data using complete cases analysis. For the purpose of the main analysis we will make the assumption that missing data is missing at random and the effect of the intervention is the same in those with and without the observations. Furthermore, we will check whether there is an imbalance or is similar the percentage of missing data within each treatment allocation. Unused data. The principal analysis will follow t he intention to treat principle. All consenting women randomised for whom adequate data is collected will be included in the primary and main secondary endpoints. A secondary, per protocol analysis of the primary outcome will be limited to women who take the majority of their randomised medication. False data. We will take all reasonable precautions to minimise the number of data errors. Everyone responsible for collecting data will be trained in the procedures to followed. All data entered will be checke d by the study team as per the Data Monitoring Plan and Data Management Plan ; and again by the statistician at the time of analysis; and corrections made wherever possible. A detailed SAP, including dummy tables, will be prepared as a separate document. 11. Trial management and oversight 11.1 Overview of trial management The conduct of the trial will be overseen by a Trial Steering Committee (TSC). The Trial Manager along with the Chief Investigator and R esearch Associate will be responsible on a day to day basis for overseeing and co -ordinating the work of the multi -disciplinary trial team."
33,page_33,"EudraCT Number 2019 -002880 -82, IRAS Number 1003208 GUARD protocol V1.0 11Mar 20 Page 34 of 53 The TMG will outsource services of an electronic data capture and randomisation services. The CRA and trial statistician will be re sponsible for monitoring data collection, processing data and conducting data validation. The KHP -CTO acts on the behalf of the sponsor and provides quality assurance and trial monitoring. The minutes from discussions of the study committees will be f ormally documented and a record kept in the TMF. 11.2 Trial Management Group The Trial Management Group (TMG) will be chaired by the trial manager, and will include the Chief Investigator, CTM, selected co -investigators (or delegated individuals), a cons ultant midwife and a research matron, Statistician and CRA. For selected meetings, the TMG may additionally include the Trial Pharmacist, representatives from KHP -CTO and the Trial Sponsors as required. This group will have responsibility for the day to da y operational management of the trial. Regular meetings of the TMG will be held to discuss and monitor trial progress and solve problems . 11.3 Trial Steering Committee A TSC will be established prior to the start of the study , with a mix of independent and study team members . The TSC will be an executive committee, responsible for the overall supervision on behalf of the Sponsor and the Funder, and will ensure that the trial is conducted in accordance with the rigorous standards set out in the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research and Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The TSC will consist of an independent chair, the Chief Investigator, the statistician, independent members consisting of a group of experienced obstetricians and dia betologists , specialist nurses and midwives and PPI members. The TSC will discuss recommendation s raised by the IDMC . A charter will be agreed by the members , listing the detailed Terms of Reference and frequency of meetings. The group will meet at least annually. 11.4 Independent Data Monitoring Committee An IDMC will be appointed comprising two fully independent clinicians and a n independent statistician. This group will be an advisory committee to the TSC. The IDMC will review outcomes after 40 (25%) of participants have given birth. Interim analys is will be performed and reported to the IDMC including rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes and to identify causes for participant withdrawal. The IDMC ’s responsibility is to safeguard the interests of the trial participants and advise the TSC to protect the validity and credibility of the trial. During the recruitment period, reports will be provided to the IDMC as per charter, which will include inform ation on the AEs reported, recruitment, along with any other data that the committee may request. The IDMC will advise the TSC if, in their view, the randomised comparisons have provided both (i) 'proof beyond reasonable doubt' that for all, or some, the t reatment is clearly indicated or clearly contra -indicated and (ii) evidence that might reasonably be expected to materially influence future patient management.

Frequ ency of meetings will be defined in a charter document. 11.5 Patient and Public Involvement At least one, and preferably two, service users will be involved in the design and management of the trial (i.e. as a member of the TSC), developing participant information resources and contributing to the reporting of the research. This approach has been very successful in previous trials within the study team . We performed an internet survey of mothers with GDM to establish whether they would be happy to tak e an alternative drug to metformin (we also asked if they would be happy to take both drugs, although this is not of relevance to current study design). The results were supportive of the study design. In brief, 30 women with previous GDM responded, 14 of whom were treated with metformin. Responses of relevance to this study were:  68% would prefer oral treatments rather than insulin  72% believe additional treatments are needed as well as diet and lifestyle change  68% would be happy to participate in a tr ial of a new drug that has good safety data in pregnancy but that has not been used to treat GDM  58% would be happy to take the new tablet instead of metformin or insulin 12. Ethics & Regulatory Approvals The trial will be conducted in compliance with the principles of t he Declaration of Helsinki (1996 ), the principles of GCP and in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements including but not limited to the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research and the Medicines for Human U se (Clinical Trial) Regulations 2004, as amended in 2006 and any subsequent amendments. This protocol and related documents has been submitted for review to Health Research Authority (HRA), Research Ethics Committee (REC), and to the Medicines and Healthc are products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for Clinical Trial Authorisation. The Chief Investigator will submit a final report at conclusion of the trial to the KHP - CTO (on behalf of the Sponsor) and the REC within the timelines defined in the Regulations. The KHP-CTO or delegate will upload the final report to EudraCT on behalf of the Sponsor. 12.1 Ethical issues There is a chance that UDCA treatment will not improve GDM control or could worsen maternal or fetal lipid profiles or outcomes. However, this is v ery unlikely given that our pilot data in humans and mice indicate that it will be beneficial. Furthermore, previous clinical trials by ourselves and others for ICP have not demonstrated adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with the drug. When UDC A was evaluated in a previous study to establish whether it was an acceptable drug for women with ICP (the PITCH pilot trial)45, 13 (23%) adverse events took place among women randomised to UDCA compared with 10"
35,page_35,"EudraCT Number 2019 -002880 -82, IRAS Number 1003208 GUARD protocol V1.0 11Mar 20 Page 36 of 53 (18%) among women randomised to placebo. No woman reported more than one adverse event. Most adverse events were mild, with the remainder classified as moderate (eight); none were classed as severe by the site principal investigators. Most adverse events related to gastrointestinal disturbances (nin e in the UDCA arm versus five in the placebo arm). Importantly, the majority were thought not, or unlikely, to be caused by the trial drug (possible causality in four events in the UDCA arm versus two in placebo arm). Given the glucose -lowering effects o f UDCA, there is a theoretical potential for UDCA to lower glucose below safe levels (hypoglycaemia). However, there is no clinical or experimental evidence that UDCA treatment causes hypoglycaemia; in murine studies, treatment with UDCA lowers blood gluco se levels for obese, but not healthy mice, to healthy levels50. In human studies, treatment of obese women with 6 weeks of UDCA did not lower their fasting glucose below normoglycaemia (2x SD below the mean)44. 13. Quality Assurance Trial committees ( IDMC and TSC ) will be appointed to oversee the conduct of the study. Monitoring to ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice and scientific integrity will be managed and oversight retained, by the KHP -CTO Quality Team. 13.1 Direct Access to Source Dat a and Documents The Investigator will permit trial -related monitoring, audits, REC review, and regulatory inspections by providing the Sponsors, Regulators and REC direct access to source data and other documents (e. g. patients’ case notes, blood test rep orts, scan reports etc). 13.2 Trial monitoring Monitoring of this trial w ill be performed to ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice, and scientific integrity will be managed and oversight retained, by the KHP -CTO Quality Team. A study specific monitoring plan will be developed by the KHP -CTO on the basis of the risk assessment. The KHP -CTO will carry out on -site monitoring to undertake source data verification checks and confirm that records are being appropriately maintained by the PI and pharm acy teams. The site PI will be responsible for ensuring the findings are addressed appropriately. The CTM will ensure relevant findings are discussed with the CI and the report is filed in the TMF. In addition to site monitoring, the CTM and CI will commu nicate regularly with sites via email, telephone and teleconferences, and will perform spot checks in the eCRF. 14. Data Handling"

The following guidelines will be strictly adhered to:  Patient data will be pseudo -anonymised .  All pseudo -anonymised data will be stored on a password protected computer system .  Data entered onto the eCRF will be pseudo -anonymised and stored on a secure server.  Full postcode will be collected and entered into the eCRF, but postcode will not be stored (the eCRF will match the postcode with the Census area (LSOA), which is the data that will be saved in the eCRF) .  All hard copies of source data worksheets and ISFs will be kept in a locked office within the trial site.  All trial data will be stored in line with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Amended Regulations 2006 and the Data Protection Act 2018 and archived in line with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Amended Regulations 2006 as defined in the Kings Health Partners Clinical Trials Office Archiving SOP, for at least 25 years .  Patients will be asked to provide their email addresses if they wish to be informed of study results and to be contacted in the future. We will collect th ese in the ISF and a copy will be given to the sponsor at intervals or at the end of the trial. 15. Data Management Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will used to capture the data of each subject considered in the study. No identifiable data will be collected for people who do not consent to participate in the trial , but reasons for not consenting will be collected . These forms will be standardised and protocol specific and create a time stamped electronic record of any amendments or additions to the document. eCRF pages will be monitored on an ongoing basis by the study monitor and the t rial manager and queries raised to resolve discrepancies . There will be some instances where data may be inputted into the eCRF directly. In those cases, the eCRF wil l become the source data. Those may be: - Medical history & demographics - Arteriograph results - Time of blood samples - Time and date of last meal - Questions related to IMP compliance where a diary card has not been completed - Reason for withdrawal - Research laboratory samples processing information and barcode This clinical trial will use the industry -standard secure database called MedSciNetLtd. All access to the MedSciNetLtd data system is controlled using a Username/Password login. Passwords are encrypted before storing to database, using SHA -1 hash (MS .NET SHA1CryptoServiceProvider). These are created and controlled by Administrative users of the system as identified by the Chief Investigator.

The back -up process is twofold: every 24hrs the database is backed -up to the server and every 7 days the ent ire server is backed up to an archival tape system. The trial manager will document database lock prior to the final dataset being sent for analys es. A separate Data Management Plan will be prepared for the trial detailing the checks to be undertaken. 16. Publication Policy Ongoing progress of the trial will be dissemin ated to the wider clinical community through relevant professional newsletters, meetings, and national and international conferences. The final report to the funder(s) will present detailed results of the trial. The trial will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (www.consort -statement.org). A lay persons’ summary of the pri ncipal findings of the results will be sent to all patients involved in the study at their request. Participants will be asked if they wish to be informed of trial results, and if they do, they will be asked to provide a personal email address for this purpose. Articles will be prepared for relevant professional journals as well as for peer - reviewed scientific journals. 17.

With additional participant consent, 80 participants will be enrolled. We will measure maternal gut hormones and metabolite profiles (UPLC -MS/MS) in plasma, and gut microbes (16S rRNA se quencing) and metabolite profiles (UPLC -MS/MS) in faeces . The metabolite profiles include measurement of bile acids (including UDCA), so it will be clear if women have taken (and absorbed) the drug. The nested studies will be performed at approximately 36 week’s gestation. These patients will be identified at the same antenatal clinics and divided into four arms : Arm 1: GDM Metformin 20 patients with GDM who were eligible and have consented to participate in the main GUARD trial and were randomised to metformin.

Should the patient agree to participate to this part of the research, a copy of the ICF will be signed by the patient and the investigator at that point or at a later visit (or delegated member according t o local standard practice), and a copy given to t he patient . A copy will be filed/ uploaded into the woman’s electronic maternity records. The investigator’s original will be filed in the ISF. After signing informed consent, o nly one study visit will be required for participation in GUARD MEC. For patien ts in GUARD, this will coincide with Follow Up 2 . Prior to this visit participants will be given a food diary to record their food intake 4 days before their appointment. Participants will attend the hospital at 36+0 weeks ’ gestation (+/-1 week ), after an overnight fast and will be given a standardised breakfast with pre -determined lipid and glucose content consisting of 50 g of fat, 75 g carbohydrates, ≥750 kcal. Participants unable to ingest at least 80% of the breakfast will be withdrawn. Blood samples will be taken at four timepoints . The following assessments will also be performed on those participants: - Inclusion/exclusion assessment - Demographics (including post -code), family, medical and obstetric data - Concomitant medication - Weight ( additional weight and height from booking visit to be obtained from medical records) - Continuous Glucose Monitoring implementation and education - Optional Vascular studies: blood pressure p ulse wave velocity , central arterial pressure, augmentation index. - Blood pressure and pulse (if not consented for the vascular studies) - Optional faecal sample (can be produced at the participant’s home and shipped to hospital) - Collect 4 -day food diary from participant - Study procedures -related adverse events - eCRF completion To coincide with the following hospital appointment: - CGM data download and collection of device.

Appendixes Appendix 1 - Studies of gut metabolites show conversion of UDCA to lithocholic acid (LCA), a potent TGR5 ligand. Our data suggest that UDCA treatment causes enrichment with bile salt hydrolase - encoding bacteria of the Bacteroidetes phylum (Figure 1A). These deconjugate intestinal bile acids, enabling their modification to the secondary bile acids ; in particular UDCA is converted to lithocholic acid (LCA). Of relevance to this application, secondary bile acids have greater affinity for the bile acid receptor TGR5 (also known as G protein bile acid receptor, GPBAR1), with LCA having the highest affinity37. Activation of TGR5 in the intestine stimulates the release of GLP -1. Our pilot data also reveal increased concentrations of LCA in the faeces of UDCA treated women (Figure 1B). Figure 1. UDCA treatment alters the gut microbiota in ICP women. A. The ratio of Bactero idetes to Firmicutes is increased with UDCA treatment of ICP, determined by 16S rRNA sequencing of the faecal microbiota. B. Secondary bile acids (LCA: lithocholic acid and UDCA) are significantly elevated in the faeces of women with ICP who were taking UD CA. C. The dyslipidaemia of cholestatic pregnancy is attenuated for cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with UDCA treatment. Groups compared with 2 -way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P <0.0001 . Appendix 2 - UDCA treatment improves ICP -associated maternal and fetal dyslipidaemia (Figure 2A). Importantly, we also show that maternal UDCA treatment is associated with improve ments in neonatal dyslipidaemia (Figure 2B)."
