Due to its mode of action (MOA), empagliflozin is expected to potentially alleviate congestive sy mptoms seen in patients shortly after initial stabilisation of acute cardiac decompensation helping t o improve heart failure ( HF)-related outcomes within several weeks after discharge from hospital. In-hospital initiation of different therapies is one of the best predictors of long -term adherence to medications and long -term improved prognosis. Trial objective(s) The main objective of this study is to assess whether in -hospital administration of empagliflozin results in improvement in HF-related outcomes ( clinical benefit including death, heart failure events (HFE) and the burden of s ymptoms as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomy opath y Questionnaire ( KCCQ )total s ymptom score )in patients hospitalis ed for acute heart failure (de novo or decompensated"

INTRODUCTION 1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND Heart failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases associated with high mortality and morbidity . Over 22 million people around the world suffer from chronic heart failure ( CHF), of which more than 5.5 million live in the US. Patients with HF a re at high risk of mortality and morbidity , 50% die within 5 y ears of their diagnosis of HF and a large number are re -hospitalised for exacerbation of HF sy mptoms [P16-03952, P16 - 05920 ]. Heart failure is the most frequent cause of hospital admission among patients 65 y ears or older [P16 -03952] , and there are over 1 million hospitalised patients each year with HF as a primary diagnosis [ R19-2918]. The cost burden of treatin g patients with HF is estimated to be $32 billion a y ear, and expected to rise to $70 billion a y ear b y 2030. Approximately 80% of the cost is related to hospital admission [R19-2917]. Two main ty pes of HF have been defined mainly based on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and also other structural changes in the heart. They consist of heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) ≤40% and heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) >40%. Relative prevalence of HFrEF among HF patients is approximately 50% [ R16-1528]. European Societ y of Cardiology in their 2016 guideline introduced a third ty pe of heart failure with LVEF ranging between 40 -49% named heart failure with mid- range ejection fraction (HFmrEF ). The exact characteristics of these patients, response to therapy or prognosis is yet to be determined. In this trial, HF patients with full spectrum of EF are allowed to participate. Outcomes for patients after a hospitalisation for HF (HHF) remain poor. Among patients with HF, 40 -50% demonstrate worsening of HF s ymptoms, and 30 -40% are re -hospitalis ed within 6 months after discharge from hospital [ R19- 2916, R19- 2915 ]. After HHF, the one -year mortality rate is high and essentially not different between patients with preserved or reduced LVEF [ R16-2217], underscoring a high unmet medical need in this population. Most hospital admissions for acute decompensation of HF are due to volume overload, evident by weight gain or information gathered from ha emody namic monitors or insertable devices [ R19-2914] . In addition, despite apparent sy mptom control at the time of discharge from hospital, up to 40% of patients still have residual congestion [ R19-2913]. The current treatment strategy for patients hospitalised for acute cardiac decompensation is mainly focused around maintaining previously established guideline directed medical therap y, blood pressure stabilis ation, optimi sing volume status, in HFrEF pts initiating life - saving therapies, and initiating beta -blockers if indicated [P13-06404] . Based on available data, in well -selected patients w ho are h aemod ynamically stable during hospitalis ation for HF, guideline -recommended HF -related medications can be safel y initiated [R19-2924], including a recent trial of sacubitril/valsartan, which demonstrated safe and efficac ious use in stabilised patients with acute decompensated heart failur e with low EF before discharge [R19-2932 ]."

Empagliflozin is an orally available inhibitor of the renal depe ndent sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT -2), promoting urinary glucose excretion. Empagliflozin is indicated for reduction of blood glucose in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ), and for cardiovascular (CV)death risk reduction in patients wit h T2DM and established CV disease. Empagliflozin also reduces blood pressure, arterial stiffness and measures of my ocardial workload, likely through various mechanisms, as well as improving other CVrisk factors (e.g. uric acid, visceral fat mass, albuminu ria; [ P15-00589, P15 - 09541]. In 2010, BI initiated the EMPA- REG (Empagliflozin –Reducing Excess Glucose) OUTCOME trial to explore the CV benefit of the drug as well as to establish the CV safet y of empagliflozin [ P15-09840]. This trial was completed in 2015 and showed that empagliflozin, when given in a ddition to standard of care treatment in high CV risk patients with T2DM, reduces the risk of 3- point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 14%, which was mostly driven by a 38% reduction in CV death. Furthermore, this trial demonstrated a relative reduction in the prespecified and adjudicated composite outcome of CV death or HHF by 34% and HHF b y 35%. Consistent with the main results of the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, in approximately 10% of the trial population who had investigator -reported heart fail ure at baseline (with subtype of heart failure not characterized), empagliflozin showed reduction in CV death, HHF, and the composite of HHF or CV death [ P16-01253]. In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin was associated w ith a lower risk of post - acute heart failure re hospitalis ation and mortality [P19- 01985 ]. These results indicate that treatment with empagliflozin may play a role in reducing the risk in the post -acute HF period, with a signifi cant earl y impact on HF hospital readmissions and mortality . Currently , two large clinical outcome trials are ongoing in patients with chronic HFpEF (EMPEROR -preserved) or HFrEF (EMPEROR- reduced) to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin for the reduction of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalis ation. In addition, two clinical trials in patients with chronic HFpEF (EMPERIAL -preserved [c26554599-01] ) or HFrEF ( EMPERIAL -reduced [c26554767-01]) to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on exercise ability using the 6 minute walk test are completed . It should be noted, that with the exception of smaller investigat or-initiated case studies, no prior clinical trial has assessed the effe ct of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized with HF. 1.2 DRUG PROFILE Empagliflozin is an orally available, potent, and selective inhibitor of the renal SGLT -2. Its selective inhibition reduces renal reabsorption of sodium and glucose. This leads to both increased urinary sodium and glucose excretion. While urinary sodium excretion returns to"

Empagliflozin has been developed for the treatment of T2DM, and has received marketing approval in various regions including for example the European Union, Latin American countries, USA and Japan where it is marketed under the brand name Jardiance®. For a more detailed description o f the drug profile please refer to the current I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) [ c01678844] and local prescribing information for empagliflozin. The Residual Effect Period (REP) of empagliflozin is 7 day s. This is the period after the last dose with measurable drug levels and/or pharmacody namic effects still likely to be present. 1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL Outcomes for patients after a HHF remain poor but in -hospital initiation of different therapies is one of the best predi ctors of long -term adherence to medications [R19-2911, R19 - 2919 , R19-2920 ]and long -term improved prognosis [R19-2924], see Section 1.1 for further details. For empagliflozin, the mode of action (MOA) suggests a potential for improving patients` fluid retention and congestion in the context of cardiac decompensation , which is the rational for performing t his study : The glucosuria mediated osmotic diuresis , as well as natriuresis, is thought to result in long-lasting h aemody namic changes, less extracellular volume, increase of haemoglobin, shift in fuel supply from glucose to fat oxidation and towards more energy -efficient ketones, possible reduction of vascular wall stress, decrease of ventricular load and improving cardiac function [ P15-00589 ,P15-09541]. While empagliflozin lowers blood pressure, t his change is not associated with an increase in heart rate unlike what has been observed for vasodilators [ P14-01668]. The described effects start as earl y as with the first dose of empagliflozin taken or within the first few weeks of its administration [ P16-01830], which would be in line with the observed earl y effects on reduction in HHF as shown in t he EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. SeeFigure 1. 3: 1."

X -axis: study day [c02695839 - 01]. Patients with HFpEF are thought to benefit from combined beneficial effects of empagliflozin (see above). This benefit is expected based on the increased prevalence of obesity , hypertension, and anaemia i n patients with HFpEF [ R17-1562], as these concomitant conditions may affect heart failure (obesity : increased peripheral resistance; h ypertension: increased cardiac workload and ox ygen consumption; anaemia: reduced cardiac oxy gen suppl y). Although HFpEF and HFrEF are considered as different disease entities, patients with HFrEF are thought to profit from the same combined effects of empagliflozin, with potentially different weighting of the individual beneficial effects. Presently , there are two large clinical outcome trials ongoing with empagliflozin, the EMPEROR -reduced (NCT03057977 , EudraCT 2017 -004073-14 ) and EMPEROR - preserved trials (NCT03057951, EudraCT 2017- 004072 - 59), investigating the long- term CV mortality and mo rbidity benefits in patients with chronic HFrEF and HFpEF. Even if these trials are proven positive for long -term clinical morbidity and mortality , it will not be known if in -hospital use of empagliflozin is safe in patients hospitalised for acute heart failure , since hospitalised patients were excluded from the EMPEROR trials. Due to its fast MOA, empagliflozin is expected to potentially alleviate congestive s ymptoms and residual fluid retention seen in patients with acute heart failure helping to stabil ise HF -related s ymptoms within the first few day s and weeks after discharge from hospital."

The safet y profile of e mpagliflozin has been well established in over 15000 patients with T2DM treated in clinical studies (of which more than 10000 were treated with empagliflozin) with maximum treatment duration of 4 years. Empagliflozin was tested in over 4600 patients with T 2DM and high CV risk for median treatment duration of 2.6 y ears[P15- 09840 ]. In addition, approximately 550 healthy volunteers were exposed to empagliflozin (up to 800 mg single dose and up to 50 mg multiple dosing). Based on the mode of action of empagliflozin, which is independent of insulin and potential concomitant T2DM, it is not expected that the safet y profile in patients without T2DM would be differen t to that in patients with T2DM [P17-04479]. Because of the mode of action, blockade of the SGLT2 transporter b y empagliflozin leads to glucosuria in patients with and without diabetes, although with less average daily glucose excretion in non-diabetic patients. Therefore, it is considered likely that the tolerability of empagliflozin in non -diabetic patients will be as favourable as in those with T2DM. Available data from completed and ongoing trials do not indicate safet y conc erns for non- diabetic CHF patients, other than those alread y described for patients with T2DM. 1.4.1 Benefits A detailed rationale for the use of empag liflozin in HF can be found in Section 1.1 and 1.3. Patients with HF are thought to benefit from combined effects of empagliflozin such as persistent osmodiuresis, reduction in blood pressure, weight loss, increase in haematocrit, and changes in cardiometabolic parameters as earl y as the first few weeks of empaglifl ozin administrations. Due to the combination of positive effects, empagliflozin is expected to address the unmet medical need of reducing congestion in this patient population. It has been shown in healthy volunteers that dosing with empagliflozin results in gly cosuria approximating 2/3 the average glucosuria in patients with T2DM. This is similar to the amount of glucose lost in T2DM subjects with moderate renal impairment [ P13-04190]. Because no difference in CV benefit was d etected for patients with renal impairment vs. the overall population in the EMPA -REG OUTCOME study , it is hy pothesised that the amount of glucosuria is not the main factor for obtaining CV effects with empagliflozin. I n the same study , empagliflozin impro ved the main outcome of CV death and HHF with a similar magnitude in patients with low or high levels of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c )at baseline, and independent of the amount of HbA1c change throughout the trial. In addition, a"

Tak ingall the data into consideration, the risk redu ction for HF outcome appears to be independent of the glycaemic status at baseline or the degree of gl ycaemic control throughout the trial or the amount of glucosuria, which suggests the benefits could be achieved in both diabetic and non -diabetic populati ons.

The frequency of overall adverse events (AEs), AEs leading to discontinuation and serious adverse events (SAEs) were comparable to placebo [c01678844 ]. In general there was a small increase in frequency of urinary tract infection (UTI) compared to placebo. There was an increase in frequency of genital infections with the use of empagliflozin. There was a small increase in total cholesterol, low -densit y lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high -density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and no significant changes in triglycerides. No clinically relevant changes in electrolytes were observed with empagliflozin [c01678844 ]. Known and potential risks in patients with CHF and without T2DM: In the empagliflozin HF program including two ongoing large EMPEROR outcome trials, and two EMPERI AL exercise capacit y trials (with more than 7500 patients being followed - up as of May 2019), the freque ncies of overall adverse events (AE), severe AE, serious AE, and AE leading to treatment discontinuation reported in patients without DM were similar or lower than the ones reported in patients with DM and consistent with the known safet y reporting describ ed in the Investigator Brochure. The frequency of AE of hy poglycaemia in patients without DM was lower than in patients with DM. As of July 2019 based on blinded data review there has been no severe hy poglycaemia (i.e. requiring assistance) or serious hy poglycaemic events and no case of ketoacidosis reported in patients without DM and no other safet y concerns were raised in this population. Adverse events related to volume depletion, hy potension, urinary tract infections and genital infections in patients without DM were reported with similar frequency as in patients with DM. Many patients with HF have renal impairment, and to ensure that the trial results reflect this population, patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR ) ≥ 20 ml/min/1.73m2 can be included. In the EMPA -REG Outcome trial, the cardiovascular benefits for empagliflozin were not driven b y its pharmacological effect of lowering blood glucose and were consistently noted in patie nts with different degrees of ren al impairment, including 540 patients with eGFR between > 30 and < 45 ml/min/1.73m2. In previous trials in patients with T2DM, the safet y profile in moderate and severe renal impairment was comparable to the overall trial population [ P17- 10453]. In the ongoing EMPEROR trials there have been more than 1300 patients with eGFR between ≥ 30 and < 45 ml/min/1.73m2 with no safety issue identified to date. As part of the periodic Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC )review, the safet y in mo re than 400 patients with eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73m2has also been specificall y evaluated and as of July 2019 there have been no safet y issues."

In addition an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is implemented who is following up on patients `safet y in an unblinded man ner. Please refer to Section 8.7 for details. Risk evalua tion in relation with COVI D-19 Patients with chronic heart diseases are at higher risk for severe illness from COVI D-19 . Therefore, in case of local high risk of COVID- 19 infection, physical visits to the sites should be avoided as much as possible .In the event of restriction to visit the investigator site, certain procedures can be done remotely , and local labs can be used instead of central lab . These changes are meant to keep the integrit y of the trial and they will not affect the benefit-risk of empagliflozin. There is no indication that empagliflozin may increase the risk of COVID -19 infection. As with any acute ill ness, empagliflozin during COVID- 19 infection has the potential to increase the risk of ketoacidosis . The risk of ketoacidosis in ca se of acute illness is adequatel y addressed in the IB. The study drug should be discontinued in case of severe COVID-19 disease. 1.4.3 Discussion The overall tolerability and safet y profile ,as outlined in this Section 1.4and the evidence as summarized in the current I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB), supports chronic safe administration of empagliflozin 10 mg in human studies, specifically in the heart failure population intended for inclusion into this trial. Patients will be treated accord ing to standard of care and trial medication will be given in addition to standard therapy . It should also be noted that empagliflozin has not been approved for the treatment of HF. Given the short duration of the trial, the lack of an indication of empagl iflozin for the treatment of heart failure and the gap in knowledge in heart failure patients in the acute setting, it is justified to include patients with ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus in this trial, who may receive other antidiabetic therapies for controllin g their glucose levels. Therefore, the placebo controlled trial design does not constitute a risk for the population in this study . Due to the combination of positive effects, empagliflozin is expected to address the unmet medical need of reducing congestion in the patient population under investigation in this trial. Overall the potential benefits, coupled with an acceptable safet y profile support the initiation of the trial."

DESCRIPTION OF DESIG N AND TRIAL POPULATION 3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN This is a randomised, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo controlled, multinational and multicentre study . A total of approximately 500 male and female patients admitted to the hospital for acute HF will (de novo or decompensated chronic HF) be randomised (1:1) in the study in about 13 countries. The pre - screening period will start when patients are admitted. Screening (Visit 1) and randomis ation (Visit 2a) can happen on the same day . Randomisation should occur after at least 24 hours and no later than 5 day s after admission and before discharge when patients fulfil criteria to indicate clinical stability including a stable dose of diuretics . Visit 2 consists of two furthe r visits (Visit 2b and 2c) that will be performed only if the patient is still in hospital. All patients will be treated on top of standard of care. P atients will receive the stud y drug for 90 day s. A follow -up phone call will be performed 7 day s after the End of Treatment Visit.

Patients who prematurel y stop medication should have an End of Treatment Visit but be followed up until their planned Visit 5 (Day 90) according to the visit schedule. 3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF CONTROL GROUP(S) Hospitalis ation for HF identifies patients at increased risk of death and re -hospitalis ation following dischar ge. In the EMPEROR trials (see Section 1.1 ) patients hospitalis ed for HF were excluded. Since the long -term mortality and morbidity of empagliflozin in patient with chronic HF will be assessed in EMPEROR trials, the main objective of this study is to assess whether in - hospital administration of empagliflozin leads to an improvement in clinica l benefit (a composite of death, number of HFEs, time to first HFE and change from baseline in KCCQ - TSS)in patients hospitalis ed for acute heart failure (de novo or decompensat ed chronic) and after initial stabilis ation assessed by the win ratio . Secondary objectives are to further assess whether it is safe to start empagliflozin in patients alread y admitted to hospital in this setting . Choice of endpoint : Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) can provide information on a range of patients’ health status. Improving patient’s sy mptoms, phy sical limitations and quality of life is one of the key goals of managing HF, and is endorsed by practice guidelines and the regulators. Health authorities , including US FDA, and major pay ers such as the Center for Me dicare and Medicaid are increasingly interested in PROs [R19-3040 ,R19-3126 ]. To better evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on improving health status (sy mptoms, and phy sical limitations) , the Kansas City Cardiomy opathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) will be used in this trial. The KCCQ is one of the most validated , clinically responsive and widely used HF PRO instruments [ R17- 2687 ]. In addition, in DAPA- HF, an outcome trial in over 4700 patients with HFrEF, dapagliflozin showed significant improvement in change in Kansas City Cardiomy opathy Questionnaire - Total Sy mptom Score ( KCCQ -TSS)from baseline at 8 months. A similar improvement in KCCQ overall summary score and KCCQ- TSS was also detected in DEFINE- HF, a study of approximately 260 patients evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin compared to placebo on biomarkers, s ymptoms, and functional status in patients with HFrEF (both with and without DM) [R19-3125 , R19-3124 ]. KCCQ is a self- administered questionnaire designed and validated to evaluate ph ysical limitations, sy mptoms (frequency, severity , and changes over time), social limitations, self- efficacy ,and qualit y of life in patients with HF (refer to Appendix 10.1). In this trial ,the KCCQ -TSSwill be assessed by the win ratio as part of a composite clinical benefit endpoint including mortalit y and HF events (see Section 7.2.2 ). General safet y including parameters relevant to the empagliflozin MOA i.e. hypotension and renal function will be the focus of the safet y assessment in this trial. Although it is likely that clinical events like de ath and hospitalis ations will occur in this trial, this study is limited in its"

Control group: Due to its mode of action, empagliflozin has the potential to be efficacious in treating patients’ congestion with HF. However, the effect of empagliflozin in patients with acute heart failure (de novo or decompensated chronic) after stabilis ation in hospital has not y et been s ystematicall y asses sed in a randomised clinical trial. Currentl y, two large clinical outcome trials are ongoing in patients with HFpEF (EMPEROR- preserved) or HFrEF (EMPEROR -reduced) to evaluate empagliflozin for the reduction of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospita lisation in patients outside the hospital setting. The placebo -controlled design is considered ethically acceptable on the basis of appropriate criteria for patient selection and discontinuation, the ability to change background therapy to maintain, or obtain sufficient levels of haemod ynamic and gl ycaemic control (in patients with T2DM) as defined in relevant local and regional guidelines for optimised standard of care. Patients should be receiving appropriate care as defined b y their ph ysician or prac titioner for all cardiovascular conditions according to the prevailing guidelines. In HFrEF patients, t his includes, but is not limited to (if indicated and not contraindicated) acet ylsalicy lic acid, statins, a diuretic, an inhibitor of the renin -angiotens in sy stem with or without neprily sin inhibitor, a beta-blocker and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, each to be given at clinically appropriate doses, and the use of implantable devices like pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD s, or cardiac res ynchroni sation therap ies(CRTs )). This therap y should be selected in the context of local or regional guidelines for primary or secondary CV disease prevention. Duration: Due to the potential earl y effect of empagliflozin (see Section 1.1 for mode of action and EMPA -REG -OUTCOME results) empagliflozin is expected to exert its effect within a few days to weeks of administration. The primary endpoint is clinical benefit, a composite of death, number of HFEs ,time to first HFE and change from baseline in KCCQ -TSS at Day 90assessed b y the win ratio . Thus, a 90 day time point is considered suitable for the assessment of the primary endpoint and evaluation of empagliflozin safety . 3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION A total number of approximately 500 patients are planned to be randomis ed in about 13 countries and approximately 125 sites."

Given the patient’s agreement, the patient will undergo the procedures for the Early Discontinuation Visit as soon as possible after treatment discontinuation and the F ollow -up Visit as outlined in the Flow Chart and Section 6.2.3. In addition, if the patient discontinues earl y, every effort should be made for the patient to attend the regularl y scheduled study vi sitsand have all study procedures performed except those pertaining to drug intake. H owever if this is not possible, then the remaining visits should be conducted b y phone. In the rare case that even this is not possible, at least vital status and information about HFEs should be retrieved and documented at the day of the scheduled Visit 5 (Day 90). If a patient becomes pregnant during the trial, the trial medication will be stopped, the patient will be followed up during the trial and until birth or termi nation of the pregnancy (see further details in Section 5.2.7.2 ).

Empagliflozin exerts its effect b ypromoting glucosuria and consequent haemo dynamic changes associated with diuresis, improvement inarterial stiffness, blood pressure lowering effect with noincrease inheart rate andreduction inheart rate multiplied by pressure product, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption. These modes of actions support the scientific rationale of testing empagliflozin in patients with HF. IntheEMPA -REG -OUTCOME trial both doses were administered topatients with T2DM and showed to be equally effective in reducing CV death, HHF, and composite of HHF or CV death inpatients with HFatbaseline. In a subgroup analy sis,empagliflozin improved the main outcome of CV death and HHF with asimilar magnitude inpatients with loworhigh levels ofHbA1c atbaseline and irrespective of the dose of empagliflozin [ P18-10152 ].This indicates theriskreduction forthisoutcome isindependent of the degree of glycaemic control at baseline, suggesting thatthese benefits can be achieved with the10mgdose similar tothe25 mg dose inthenon-diabetic population . The mechanism of action is supported by studies in healthy volunteers where both doses were associated with a glucosuria of about 50g per day . Given the lower exposure with empaglifl ozin 10 mg and similar general safety , and similar observed CV effects for both doses, empagliflozin 10 mg once dail y has been selected as the dose in this trial. Forfurther details seecurrent version oftheIB [c01678844 ]. 4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups After the assessment of all in clusion and exclusion criteria, each eligible patient will be randomised to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, or matching placebo according to a randomisation plan in a 1:1ratio, stratified according to HF status (de novo or decompensated chronic) at Visit 2avia Interactive Response Technology (IRT) . Note that the medication number is different from the patient number (the latter is generated during screening via the IRT System ). Tofacilitate the use of the I RT, the Investigator or delegate will receive a manual including all necessary instructions for using the sy stem. A copy of the manual will be available in the ISF. Patient assignment to a treatment group will be determined by a computer generated random sequence. Access to the randomisation code will be controlled and documented -for further details please refer to Section 4.1.5.1 . and 4.1.5.2 . Using thisprocedure, relevant parties willbe blinded tothetreatment group assignment."

Trial medication will be dispensed by the pharmacist or the investigator in a double - blind manner. IRT will be used to allocate trial medication to patients. At Visit 2a patients will be assigned one medication kit for a 30 day s treatment period and 5 day s of reserve. At Visit 4 patients will be assigned two medication kits for 30 day s treatment period and 5 days of reserve each. During the COVID -19 pandemic ,there might besituations that would not allow a patient to come to the site for the study visit. If the investigator judges it as favourable and sa fe to continue trial medication, trial medication might be shipped from the site to the patient (for more details see Sections 6.1, 8.1 and 10.5). Treatment starts on the day of Visit 2a and ends on the day of Visit 5(or early discontinuation visit). For further details regarding packaging please refer to Section 4.1.6 . From the start of the treatment period patients will be instructed to take the trial medication once dail y with a glass of water. Empagliflozin can be taken with or without food. To ensure a dose interval of about 24 hours, the medication should be taken in the morning at approximately the same time every day including the day s of study visits . If a dose is missed by more than 12 hours, that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. No double doses should be taken. In case trial medication was discontinued for a temporary reason or by the patient without a medical indication , trial treatment can be resumed at any time until Visit 5 ( EoT). Trial medication should be restarted if and as soon as medicall y justified (see also Section 3.3.4.1 and 4.2.1 ). 4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding 4.1.5.1 Blindin g Patient s, investigators , central reviewers, and every one involved in trialconduct or analysis or with an y other interest in this double -blind trialwill remain blinded with regard to the random isedtreatment assignments until after database lock. The access to the randomisation code will be restricted until its release for analy sis. The DMC will be provided with unblinded data in order to allow them to review efficacy and safet y and to fulfil their tasks as outlined in the data monitoring committee cha rter. An independent team, not otherwise involved in the conduct of the trial, will provide the unblinded results to the DMC. 4.1.5.2 Unblinding and breaking the code Emergency unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT.

They must not be forwarded to other investigators or clinics. Patients should be instructed to return unused investigational drug. The investigator or designee must maintain records of the produ ct’s delivery to the trialsite, the inventory at the site, the use by each patient , and the return to the sponsor orwarehouse / drug distribution centre or alternative dispos al of unused products. If applicable, the sponsor or warehouse / drug distributi on centre will maintain records of the disposal. These records will include dates, quantities, batch /serial numbers, expiry (‘use -by’) dates, and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational medicinal product and trial patient s. The investig ator or designee will maintain records that document adequatel y that the patient s were provided the doses specified by the Clinical Trial Protocol ( CTP)and reconcile all investigational medicinal product s received from the sponsor . At the time of return to the sponsor <and/or >appointed CRO, the investigator or designee must verify that all unused or partially used drug supplies have been returned by the clinical trialpatient and that no remaining supplies are in the investigator ’s possession. 4.2 O THER TREATMENTS , EMERGENCY PROCEDURES , RESTRICTIONS 4.2.1 Other treatments and emergency procedures The use of medication for the treatment of HF will be at the discretion of the Investigator and should be in accordance with local/international guidelines. All concomitant (additional) medications and other therapies should be recorded on the appropriate pages of the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ). Concomitant antidiabetic medications should be adjusted individually as clinically indicated by the patient’s usual diabetes care provider. Additional guidance is provided in the IB. Restrictions of antidiabetic background therap y are described in Section 4.2.2 . Patients without a diagnosis of DM experiencing repeated or severe s ymptoms such as nervousness, sweating, intense hunger, trembling, weakness and palpitations should contact the Investigator or other healthcare profession al, as these sy mptoms might be suggestive of hypoglycaemia. In the case of h ypoglycaemia, in patients with or without DM, that may put the patient at risk (e.g. repeated s ymptomatic hy poglycaemia or severe h ypogl ycaemia), appropriate care should be provided at the discretion of the Investigator. Special attention must be paid to the prevention of ketoacidosis. All patients must be made aware of this risk and need to be instructed to contact the Investigator or other healthcare professional in case of s ympto ms of metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and DKA. Cases of DKA have been reported in patients treated with empagliflozin, including fatal cases. In a number of reported cases, the presentation of the condition was at ypical with only moderatel y increased blood glucose value s; below 14 mmol/l (250 mg/dl)."

Patients should be assessed and treated for ketoacidosis immediately according to local guidelines if these s ymptoms occur, regardless of blood glucose level. If ketoacidosis is suspected, the trial medication should be discontinued, the patient should b e evaluated, and prompt treatment should be initiated. Patients who may be at higher risk of ketoacidosis while taking empagliflozin include patients on a very low carbohy drate diet (as the combination may further increase ketone body production), patients with an acute illness, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g. Ty pe 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery ), insulin dose reduction (including insulin pump failure), alcohol abuse, severe dehy dration, an d patients with a history of ketoacidosis Empagliflozin should be used with caution in these patients. In patients requiring insulin, caution should be taken when the dose of insulin is reduced. In clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g. prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery ), the Investigator should consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporaril y discontinue the trial medication. There are no trial specific emergency procedures to be followed. In patients with heart f ailure who receive empagliflozin, elderly patients with heart failure and in case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. ph ysical examination, laboratory tests including haematoc rit), blood pressure measurement and electrolytes is recommended since empagliflozin may potentially lead to h ypotension. Temporary interruption of the study drug should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected. Temporary interruption of empaglifloz in should be considered in patients with complicated urinary tract infections. 4.2.2 Restrictions 4.2.2.1 Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment The use of an y SGLT -2 inhibitors or combined SGL T-1 and 2 inhibitors except the blinded trial medication is prohibited during the course of the trial. This also includes the 7 day s period between the End of Treatment ( EoT)and the Follow -up Visit. If any restricted treatment is given during the conduct of the trial, the trial medication can be discontinued temporaril y, or if needed permanently. If the patient is in need of an y additional treatment during this period, this may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. The patient can still remain on trial medication."

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sig n (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The followin g should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE fo rm (if applicable): Worsening of the underly ing disease or o f other pre -existing conditions. Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory test results, if they are judged clinically relevant by the investigator. If such abnormalities al ready exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only. 5.2.7.1.2 Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE ,which fulfils at least one of the following criteria: -results in death, -is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically might have caused death if more severe, -requires in patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation , - results in persistent or signif icant disability or incapacity , -is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect, -is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based on appropriate medical judg ement which may jeopard isethe patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or deve lopment of dependency or abuse. 5.2.7.1.3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious” In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by their nature, can alway s be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above."

A copy of the latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be reported as SAEs as described in Se ction 5.2.7.2 . Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as described in 5.2.7.2, subsection s“AE Collection ”and“AE reporting to sponsor and timelines” . 5.2.7.1.4 Adverse events of special interest The term adverse events of special interest (AESI) relates to an y specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESI sneed to be reported to the sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE s, please see Section 5.2.7.2.2 . The following a re considered as AESIs: Hepatic injury A hepatic injury is defined by the following alterations of hepatic laboratory parameters: an elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase ) and/or ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) ≥3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, or Aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥5fold ULN. These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patient s showing these l ab abnormalities need to be followed up according to the eDC sy stem. In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be fol lowed . Decreased renal function Decreased renal function is defined by a creatinine value showing a ≥ 2 fold increase from baseline and is above the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN). For the AESI “decreased renal function” patients need to be followed up appropriatel y based on local clinical guidance."

Due to its mechanism of action, empagliflozin may potentiall y modify the clinical presentation of ketoacidosis which may occur at lower plasma glucose levels in patients with DM and potentially also in non -diabetic patient population. The diagnosis of ketoacidosis in these patients can be based on arterial pH ≤7.30, serum bicarbonate levels <15 mmol/L and measurement of serum beta- hydroxybutrate levels. Other diagnostic criteria which can support the diagnosis of ketoacidosis are urine keto nes and anion gap >10 mmol/L . Investigators should note that not all criteria mentioned above need to appl y for the diagnosis of ketoacidosis, and clinical judgment should also be taken into consideration. 5.2.7.1.5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs The intensity (severit y) of the AE should be judged based on the following: Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated . Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity . Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities . 5.2.7.1.6 Causal relationship of AEs Medical judg ement should be used to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the adverse event and the given stud y treatment , considering all relevant facto rs, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re - challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history . Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a ca usal relationship could be : The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug . The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class. A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure. Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced . No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre- existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications). The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome). An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller effect size if dose is reduced )."

Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despite removing the original trigger. Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned). Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains unchanged. 5.2.7.2 Adverse event collection and reporting 5.2.7.2.1 AE Collection The investigator shall maintain and ke ep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files. The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by the investigator: From signing the in formed consent onwards until the individual patient ’send of trial participation (End of Study (EOS)): all AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs . After the individual patient ’s end of trial: the investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for new AEs but should only report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see Section 5.2. 7.2.2 ), but not on the CRF. For some t ypes of AEs additional information will be collected in the eCRF due to the nature of the event and mechanisms of action of the trial medication. These listed AEs are distinct from AESI.

Once a patient has been enrolled in the clinical trialand has taken trialmedication, the investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy in a trialparticipant immediately (within 24 hours) by means of Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry point. The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be followed up and reported to the s ponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part B).

Thetrial medication packs contain sufficient medication toallow forthe allowed time windows. Alltrialvisits should take place at approximately the same time of day and preferabl ybefore noon. During the COVID -19 pandemic, there might be situations when patients might not be able to come to the site for the scheduled visit. This might be e.g. due to restrictions set by authorities or by the investigator site/institution, because the patient is quarantined, or because ofany patient specific situation that the investitator judges as being not safe for the patient to come to the site. For details on potential modi fication sof the trial conduct related to the COVID -19 pandemic, please refer to Section 10.5 . 6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECT ED VISITS Please refer to the Flow Chart and Section 5 for details of the p rocedures performed at each visit. 6.2.1 Screening and run -in period(s) Due to the short time window when patients can be randomised (between 24 hours after hospitalisation and no later than 5 day s), potential study patients should be identified as soon as possi ble and their improvement followed up accordingl y (pre-screening). Potential study patients should be approached to assess their interest in volunteering as a participant in this trial as soon as possible. Screening Period The investigations for the main diagnosis for inclusion are to be completed and documented per standard of care as a prerequisite to consideration for study participation. Patients will be included in the study based on local BNP or NT- proBNP and other available laboratory measurements. Following informed consent, the patient will undergo Visit 1/screening assessments as indicated in the Flow Chart. The assessments must all fall within the acceptable screening visit window but do not need to be performed on the same day . The patient shoul d be registered in IRT as a screened patient. Re-screening within the same hospitalisation and current episode of acute decompensation is not allowed. Nevertheless, if a patient who failed screening before has another episode of"

Baseline Conditions Ongoing conditions/diagnosis from the Medical History questionnaire will be documented as Baseline Conditions. If the patient meets the entry criteria, Visit 2 a should occur as soon as possible once it has been confirmed that the patient is eligible to continue. If the patient does not meet the entry criteria, (i.e. fail to meet one or more of the inclusion criteria, and/or meet one or more of the exclusion crite ria) following Visit 1 procedures, they should be registered as a screen failure in IRT. 6.2.2 Treatment perio d(s) After a final check of all in- and exclusion criteria, patients eligible will be randomis ed at Visit 2ausing IRT. Randomisation can occur at the s ame day as the screening visit. All Visit 2a assessments must be performed before the first dose is taken in hospital . Assessments from Visit 2 awill be used as baseline values. Patients will undergo visit assessments as indicated in the Flow Chart . Patients will have further visit swith a reduced number of assessments two and four day s thereafter if they are still hospitalised (Visits 2b and 2c at Day 3 and 5). Thepatients willreturn totheclinic forregular ly scheduled Visits3, 4 and 5 (EoT) on day s 15, 30 and 90 respectively after randomisation asspecified in the Flow Chart. These on -site visits willassess theoccurrence ofsafet yand efficacy endpoints, trial medication compliance (Visit 3, 4 and 5 ), concomitant therapy or intervention. The assessments at these visits can be performed post-dose. Patients should be instructed totake their medication onthemorning of their visits at home like all day s. Visits should be routinely scheduled at approximat elythe same time of day for each visit. All other medications the patient is receiving should be taken as instructed by the ph ysician.

STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE The eligible patients for this trial will be randomised to one of two treatment groups (empagliflozin or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio, stratified according to HF status (de novo or decompensated chronic HF). The primary endpoint is clinical benefit defined in Section 7.2.2 [R16- 4813 and R19-3448 ]. The statistical model will be a non -parametric generalised pairwise comparison within HF status strata. The variance of the win ratio will be calculated using the as ymptotic normal U statistics approach [ R19-3448 ]. The primary model will be conducted on all randomised patients. 7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES For the primary endpoint, superiority of empagliflozin vs. placebo will be evaluated with one-sided tests, at a significance level of 0.025, in the following struct ure: Null hy pothesis – There is no difference between the effect of placebo and the effect of empagliflozin or the effect of placebo is greater. Alternative h ypothesis – The effect of empagliflozin is greater than the effect of placebo. Secondary and furth er endpoints will be evaluated in an exploratory manner. 7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES 7.2.1 General considerations The efficacy anal ysis will be based on the randomised set (RS), including all randomised patients. Analyses will be performed according to the intention -to-treat principle, with the use of all available data (on and off -treatment) through the trial period. This equates to a treatment -policy style estimand. If a Per Protocol Set (PPS) is required, this will also be specified in the TSAP. Important protocol deviations will be described in the TSAP. The safet y analysis will be based on the treated set (TS), which co nsists of all patients treated with at least one dose of trial medication. For both efficacy and safety anal yses, treatment will be evaluated as randomised. For all endpoints, baseline will be defined as the last available measurement before start of trialmedication."

This will be assessed using a win ratio approach. All patients randomised to empagliflozin are compared to all patients randomised to placebo within their stratum. For an y two patients, apatient will win, i.e. achieve a better clinical outcome, as determined by assessing the following criteria sequentia lly, stopping when an advantage for either patient is shown: 1.Death within common follow -up time death is worse than no death earlier death is worse tied, if not possible to determine 2.Number of H FEswithin common follow -up time more H FEsis worse tied,if same number of H FEs 3. Time to first H FEwithin common follow -up time earlier H FEis worse tied, if not possible to determine 4.KCCQ -TSSchange from baseline at D ay 90 more positive change from baseline is better the threshold for the difference is >= 5 f or a win tied, if difference < 5 Note, priority is therefore given todeath over H FE, and both of these over changes in KCCQ- TSS.Below are some examples: 1.Death, e.g.: Patient A dies 30 day s after randomisation (loses) Patient B dies 40 day s after randomisation (wins) 2.If no winner based on death, number of H FEswithin common follow -up time, e.g.: Patient A had two HFEs (loses) Patient B had one HFE (wins) 3.If no winner based on number of H FEs, time to first H FE, e.g.: Patient A had an HFE 30 day s after randomisation (loses) Patient B had an HFE 50 day s after randomisation (wins)"

The win ratio is then calc ulated as the total number of wins in the empagliflozin group (NW)across all strata divided by the total number of losses (NL).So the win ratio is= N W/ N L. The variance is calculated by the as ymptotic normal U statistic approach [ R19-3448] Separate summaries for each component of this endpoint will also be presented. The method of handling missing KCCQ -TSS values for this anal ysis is described in Section 7.3. 7.2.3 Secondary endpoint analyses Secondary endpoints will not be tested in a hierarchical sequence, and no adjustment for multiple comparisons is planned. Change from baseline in continuous endpoints, such as KCCQ-TSS, will be anal ysed using restricted maximum likelihood estimation based on a mixed- effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) analy sis to obtain adjusted means for the treatment effects. This model will include discrete fixed effects for treatment group (empagliflozin or placebo) and HF status (de novo or decompensated chronic HF) at each visit and continuous fixed effects for baseline value at each visit. Missing data caused by patient withdrawal or other reasons will be handled implicitly by the MMRM approach. Area under the curve (AUC) of change from baseline in log -transformed NT -proBNP level over 30 days of treatment will be anal ysed by an analy sis of co variance (ANCOVA). Based on literature reviews, NT -proBNP level is regarded as log- normally distributed, therefore values will be log -transformed prior to anal ysis [R19-3044 ]. The linear trapezoidal rule will be used to calculate the AUC after the log-transformation has been applied to each value. Analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) with a discrete fixed effect for HF status (de novo or decompensated chronic HF) and a continuous fix ed effect for baseline NT -proBNP level (log-transformed) will be used to compare treatment groups. The method of handling missing NT-proBNP levels for this analy sis is described in Section 7.3. Comparisons between treatment groups regarding the binary endp oint variable (improvement in KCCQ -TSS of ≥ 10points after 90 days of treatment) will be performed using a logistic regression model adjusting for the binary covariate HF status (de novo or decompensated chronic HF). The likelihood -ratio test will be used to test for a difference between treatments. Adjusted odds ratios together with 1 -sided 97.5% confidence limits will be used to quantify the effect of treatment, comparing empagliflozin to placebo as the reference."

Other secondary endpoints will be summarised descriptively (including day s alive and out of hospital). Analy sis of recurrent events will be described in the TSAP. 7.2.5 Safety analyses Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produc ed. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period (REP), a period of 7 day s after the last dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the on -treatment period for evaluation. All treated patients will b e included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned. Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment -emergent’. Frequency ,severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) at the database lock. Laboratory data will be analy sed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be summarised . Treatment groups will be compared descriptivel y with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically relevant abnormal values."

Reasons for discontinuation and u se of post -baseline concomitant medications will be tabulated. The details of the anal ysis will be specified in the TSAP. 7.2.6 Interim Analyses No interim anal ysis is planned bu t a Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC )will be in place with tasks as described in Section 8.7 . 7.3 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA Missing data for KCCQ -TSS and NT -proBNP will be estimated using multiple imputation , according to whether patients are on -treatment or off- treatment . Further details on multiple imputation and r ules for handling missing data for other secondary and further endpoints will be specified in the TSAP. 7.4 RANDOMISATION The trial will be performed as a double -blind design with respect to placebo and empagliflozin. Patients will be randomised to the trial treatments in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be stratified b y HF status (de novo or decompensated chronic HF). Patients will be randomised in blocks to double- blind treatment via an IRT system. Approximately equal numbers of patients will be randomised to each treatment group. BI will arrange for the randomisation and the packaging and labelling of trial medication. The randomisation list will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo - random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non - predictable. The block size will be documented in the Clinical Trial Report. Access to the codes will be controlled and documented. 7.5 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE Powers for superiority inwere estimated b y simulation using a shared frailty approach. Initiall y a frailty value was simulated for each patient using a gamma distribution. Deaths were assumed to have constant hazard for an y given patient dependent upon the frailt y term, leading to a marginal Lomax distribution. HFEswere assumed to have a Poisson distribution within patients, again depending on the frailt y parameter, leading to a marginal negative binomial distribution. The number of HFEs per patient was nominally capped at 7 per p atient over the 90 day period. ForKCCQ -TSS, the frailty terms were directl y transformed into a capped normal distribution (values below 0 or above 100 set to 0 and 100 respectivel y). High frailties corresponded to low KCCQ -TSS scores and vice versa. The use of a shared frailty"

Two Coordinating Investigat ors are responsible to coordinate investigators at the different sites participating in this trial. Tasks and responsibili ties are defined in a contract. An Executive Committee (ExCom) consisting of independent experts (including the Coordinating Investigators of this trial) and sponsor representatives will be established to support the sponsor in designing the tr ials and successful execution. The compositi on of the ExCom will be documented in the Trial Master File (TMF). The tasks and responsibilities will be agreed in contracts between the ExCom members and the Sponsor and also summarised in an ExCom charter. The Executive Committee will assess the baselin e characteristics of the patients in an ongoing blinded manner and if needed, may take appropriate steps, which may include restrictions to enrolment for certain subpopulations. A National Coordinator Committee (NCC) will be established and will consist of the leading expert(s) in each o f the participating countries. The NCs will support the Sponsor in the succe ssful execution of the trial. The NCC will have an ad visory function in the trial. The tasks and responsibilities will be agreed in contracts between the NCC member and the Sponsor . A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established. Members of the DMC are independent of BI, they are phy sicians experienced in the treatment of the disease under investigation and a statistician. The DMC will evaluate safet y data. While DMC members may be unblinded, measures are in place to ensure the blinding for every one else involved in the trial. Regular DMC meetings will be held at specified intervals. The DMC will recommend continuation, modification or terminati on of the trial as detailed in the DMC charter. DMC recommendations as well as the final BI decision will be reported to the appropriate Regulatory Authorities (RAs)/ Health Authority (Has) , IRBs/ECs, and to investigators as requested by local law. The tas ks and responsibilities of the DMC are specified in a charter. An independent external commit tee (Clinical Event Committee (CEC) ) will be established to adjudicate certain hepatic events and ketoacidosis. Hepatic External adjudication for hepatic events Certain hepatic events will be adjudicated b y external independent experts for severit y and causal relationship with the trial medication; both in a blinded fashion. Events to be reviewed will be defined in a charter. Events may either be defined by abnorma l laboratory values and/or r elevant adverse events or both. For qualify ing events, relevant source documents generated from any medical evaluations of these events will be requested including for example laboratory values, histological anal ysis, reports from ultrasound, computed tomograph y (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),"

In ex ceptional cases, when it is impossible to conduct the visits at the trial site, visits may be performed at the patient’s home or remotel y (via telephone and/or internet based means of communication). The visits may also be performed as a combination of home and remote visits. Based on a thorough benefit -risk assessment (se e Section 1.4. 2), the visit procedures may be adjusted for the purpose of particular visits, whereb y critical safet y measures will remain in p lace. All home/remote visits need to be discussed with and approved by the sponsor`s trial team. Local regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country need to be respected for all modifications. Under these circumstances ,thebelow modifications can be considered . Patients need to be informed about the modifications and agree to them before implementation (see Section 8.1 ): Remote visit If a patient is not able to come to the site for an outpatient visit, a r emote visit (by phone) should be performed instead and all assessments that can be done b y phone performed. Assessments that can be performed during a remote visit are: NYHA Classification, HCRU, parts of the congestion score ( Dyspnoea , Orthopnoea , Fatigue ), Adverse Events, concomitant therapy , Patient Global I mpression of Severit y of Heart Failure S ymptoms ( PGI-S). KCCQ is a questionnaire that should be answered by the patient alone. Patients can be supplied with the questionnaire to be filled out at home. The questionnaire should be answered on the day of the remote visit and sent back to the site. The paitent needs to be instructed to go alone to a quiet area where she/hecanrecord her/his response inthe questionnaire without interaction with others .Ininstances where apatient cannot give or decide upon a response, noresponse should berecorded. For illiterate patients the the process described in Section 10. 2should be followed during the phone visit. Safety lab, other labor atory tests If taking blood samples for central lab is not possible, blood anal ysis for safety lab can be done in a local lab. The results of the lab tests are to be reported and transferred to the investigator, who has to ensure medical review and proper documentation. Minimum required safet y lab parameters are e GFR and li ver enzy mes which will be captured in the eCRF. An urine analy sis should not be performed locall y. Dispensation of Trial medication (IMP) If a patient is not able to come to visit 4 as pl anned but theinvestigator considers it favorable and save for patient to continue with I MP, IMP can be shipped from site directl y to the patient (if legall y acceptable according to local regulations)."

Clarification of how the variance will be calculated by provid ing a more specific description. Rationale for change Based on recent publications and public scientific discussions involving representatives from FDA and other regulatory authorities, the win ratio has gained attention in the scientific community . Compared to the “net benefit” approach, the result arising from the “win ratio” will likely be better understood by regulatory authorities a nd by the scientific community . The overall statistical power for the primary endpoint will remain very similar with the win ratio.
