Loss of activity of SDH or FH leads to accumulation of the metabolites succinate and fumarate, respectively. Succinate and fumarate act as inhibitors of a broad array of D- ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. The Ten-eleven Translocation ( TET) family of DKG-dependent dioxengenase enzymes convert 5-methylcytosine to 5- hydroxymethycytosine leading to DNA demethylation. Inhibition of these enzymes due to SDH and FH deficiency causes DNA hypermethylation and has been verified in preclinical models. x Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. KIT and PDGFRA mutations have been identified as tumor initiating events in 85% of adult patients with GIST and these tumors are responsive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib. In pediatric patients, however, 85% of GISTs lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations (wild-type) and imatinib is not effective. x Recent work in the Pediatric and Wild-Type (wt) GIST Clinic at the NCI led to the identification of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency in approximately 90% of wild-type GIST 1. x In addition to wild-type GIST, SDH deficiency is also present in 30% of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PHEO/PGL) and a subset of renal carcinoma. Loss of SDHB protein expression is seen in PHEO/PGL and wtGIST either due to mutation in SDH subunit genes or hypermethylation of the SDHC promoter region 2-4. x Mutations leading to loss of function of FH have been identified in PHEO/PGL as well as type II papillary renal cell carcinoma in patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC)3,5. An FH-deficient paraganglioma had DNA hypermethylation as demonstrated by array and immunohistochemistry showed increased 5hmC levels in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. x SGI-110 is a small molecule derivative of decitabine that acts as a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor and is resistant to inactivation by cytidine deaminase, hence may thus have a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile compared to decitabine. Subcutaneously administered SGI-110 is gradually converted to decitabine resulting in prolonged exposure with a several fold increase in apparent T 1/2 compared to intravenous decitabine. SGI-110 has been demonstrated in preclinical models to induce a dose-dependent decrease in global DNA methylation and up-regulate expression of specific genes including MAGE-A1 and NY-ESO-1 through decreased methylation. x We are proposing a phase II trial with SGI-110 in these SDH-deficient and FH- deficient tumors."
3,page_3,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 4 Version Date: 07/22/2019 Objectives: To assess the clinical activity of SGI-110 in patients with wt-GIST, SDH-deficient PHEO/PGL, and HLRCC-associated RCC using RECIST (v1.1). Eligibility: x Adults and children ( ≥12 years of age) with wt-type GIST, SDH deficient PHEO/PGL, or HLRCC-associated RCC and measurable disease will be eligible. x Newly diagnosed patients with PHEO/PGL or HLRCC-associated RCC with localized, resectable disease will not be eligible. Patients with PHEO/PGL or HLRCC-associated RCC with unresectable localized disease and/or metastatic disease w ill be eligible. x Newly diagnosed patients with wt-GIST with completely resectable disease w ill not be eligible. Patients with wt-GIST with metastatic disease and/or residual or recurrent tumor following surgical debulking will be eligible x Patients with wt-GIST or HLRCC-associated RCC who have not previously received systemic therapy are eligible as there are no standard chemotherapy regimens known to be effective for these cancers. x Must have adequate performance status, may not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and must have adequate major organ function. x No history of severe or uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease w ill be excluded. Design: x This is a single site, open label, phase II study using a small optimal two-stage design to evaluate the clinical response in three groups of patients: 1. wild-type GIST (GIST without KIT or PDGFRA mutation) 2. PHEO/PGL in patients with germline SDH subunit mutation, or 3. RCC associated with HLRCC x SGI-110 w ill be administered subcutaneously at 45mg/m 2/day x 5 days on a 28-day cycle to the three groups of patients. x SGI-110 activity w ill be assessed by imaging res ponse of measurable disease using RECISTv1.1, using CT, MRI and/or PET. x Patients will be closely monitored for development of toxicity with regular physical examinations and laboratory evaluations. Toxicity will be graded using version 5.0 of the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. x SGI-110 related toxicities ≥ grade 3 will be cons idered treatment limiting toxicities, unless they are reversible within 72 hours with supportive care. Following recovery from toxicity up to 2 dose reductions will be allowed. x Initially 7 evaluable patients in each gr oup (strata) w ill be enrolled and if 0 of the 7 have a response, then no further patients w ill be accrued in that strata. If 1 or more the first 7 (14.3% or more) have a response, then accrual would continue until a total of 21 patients have enrolled in that strata. If at least 3 responses (at least 14.3%) are observed among the 21 evaluable patients, the agent should be considered worthy of further testing in this disease."

11,page_11,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 12 Version Date: 07/22/2019 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES 1.1.1 Primary Objective To assess the clinical activity (CR or PR) of SGI-110 in patients with wt-GIST, SDH- deficient PHEO/PGL, and HLRCC-associated renal cell carcinoma using RECIST (v1.1) . 1.1.2 Secondary 1.1.2.1 Evaluate the toxicity, progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and pain and quality of life (QOL) of patients on treatment with SGI-110. 1.1.2.2 Better define the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SGI-110 in all patients. 1.1.3 Exploratory 1.1.3.1 Determine the serum and urine concentration of succinate, fumarate and 2- hydroxyglutarate in patients with wild-type GIST, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma associated with SDH deficiency and HLRCC-associated kidney cancer prior to and on therapy with SGI-110. 1.1.3.2 Explore changes in DNA methylation and gene expression including SDH, FH, and tumor testis antigens in response to treatment with SGI-110. 1.1.3.3 Assess the global DNA methylation status in tumors by determining LINE-1 methylation in archival pre-treatment tumor samples and in on-treatment tumor samples when available. 2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1.1 Background Loss of activity of the Krebs cycle components succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex or fumarate hydratase (FH), has been identified as a mechanism of tumorigenesis in subsets of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PHEO/PGL), and renal cell carcinoma. DNA hyper-methylation has been demonstrated in these cancers2,6,7. Loss of activity of SDH or FH leads to accumulation of the metabolites succinate and fumarate, respectively. Succinate and fumarate act as inhibitors of a broad array of D-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. The Ten-eleven Translocation (TET) family of DKG-dependent dioxengenase enzymes convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethycytosine leading to DNA demethylation. Inhibition of these enzymes due to SDH and FH deficiency causes DNA hypermethylation8. It is hypothesized that a methylation inhibitor would impact tumor growth by reversing the DNA hypermethylation that is seen in this group of tumors with Krebs cycle abnormalities. 2.1.2 Gastrointestinal stromal tumors Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. KIT and PDGFRA mutations have been identified as tumor initiating events in 85% of adult patients with GIST and these tumors are responsive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib9. In pediatric patients, however, 85% of GISTs lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations (wild-type"
12,page_12,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 13 Version Date: 07/22/2019 GIST)10 and imatinib is not effective. Recent work in the Pediatric and Wild-Type (wt) GIST Clinic at the NCI led to the identification of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency in 88% of pediatric wild-type GIST1,10. Loss of SDHB protein expression is seen in PHEO/PGL and wt-GIST either due to mutation in SDH subunit genes or hypermethylation of the SDHC promoter region, which was seen in 21 of 95 wild-type GIST tumors examined1,10. 2.1.3 Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma In addition to wild-type GIST, SDH deficiency is also present in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PHEO/PGL)3,11. Pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are neuroendocrine tumors arising from the adrenal chromaffin cells and ganglia along the sympathetic and parasympathetic chains, respectively. Seventeen underlying germline mutations associated with PHEO/PGL have been identified and account for approximately 35% of PHEO/PGL12. Approximately 10-30% of PHEO/PGL are SDH-deficient13,14 and there is an increased risk of more aggressive metastatic disease in patients with SDHB mutation. SDHC promoter hypermethyation has also been described in PHEO/PGL as mechanisms for SDH deficiency in isolated paraganglioma15 as well as in patients with Carney Triad16. However, the percentage of SDH deficient PHEO/PGL with SDHC promoter hypermethylation is unknown. Surgical resection is the only curative therapy for patients with PHEO/PGL, however both radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine (CVD) have been used to treat patients with metastatic or recurrent disease12. Averbuch and colleagues reported a 57% response rate in pateints with malignant pheochromocytoma17. A recent retrospective analysis of 17 patients with metastatic PHEO/PGL showed a 47.1% rate of response to CVD18. A meta-analysis of patients with metastatic PHEO/PGL treated with CVD chemotherapy showed a 4% CR and 37% PR rate19. Approximately 60% of metastatic PHEO/PGL are methyl-iodobenzylguanine (MIBG) avid and can be treated with 131I-MIBG20. A meta-analysis of patients treated with 131I-MIBG showed a complete response rate of 3% and PR rate of 27%21. A small number of patients with metastatic PHEO/PGL have also been reported to have disease response when treated with temozolomide. While CVD chemotherapy has been described as standard therapy for PHEO/PGL20 the data supporting this therapeutic approach is limited. 131I-MIBG in patients with MIBG avid tumors or cytotoxic chemotherapy (CVD or temozolomide) is required prior to enrollment on this trial. However, patients who have refused cytotoxic chemotherapy or for whom treatment on this protocol prior to receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy is felt to be in the best interest for the patient by the local investigator will also be eligible. 2.1.4 Renal Cell Carcinoma Mutations leading to loss of function of FH have been identified in type II papillary renal cell carcinoma in addition to PHEO/PGL6. Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an autosomal-dominant hereditary s yndrome due to mutations in FH5. Approximately 93% of patients with HLRCC have detectable mutations in FH4. While renal cell cancer occurs less often than leiomyomas in patients with HLRCC, HLRCC-associated kidney cancer is typically clinically aggressive with early development of metastatic disease. Nephron-sparing surgical therapy is standard for localized HLRCC-associated renal cancer22. While there is currently no standard systemic therapy for metastatic HLRCC-associated renal cell cancer, treatments targeting the VEGF and EGFR pathways are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials22. 2.1.5 SGI-110"
13,page_13,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 14 Version Date: 07/22/2019 SGI-110 is a small molecule derivative of decitabine that acts as a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor and is resistant to inactivation by cytidine deaminase23. Subcutaneously administered SGI-110 is gradually converted to decitabine resulting in prolonged exposure with a several fold increase in apparent T 1/2 compared to intravenous decitabine. SGI-110 has been demonstrated in preclinical models to induce a dose-dependent decrease in global DNA methylation and up-regulate expression of specific genes including MAGE-A1 and NY-ESO- 1 through decreased methylation. 2.1.5.1 Pharmacokinetics of SGI-110 Studies were conducted in mice, rats, monkeys and rabbits to examine the PK profile of SGI- 110 available as a sodium salt. Intravenous, bolus, oral, and SC routes of administration were evaluated. Results of these studies are available in the Investigator’s Brochure (Guadecitabine: Investigator’s Brochure. Version 6.0, 10September 2015 ). In summary, in vivo oral bioavailability in rodents was greater than 30%, but in vitro permeability measured in human Caco-2-cells was poor. Additionally, SGI-110 degrades rapidly both chemically due to hydrolysis and enzymatically due to presence of phosphodiesterases and other enzymes (phosphatases, phosphorylases, etc.). These findings substantiate the selection of a parenteral route for dosing. Comparative studies indicate close to 100% bioavailability via subcutaneous (SC) administration. Once in the biological system, SGI-110 cleaves to decitabine, a known active moiety. The rate of this conversion to decitabine varies across species and appears to be much higher in rats and rabbits, compared to primates. When administered SC to non-human primates, SGI-110 releases decitabine slowly compared to other species, possibly prolonging the effect over more sustained periods. Therefore, SC route of administration is recommended. The recommended safe starting dose of SGI-110 for human studies, [Regimen 1 (Daily x5): 3 mg/m 2/dose, and Regimen 2A (Weekly X3) 6 mg/m2/dose], was based on (1) results from repeat-dose toxicology studies in rabbits (the most sensitive species) and rats; (2) results from a non-GLP non-human primate toxicology, PD and TK study; (3) the established PK and safety profile for decitabine. 2.1.5.2 Clinical Studies in Humans As of 30 June 2015, 5 clinical trials of SGI-110 have been initiated: 3 as monotherapy in AML/MDS, 1 as monotherapy in HCC and 1 in combination with carboplatin in ovarian cancer. Three dosing regimens (Daily x 5, Once weekly, and twice weekly) were employed in the initial phase I study in adult patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In a subsequent Phase 2 study doses of 60mg/m2/day Daily x5 and 90mg/m2/day Daily x5 were used in subjects with MDS or AML. An additional cohort in this study was treated with 60mg/m2/day for 10 days. In a single agent study, the maximum tolerated dose of the drug for the first cycle when given Daily x 5 to patients with MDS was 90mg/m2/dose. Dose limiting toxicities seen at 125mg/m2/day in this patient population were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and sepsis. The MTD was not reached for patients with AML with the highest dose administered 125mg/m 2/day Daily x5. In a phase II dose expansion for patients with AML and MDS dosing regimens of 60mg/m2/day Daily x5 and 90 mg/m2/day Daily x5 have been used. A total of 202 subjects have been treated using these regimens. There were no significant differences in complete response rates between 60mg/m2/day Daily x5 and 90 mg/m2/day Daily x5 in relapsed/refractory AML subjects (13% vs 19% respectively) or in treatment naïve elderly subjects with AML (54% vs 55%, respectively). The biologically effective dose was determined by assaying LINE-1 demethylation. In these patients there"
14,page_14,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 15 Version Date: 07/22/2019 was also no significant difference in LINE-1 demethylation between patients treated on the two different dosing regimens. A smaller number of patients with AML and MDS have been treated using a schedule of 10 days of treatment per cycle (days 1-5 and days 8-12). Patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer were enrolled on a phase II combination trial of SGI-110 and carboplatin (NCT01696032). In combination with carboplatin a starting dose of SGI-110 of 45mg/m2/day Daily x5 was not tolerated and the dose was de-escalated to 30mg/m2/day. Dose of SGI-110 of 30mg/m2/day + carboplatin AUC 4 was well-tolerated and is being used for stage II of the study. In patients with HCC, a Phase II study of mono- therapy with SGI-110 is ongoing (NCT01752933). Dosing started at 60mg/m2/day on days 1-5 every 28 days. This dose was reduced to 45mg/m2/day Daily x5 due to grade >/=3 hematological toxicity. Thirty-six subjects received this dose on stage 2 of this study. Overall, 22 of 50 subjects (44%) had SAEs in this study. Most subjects had SAEs considered not related to study treatment. No SAE with an outcome of death was considered related to study treatment. 2.1.6 Health-Related Quality of Life and Patient-Reported Symptoms 2.1.6.1 Study Measures Distress and Symptom Checklist (Appendix IV): The Distress Thermometer 24 is a brief screening tool endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) to assess for distress in adult cancer patients. The Distress Thermometer (DT) is a visual-analog scale similar to those used to assess pain. The DT obtains an overall distress score based on the visual analog scale, and includes a “problem list” , or checklist, where patients can identify specific physical and emotional symptoms and practical and family concerns that can cause their distress. The DT has been widely validated in adult (>18 years old) cancer patients, and has been recognized as a good alternative to many of the longer measures commonly used to screen for distress in cancer patients 25-27. Whereas the Distress Thermometer was originally written for adult cancer patients, early evaluation of the scale shows validity for children and adolescents with cancer 28. In an ongoing study at the NIH with 163 pediatric patients ages 7-21 undergoing treatment for cancer, NF1, HIV or a primary immune deficiency and their caregivers, an adapted DT has shown convergent validity when compared with standardized measures and with specific items on the symptom checklist. It has also shown reasonable concordance with parent and provider ratings 29. For this study, we w ill use the DT as a distress and symptom rating tool. It is quick to administer and a low burden to patients and their caregivers 29. Whereas most patient reported outcome measures utilize a 7 –day recall period (including the PROMIS measures), the adapted DT utilizes a 30 day r ecall period which allows problems or symptoms that might have been present in the past month, but not necessarily the past week to be documented. The distress and symptom rating scales will take approximately 5 minutes to complete. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a health related quality of life measurement tool that was developed by NIH to standardize patient-reported outcomes for national use by research clinicians. Two versions of PROMIS are available to researchers: computer-adaptive tests (CATs) and short forms. The short forms are brief, static instruments that have demonstrated similar reliability to the longer, dynamic CATs, which provide precise measures for studying populations with widely varied responses and longitudinal self-report data 30. Each short form includes 4 to 8 items, measures reported health outcomes in the past 7 days on a Likert type scale, and takes approximately 5 minutes"
15,page_15,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 16 Version Date: 07/22/2019 to complete. PROMIS instruments, measuring a broad range of health domains, have been validated for adults (>18) with a variety of health conditions 31. Early evaluation of PROMIS pediatric instruments indicates validity for children ages 8 to 17 32, hence this is appropriate for the age group 12-17 years old in this trial. Six pediatric PROMIS instruments and six parallel Parent Proxy PROMIS instruments (See Appendix III) are available to assess five quality of life health domains (physical function, pain interference, fatigue, emotional health, and social health) and are intended for use with both healthy and chronically ill pediatric populations. This protocol w ill utilize pediatric PROMIS short forms and the Parent Proxy short forms to assess symptoms that can be associated with GIST. These include physical function, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, pain interference, and peer relationships. Assessments of Health-Related Quality of Life w ill be administered at the start of therapy, at the end of cycle 4 and then every 4 cycles thereafter, and then at the end of therapy. The PROMIS Patient Outcome Measures (6) and patient-reported symptom severity (Distress and Symptom Checklist) will provide us with essential information regarding how symptoms may change over the course of treatment, and will also provide a more in-depth assessment of the known toxicities associated with SGI-110 in this patient population. The PI of the study w ill be notified of participants who have scores 2 standard deviations above the mean normative t-score of 50 (so a t-score of 70) on the PROMIS depression short form (suggesting high depression), and these participants w ill be assessed for s uicidal ideation by a member of the psychosocial team. Those found to have suicidal ideation w ill be referred to the NIH psychiatry service. 2.1.7 Rationale Based on the dosing regimens that have been tolerated in these ongoing trials we propose a starting dose for single agent therapy of 45mg/m2/day daily x5 on a 28 day cycle. The majority of patients enrolled on our trial will not have had extensive therapy with cytotoxic agents and hence would not be expected to experience the degree of bone marrow toxicity that was observed in patients on these earlier trials. Because GIST, RCC, and PHEO/PGL are more indolent tumors it may be expected that a more prolonged course of treatment w ill be given to our patients. In order to facilitate more long-term dosing of the drug two dose de-escalations of approximately 30% will be allowed. 3 PATIENT SELECTION 3.1 E LIGIBILITY CRITERIA 3.1.1 Inclusion Criteria: Patients must: 3.1.1.1 Have recurrent or refractory/unresectable disease for which there is no known curative therapy. x Wild type-GIST: Patients with recurrent or progressive disease will be eligible. Newly diagnosed patients with resectable localized disease w ill not be eligible. Newly diagnosed patients with metastatic disease and newly diagnosed patients with residual tumor following surgical debulking will be eligible."
16,page_16,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 17 Version Date: 07/22/2019 x PHEO/PGL: Patients with recurrent or progressive disease will be eligible. Newly diagnosed patients with PHEO/PGL that is metastatic at diagnosis and/or unresectable will be eligible Patients with PHEO/PGL with localized (non-metastatic), resectable disease will not be eligible. x Renal cell cancer associated with HLRCC: Patients with localized, resectable HLRCC-associated renal cell cancer will not be eligible. Patients with metastatic and/or unresectable HLRCC-associated renal cell cancer will be eligible. 3.1.1.2 Have one of the following confirmed histologically, cytologically, or through biochemical testing: x wild-type GIST (GIST without KIT or PDGFRA mutation); x PHEO/PGL with a germline mutation in SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, or SDHD; x renal cell cancer associated with HLRCC. Testing will be performed in CLIA certified labs using genetic tests for KIT/PDGFRA and testing panels developed for patients with PHEO/PGL. Results from outside labs will be accepted. Pathologic diagnosis w ill be reviewed and verified at the Clinical Center. 3.1.1.3 Age: be ≥ 12 years of age Because there is no dosing or adverse event data currently available on the use of SGI-110 in children < 18 year of age, children < 12 years of age will be excluded from this st udy, but may be eligible for future pediatric trials should the results of the study be positive. 3.1.1.4 Measurable disease: Have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as >20 mm with conventional techniques or as >10 mm with spiral CT scan. See Section 8.2.2 for the evaluation of measurable disease (RECIST v1.1). 3.1.1.5 Prior Therapy 3.1.1.5.1 Prior therapy requirements: x Wt-GIST: Because there are no standard chemotherapy regimens known to be effective for wt-GIST, previously untreated participants are eligible. x PHEO/PGL with germline SDH subunit mutation: 131I-MIBG in patients with MIBG avid tumors or cytotoxic chemotherapy (CVD or temozolomide) is required prior to enrollment on this trial. However, patients who have refused cytotoxic chemotherapy or for whom treatment on this protocol prior to receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy is felt to be in the best interest for the patient by the local investigator will also be eligible. x HLRCC-associated renal cell cancer: Because there are no standard chemotherapy regimens known to be effective for HLRCC-associated renal cell cancer, previously untreated participants are eligible. 3.1.1.5.2 Prior therapy wash-out period requirements x Participants must be at least 4 weeks from prior surgical procedures and surgical incisions must be healed."

Participants with prior radiation therapy must be at least 4 weeks post therapy and have had progression of disease outside the radiation port. x Participants must have had their last dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy at least 28 days prior to enrollment, their last dose of biological therapy, such as biological response modifiers (e.g., cytokines), immunomodulatory agents, vaccines, differentiating agents, used to treat their cancer at least 28 days prior to enrollment, their last dose of a monoclonal antibody at least 28 days prior to enrollment, and their last dose of any investigational agent at least 28 days prior to enrollment. x Participants must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of prior therapy to a grade 1 (CTCAE v.5.0) level prior to enrollment (does not apply to alopecia). 3.1.1.6 Performance Level: ECOG performance status <2 or Karnofsky >60% in patients > 16 years of age, Lansky ≥ 60 for patients ≤ 16 years of age (See Appendix I). 3.1.1.7 Have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:  absolute neutrophil count >1,500/mcL  platelets >100,000/mcL  total bilirubin within normal institutiona l limits  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) <2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal  creatinine within normal institutiona l limits OR  creatinine clearance >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. 3.1.1.8 Birth Control: The effects of SGI-110 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because decitabine is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months following participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 3.1.1.9 Ability of subject or legal guardians (if the patient is <18 years old) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 3.1.2 Exclusion Criteria Patients with any one the following will be excluded: 3.1.2.1 Ongoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy directed at the tumor, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy, including investigational agents for their disease. 3.1.2.2 History of allergic reactions to SGI-110 or decitabine. 3.1.2.3 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, symptomatic"

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with SGI-110 , breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with SGI-110. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. 3.1.2.5 Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, active infection, active bleeding diatheses, or renal transplant, including any patient known to have hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) w ill be excluded.

SGI- 110 w ill be administered subcutaneously at 45mg/m2/day x 5days on a 28-day cycle. Cycles may be repeated until there is evidence of tumor progression clinically or by RECISTv1.1 or there is intolerable toxicity that is not alleviated by dose reduction. SGI-110 activity w ill be assessed by radiographic res ponse of measurable disease using RECISTv1.1. Patients will be carefully monitored for toxicity and response. Time to progression, overall survival and quality of life will be evaluated as sec ondary objectives. 5.2 DRUG ADMINIS TRATION SGI-110 w ill be administered subcutaneously, preferably in the a bdominal area at 45mg/m2/day x 5 days on a 28-day cycle. SGI-110 is available in a two-vial system, (1) SGI- 110 for Injection 100 mg, and (2) SGI-110 Diluent for Reconstitution 3 mL. SGI-110 drug product admixed with the custom diluent as described in section 15.1. The reconstituted SGI-110 solution is stable for 1 week under refrigerated conditions. SGI-110 should be injected slowly (up to one minute) as some injection site discomfort or pain may be experienced. Care must be taken to avoid intradermal injection as this may result in injection site pain. To prevent injection site pain, patient should be directed to apply ice packs to the injection site before and after the injection. If the injection pain continues despite these measures, pre-treatment with topical or systemic analgesics may be considered. Patients will be observed in clinic for at least one hour after the first dose of SGI-110.Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate w ill be obtained and injection site will be monitored for signs of local reaction every 20-30 minutes in clinic for 1- hour post injection after the initial dose of SGI-110. 5.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS Although not a phase 1 study, toxicity w ill be evaluated and treatment limited by the toxicities defined below. This study w ill utilize the CTEP Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 for toxicity and Adverse Event grading and reporting. An adverse event must be judged to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to SGI-110 to be a treatment limiting toxicity. Because it is possible that longer-term administration of the drug may be required in these patient populations, two dose reductions of approximately 30% will be allowed for patients who develop toxicity determined to be treatment related. If a subject misses or skips a dose the dose will be given the next day. When a missed or skipped dose occurs, the research team should be notified to provide guidelines to the subject on whether to proceed with further doses. SGI-110 will be held for treatment-limit ing toxicities and re-started at the reduced dose after resolution of toxicity to a grade 1 or baseline. Treatment-limiting toxicity is defined as: x Toxicities that are possibly, probably or definitely related to SGI- 110 and are ≥ grade 3, unless the toxicity resolves/reversible within 72 hours with supportive care. x In addition, persistent grade 2 toxicities will be considered dose-limit ing if they are intolerable to the patient. If the patient experiences a treatment limiting toxicity after two dose reductions, SGI-110 w ill be discontinued permanently."

Patients with a healthy mouth may use non-alcoholic mouthwash 4 to 6 times daily (e.g. after each meal), or according to the instructions, during the st udy. Saline mouthwashes (Sodium chloride 0.9%) are preferred in cases of stomatitis, and should be used at a different time than toothbrushing (e.g. after tea). Consider treating stomatitis at an early stage (CTCAE grade 1) or as soon as the patient complains of a sore mouth. Consider using an oral topical analgesic, with or without topical steroids, depending on the patient’s clinical condition and the local standard medical practice. 6.3 DIARRHEA Patients should be made aware that they may experience diarrhea, and should record the number of stools and associated symptoms. Patients should inform the physician if they develop diarrhea. The following dietary advice should be considered: BRAT diet (bananas, rice, apple sauce, toast, plain pasta), readily digestible food, avoidance of lactose-containing products and fried, fatty or spicy foods, increased fluid intake (8-10 glasses of clear fluids/day (including water, clear broth, fluids containing salt and sugar). Patients should be given loperamide to take home and should start taking loperamide after the first episode of unformed, loose stool. If diarrhea persists and after consulting with the investigator, loperamide can be continued at a dose of 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Patients should contact their physician or study nurse if they have persistent diarrhea, diarrhea complicated by vomiting or fever, or inabilit y to take oral liquids 7 BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION 7.1 CORRELATIVE STUDIES FOR RES EARCH /PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES 7.1.1 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed in patients during cycle 1 according to Section 5.6, Study Calendar.

Systemic levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate have been investigated as a method of identifying patients with glioblastoma with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation 37. In these patients, the plasma/urine ratio of 2- hydroxyglutarate was significantly different between patients with mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes. Systemic levels of glycolytic metabolites are not well-defined in patients with wt-GIST, HLRCC, or PHEO/PGL. We w ill begin to explore the metabolomic profile of patients with tumors related to Krebs cycle defects. Serum and urine 2- hydroxyglutarate, succinate, and fumarate w ill be determined at baseline and on treatment. Plasma and urine samples will be collected at baseline and on day 7, 14, and 28 of cycle 1. Urine samples will be cooled to 4 C, centrifuged, ali quoted and stored at -80 C until analysis. Blood samples (3mL) w ill be collected in EDTA tubes and cooled to 4 C, centrifuged, and plasma will be ali quoted and stored at -80 C until analysis.

This is a secure program, with access to LabSamples limited to defined CPP personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. Installation of LabSamples is limited to computers specified by Dr. Figg. These computers all have a password restricted login screen. All CPP personnel with access to patient information a nnually complete the NIH online Protection of Human Subjects course. LabSamples creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced back to patients wit hout LabSamples access. The data recorded for each sample includes the patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, as well as box and freezer location, and date samples are sent to the investigator or shipped to outside institutions. Patient demographics associated with the clinical center patient number are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated with the processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.). 7.2.1 Sample Storage and Destruction Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at -80 qC in accordance to stability requirements. These freezers are located onsite in the CPP and offsite at NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by laboratory staff at all times. Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in LabSamples. All"
31,page_31,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 32 Version Date: 07/22/2019 researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused samples must be returned to the CPP. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator to ensure that the samples requested are being used in a manner consistent with IRB approval. Following completion of this study, samples w ill remain in storage as detailed a bove. Access to these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the rights to use the material. If, at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to be utilized, the individua l must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the samples will be destroyed (or returned to the patient, if so requested), and reported as such to the IRB. The PI w ill record any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples as a deviation. Reporting will be per the requirements of section 10.2.1 . Sample barcodes are linked to patient demographics and limited clinical information. This information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of the LabSamples. It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient information such as race, age, dates of diagnosis and death, and histological information about the tumor, in order to correlate genotype with these variables. The study w ill remain open and status reported to the N IH Intramural IRB until all samples have been analyzed, reported or destroyed. Unintentiona l loss or destruction of any sample s will be reported to the NIH Intramural IRB per the requirements of section 10.2.1 . Any use of these samples for purposes not described in this protocol will require prospective NIH Intramural IRB review and approval. Data from patient reported outcomes and functional endpoints w ill be sent to POB NCI for data analysis. All data will be identified using the st udy number; no personal identifying information should be sent to NCI. 8 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response after the first 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response. Response and progression w ill be evaluated in this st udy using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 8.1 DEFINITIONS Evaluable for toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with SGI-110. Evaluable for objective response: Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated w ill be considered evaluable for response. These patients w ill have their res ponse classified"
32,page_32,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 33 Version Date: 07/22/2019 according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions. 8.2 DIS EAS E PARAMETERS Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable. If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the cond itions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol. Malignant lymph nodes. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non-measurable. Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to r epresent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described a bove. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to repr oducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters"
33,page_33,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 34 Version Date: 07/22/2019 will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regress ion in the measurable dimension of the disease. Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each s hould be noted throughout follow-up. 8.2.1 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam. Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and t10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. Chest x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable. Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT"
34,page_34,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 35 Version Date: 07/22/2019 introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed. Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it ca nnot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances. Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The ut ilizat ion of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an e ndpoint. Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI 96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 26:1148-1159, 2008]. In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI 92:1534-1535, 2000]. Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. FDG-PET: While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG- PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial a bnormal FDG- PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD."
35,page_35,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 36 Version Date: 07/22/2019 c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease-specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. Note: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 8.2.2 Response Criteria 8.2.2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study. Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase. Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator). 8.2.2.2 Evaluation of Best Overall Response The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest"

The study will be c onducted as a small, optimal two-stage phase II trial 40, in order to rule out an unacceptably low 5% overall res ponse rate (ORR; p0=0.05), in favor of a slightly higher response rate of 30% (p1=0.30). With alpha=0.10 (probability of accepting a poor treatment=0.10) and beta = 0.10 (probability of rejecting a good treatment=0.10), the study w ill initially enroll 7 evaluable patients in each gr oup (strata) and if 0 of the 7 have a response, then no further patients will be accrued in that stratum. If 1 or more the first 7 (14.3.1% or more) have a response, then accrual would continue until a total of 21 patients have enrolled in that stratum. Only complete responses (CR) and partial responses (PR) w ill be c ounted towards the overall response rate. As it may take several weeks to months to determine if a patient has experienced a response, a temporary pause in the accrual to that stratum in the trial may be necessary to ensure that enrollment to the second stage is warranted. If there are 1 to 2 responses in 21 patients, this would be an uninterestingly low response rate, while if there were 3 or more responses in 21 (14.3% or more) patients, then this would be sufficiently interesting to warrant further study in later trials. Under the null hypothesis (5% response rate), the probability of early termination is 70%. With three cohorts of up to 21 patients apiece, the maximum number of evaluable patients required would be 63. In order to allow for a small number of inevaluable patients, the accrual ce iling will be set to 70. Descriptive summaries of the secondary outcome variables (toxicity, progression-free survival, overall survival, quality of life, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics) w ill be presented at the time of the primary analysis, and will be repeated in subsequent analyses to characterize the extent to which changes are maintained over a longer follow-up period. Each of these secondary endpoints w ill be assessed in a hypothesis generating manner, without formal adjustment for multiple comparisons but reported in the context of the number and type of evaluation being performed. In addition, progression-free survival and overall survival will be reported separately for each stratum. Changes in QOL will be evaluated relative to any degree of res ponse and summary statistics will be described over time. As these evaluations may be performed in a post hoc manner based on the response results obtained, the findings w ill need to be carefully presented in the context of the exploratory nature of the analyses undertaken."

There is no clinical information that suggests differences in SGI-110 metabolism or response among racial or ethnic groups or between the genders, indicating that results of the trial will be applicable to all gr oups. This phase II trial of SGI-110 will be conducted in children greater than or equal to 12 years of age and adults measurable , localized or metastatic or unresectable wild-type GIST, SDH deficient PHEO/PGL, or HLRCC- associated RCC w ill be eligible for trial participation. Patients with PHEO /PGL or RCC must have recurrent or refractory disease. Efforts will be made to extend the accrual to a representative group from this population, but with these uncommon diseases and with a planned accrual of 24 patients, a balance must be struck between completing the trial in a timely fashion on the one hand and the need to explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other. If differences in outcome that correlate to gender, racial, or ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or additional studies may be performed to investigate those differences more fully. 14.1.1 Gender and Minority Accrual Estimates DOMESTIC PLANNED ENROLLMENT REPORT Racial Categories Ethnic Categories Total Not Hispanic or Latino Hispanic or Latino Female Male Female Male"

Children greater than or equal to 12 years of age w ill be enrolled and the study will be conducted by pediatric oncologists who have extensive experience in performing investigational drug trials in children. Patients enrolled at the POB, NCI will be cared for in the POB outpatient clinic or day hospital. When patients require hospital admission, they will be cared for on the 1NW Pediatric Unit by the POB staff. 14.3 P ARTICIPATION OF SUBJECTS UNABLE TO GIVE CONSE NT Adults unable to give consent are excluded from enrolling in the protocol. However, re-consent may be necessary and there is a possibility, though unlikely, that subjects could become decisionally impaired. For this reason and because there is a prospect of direct benefit from research participation (section 14.5), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to f ill in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI or AI w ill contact the NIH Ability to Consent Assessment Team (ACAT) for evaluation as needed for the following: an independent assessment of whether an individual has the capacity to provide consent; assistance in identifying and assessing an appropriate surrogate when indicated; and/or an assessment of the capacity to appoint a surrogate.

In adults, SGI-110 has been relatively well tolerated. The dose limiting toxicities observed with SGI-110 include grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and grade 5 sepsis. The most common toxicities reported with SGI-110 monotherapy include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, diarrhea, injection site pain (including pain, burning, irritation, erythema, inflammation, bleeding, pain, or subcutaneous nodules), anemia, febrile neutropenia (See Section 9.1). 14.5 RIS KS /BENEFITS ANALYSIS Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. KIT and PDGFRA mutations have been identified as tumor initiating events in 85% of adult patients with GIST and these tumors are responsive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib. In pediatric patients, however, 85% of GISTs lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations (wild- type) and imatinib is not effective. SDH deficiency is present in the majority of patients with wt- GIST and guadecitabine may have activity in this population of patients. Approximately 10-30% of PHEO/PGL are SDH-deficient13,14 and there is an increased risk of more aggressive metastatic disease in patients with SDHB mutation. Surgical resection is the only curative therapy for patients with PHEO/PGL, however both radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine (CVD) have been used to treat patients with metastatic or recurrent disease 12. While responses can be seen with this therapy, complete durable responses are rare and additional therapeutic options are lacking. Guadecitabine may have activity in this population of patients with SDH-deficient PHEO/PGL. HLRCC-associated kidney cancer is typically clinically aggressive with early development of metastatic disease. Nephron-sparing surgical therapy is standard for localized HLRCC-associated renal cancer22. While there is currently no standard systemic therapy for metastatic HLRCC- associated renal cell cancer, treatments targeting the VEGF and EGFR pathways are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials22. HLRCC is an autosomal-dominant hereditary s yndrome due to mutations in FH5. All three of these tumors (SDH deficient PHEO/PGL, HLRCC-associated RCC, and wt-GIST) have limited treatment options for metastatic and locally recurrent disease and are associated with deficiency in the Krebs cycle components SDH and FH. These tumors exhibit global DNA hypermethylation and may be responsive to guadecitabine. Therefore, this phase II protocol involves greater than minimal risk to children, but presents the prospect for direct benefit to individual child-subjects (Category 2). 14.6 CONSENT AND ASSE NT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION The procedures and tests involved in this study and the associated risks, discomforts and benefits of these processes, will be carefully explained to the patient or the patient’s parents or guardian if"

The investigators are requesting a waiver from the IRB to allow only one parent to sign the treatment informed consent form to enter a child on the protocol. Because many patients must travel to the NIH from long distances at substantial expense, requiring both parents to be present for the consent process could be a financial hardship for many families. The parent who signs the consent for a minor must be a legally recognized parent or guardian. When guardianship status of the child is uncertain, documentation of custody status must be obtained. In situations where there is joint custody of a child, both parents must sign consent. If only one parent can be present at NIH, the other par ent’s consent can be obtained by telephone via the procedure described in section 14.6.1 . Where deemed appropriate by the clinician and the child’s parent(s) or guardian, the child will also be included in all discussions about the trial and age-appropriate language w ill be used to describe the procedures and tests involved in this study, along with the risks, discomforts and benefits of participation. Verbal assent will be obtained as appropriate for children ages 7-11 and the parent or guardian will sign the designated line on the informed consent attesting to the fact that the child has given assent. Children under the age of 18, but who are age 12 or older will be asked to sign an age appropriate assent form. Children under the age of 12 w ill not be required to provide assent as they typically do not have the cognitive ab ility to fully understand the nature of research. The consent/assent process will be documented in the child’s medical record, including the assessment of the chi ld’s ability to provide assent (verbal versus written) as applicable. 14.6.1 Consent for minors when they reach the age of majority When a pediatric subject reaches age 18, continued participation (including ongoing interactions with the subject or continued analysis of identifiable data) will require consenting of the now adult with the standard protocol consent document to ensure legally effective informed consent has been obtained. Given the length of time that has transpired for some of the subjects since their last visit for this study, we request waiver of informed consent for those individuals who become lost to follow up or who have been taken off study prior to reaching the age of majority. Requirements for Waiver of Consent consistent with 45 CFR 46.116 (d): (1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects. a. Analysis of samples and data from this study involves no additional risks to subjects. (2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects. a. Retention of these samples or data does not affect the welfare of subjects. (3) The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration. a. Considering the lengt h of time between the minor’s last contact with the research team and their age of majority, it will likely be very difficult to locate them again. A significant reduction in the number of samples analyzed is likely to impact the quality of the research."
52,page_52,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 53 Version Date: 07/22/2019 (4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation. a. We only plan to request a waiver of reconsent for those subjects who have been lost to follow-up 14.6.2 Telephone consent The following procedure may be used in cases where reconsent is required. This process may also be used to obtain initial consent of an absent parent when both parental signatures are required. The informed consent document will be sent to the subject. An explanation of the study will be provided over the telephone after the subject has had the opportunity to read the consent form. The subject will sign and date the informed consent. The original informed consent document will be sent back to the consenting investigator who will sign and date the consent form with the date the consent was obtained via tele phone. A fully executed copy w ill be returned via ma il for the subject’s records. The informed consent process will be documented in the medical record. 15 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 15.1 SGI-110 (GUADECITABINE ) (NSC 780463) Chemical Name or Amino Acid Sequence: Sodium (2 R,3S,5R)-5-(4-amino-2-oxo-1,3,5-triazin-1(2 H)-yl)-2-(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydrofuran-3-yl ((2 R,3S,5R)-5-(2-amino-6-oxo-1 H-purin-9(6 H)-yl)-3- hydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl phosphate Other Names: Guadecitabine Classif ication: DNA methylation inhibitor Molecular Formula: C18H23N9NaO 10P M.W.: 579.39 Da Approximate Solubility : It is water soluble at about 30 mg/mL over a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. It is unstable in aqueous solutions and is relatively more stable at neutral pH. SGI-110 is soluble in common organic solvent systems such as methanol, dimethylamine (DMA), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Mode of Action: Guadecitabine (SGI-110) is a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation. Guadecitabine is a dinucleotide of decitabine and deoxyguanosine linked with a phosphodiester bond. Decitabine is the active metabolite. Guadecitabine is a new chemical entity that was designed to enhance pharmacokinetic (PK) properties compared with decitabine, with potential to improve pharmacodynamics (PD), clinical effi cacy, and safety. How Supplied: SGI-110 for Injection is supplied by Astex Pharmaceutical and distributed by the Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP/DCTD/NCI as follow: x SGI-110 for Injection : 100 mg dry powder lyophile containing free acid equivalent in a single-use vial;"
53,page_53,"Abbreviated Title: Ph II SGI 110 in Peds & Adults 54 Version Date: 07/22/2019 x Diluents for Reconstitution : Two fill volumes: 3 mL or 1.2 mL  3 mL single-use vial containing non-aqueous diluent of propylene glycol, glycerin, and ethanol. (Will be phased out ar ound July 2019)  1.2 mL single-use vial containing non-aqueous diluent of propylene glycol, glycerin, and ethanol. (Will be available for use ar ound July 2019) All vials are packaged in clear glass vials with stoppers made of latex-free rubber stopper and capped with an aluminum flip-off seal. Preparation: 1. Allow SGI-110 vial(s) and diluent vial(s) to reach room temperature approximately 60 minutes. 2. Next, loosen the lyophilized powder of SGI-110 by gently tapping and rotating the vial on a hard surface. 3. Use a 1 mL syringe and withdraw 0.9 mL of diluent and add it to the SGI-110 vial resulting in a final concentration of 100 mg/mL. Manually shake or mechanically vortex the diluted vial(s).  Manually shake: Intermittently shake the reconstituted vial vigorously (approximately 5 minutes). In general, the shaking process will take 5 to 10 minutes. Rotate the vial and inspect the vial contents to ensure that all lyophilized SGI-110 powder has dissolved. After dissolution, allow the vial to rest until all bubbles have dissipated (approximately 10 minutes).  Mechanically shake (vortex): Before vortexing, rotate or shake the vial to ensure that the drug powder is thoroughly wetted with diluent. Then, vortex for 5-10 minutes at a speed setting of 5. Remove the vial from the holder and invert it 2-3 times. Place the vial on the vortex and mix for another 10 minutes. Ensure that all SGI-110 powder is completely dissolved. Repeat the process if partially dissolved. Once all drug is dissolved, allow the solution rest until all bubbles dissipate (approximately 10 minutes). 4. The final solution of the diluted vial should be colorless to pale yellow. 5. Withdraw the diluted solution into a syringe. If two or more syringes are needed to deliver the total prescribed dose, all dispensed syringes should have equivalent volumes for consistency and ease of administration. Note: If SGI-110 powder has not dissolved 60 minutes after completion of manually shaking or vortex, do not use the vial(s) . Vorte x: Sites that do not have access to a vortex may request it directly from Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Contact: Richard Morishige Phone: (925) 560-2882 Email: Richard.Morishige@astx.com Storage:  Store SGI-110 lyophilized powder refrigerated between 20 and 80 C (360 and 460 F)"

Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov for determination of suitability. Stability: Stability studies of SGI- 110 intact vials are ongoing. x Upon reconstitution, the diluted drug solution is good for 8 days refrigerated at 2 to 8 C Route (s) of Administration: subcutaneous injection Method of Administration : Administer by slow subcutaneous injection. Care must be taken to avoid intradermal injection. If injection site pain is reported upon injection, apply ice packs to the injection site both before and after injection for 5 – 10 minutes each; however, using icepack for the first dosing is not recommended. Pretreatment of topical or systemic analgesics can be considered. Potential Drug Interactions : Drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with guadecitabine or decitabine. In vitro studies suggested that guadecitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce major P450 enzymes and is not a CYPs substrate. Furthermore, guadecitabine nor the active metabolite decitabine inhibit major human drug transporters. Special Handling: SGI-110 is a cytotoxic agent. Use PPE when preparing the drug. Direct contact of SGI-110 to skin must be washed immediately with soap and copious amount of water. The drug degrades rapidly in soap water. If SGI-110 contacts the mucous membranes, flush the affected area thoroughly with water. Drug spilling can be inactivated by either using a 2 N sodium hydroxide solution or water and kericide CR Biocide B which consists of a blend of stabilized chlorine dioxide and a quaternary ammonium compound 15.1.1 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountab ility: Active CTEP-registered investigators and investigator-designated shipping designees and ordering designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and A ccess Management (IAM) account and the maintenance of an “active” account status and a “current” password.
