AtVisit 8 and Visit 9 of the open -label phase , all pat ients will receive a 120- mgdose of galcanezumab . All patients will be fo llowed f or a 4 -month, post - treatm ent phase during which no study medicat ion will be administ ered. Number of Patients : The study will randomiz e approximately 486 patients wi th EM. China, Russia, and India intend to parti cipate in the study . Statistical Analysis: Unless otherwise specified , analyses will be conducted on an intent- to-treat (ITT) populat ion, which include sall patients who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose of invest igational product. Patients in the ITT populat ion will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they are randomized . When mean change from baseli ne is assessed, the patient will be included in the analysis only if the patient has a baseline and postbaseline measurement. The primary analysis will evaluate the efficacy of galcanezumab compared wi th placebo on the overall mean change from baseline in the number of m onthly MHDs during the 3-month double - blind treatment phase. Migraine headache days will be defined to include both migraine and probable migraine (a headache missing 1 of the migraine features in the International Headache Society [IHS]ICHD -3 definit ion) days. The primary analysis will be performed using a restri cted maximum likelihood based mixed models repeated measures (MMRM) technique. The analysis will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, country , month, and treatm ent- by-month interacti on, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline number of MHDs and baseline number of MHDs -by-visit interacti on."

Study Rationale Study I5Q-MC-CGA X (CGAX; PERSIST ) will enable a co mprehensive clinical assessment of galcanezumab in China and selected other countries. Theevidence of efficacy and safet yof galcanezumab in prevent ion of migraine has already been confirmed in 3 Phase 3 studies conducted mostly intheUnited States ( US)andEuropean Union ( EU). The purpose of Study CGAX i s to confirm the efficacy of galcanezumab on the episodic migraine (EM)populat ions of multiple regions that did not participat ein the previous Phase 3 studies and to ev aluate safet y as well. Study CGAX will include up to 6months on treatm ent wi th investigational product ( 3months of doubl e-blind treatment and 3 months of open -label treatment) followed by 4months of post -treatm ent observat ion to further evaluate the effects of galcanezumab in prevent ing migraine. 3.2. Background Migraine is a commo n chronic neuro logical disease. As reported, it is1 of the 5leading causes of years lived wi th disabili tyin the world in 2016 (GBD 2016 Di sease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Co llaborators 2017). Theprevalence of migraine in China is 9.3% , whi ch is estimated to be approximately 80 milli on adul ts(Yuetal.2012). This is similar to the global average prevalence rate of 11% (Stovner et al. 2007) . Despite the high prevalence and associ ation with significant disabilit y,migraine remains undertreated. One study est imate dthat only a small fracti on (3-13%) of patients with migraine in the West ern worl dreceive dpreventive treatm ent, although m ore than 25% of themneeded it(Rizzoli 2014). In China, the corresponding rate for receiving migraine prevent ive treatment is even lower:only 2.7% of all patients were reported to have receiv edmigraine preven tive medicat ions (Li et al. 2012). Current pharmacotherapy options for migraine are not ideal due to the safet y concern . Most drugs used for migraine prevention were originally developed for other indications ( for example , topiramate as ananti-epilept ic). Al though these drugs (topiramate, propranol ol, flunarizine, etc. ) have been shown to be effective, not all patients respond to tre atment,and patients m ay experience adverse effects such as paresthesias, memory and concentration problems wit h topiramate, sl eep disturbance wit h propranol ol, etc. (Estem alik and Tepper 2013 ). Calcitonin gene -related pepti de (CGRP) isa 37-amino acid neuropeptide widely expressed throughout the central and per ipheral nervous sy stem . CGRP is implicated in the pathophysio logy of migraine andis hypothesized to be invo lved in the release of inflammatory mediators and the transmissio n of nociceptive (pain) informat ion from intracranial blood vessels to the nervous system (Villal ón and Olesen 2009). In individuals with migraine , serum concentrations of CGRP are significant ly elevated during migraine attacks (Goadsby et al. 1990; Goadsby and Edvinsson 1993), and infusio n of CGRP to individuals wit h a history of migraine can trigger migraine attacks (Lassen et al. 2002).

Visit 1 will be complete dwhen the last scheduled procedure of the screening assessment i s completed. Study Period II : Qualified pat ients will enter Study Period II (prospective baseline) to determine their eligibilit y for the study and to establish baseline data for comparison of endpoints during the treatment period. Beginning at Visi t 2, pati ents will log in daily to the el ectronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) system to answer ques tions about the occurrence of headaches, headache duration, headache features, severit y of headache, and use of headache medicat ion, etc. Patients will also record the name, dose, and date of any acute headache medicat ion on a headache medication log which will be returned to si te staff at each study visit. At the end of the prospective baseline period, sites will be notified whether their pat ients met criteria and are eligible to be randomized at Visit 3.

Scientific Rationale for Study Design The l ength of the rando mized treatment phase is considered sufficient to assess the safet y and efficacy of a migraine prevent ion medicat ion,given the m echanism and observed onset of action for CGRP ant ibodies as well as the evidence of efficacy and safet y from completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of galcanezumab and from other drugs in the same class ( Dodick et al . 2014a,"

A 4-month post -treatment fo llow-up phase is included to evaluate patient safet y during wash -out of galcanezumab .This allows for a total of 5 months of observation from the time of last injection of galcanezumab . A 5 -month post -treatm ent observat ion peri od all ows f or a wash -out of approximately 5 eliminat ion half -lives of galcanezumab and should decrease galcanezumab serum concentrations by approximately 97% during thi s time. 5.5. Justification for Dose The dose regimen planned for this study isa 240 -mgloading dose followed by 120 m g once monthly. This dose regimen was demonstrated to be statist ically significant and clinically meaningful in reducing MHDs in 3 Phase 3 pivotal efficacy studies of galcanezumab (Studi es CGAG, CGAH, and CGAI) .A dose of 240 m g once m onthly showed a similar efficacy and safet y profile as a 240 -mg lo ading dose fo llowed by 120 mg once m onthly .As such, only a 240-mg lo ading dose fo llowed by 120 mg once m onthly is proposed for Study CGAX."

Si tes will administer inject ions of investigational product ( galcanezumab or placebo) at 3office visits during the doubl e-blind treatment phase and galcanezumab at 3 office visit s during the open -label treatment phase (Secti on 2). Possible inject ion sites include the abdo men, thi gh, and upper arm . The b uttocks m ay also be used, if needed . The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for the fo llowing: maintaining accurate records of investigational product dispensing at the end of the study ,returning all unused medication to Lilly, or its designee, unless the sponsor and sites have agreed all unused medication is to be destroy ed by the site, as allowed by local law 7.1.1. Packaging and Labelling Galcanezumab and m atching placebo (excipients only) will be supplied as an injectable so lution in 1-mL, single -dose, prefilled, disposable manual sy ringes wi th study -specific l abels. Each syringe of galcanezumab is designed to deliver galcanezumab 120 m g. The sy ringes (and conten ts) containing either galcanezumab or placebo will be visibly indist inguishable from each other. Syringes will be supplied in cartons, with the appropriate quant ity of syringes specific to the planned dispensing schedule of invest igational product. Clinic al trial materials will be labeled according to the country ’s regul atory requi rements. 7.1.2. Medical Devices The m anufactured medical devices provided for use in the study are prefilled syringes. 7.2. Method of Treatment Assignment Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be randomized to double -blind treatment at Visit 3. Assignment to treatm ent groups will be determined by a computer- generated random sequence using an interactive web- response system (IWRS). The IWRS will be used to assign doubl e-blind in vesti gational product to each patient. Site personnel will confirm that they have located the correctly assigned package by entering the confirmat ion number found on the package into the IWRS. To achieve between -group com parabilit y, the randomizat ion will be stratified by country and baseline migraine frequency (<8 MHDs versus ≥8 MHDs ). To ensure an appropriate balance of patients wi th low-and high -frequency MHD s, thesponsor willstop enrollment oflow-frequency patients ifthenumber exceeds anestimated 292."

The actual time of all dose administrations will be recorded in the patient’s electroni c case report form ( eCRF) . 7.3. Blinding This is a double -blind study . Blinded transi tionto ope n-label treatment phase and/or post - treatm ent follow-up phase is included in this study. To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study is complete. After the reporting database is locked for statist ical analysis of the double -blind treatment phase, a limited number of Lilly personnel will be unblinded to complete the study report and prepare for submissio n. However, study sites, pati ents and all Lilly personnel direct ly involved in the ongoing open -label and post -treatment follow -up phases will remain blinded to patients’ double- blind treatment assignment. Emergency unblinding for AEs m ay be perform ed through the IWRS . This option may be used ONLY if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment . All unblinding events are recorded and reported by theIWRS . If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblin ded, the pati ent must be discont inued fro m the study . In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study , the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly Medical representative for the pati ent to continue in the s tudy. In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment is warranted. Patient safet y must always be the first consideration in making such a determinat ion.If an emerge ncy unblinding occurs, Lilly must be notified as soon as possible. 7.4. Dose Modification Dose m odificat ions are not permitted in this study . 7.4.1. Special Treatment Considerations During the post -treatment follow -up peri od, p atients will not receive galcanezumab or placebo . After completion of Visit 10(Month 6) assessments , if clinically warranted due to a worsening of symptoms, pati ents m ay start migraine prevent ion medicat ions at the discret ion of the investigator. The list of allowed prevent ive medications is provi ded separately . 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage /Accountability The packaged invest igational product must be stored according to the storage requirements printed onto the packaging label. To administer the galcanezumab injections, sites are to refer to the pharmacy binder for the preparati on and handling instructions of the packaged pre -filled syringes."

Unless otherwise stated in the subsect ions below, all samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroy ed wi thin 60 days of receipt of confirmed test r esults. Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory certificati on standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessments ePRO Di ary: Pati ents will be asked to use an ePRO device (starting at Visit 2) to record headache information, including but not limited to reporting headaches, features and intensit y of headache, usage of any acute headache medicat ion or not, and other information such as migraine -associated symptom s (for example , nausea, vomit ing, photophobia, and/or phonophobia) . 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments Most of secondary efficacy assessments in this study (Table CGAX. 2) will be provi ded by the ePRO di ary; however, details o f acute headache medicat ion use will be captured by a headache medicat ion log and reported at site visits. 9.1.2.1. Patient Global Impression o f Severity The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Severi ty (PGI -S) scale ( Guy 1976) is a pati ent-rated instrument that measures baseline illness severit y. The PGI -S includes a range of possible responses, fro m 1 (“normal, not at all ill”) to 7 (“extremely ill”). 9.1.3. Appropriateness of Assessments All efficacy and safet y assessments have been well documented and are generally regarded as reliable, accurate, and relevant in this pat ient population. This includes healt h outcom es measures considered to be appropriate f or evaluat ing changes in qualit y of life, global funct ioning, and disabilit y (Section 9.9). 9.2.

Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medical ly important, considered rel ated to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused the patient to discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appro priate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency o f follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ion(s), including clinically significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in the study . In addi tion, si te personnel will record vi a eCRF any change in the condit ion(s) and any new condit ion(s)asAEs. Invest igators should record their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure or invest igational product via eCRF. The invest igator will decide whether he or she interprets the observed AEs as reasonably possibly related to migraine, to the invest igational product, study device, study procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies. The investigator will answer y es/no when making this assessment. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient’s investigational product is di scontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF, clarifying if possible, the circumstances leading to discontinuations of treatment . 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es: death initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion a life- threatening experience ( that is, immediate ri sk of dying) persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y congenital ano maly/birth defect considered significan t by the invest igator for any other reason: important medical events that may not resul t in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious, based upon appropriate medical judgment when a condit ion related to the invest igational device ( for example ,prefilled syringe) necessitates medical or surgical intervent ion to preclude eit her perm anent impairment of"

However, if an SAE occurs after si gning the ICF, but prior to receiving investigational product, i t needs to be reported ONLY if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This 24 - hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up SAE inform ation. Pregnancy (dur ing maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements, any pregnancy that occurs during the study , including those in which conceptio n occurred within 5 months afte r last administration of invest igational product, should be reported using the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in patients once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patientsummary eCRF has been com pleted). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged from the study , and he or she considers the event reasonably possibly re lated to the study treatm ent or study parti cipati on, the investi gator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly. 9.2.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and th at the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the associ ated detailed guidance or nati onal regulatory requi rements in parti cipat ing countries requi re the reporting of SUSARs. Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and the associated detailed guidance. 9.2.2. Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and to facilitate process and produc t improvements. Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product (or drug delivery system such as a prefilled syringe ) so that the situation can be assessed. 9.3.

Blood pressure and pulse will be measured in triplicate in the sitt ing posit ion prior to bl ood draws and study drug administration (see Study Schedule [ Secti on 2]). Any clinically significant findings from vital signs measurement that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF . 9.4.3. Laboratory Tests For each patient, laboratory tests detailed in Appendix 2 shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2 ). Any clinically significant findings from laboratory tests that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF . In addit ion, an immunogenicit y sample will be co llected, when possible, for any pat ient who experiences a potential systemic allergic/hypersensit ivity react ion during the study as judged by the invest igator. This immunogenicit y sample should be coll ected immediately or as soon as possible, taking into considerat ion the availabilit y and well -being o f the pati ent. Exact date and time of the sample should be recorded on the laboratory requi sition form. 9.4.4. Samples for Immunogenicity Research Where local regulat ions and ethical review boards ( ERBs )allow, blood samples for immunogenicit y testing will be collected to determine ant ibody producti on against galcanezumab as specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2).Immunogenicit y will be assessed by a validated assay designed to detect anti -drug ant ibodies (ADAs) in the presence o f the investigat ional product. Ant ibodies may be further characteriz ed and/or eval uated for their abilit y to neutralize the activit y of galcanezumab . Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15 y ears after the last patient visit for the study , or for a shorter peri od if regulat ions and ERBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by the sponsor.

Safety Monitoring Invest igators are responsible for monitoring individual pat ient safety throughout the tri al.If a study patient/subject experiences elevated ALT ≥3-foldULN, ALP ≥2-foldULN, or elevated TBL ≥2-foldULN, clinical and laboratory monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by the investigator. Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence o f observed laboratory test abnorm alities. To ensure patient/subject safety and co mply with regul atory guidance, the invest igator is to consult with the Lilly Medical representative regarding collect ion of specific reco mmended clinical information and fo llow-up laboratory tests. See Appendix 4 . Neurol ogical examinat ions will be conducted at screening, Month 3, and Month 6 of treatment, as well as at the final visit of the post-treatm ent follow-up peri od or early termination visit in order to assess for any signs of preexist ing or treatment -emergent neurol ogical abnorm alities such as stroke or other cerebrovascular events. If a study patient experi ences signs of a cerebrovascular event, appropriate fo llow -up and clinical management should be conducted by the invest igator, and the Lilly Medical representative shoul d be consul ted regarding collection of further clinical informat ion and fo llow-up testing. Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate blinded methods . 9.4.5.1. Hepatic Safety Monitoring If a study patient experiences elevated ALT ≥3-foldULN, ALP ≥2-foldULN, or elevated TBL ≥2-foldULN, liver testing ( Appendix 4 ) shoul d be repeated within 3 to 5 days including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, and creat ine kinase to confirm the abnormalit y and to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. If the abnormalit y persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by the invest igator and in consultation wit h the study medica l monitor. Moni toring of ALT, AST, TBL, and ALP should continue until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline levels. Hepatic Safety Data Collection Addit ional safet y data should be co llected via the CRF if 1 or more of the fo llowing condi tions occur: elevation of serum ALT to ≥5-foldULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests elevated serum TBL to ≥2-foldULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndro me) elevation of serum ALP to ≥2-foldULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests patient disco ntinued fro m treatm ent due to a hepatic event or abnormalit y of liver tests hepat ic event considered to be a SAE 9.5. Pharmacokinetics At the visit s and t imes specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2),venous blood samples of approximately 2.5 mL each will be collected to determine the serum concentrations of galcanezumab . A maximum o f 3 sam ples m ay be collected at addi tional time points during the"

Instructions for the collect ion and handling of blood samples will be provided by the sponsor. When a blood sample is co llected, the time and date of last dose administration prior t o blood sampling should be recorded. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time )of each sampling will be recorded. Galcanezumab concentrati on inform ation that may /woul d unblind the study will not be reported to invest igative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure invest igational product concentration will be retained for a maximum of 1 year following last patient visit for the study .

It is intended that blood samples co llected fro m patients who recei ved pl acebo shoul d not be analyzed for determinat ion of serum concentrations of galcanezumab . 9.6. Pharmacodynamics Not applicable. 9.7. Genetics Not applicable. 9.8. Biomarkers Not applicable. 9.9. Health Economics Health economic, di sabili ty,and quali ty-of-life assessments of galcanezumab in pat ients with migraine will be based on the fo llowing scales: Migraine Disability Assessment test (MIDAS) : The MIDAS was designed to quantify headache -related di sabili ty over a 3 -month peri od. Thi s instrum ent consists of 5 items that reflect the number of days reported as missing, or with reduced productivit y at work or hom e and social events; a higher value is indicat ive of more disabilit y (Stewart et al. 1999, 2001). This instrum ent is considered reliable and valid and is correlated with clinical judgment regarding the need for m edical care (Stewart et al. 1999 , 2001) . Migraine Specific Quality-of-Life questionnaire (MSQ v2.1): The MSQ v2.1 is a self - administered healt h status instrument that was developed to address physical and emotional limitations of specific concern to individuals suffering fro m migraine. The instrument consists of 14 items that address 3 domains : (1) Rol e Functi on-Restri ctive; (2) Role Funct ion-Prevent ive; and, (3) Em otional Functi on (Jhingran et al. 1998). The instrument was designed with a 4 -week recall period, and is considered reliable, valid ,and sensit ive to change in migraine ( Jhingran et al. 1998; Rendas -Baum et al. 2013). Migraine Interictal Burden Scale (MIBS -4):The MIBS -4measures the burden related to headache in the time between attacks. The self -administered instrument consists of 4 items that"
44,page_44,"I5Q-MC-CGAX (a)Clinical Protocol Page 44 LY2951742address disruption at work and school, diminished family and social life, difficult y planning, and emotional difficul ty. The quest ionnaire specifically asks about the effect of the disease over the past 4 weeks on day s without a headache attack. Response options incl udethe following: don’t know/not applicable, never, rarely, some of the time, much of the time, or most or all of the time. Each response has an associated numerical score, with the summat ion across all 4 items result ing in a total score ra nging fro m 0 to 12, and the level of interictal burden being categorized into the following: 0 for none, 1 or 2 mild, 3 or 4 moderate ,and >5 severe (B use et al .2009). Patient Health Questionnaire - 9: The Patient Health Quest ionnaire -9 (PHQ -9) is a 9 -item patient-completed instrument that was designed for detecting MDD and for measuring the severit y of depressive symptom s (Kroenke et al. 2001). The 9 i tems pertain to the diagnostic criteria for MDD from the Diagnost ic and Statist ical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edi tion (DSM -IV) and are still applicable for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual o f Mental Disorders, Fifth Edi tion (DSM -5): anhedonia; depressed mood; trouble sleeping; feeling t ired; change in appeti te; guilt, self -blame, or worthlessness; trouble concentrating; feeling slowed down or restless; and thoughts of being better off dead or hurting oneself . Each i tem is rated on a 4 -point scale (0 = never, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half the t ime, 3 = nearly every day) based on symptoms ove r the past 2 weeks. The overall score ranges fro m 0 to 27, with the levels o f depressio n severit y defined as fo llows: 0 to 4 minimal, 5 to 9 mild, 10 to 14 moderate, 15 to 19 moderately severe, and 20 to 27 severe. The instrument is considered reliable and valid for use in research and clinical settings (Kroenke et al. 2001), including in patients with migraine (Seo and Park 2015a). 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale: The 7 -item Generalized Anxiet y Disorder Scale (GAD -7) is a 7-item patient-completed questi onnaire that was designed to screen for GAD and for measuring the severit y of anxiet y symptom s (Spi tzer et al . 2006). The tool was developed based on symptom criteria for GAD in the DSM -IV (still applicable for DSM -5) as well as review of exi sting anxiet y scales, with items addressing the following: feelings o f nervousness, uncontrollable worrying, excessive worrying, trouble relaxing, restlessness, irritabilit y, and fearfulness. The patient identifies how much they have been bothered by these symptom s over the past 2 weeks. Each of the 7 items is rated on a 4 -point scale (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 =more than half the days, 3 = nearly every day ), with total score ranging from 0 to 21. The levels o f anxiet y severi ty are defined as follows: 0 to 4 minimal, 5 to 9 mild, 10 to 14 moderate, and 15 to 21 severe. The instrument is considered reliable and valid for use in research and clinical settings (Spitzer et al. 2006), including in patients with migraine (Seo and Park 2015b)."

Populations for Analyses Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses will be conducted on an intent-to-treat ITT popul ation, which will include all pat ients who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose o f investigat ional product. Patients in the ITT population will be analyzed according to the treatm ent group to whi ch they are randomized. When change from baseline is assessed, the patient will be included in the analysis only if heor she has a baseline and a postbaseline measurement. The detailed definit ions of populat ions for analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 10.3. Statistical Analyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this study will be the responsib ility of Lilly or its desi gnee. Details of statist ical analysis methods will be described in the SAP. The primary analysis will be performed using a restricted maximum likelihood -based MMRM technique with prespecified model term s (Sect ion 10.3.3.1 ). Visit -wise binary efficacy variables will be analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model (GLIMMIX) as pseudo -likelihood -based mixed effects repeated measures analysis . In addit ion to the MMRM approach, analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA) model or analysis of variance (ANOVA) mayalso be implemented. When an ANCOVA model is used to analyze a continuous variable, the model will contain the main effects of treatment and country as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline. The ANOVA model will use the same terms except the continuous fixed cov ariate of baseline. T ypeIII sum -of-squares for the least -squares means will be used for the statist ical co mpar isons, unless otherwi se specified. Continuous efficacy and health outcome endpo ints will be analyzed using MMRM methods, as well as an ANCOVA mo del if deemed appropri ate."
46,page_46,"I5Q-MC-CGAX (a)Clinical Protocol Page 46 LY2951742Categorical co mpar isons between treatment groups will be performed using Cochran- Mantel - Haenszel controlling for coun tryor using the Fisher’s exact test, where appropriate. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided al pha level of 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods describe d in the protocol, and the j ustification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report or SAP . Changes may only be m ade in the SAP pri or to unblinding . Addit ional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed approp riate. 10.3.2. Treatment Group Comparability 10.3.2.1. Patient Disposition The number and percentage of ITT patients who complete the study or discontinue early will be tabul ated for all treatm ent groups for double -blind treatm ent (Study Period III), open -label treatm ent (Study Period IV), and post -treatm ent follow-up (Study Period V) both overall and by visit. Patient allocation by invest igator will be summarized for Study Period III for all ITT patients. Patient allocation by invest igator will also be listed for all stud y periods. 10.3.2.2. Patient Characteristics The fo llowing pati ent characteri stics at baseline will be summarized by treatm ent group for all ITT patients: Dem ographic (age, gender, ethnic origin, height, weight, body mass index ) Migraine headache, headache, variatio n of migraine/headache measures per 30- day baseline period Medical history and preexist ing condit ion Medical history and preexist ing condit ions will be summarized by preferred term (PT) within system organ cl ass(SOC) . 10.3.2.3. Concomitant Therapy The proporti on of patients who received concomitant medicat ion (as recorded via eCRF) will be summarized for all ITT patients for the doubl e-blind, open -label, and post -treatment phases separately .Details will be included in the SAP. 10.3.2.4. Treatment Compliance Dosing will occur at monthly study visits. Treatment com pliance for each patient will be calculated as the number of completed scheduled dosing visits in which the patient receives an inject ion, divided by the number of co mpleted scheduled dosing visits, including any skipped dosing visits at or before the last dosing visit (Visit 9) or early discontinuation visit."
47,page_47,"I5Q-MC-CGAX (a)Clinical Protocol Page 47 LY2951742Treatment compliance for each period will be summarized overall and by treatment group, and treatm ent com parisons for the doubl e-blind treatme nt phase will be perform ed using an ANOVA with treatm ent and country in the m odel. 10.3.2.5. Electronic Patient -Reported Outcome Diary Compliance Electronic pat ient-reported outcome diary com pliance at each 1 -month period (including baseline, Month 1, 2, 3, … till M onth 10) will be calculated. Diary com pliance at each peri od is calculated as follows: Actualnumberofdiarydaysintheperiod Expected numberofdiarydaysintheperiod∗100 Actual number of di ary days is calculated as the total number of days wit h nonmissing answers . Diary com pliance for each peri od will be summarized overall and by treatment group , and treatm ent com parisons for the doubl e-blind treatment phase will be perform ed using an ANOVA with treatm ent and country in the model. 10.3.3. Efficacy Analys es 10.3.3.1. Primary Analyses The primary efficacy measure is the overall mean change from the baseline period in the number ofmonthly MHDs during the 3-month double -blind treatment phase, and the primary analysis will evaluate the efficacy of galcanezumab (120 mg/ month) com pared wi th placebo. The primary analys is will be performed using a restricted maximum likelihood -based MMRM technique. The analysis will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, country , month, and treatment -by -month interacti on, as w ell as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline number of MHDs and baseline number of MHDs -by-monthinteracti on. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model wit hin-patient errors . The Kenward - Roger (Kenward and Roger 1997) approximat ion will be used to estimate deno minator degrees of freedo m. If the m odel does not converge with both the Hessian and the G matrix being positive definite under the default fitting algorithm used by PROC MIXED, the Fisher scoring algorithm will be implemented by specifying the SCORING option in SAS®. If the m odel still fails to converge, the model will be fit using covariance matrices o f the following order specified by a decreasing number of covariance parameters unt il convergence is met: heterogeneous Toepl itz heterogeneous first-order autoregressive Toeplitz first-order autoregressive When the unstructured covariance matrix is not utilized, the sandwich estimator (Diggle and Kenward 1994) will be used to estimate the standard errors of the fixed effects par ameters. The sandwich est imator is implemented by specifying the EMPIRICAL option in SAS®. When the"
48,page_48,"I5Q-MC-CGAX (a)Clinical Protocol Page 48 LY2951742sandwich est imator is utilized, the Kenward -Roger approximat ion for denominator degrees of freedo m cannot be used. Instead, the deno minator degrees of fr eedo m will be partit ioned into between -subject and within -subject portions by the DDFM=BETWITHIN option in SAS®. SAS®PROC MIXED will be used to perform the analysis. 10.3.3.2. Secondary Analyses The secondary analyses will be conducted for the double -blind treatme nt phase. For the continuous secondary efficacy and heal th outcom es, the change from baseline to each scheduled postbaseline measure will be analyzed fro m repeated m easures analyses with similar m odels as described in Section 10.3.3.1 , with baseline number of migraine headache days category (<8versus ≥8) included as a covariate . Further details will be provi ded in the SAP. For the analysis o f 30%, 50%, 75%, and 100% response, the percentage of patients meeting response criteria during the 3 -month double -blind treatment phase will be est imated for each treatm ent from a categori cal, pseudo -likelihood -based repeated measures an alysis o f longitudinal binary outcom es indicat ing whether patients meet response criteria. This analysis will be implemented using the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS. Further details r egarding secondary analyses will be summarized and described in the SAP. Amo ng these secondary object ives, some may be chosen as the key secondary object ives, and thekey secondary objectives will be tested using an appropriate mult iple testing approach provi ding strong con trol of the f amilywise error rate (for the primary and key secondary tests) at a 1-sided 0.025 alpha level (or, equivalent ly, 2-sided 0.05 al pha l evel).Details of the key secondary object ives and the specific testing methodology (including testing order, relationship ,and t ype I error allocat ion and propagation) will be specified in the SAP. 10.3.3.3. Tertiary Efficacy Analyses The exploratory efficacy analyses will be conducted for the doubl e-blind treatment, open -label treatm ent, and post -treatm ent phases. Further details re garding tertiary efficacy analyses are summarized in the SAP. 10.3.4. Safety Analyses The safet y analyses will be conducted for the double -blind treatment , open -label treatment, and post-treatm ent follow-up phases. The safet y and tol erabilit y of treatm ent will be assessed by summarizing the following: AEs otreatm ent-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) by preferred term by SOC by maximum severit y oSAEs oAEs leading to discont inuat ion vital signs and wei ght ECG s"

Categorical Safety Variables Unless specified otherwise, the categorical safet y analyses will include both schedule dand unscheduled visits . Com parisons between treatment groups for all categorical safet y measures will be made using the Fisher ’sexact test for Study Period III (doubl e-blind treatment). Descriptive statist ics only will be presented for the treatment groups in the open -label phase (Study Period IV) and in the post-treatm ent follow-up phase (Study Period V) wi th the post -treatm ent populat ion. 10.3.4.2. Adverse Events Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as the reported AEs that first occurred or worsened during the postbaseline phase co mpared with baseline phase. For each TEAE, the severit y level o f the event (mild, moderate, or sev ere) will be determined by pat ient or physician opinio n. The Medical Dict ionary for Regul atory Activities (MedDRA) Lowest Level Term will be used in the treatment -emergent computation. For each Lowest Level Term, the maximum severit y at baseline will be used as the baseline severit y. If the maximum severit y during postbaseline is greater than the maximum baseline severit y, the event is considered to be treatm ent-emergent for the specific postbaseline period. For each patient and TEAE, the maximum severi ty for the MedDRA l evel being displayed ( PT, High Level Term, or SOC ) is the maximum postbaseline severit y observed fro m all associ ated Lowest Level Terms mapping to that MedDRA level. For events that are gender specific, the deno minator and computation of the percentage will include only patients from the given gender. 10.3.4.3. Vital Signs and Weight Vital signs collected during the study include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Bl ood pressure and pul se measurements will be taken whe n the patient is in a sitting posi tion. Three measurements of sitting blo od pressure and pulse will be collected at every visit (except for Visit 2 and phone visit s); the 3 si tting bl ood pressure and pul se measurements will be averaged and used as the val ue for that visit for analysis . The incidence rates of patients with treatment -emergent vi tal sign and wei ght changes based at any time postbaseline will be assessed using the Fisher’s exact test. Specific criteria for treatm ent-emergent definit ion will be docum ented in the SAP. 10.3.4.4. Electrocardiogram Intervals and Heart Rate The corrected QT interval will be calculated using the Fridericia method (QTcF). The number and percent of patients meeting criteria for treatment -emergent abnorm alities in ECG intervals (pulse rate, QRS, and QTcF) and heart rate at any time during study will be summarized. Treatment group comparisons will be performed using the Fisher’s exact test."
50,page_50,"I5Q-MC-CGAX (a)Clinical Protocol Page 50 LY295174210.3.4.5. Laboratory Tests The incidence rates of patients with treatment -emergent abnormal, high, or l ow laboratory values at any time postbaseline will be assessed using the Fisher’s exact test for each laboratory test. Patients will be defined a s having a treatment -emergent l ow value if they have all normal or high values at baseline, fo llowed by a value bel ow the lower reference limit at any postbaseline visit. Patients wi th all norm al or hi gh values at baseline (no low values) will be included in the analysis of treatment -emergent low laboratory values. Patients will be defined as having a treatm ent-emergent high value if they have all normal or low values at baseline, fo llowed by a value above the upper reference limit at any postbaseline vis it. Pati ents wi th all normal or low values at baseline (no high values) will be included in the analysis o f treatm ent-emergent hi gh laboratory values. For analytes simply classified as normal or abnormal, patients will be defined as having a treatm ent-emergent abnorm al value if they have all normal values at baseline, followed by an abnorm al value at any postbaseline visit. Patients with all normal values at baseline will be included in the analysis o f treatm ent-emergent abnorm al laboratory values. 10.3.5. Pharma cokinetic Analyses Galcanezumab concentrati ons will be illustrated graphically and summarized descriptively. If warranted and based on availabilit y of data, the relati onship of serum galcanezumab concentrations to efficacy endpo ints, safet y endpo ints,or ADA may be explored. Patient and healt hy subject data, including but not limited to serum galcanezumab concentrati ons, from other clinical studies evaluat ing galcanezumab may be combined with data fro m this study to support additional analyses. Such anal yses may be reported separately. 10.3.6. Evaluation of Immunogenicity The frequency and percentage of patients with preexist ing ADA and with treatment -emergent ADA -positive to galcanezumab will be tabulated. Treatment -emergent ADAs are defined as those wi th a titer 2-fold (1 dilution) greater than the minimum required dilut ion if no ADAs were detected at baseline (treatment -induced ADA) or those with a 4 -fold (2 dilut ions) increase in t iter compared to baseline if ADAs were detected at baseline (treatment -boosted ADA). For the treatm ent-emergent ADA -positivepatients,the distribution of maximum t iters will be described. The frequency of neutralizing ant ibodies will also be tabulated in treatm ent-emergent ADA - positivepatients. The relat ionship between ADA andsafet y and efficacy endpo ints may be assessed. 10.3.7. Other Analyses 10.3.7.1. Health Economics The change from baseline for the double -blind treatment phase and for the double -blind treatm ent, open -label treatment, and post -treatment fo llow-up phases co mbined for MSQ v2.1 (Role Functi on-Restrictive, Rol e Funct ion-Preventive , Em otional Funct ion, and total score ),"

Interim Analyses No interim analyses are planned for this study . If an unplanned interim analysis is deemed necessary , the appropri ate Lilly medical director, or designee, wil l be consulted to determine whether it is necessary to amend the protocol. This study will include t wo database locks . The first is to occur after all pat ients have had the opportunit y to complete the 3 -month double -blind treatment phase (Study Period III ). The purpose of this analysis isthe final analysis o f the primary efficacy endpoint, as well as efficacy and safet y analyses of the double -blind phase. Study sites, patients, and all Lilly personnel directly involved in the cont inuing trial will remai n blinded to patients’ double -blind treatment assignment. Unblinding details are specified in the unblinding plan sect ion of the SAP or a separate unblinding plan document. This analysis will not be considered an interim analysis because the double -blind phase is of primary interest. The second database l ock will occur at the post-treatment fo llow-up phase once all pat ients have had the opportunit y to com plete the ent ire study .This reporting database will include all data for all patients enrolled into the study , including all open -label and post -treatm ent phase data.

Synopsis Title of Study: A Phase 3, Rando mized, Double -Blind, Pl acebo -Controlled Study of the Efficacy and Safet y of Galcanezumab in Pat ients with Episodi c Migraine (EM) –the PERSIST Study . Rationale: Study I5Q-MC-CGAX (CGAX ; PERSIST ) is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safe ty of galcanezumab, in the prevent ion of migraine co mpared wi th placebo in pati ents wi th EM in multiple regions. Treatment Arms and Duration: Patients who com plete the doubl e-blind period m ay enter a 3-month open -label extensi on phase during which all pat ients will receive galcanezumab 120 mg/month. At Visit 7, Ppatients originally assigned to placebo will receive an init ial loading dose of 240 -mggalcanezumab; patients ori ginally assigned to galcanezumab will continue the dose of 120 mg but will receive 2 inject ions (1 inject ion of 120 -mggalcanezumab and 1 inject ion of placebo) to maintain blinding. At the Visit 8 and Vi sit 9second and third (la st) vi sitsof the open -label phase, all patients will receive a 120- mgdose of galcanezumab . All patients will be fo llowed f or a 4 -month, post - treatm ent phase during which no study medicat ion will be administered. 2. Schedule of A ctivities Visit 1 2 3 4 b 5l 6 7"

Objectives and Endpoints Objectives (cont.) Endpoints (cont.) Tertiary Objectives To compare galcanezumab with placebo with respect to changes in symptoms that accompany migraine or probable migraineChange f rom baseline in the number of monthly MHDs with: onausea and/or vomiting ophotophobia and phonophobia oaura oprodromal symptoms 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 486 participants will be randomized such that approximately 388 evaluable participants com plete the doubl e-blind treatment phas estudy . China, Russia, and India intend to participate in the study . 7.3. Blinding This is a double -blind study . Blinded transit ion toanopen -label treatment phase and/or post - treatm ent follow-up phase is included in this study. To preserve the blinding of the s tudy, a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study is complete. After the reporting database is locked for statist ical analysis of the double -blind treatment phase, a limited number of Lilly personnel will be unblinded to complete the study report and prepare for submissio n. However, study sites, pati ents and all Lilly personnel direct ly involved in the ongoing open -label and post -treatment follow -up phases will remain blinded to patients’ double- blind treatment assignment. 8. Discontinuation Criteria Patients who discont inue the study orinvest igational product during the double -blind treatment phase (Study Period III) or open -label treatm ent phase (Study Period IV) will proceed immediately to Study Period V. 10.3.8. Interim Analyses No interim analyses are planned for this study . If an unplanned interim analysis is deemed necessary , the appropri ate Lilly medical director, or designee, will be consulted to determine whether it is necessary to amend the protocol."
70,page_70,"I5Q-MC-CGAX (a)Clinical Protocol Page 70 LY2951742This study will include two database locks . The first is tooccur after all pat ients have had the opportunit y to complete the 3 -month double -blind treatment phase (Study Period III). The purpose of this analysis is the final analysis o f the primary efficacy endpoint, as well as efficacy and safet y analyses of the double -blind phase. Study sites, patients, and all Lilly personnel directly involved in the cont inuing trial will remain blinded to pat ients’ double -blind treatment assignment. Unblinding details are specified in the unblinding plan sect ion of the SAP or a separate unblinding plan document. This analysis will not be considered an interim analysis because the double -blind phase is of pri mary interest. The second database l ock will occur at the post-treatment fo llow-up phase once all pat ients have had the opportunit y to com plete the ent irestudy .
