(49) To estimate the treatment effect, we will then compare mean change from V 1 to month 6 visit using analysis of covariance, with value at V 1 as covariate and the treatment group as main effect. Moreover, sensitivity to treatment will be assessed using effect sizes of the different outcome variables when using nabilone to treat non -motor symptoms in Parkinson´s disease. For CGI -I analyses, distributions of aggregated ratings (amelioration, aggravation) after 6 months will be evaluated by the Wilcoxon matched -pairs test.

30,page_30,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 31/109 1 Background and Rationale 1.1 The endocannabinoid system The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has become a center of attention for its (neuro )modulatory effects in the last 25 years and has become a potential target of drug therapy for a variety of illnesses . The ECS plays an important role in many physiological body functions and influences mood, motor control, cognition, eating behavior , and nociception. Therefore, indications like neuropathic pain, anorexia , and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or spinal trauma , as well as chemotherapy -induced emesis can now be treated with cannabinoids like nabilone, dronabinol, sativex , and e pidiolex. [ 12,31,32] The two main cannabis species sativa and indica have been the ancestors of almost all strains that exist today and from which more than 60 pharmacologically active components derive. The main psychoactive compound of Cannabis sativa is Δ9 – tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) , which has a stronger euphoric p otential than isolated components of Cannabis indica that have more sedative, analgesic , and antiemetic effects. [1,12] The ECS summarizes endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids), cannabinoi d receptors and their synthesis , and degradation enzymes. Endocannabinoids are endogenous lipids and ligands to cannabinoid receptors. Arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and 2 -arachidonoyl glycerol (2 -AG) have been the first discovered and therefore best known endogenous cannabino ids out of a large group of molecules binding to the endocann abinoid receptors. Endocannabinoids are not stored in vesicles like other neurotransmitt ors. They show a release on -demand into the extracellular space mainly through retrograde signaling after postsynaptic activation with the duty to decrease presynaptic neurotransmission. After their local and short -lasting task is fulfilled endocannabinoids are take n up by surrounding cells and degraded mainly by fatty acid amide hydrolysis (FAAH) for anandamide and by monoacylglycerol lipase for 2 -AG. [2,12,32] The endocannabinoid receptors, named CB1 and CB2, are G -protein coupled, seven - transmembrane domain receptors of the Gi and Go classes. Both are activated mainly by cannabinoids and their synthetic analogues, eicosanoids or aminoalkylindoles as well as by a large number of synthesized agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators. [1] Activation of these receptors inhibits adenylate cyclases and subsequently increases the intracellular amount of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), resulting in alteration of the level of activity in volt age- dependent calcium channels and potassium channels and an activation of several mitogen -activated prote in kinases. [3]"
31,page_31,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 32/109 The CB1 cannabinoid receptor is referred to as t he „brain cannabinoid receptor“ due to its numerous occur rence in all brain structures. Particularly, the Cortex, Basal Ganglia, Hippocampus and Cerebellum present with a high density of CB1 receptor. Combining all its effects, the CB1 receptor aids in the control of cell survival, differentiation and proliferation , and several cell functions. Through retrograde activation the duration of synaptic activation, synaptic plasticity , and neurotransmitter release is influenced. [ 1,4,32] Moreover, n on-neuronal cells of the brain, astrocytes in particular, express t he CB1 receptor in a large amount and its activation through glutamate release leads to an activation of presy naptic metabotropic glutamate receptor. [5] The occur rence of the CB1 receptor is not limited to the brain, but also appears in the peripheral nervous system and other m ammal tissues and organs , where it aids in maintaining homeostasis. [ 1] The CB2 receptor is of little homology to the CB1 receptor but shows similar ways of activation through Gi/o. It is expressed mostly in cells and organs playing a role in the body´s immune system where its activation reduces the liberation of pro -inflammatory response (cytokines, lymph oangiogenic factors). [6] CB2 receptors are also expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and in microglia and vascular cells of the brain as well as in the dorsal vagal motor nucleus, the nucleus ambiguous and the spinal trigeminal nucleus . CB2 receptor activation may contribute to affective behavior but its concrete role in the brain is not defined yet. In the gastrointestinal tract e ffects on food intake, gastrointestinal motility, gastric secretion and gastroprotection, cell proliferation , and intestinal inflammato ry processes are discussed. [7] In 2003 the U.S. Hea lth and Human Services grante d U.S. Patent 6630507 which describes the use of components extracted from Cannabis sativa as useful in neuroprotective disorders like PD, Alzheimer´s disease, and HIV - induced dementia. [ 33] Neuroprotective potential of cannabinoids is believed to be due to receptor - induced but also – independent mechanisms and specific eff ects of s everal endocannabinoids and synthetic agents, like THC, CBD, cannabinol , CP55, 940, and AM404 (an anandamide analog). [ 12] In preclinical experiments, cannabinoids have the ability to counteract reactive oxygen species and strengthen endogenous antioxidants and thereby prevent oxidative stress on neuronal cells by reducing microglial and proinflammatory activation through agonistic action of the CB2 receptor system as well as by reduc ing glutamatergic excitotoxicity. [ 34, 12] Moreover, t here exist other receptors where several endocannabinoids like anandamide can bind to under certain circumstances, like the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) cation channel, the peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor (PPAR), the"
32,page_32,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 33/109 abnormal -CBD receptor and the GTP -binding protein -coupled receptor (GPR) 55 that possibly influence the clinic of movement disorders. [ 1,12] Nabilone is an analogue of dronabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis, but it is not derived from the cannabis plant in contrast to dronabinol. Nabilone acts as a partial agon ist on both CB1 and CB2 receptor in humans and therefore mimics the effect of THC but with more predictable side effects and less euphoria. In Austria , nabilone is licensed for the use as an antiemetic for chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting not responding to conventional antiemetic treatment . The FDA approved nabilone for treating anorexia and weight loss in patients with AIDS. Nabilone is widely used as an adjunct therapy f or chronic pain management, although it is only officially approved for t his use in Mexico. Nabilone is a racemate consisting of the (S, S) and the (R,R) isomers (""trans"") with an average weight of 372.5408 Dalton. After oral administration it is rapidly absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract. The major excretory pathway is the biliary system. The half -life of nabilone amounts to 2 hours, with a half -life of its metabolites of around 35 hours. The chemical formula of nabilone is: C24H36O3. 1.2 Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson´s Disease Parkinson´s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that occurs with a prevalence of 1,6/1000 in both males and females equally in all geographical areas. It is less common in Asia than in Europe, Afr ica, North America, South America , or Australia and its prevalence is increasing with age (1% in 60 years old people , 3% at the age of 80 year s). The mean age of onset is 55 years (17 – 80 years). Although PD is generally considered a paradigmatic movement disorder, it has long been recognized that the neuropathology underlying PD invo lves many brain areas that are not directly involved in motor control. [ 14,15] It is therefore not surprising that a majority , if not all , PD patients suffer from non -motor symptoms adding to the overall burden of parkinsonian morbidity. [ 16,17,18] In this trial, male and female PD patients without disturbing motor fluctuations or dyskinesia over the age of 30 years suffering from non-motor symptoms (measured on the basis of UPDRS Part I, including at least anxiety or pain) will be included. Non-motor symptoms in PD involve a multitude of functions including disorders of sleep - wake cycle regulation, cognitive dysfunction, disorders of mood and affect, autonomic dysfunction as well as sensory symptoms and pain. They become increasingly prevalent and obvious over the course of the illness and are a major determinant of quality of life, progression of overall disability, and of nursing home placement in PD. [ 19] Common non -motor symptoms in late stage PD include hallucinations, dementia, and autonomic dysfunction including urinary incontinence, constipation, and symptomatic"
33,page_33,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 34/109 orthostatic hypotension. In PD patients who have had 20 years of disease duration, dementia occurs in 83%, hallucinosis in 74%, symptomatic OH in 48%, constipation requiring daily laxatives in 40% and urinary in continence in 71%. [ 18] Moreover, certain non -motor symptoms such as constipation, olfactory loss, anxiety, depression, and RBD may antedate the on set of classical motor symptoms by years or even decades. [ 20,21,22,23,24,25,26] Unlike most motor features of PD, NMS often have limited treatment options or response. [13] Although common, there is a paucity of research concerning the diagnosis and treatment of non -motor symptoms in PD. Indeed, non -motor symptoms in PD are frequently missed or undeclared durin g routine consultations and well -performed large -scale RCTs for the treatment of the different non -motor symptoms in PD are lacking. [ 27,28] However, a variety of treatments are available, and for some patients, these treatments can effectively control or improve disability from non -motor sympt oms, such as psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and fatigue (see Table 1). Table 1: Drug classes for non -motor s ymptoms in PD NON -MOTOR SYMPTOMS DRUG CLASS (NAME) Disorders of sleep and wakefulness REM Sleep behavioural disorder Benzodiazepine (Clonazepam), hormons (Melatonin) Autonomic dysfunction Constipation Osmotic laxative (Polyethylene Glycol), Chloride channel activator (Lubiprostone) Gastrointestinal motility Peripheral dopamine antagonist (Domperidone) Orthostatic hypotension Peripheral dopamine antagonist (Domperidone), mineralcorticoid (Fludrocortisone), vasopressor (Midodrine), acetylcholineesterase inhibitor (Pyridostigmine), Norepinephrine prodrug (Droxidopa) Sialorrhoea Anticholinergic (Atropine drops, Glycopyrrolate), Neurotoxin (Botulinum toxin A, Botulinum toxin B) Cognitive impairment Dementia Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (Rivastigmine) Psychiatric symptoms Depression Dopamine agonist (Pramipexole), serotonin reuptake inhibitor / serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (Citalopram, Escitalopram, Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Sertraline, Venlafaxine extended release), Tricyclic antidepressant (Desipramine, Nortriptyline) Psychosis Atypical antipsychotic (Cloz apine, Quetiapine), Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (Rivastigmine) Other Fatigue (Stimulant Methylphenidate, Modafinil )"
34,page_34,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 35/109 1.3 Preclinical Research in Parkinson´s disease The endocannabinoid system (ECS) functions as a regulator of dopamine release and uptake. Inversely, changes of dopamine levels in the brain can alter the ECS. [ 9,10] To date the hypothesis is that endocannabinoids are a compensational mechanism to the loss of dopamine in patients with PD. [1,12] A reduction of CB1 receptors has been shown in post mortem analyses of the caudate nucleus, anterior dorsal putamen and external segment of the globus pallidus in comparison to normal level s to the rest of the brain. This might be related to an overactive endocannabinoid system with increased CB1 receptor activity, messenger RNA levels and levels of endocannabinoids in the basal ganglia which has been described in animal models. It is believ ed that these findings play a role in motor symptoms of patients with PD and can be influenced by L evod opa therapy . [1,11,30] Moreover, neuroprotective properties of cannabinoids in preclinical experiments are gaining more and more attention for clinicians dealing with patients with movement disorders . These effects are mainly due to antioxidant mechanisms, microglial inhibition and modulation of cell -cell interaction of glia cells an d neuronal cells in the basal ganglia. [1,11,30] Indeed, activated microglia have been found in lesions of neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra of deceased patients with PD in comparison to healthy person. Moreover, a decrease of microglial activation is the reason why CB2 receptor agonists have shown to reduce inflammation and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD. [ 1,11,30] Interestingly, Barrero et. al discovered that polymorphisms in the cannabinoid receptor gene influence depressive mood in patients with PD. [ 35] 1.4 Therapeutic potential of C annabinoid s in Parkinson´s Disease The endocannabinoid system takes part in building emotions, motor control, attention and concentration, the sensation of pain , and eating. [ 12,31,32] Evidence of effects of cannabino ids on symptoms in PD from clinical trials is scar ce. Most of these trials are either small -sized with less than 20 patients included [12,40,42] or uncontrolled [12,36,37,38,39]. Improvement of motor and non -motor symptoms in PD after intake of cannabinoids has been described in several uncontrolled observational studies with ameliorated rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity , and Levodopa -induced Dyskinesia (LID) as well as improved pain, psychosis, symptoms of RBD , and sleep -quality. These effects could not be reproduced by randomized controlled trial (RCTs) , which were small -sized and used different cannabinoids."
35,page_35,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 36/109 Thus, w hile a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled crossover trial in 7 PD patients suggested improvement of Levodopa -induced Dyskinesia (LID) with the synthetic cannabinoid nabilone (0.03mg/kg nabilone per day) [42], another randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled crossover trial in 19 PD patients found no effects on LID with an oral cannabis extract (40). Interestingly the same study did not show any effects on QoL (40), while another parallel -group randomized controlled trial ( RCT) [43] in 21 PD patients treated with placebo, cannabidiol (CBD) 75 mg/day or CBD 300 mg/day reported improved QoL in patients using CBD 300 mg/day and placebo . The same study showed no difference in the mean total UPDRS scores of patients with placebo and CBD in different dose regimens. Overall, there is no conclusive evidence from RCT on the symptomatic treatment of motor symptoms in PD . [12,40, 43, 42] Cannabinoids were well tolerated in all of these trials . No serious adverse events were recorded. The most common side effects from the RCTs have been the feeling of dizziness in up to 10% of patients, mild hypotension in up to 90% of patients, deterioration or new - onset change of perception (hallucinations, the feeling to be detached, confusion), and somnolence in up to 47% of patients. [40,42, 43] In one RCT two patients withdraw from the study due to vertigo and postural hy potension resulting from receiving nabilone but this was not consistent with other RCTs which included a greater sample size and documented no withdrawals due to side effects of cannabinoids. Due to the overall impact of NMS in PD and based on the influence of the endocannabinoid system on NMS in broad manner in PD, we decided to perform a proof of concept study to test nabilone for the treat ment of NMS in PD. We hypothesize that because of the described effects of the endocannabinoid system, nabilone will improve non -motor symptoms in p atient s with PD. This therapy should be well tolerated by contrast to some of the drug classes used in standard medical care and can therefore be an ethically justified additional treatment option for symptoms n ot concerning motor control of PD. If the treatment shows to be effective, the use of nabilone in health care practice can be supported by the data from this study."

Optimally, t he Safety Follow -Up Visit of the NMS -Nab Study w ill be the Screening / Baseline Visit of this open -label extension study. Patients will be re -tapered in an open -label nabilone dose optimization phase lasting up to 28 days followed by an open -label period of 6 months on a stable nabilone dose. Patients must meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects, who have signed the informed consent form at the first visit, will be re -tapered with open - label nabilone starting with a dosage of 0.25 mg at the evening. Dur ing dose titration and optimization, nabilone will be titrated in 0.25 mg increments (increase by 0.25 mg/ every one to four days), optimally up to the dose the patient had in the open -label titration phase prior the r andomized placebo -controlled , double -blind, parallel -group, enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal trial. It is the investigator´s decision to modify this dose, if necessary. The re -tapering will be performed up to a maximum dose of 1 mg twice daily.

Criterion 1 defines responders. Patients who meet this criterion will enter into the open -label treatment period at the last prescribed dose. Patients who meet criterion 2 will proceed to the open -label treatment period at the previous lower dose, providing they will meet the definition of a resp onder at that dos e. Patients who meet criterion 3 and were responder will enter the study at 1 mg twice daily. Patients are discontinued after dose optimization phase if they meet criteria number 2 but did not meet the responder definition at the previous dose, if they meet criteria 2 at the initial dose of 0. 25 mg once daily, or if they meet criteria 3 but did not meet the definition of a responder. During the open -label treatment period, dose adjustments can be performed if CGI -I deteriorates. In this case, patient will re -enter the titration phase of the trial . After the dose optimization visit, the patient will enter the 6 months open -label treatment period with nabilone in the dose defined in the titration phase. Visits will be performed every 3 months (V 2, V 3) in the scope of the patients regular visits in the specialized outpatient department. V 3 will be the terminatio n visit. Following this, nabilone will be tapered in all patients in 0.25 mg two -daily decrements. Phone calls will be held every other day during dose tapering phase.

Recruitment phase will last to the point when all of the 48 patients of the double - blind phase of the NMS -Nab trial have been asked if they are willing to participate in this extension trial. The study will begin with the Screening / Baseline Visit. If a patient is eligible for the study, he/she will then enter the open -label dose titration phase. This o ptimization phase will last from 2 up to 28 days for each patient and will include phone calls every other day and a visit at the end of the titration phase ( V 1). The patients will stay on the op en-label medication for 6 months which ends with the termination visit. Afterwards, the nabilone dose will be tapered and a Safety Follow -Up will be performed via telephone call and on -site visit. The total anticipate d study duration for an individual patient starting from the Screening / Baseline Visit will be a minimum of 186 days / 26 weeks + 4 days (including safety follow -up visit) and a maximum of 263 days / 37 weeks + 4 days. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient in the study (LPLV) . 3.1.4 Planned Number of Patients This is an open -label study. The sample size for this study is not based on statistical considerations; Up to 48 subjects who completed the r andomized placebo -controlled , double -blind, parallel -group, enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal study and met patient exclusion/inclusion criteria will be enrolled. In the r andomized placebo -controlled , double -blind, parallel -group, enriched enrolment randomize d withdrawal study a total of 38 patients provide d 80% power at a 2 -sided 5% significance level to detect a statistically significant difference in the change from randomization to Week 4 in MDS -UPDRS P art I score between nabilone and placebo if the true d ifference is 2.5 points. In the absence of previous data, we empirically chose as clinically meaningful a 2.5 units change from randomization to the visit at 4 weeks (in P hase 2). This sample size calculation assume d a standard deviation of the change from randomization to week 4 to be 2.4 points. ( 46) Assuming a drop -out rate of 25 %, we planned to include aroun d 48 patients with Parkinson´s disease in the NMS -Nab trial . Importantly, although a sample size calculation is provided, this was an exploratory study evaluating different NMS domains. Furthermore , corrections for multiple comparisons are therefore not planned."

Withdrawal of full consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further investigational treatment and does not wish or is unable to continue further study participation. Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the subject’s study data, but no further information will be collected unless a separate consent has been given. Withdrawal of partial consent means that the subject does not wish to take the protocol - specified product any longer but is still willing to collaborate in providing further data by continuing on study. The investigator has the right to discontinue a patient from IMP or withdraw a patient from the study at any time. The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented. Patients should be discontinued if they experience intolerable side effects believed to be related to the study drug and they will be terminated if they did not meet the responder cri terion at the previous dose or the maximum permitted dose. The Sponsor has the right to discontinue this trial at any time. The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the s ponsor decides to stop the clinical trial. The S ponsor has the right to terminate the trial prematurely at any time. This might be if there are any relevant medical or ethical concerns, or if completing the trial is no longer practicable. If such action is taken, the reasons for terminating the trial must be documented in detail. All tr ial subjects still under treatment at the time of termination must undergo a final examination (Early Termination Visit as soon as possible and Safety Follow -"

The principal investigator must be informed without delay if any investigator has ethical concerns about continuation of the trial. In case of discontinuation of the trial the IEC and competent regulatory authority must be informed within 15 days of early termination . 4.3.1 Potential Criteria for Withdrawal from Study The investigator should inform the Monitor if any of the following events occur that may lead to a discontinuation of the participation in the study: 1. Noncompliance of the patient with the study procedures or medications. 2. The patient doesn´t have a stable PD or changes his/her medication or receives neurosurgical intervention for PD. 3. The patient presents with one or more clinically significant laboratory values that are not within normal limits or clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination, or experiences AEs that are intolerable (as determined by the patient) or that endanger the safety of the patient based on the investigator´s judgement. 4.3.2 Definite Criteria for Withdrawal from Study A definite withdrawal from the study must be operated if any of the following events occur: 1. The patient withdraws his/ her consent willingly. 2. Patient develops a psych iatric, medical or surgical condition that would interfere with his/ her participation. 3. Patient shows abnormal laboratory values concerning hepatic an d renal function as described in the exclusion criteria. 4. Pregnancy of the patient during the study, as confirmed by a positive pregnancy test. 5. Withdrawal of t he patient is requested by the S ponsor or a regulatory agency. 6. The Sponsor or a regulatory agency discontinues the study. Reasons for discontinuation may include, but are not limited to the following:  Patient enrolment is unsatisfactory  Administrative Reasons 7. The Sponsor terminates the study prematurely. Premature termination of the trial will be considered if:  The risk -benefit balance for the trial subject changes markedly.  It is no longer ethical to continue treatment with the IMP.  The S ponsor considers that the trial must be discontinued for safety reasons.  An interim analysis or results of other research show that one of the trial treatments is superior or inferior to anothe r.  It is no longer practicable to complete the trial . 8. Patient has performed an active suicide since the last visit o r reports any suicidal behavior. In this case he/she should be ref erred to a hospital for Mental Health immediately . Should the trial be discontinued or should a subject request or decide to withdraw from the study, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the end of withdrawal. Thus, if a discontinuation of or a withdrawa l from the study occurs, all observations, evaluations as well as lab results and other test results should be documented. Moreover, a"

In case of a discontinuation of or a withdrawal from the study every effort should be made for attendance of an Early Termination (ET) Visit, which will be scheduled as soon as possible , followed by a Safety Follow -Up Visit af ter 2 weeks + 2 days of the ET (if the ET is performed after 5 days after the last intake of study drug) (see 5.6 and 5.7). Patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn, unless a separate consent has been given for further data collection. In case the withd rawal was due to an AE the patient should be followed up until he/she has recovered/ it has resolved, has reached a stable state, the investigator determines that it is no longer clinically significant, or the patient is lost to follow up. (see 8) 4.4 Further treatment after end of treatment After the end of the study treatment, alternative methods for the therapy of disturbing non - motor symp toms in PD can be prescribed to the patients as seen in Table 1: Drug classes for non-motor s ymptoms in PD, keeping in mind the patient´s tolerance . If the patient has shown benefit from the therapy with nabilone, a cannabinoid therapy will be prescribed on behalf of the investigator´s decision . 4.5 Closure of the Study The clinical trial shall be deemed to end when the last patient absolved the planned last visit according to protocol. The completion of the study will be reported to the ethics committee as well as to the relevant authorities ."

Details of scales used to evaluate efficacy and safety can be found in Section 6.1 and 6.2 and in the applicable appendices. A detailed description of study procedures by visit will be provided in this section. Eligible subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at the Screening / Baseline Visit will be titrat ed to the optimal dose as described above which could last up to 28 days . During this phase regular phone calls will be held every other day . After reaching the optimal dose, the patients will visit the outpatient clinic for an on -site visit (V 1) and enter the 6 months of open -label treatment phase with 4 -monthly visits . The first dose of IMP will be taken at home after the Visit V 1. A Safety Phone call will take place 5 days ± 2 days and a Safety Follow-Up visit will be performed 2 weeks + 2 days after the last intake of study medication . At visits after intake of medication, t he patients will be requested to return the IMP kits (including all used, unused , and partially used medication) dispensed to them at the previous visit and to take the ir IMP in the morning before every visit. Furthermore, the patient s should take the ir concomitant medication at home and at the clinic , if permitted, as normally schedul ed. Safety evaluations will be performed as scheduled in the schedule of events t able with examination of vital signs, AE, concomitant medication , the items 1.2, 1.8 , and 1.12 of MDS -UPDRS Part I, and the C -SSRS operated at every visit and AE and concomita nt medication , the items 1.2, 1.8 , and 1.12 of MDS -UPDRS Part I, and the C - SSRS at every phone call. In the event of Early Termination, patients will be asked to complete an Early Termination Visit as soon as possible and to return for a Safety Follow -Up Visit 2 weeks + 2 days after their last dose of IMP. Please refer to the Schedule of Events table and the Schematic diagram (in 3.2 for specific timing of assessments and Section 5.1,5.2,5.3,5.4,5.5,5.6,5.7, , and 6 for a detailed description of timing and aim of study procedures and scales . 5.1 Recruitment and Screening / Baseline Visit 5.1.1 Recruitment and Informed Consent Process Patients previously participating in the randomized p lacebo -controlled , double -blind, parallel - group, enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal NMS -Nab Study will be seen in the outpatient department on -site or at the neurologic wards ."

If the Screening / Baseline Visit occurs on the same day as the last visit of the NMS -Nab study, procedures or assessments completed for the NMS -Nab study do not need to be repeated for this trial . For interested patients a member of the qualified research team will explain the study purpose, goals , and requirements in an understandable way and an IRB/IEC -approved informed consent form will be hande d to the patients considering participation for info rmation . Relevant contact from the site including phone numbers will be given to the patient. Thus the patient can read, ask questions , and consult his/her family members if requested . It is the responsibility of the principal investigator , or a subinvestigator delegated by the principal investigator to obtain written informed consent from each subject prior to participation in the trial, following adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study. The person taking consent must be GCP trained , suitably qualified and experienced, and have been delegated this duty by the PI on the delegation log. The i nvestigator or designee will explain the patients are under no obligation to enter the trial and tha t they can withdraw at any time during the trial, without having to give a reason. No clinical trial procedures will be conducted prior to taking consent from the participant. Consent will not denote enrolment into trial. If all questions are clarified an d the patient has been given ample time to think about his/her participation, the informed consent will be obtained in acc ordance with ICH GCP by signing the informed consent form at a visit on -site before any trial -related procedures are completed . The si gnature from the investigator who conducted the informed consent discussion and the patient as well as the date will be provided and documented in the source documents. For patients who consent to participate in the study a copy of the signed ICF and other information available will be provided to them prior to participation. The original signed and dated ICF will be maintained at the investigator´s site. Any patient who is unable to demonstrate understanding of the information contained in the ICF won´t be allowed to participate in the study . The ICF and any other information provided to patients will be revised whenever important new information (e.g. safety information resulting in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment) becomes available that is relevant to the consent and continued participation of a patient in the study. The revised ICF and i nformation must receive IRB/IEC -approval prior to its use, and a copy of the IRB/IEC’s approval will be provided to the Sponsor. The patient will be inf ormed of any new info rmation via the revised ICF or i nformation material by the investigator and his/her willingness to further participate in the study will be questioned. A signed and dated new ICF will be obtained and stored, and a copy will be given to the patient. This will as well be recorded in the source documents."

The following assessments will be performed during the Screening / Baseline Visit and used to determine whether a patient is eligible for the study or not. If the NMS -Nab2 Screening / Baseline Visit occurs on the same day as the last visit of the NMS -Nab Study, procedures or assessments completed for the NMS -Nab Study do not need to be repeated for this Screening / Baseline Visit. Screening / Baseline Assessments: 1. Obtain written informed consent (see Section 5.1.1 ), sign and date, and provide a copy to the patient. 2. review inclusion and exclusion criteria for eligibility 3. review demographics, medical, medication and psychiatric history , review neurologic al and PD history, including questions for disturbing (i.e. treatment required) impulse control disorders and anti -PD medications . a. If less than 2 months have passed between the patient's completion of the NMS -Nab S tudy and the Screening / Baseline Visit, and there are no changes to medical, medication, or psychiatric history since completion of the NMS - Nab study, these data do not have to be re -captured. b.

The duration of the open -label titration phase can range from 2 days up to 28 days. Dose adjustments during titration phase will be performed until the patient: 1. Criterion 1: has much (CGI -I Rating Scale: 2) or very much (CGI -I Rating Scale: 1) improved NMS on the 7-point Clinical Global I mpression of Improvement Scale. This criterion defines responders. Patients who meet this criterion will enter into the 4 -weeks treatment period at the last prescribed dose. 2. Criterion 2: experiences intolerable side effects believed to be related to the study medication . Patients who meet criteria 2 will proceed to the 4 -weeks treatment period at the previous lower dose, assuming they will meet the definition of a responder at that dose. 3. Criterion 3: reaches t he maximum permitted dosage of 1 mg twice daily. Patients who meet criteria 3 and were a responder will enter the study at 1 mg twice daily. Patients are discontinued if they meet criteria number 2 but d id not meet the responder definition at the previous dose, if they meet criteria 2 at the initial dose of 0. 25 mg once daily, or if they meet criteria 3 but did not meet the definition of a responder. 5.3 Visit V 1 Patients will have an on -site visit at the clinic after they meet the responder criterion at their “optimal dose”.

For the MoCa and the MMSE, the difference between the Screening Visit of the NMS - Nab Study and the Termination Visit of this extension study will be compared. Therefore, the total MDS -UPDRS Part I, II, III, and IV (total UPDRS: 50 items, Part I: 0 to 52 points, Part II: 0 – 52 points, Part III: 0 – 132 points plus Hoehn and Yahr Scale 0 - 5 points, Part IV: 0 -24 points), the Non Motor Symptoms Scale (4 domains, 15 items, points from 0 – 12x15 with the latter being severely impaired daily or always), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (14 items, values from 0 – 42 points), the Parkinson´s Disease Questionnaire – 8 (8 items), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (8 items, score ranges from 0 – 30 points), the Mini Mental State Exam (0 to 30 points), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (8 items, ranges from 0 – 24 points), the Fatigue Severity Scale (9 items, 9 – 63 points), the King´s Parkinson´s Disease Pain Scale (7 domains, 14 items, 0 – 168 points), and the Questionnaire for Impulsive -Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease –Rating Scale (7 domains, 0 – 122 points) will be performed. The result of the C linical Global Impression – Global Improvement scale (ratings from 1 to 7) at the Termination Visit will be used as a secondary efficacy criterion. All presented scales are measured in points given above. Currently, the MDS -UPDRS Scale is the most common used scale in evaluation motor symptoms in patients with PD. The Movement Disorder Society (MDS) -sponsored new version of the UPDRS was published in 2003 with respect to the Task Force for Rating Scales´ proposed criticism of the original UPDRS concerning issues of weakness and ambiguities. ( 44) The scale consists of four components with each part addressing different domains of symptoms of PD and it s therapy (Part I: Non -Motor Experiences of Daily living; Part II: Motor experiences of daily living ; Part III: Motor Examination; Part IV: Motor Complications). Each section was written by appropriate members of the subcommittees, reviewed, and ratified b y the subcommittee. Part I of the MDS -sponsored new version of the UPDRS consists of one part (Part IA) containing the observations of the investigator regarding behaviors based on information from patients and caregivers, and one part (Part IB) to be self -administered by the patient alone or with help of the caregiver without"
62,page_62,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 63/109 cooperation with the investigator. The rater can solely review this part to ensure that all items are rated and questions for understanding can be addressed to him/her. Part II is als o based on the patient´s self -evaluation. Part III needs to be demonstrated or performed by the rater. Part IV consists of instructions for the investigator and the patients to combine clinical observations with information provided by the patient and it i s executed by the rater. Only qualified and trained raters will administer the MDS UPDRS subscales in accordance with requirements for background and experience in research settings. Trainings will be documented by providing a Certificate of Rater Approval . The MDS UPDRS Scale will first be measured before the patient receives nabilone and in subsequent visits after the patient´s morning dose of nabilone. It will be documented if the patient is in an ON state (i.e. period when the patient notices a benefit on MS from standard oral LD/CD treatment) or in an OFF state (i.e. t he phase with no response to medication and significant motor symptoms). The Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) was developed by an international multidisciplinary PD -NMS group in order to create a comprehensive questionnaire to assess symptoms of PD that are not affecting movement. Symptoms included in the scale range from vertigo and other symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, falls, daytime sleepiness and subsequent loss of energy, sleep d isturbances at night, restlessness in the legs to psychiatric and cognitive symptoms like apathy, loss of motivation and interest, nervousness, anxiety, worry, sadness, depression, mood swings, loss of joy in usual activities, and symptoms of delusion, hal lucinations, and double vision. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was developed in 1983 from Ziegmond und Snaith which edited a longer version of the questionnaire and published this 14 -items -long tool. The Scale aims to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression and was generated as a screening tool. 7 items address symptoms of anxiety and the other 7 items assess depression in patients. Therefore, a subscore for anxiety and depression can be generated. Questions regarding physical symptoms and int rusive items are not included to avoid confounding of the result by organic diseases. Parkinson´s Disease Questionnaire -8 The PDQ -8 is the short version of the longer PDQ -39 scale and was created to measure the health status and functional capacity of patients with PD. Its eight questions cover eight aspects of quality of life. The instrument was developed on the basis of int erviews with people diagnosed with PD and it has been widely validated. The questions relate to mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well -being, social support, cognition, communication, and"
63,page_63,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 64/109 bodily discomfort. The patient is asked to rate each q uestion regarding his/her PD symptoms over the past month. Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) Nasreddine et. al created the MoCA in 1996 in Montreal, Quebec to asses symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. The t est assesses several cognitive domai ns through its task for orientation to time and place (6 points), its learning task (five nouns) to assess short -term memory recall (5 points), a task to assess visuospatial / executive functions (task adapted from trail making B task, clock -drawing task, and drawing a three -dimensional cube, 5 points), and a phonemic fluency task (1 point), and a two -item verbal abstraction task (2 points). Cognitive function and working memory are evaluated using a sustained attention task (target detection using tapping, 1 point), a serial number subtraction task (3 points), and a task where digits are repeated forwards and backwards (1 point each). Verbal skills are assessed by using a confrontation naming task with animals with low familiarity (lion, camel, rhinocerus, 3 points), by letting the patient repeat two sentences with complex syntax (2 points), and the fluency task described above. Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) Folstein et al. developed the MMSE in 1975. The MMSE is a The MMSE consists of 30-items and was designed to be a brief global cognitive screening measure. It consists of several short tasks used to assess attention, memory, language, and visuospatial abilities, as well as orientation to person, place and time. A cutoff of 24 (23 and below) has been p roposed to detect cognitive impairment. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Daytime sleepiness is assessed by the ESS, which is a short self -administered scale asking for the probability of dozing in eight different situations during the day. Answers can range from no chance of dozing to high chance of dozing in the following scenarios: sitting and reading, watching TV, sitting in a public space, being an assistant driver in a one -hour ride without a break, relaxing in the evening, sitting and talking to a nother person, sitting still after lunch without intake of alcohol and stopping the car at a traffic light. King's Parkinson's disease pain scale (KPPS) Chaudhuri et al. initially published the KPPS to be a reliable and valid scale to rate different types of pain in PD in 2015. ( 45) Its aim is to evaluate the global and bedside burden of pain and to characterize various phenotypes of pain in Parkinson Disease (PD) patients."
64,page_64,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 65/109 The scale consists of seven domains including 14 items, with each item scored by severity (0-3) multiplied by frequency (0 -4), resulting in a subscore of 0 to 12, with a total possible score range from 0 to 168. The KPPS pr ovides questions for musculoskeletal pain, chronic pain, fluctuation -related pain, nocturnal pain, oro -facial pain, discolouration, oedema / swelling and radicular pain. The contact information for this questionnaire and the permission to use for this stud y was granted by: Mapi Research Trust, Lyon, France – Internet: https://eprovide.mapi -trust.org Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) To evaluate the level and severity of fatigue of patients during the past week the FSS will be used in this study. It consists of nine statements with levels ranging from 0 to 7 points whereat a low value indicates a strong disagreement with the statement and a high value a strong approval of it. The scale pays attention to motivation, the impact of exercise on fatigue, the impact o f fatigue on (physical) functioning, work, family or social life, and problems and disability arising from fatigue. Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI -I) The CGI -I is used by the investigator to rate the patient´s total improvement based on a 1 to 7 point weighted scale at which one point means “very much improved” and seven points indicate a status of being “very much worse”. If the scale has not been assessed, a zero score will be given. The rater should evaluate the improvement of the patient to his clinical judgment, whether or not the improvement is believed to be due to drug therapy. Questionnaire for Impulsive -Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease –Rating Scale (QUIP -RS) The QUIP -RS is a measurement designed to support the diagnosis and to measure the severity of symptoms of impulse control disorders and related disorders in PD in the last four weeks. The QUIP -RS consists of 4 primary questions addressed to commonly reported thoughts, urges/desires, and behaviours associated with impu lse control disorders each applied to 4 domains of impulse control disorders and 3 domains of related disorders. These 4 domains are: compulsive gambling, buying, eating, and sexual behavior. The 3 domains of related disorders are medication use, punding, and hobbyism. Each question can have a score from 0 to 4 assessing the frequency of thoughts, urges, or behaviours. The scores for each impulse control disorder and related disease can range from 0 to 16 points, with a higher score indicating a greater sev erity of symptoms. The total QUIP -RS score for all ICDs and related disorders combined can have values from 0 to 112 points . © University of Pensylvannia"

Physical and neurological examination A brief physical and neurological examination of the patient will be h eld at the Screening / Baseline Visit, the Visits V 1, V 2, V 3 , the Safety Follow -up Visit, and an Early Termination Visit (if applicable) of the patient and documented in the patient´s record. All physical examinations will be performed by trained medical personnel only, prior to IMP administration on dosing days. Any abnormal findings will be recorded as AEs. Physical examination must at least include assessment of the vigilance and orientation, general condition, nutritional condition, HEENT (head , eyes, ears, nose and throat), respiratory system, heart, abdomen, extremities, and visible skin an d mucous membrane. Patients should be questioned for defecation and the act of urination. Neurological examination should include standard neurological asse ssment of vigilance, orientation, mental status (e.g. consciousness), meningism, cranial nerves, the motor system and sensory system of both upper and lower extremities, reflexes (including pathological reflexes), cerebellar signs, gait, tandem gait, and p ostural stability, as well as special tests for parkinsonism (e.g. finger tapping, toe tapping , facial expression, …). Vital signs Vital signs including the evaluation of weight, height (only at Screening / Baseline Visit), temperature, and active orthostatism will be performed at all visits during the course of the study. The latter will be assessed by measuring the heart rate and blood pressure after 10 minutes of quiet rest in a supine position and at 1, 2, 3, 5, a nd 10 min after active standing. Blood pressure and pulse rate should be obtained in a quiet room at a comfortable temperature, with the patient’s arm unconstrained by clothing or other material, and with an appropriate cuff size.

Columbia Suicide Severity Scale (C -SSRS) The C -SSRS was initially designed for suicidal assessment in one study, but has shown overall successful prediction of suicidal behaviour in adolescences and adults. It is the only screening tool to assess the full range of suicidal ideation and behaviour including criteria for the next steps (e.g. referral to a mental health professional). Suicidality in this study with this scale will be assessed by trained study personnel only (Posner et. al, 2011) on all visits and telephone calls as a measurement for s afety. The scale consists of 4 categories: suicidal ideation, intensity of suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour, and actual/potential lethality which can be answered by Yes or No. At Screening / Baseline Visit the questionnaire for the past 6 months will be used and for all other visits and phone calls the version “Since the last visit” will be administered. © 2008 The Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc. 6.3 Assessment of exploratory endpoint  Eye-tracking Examination (reaction time, attention span, concentrativeness)"

Canemes 0.25 mg capsules are an oral dosage form in white hard gelatine c apsules. Each capsule contains 0.25 mg Nabilone as the active ingredient, in the form of a polyvinylpyrollidone (Povidone) co -precipitate and corn starch. Each PE bottle contains 28 capsules for a treatment period of approximately 1 month. Synthetic cannabinoid nabilone Other components: Polyvinylpyrollidone (Povidone) co -precipitate and corn starch Administration form: capsules Mode of administration: oral Dose: 0.25 – 2 mg per day Manufactured in 0.25 mg dosage strength Bottles of 28 capsules each For clinical trial use only, Usage as described in the protocol Stored at room temperature, Store pharmaceutical material out of the reach and sight of children Sponsor : Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria Represented by O.Univ. -Prof. Dr. Werner Poewe 7.1.2 Dosing Instructions During titration phases nabilone will be started with a dosage of 0. 25 mg in the evening orally and titrated by 0. 25 mg increments every one - to four - daily. Dose adjustments should be performed as follows: First dose to be implemented: 0. 25 mg orally in the evening once a day (0 -0-1) Increase in one to four -day- steps, according to the investigator´s decision: 2. 0.25 mg by mouth BID (1 -0-1), 3. 0.25 mg 1 -0-2 orally, 4. 0.25 mg 2 -0-2 orally, 5. 0.25 mg 2 -0-3 by mouth, 6. 0.25 mg 3 -0-3 orally, 7. 0.25 mg 3 -0-4 p.o., 8. 0.25 mg 4 -0-4 orally A maximum of 1 mg twice a day should not be exceeded. Optimally, the dose the patient was classified as a responder in the NMS -Nab Study should be reached. However, the"
70,page_70,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 71/109 investigator can adapt this do se according to his/her decision. Between morning dose an evening dose a time interval of 12 h should be meet. Preferably, tablets should be taken at the same time each day. In case a participant misses a dose, he/she will be instructed to take their next dose of nabilone at the normally scheduled time. The increment of dosage should take place until the patient has much (CGI - I Rating Scale: 2) or very much (CGI -I Rating Scale: 1) improved, reached a maximum dose of 1 mg BID or experiences intolerable adverse events that are believed to b e related to the study drug. During the trial the fixed dosage of the study drug should not be changed. If the patient deteriorates in his CGI -I, dose adjustments can be made and the patients doesn´t have to restarts again at titration phase. 7.1.3 Packaging a nd Label ling The IMP supplies for this study will be packaged according to current GMP guidelines and applicable national laws and regulations. For titration phase, IMP will be packaged in an open -label fashion . Packaging , labelling and d istribution of IMP will be performed by the company Kwizda. 7.1.4 Handling and Storage Requirements The i nvestigators will be responsible for ensuring the correct storage and sufficient stocks of the IMP and comparative drug at the trial centers. The i nvestigator bears the responsibility for the proper storage in a secure location at the site which means in a lockable cabinet with restricted access to the i nvestigator(s) and authorized site staff. Personnel having access to the IMP will be listed on the Authorization and Del egation log in the Inv estigator Site File (ISF). The i nvestigators will ensure that the IMP is only used according to this protocol and will only be dispensed to participants of the study . Dispensing will be performed by authorized members of the study tea m. The i nvestigator will be responsible for the Drug Accountability log. Drug accountability will be recorded in the patient´s record as well. Drug accountability will be noted by a monitor during site visits and at the completion of the trial. Unused stud y drug from all sites will be sent to the company Kwizda for destruction after completion of the trial (LPLV) . 7.2 Subject´s Compliance 7.2.1 Numbering of Patients All participants who are eligible for the study (see: Inclusion criteria 4.1. ) will rec eive a"

This will be a unique number received at the Screening / Baseline Visit to be identified throughout the participation in the study (in ascending order, starting with number 001 for the first pat ient). This number will be used in all communications between the investigator and the Sponsor for the specific patient. A patient only enters the trial, if he meets all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria during the Screening / Baseline Visit. The assigned kit number of the open -label IMP will be documented in the source documents. In case of a drop -out, no replacement will be recruited and the screening number will be assigned as before in an ascending order. Due to this study being an open -label study, no procedures for blinding and unblinding are outlined in this protocol. 7.3 Drug Accountability and Treatment Compliance The receipt of medication and the condition of it as well as the loss or damage of medication will be recorded in the source d ocuments and the company Kwizda will be informed . The dispensing and return of medication should be documented in the Drug Accountability Section and the patient´s record . Both this records and the medication supplies must be available to b e reviewed by the study S ponsor or designee at any time requested. The investigator is responsible for appropriate storage of used, unused, and partially used study drug supplies on -site until they are returned for destruction on completion of the study (LPLV). Supplies of nabilone intended for this study should only be used for the purpose of the study and adhering to this protocol. It is prohibited to apply for any other purpose. The investigator is responsible that the use of the study drug is strictly in accordance w ith the study protocol. 7.3.1 Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance In outpatient treatment procedures for the verification and documentation of the compliance will be as follows:  The patients only receive the amount of medication units at each visit that will be needed until the next visit.  The Investigator takes back the empty containers or non -used units . The patient must return all used, unused, and partially used study drug supplies at the planned visits in the study course. Drug accountability m ust be done in the presence of the participant. Thus , discrepancies between the dosing regime and the patient´s compliance"
72,page_72,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 73/109 can be clarified directly. Drug Accountability must be recorded in the source documents and the Drug Accountability Log in the Investigator Site File . The end of treatment for the patient should be documented . In case of persistent noncompliance of a patient (<80% to >120% of the assigned dose), the Sponsor or its designee will be informed t o decide together with the investigator whether the patient should be discontinued or not. 7.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications/Treatments 7.4.1 Allowed Anti -PD Medications/Treatments All Anti -PD Medications are allowed in this study preconditioned the patient h as a stable Parkinson´s disease and that the regimens of Anti -Parkinson´s medications, other current prescribed/non -prescribed medications or dietary supplements are stable for at least 30 days prior to screening and will be continued on the same doses and regimens. The nabilone titration in the NMS -Nab Study should be an exception of this. The addition of any new anti -PD medication or other prescribed / non -prescribed drugs are allowed during the study as well as changes to frequency or intervals between d oses , but have to be recorded in the source documents and discussed with the investigator due to possible interactions. Participants will be advised to refrain from the use of any concomitant medication during their participation in the study without prior permission by the investigator. The use and the reason for the use of any additional medication will be recorded in source documents. 7.4.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications/Treatments Nabilone has an addictive and CNS depressing effect if taken together with diazepam, Na - Secobarbital, alcohol and codeine . Interactions between nabilone and the following medications have been observed. Therefore, these the intake of these drug s during the course of the clinical trial is prohibited for participants of this study .  amphetamine, cocaine , other sympathomimetics  atropin e, scopolamin e, antihistaminics , other anticholinergic substances  amitriptylin e, amoxapin e, desipramin e, other tricyclic antidepressive drugs  barbiturate s, benzodiazepine s (except for clonazepam up to a maximum of 1.5 mg per d) , lithium, opioids, b uspiron e, muscle relaxi ng agents, C NS depressing substances  disulfiram"

During the trial, such non -pharmacological therapies can be started as well . All non - pharmacological therapies will be documented in the source documents at the Screening / Baseline Visit. The concomitant non -pharmacological therapies should be kept on the same levels during the study."
74,page_74,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 75/109 8 Adverse Events 8.1 Summary of known and possible Adverse Events of the IMP Generally, nabilone is well tolerated. Common adverse reactions ( 1/100 to <1/10) observed in patients are:  Somnolence  Vertigo  Euphoria  Ataxia  impaired vision  difficulties to concentrate  sleep disturbances  dysphoria  headache  hypotension  nausea  dry mouth Controlled trials with patients taking nabilone showed that at least one side effect occurred per subject. Most patients develop a tolerance in regard of adverse events concerning the CNS and therefore relaxation, somnolence and euphoria reside after some weeks. This effect is reversible. In therapeutic doses nabilone is a potential addictive drug . The potential to cause mental addiction is unknown and no patient has shown withdrawal symptoms in clinical trials. In conjunction with psychological stress, a n overdose phenomenon of nabilone can appear at therapeutic doses. Symptoms due to overdosing nabilone have been described as enhanced psychomimetic and psychological side effects of the drug. In clinical trials a normalization of the mental state of the p atient was reached after 72 hours of withdrawal of the drug without additional therapy. One should monitor vital signs due to the possible occurrence of hypertension, hypotonia, and tachycardia. No cases of patients taking doses above a level of 10mg dail y have been described in clinical trials so far. Hereby, one would expect symptoms like hallucinations, anxiety, respiratory depression, and coma."
75,page_75,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 76/109 No adaption of dose needs to be done in the elderly . Nabilone should not be used in patients under the age o f 18 years because it has not been studied in separate trials. The primary route of elimination of nabilone is biliary. Thus it should not be used in patients with severe impairment of liver function . No data in patients with impaired renal function have b een collected, which is why it should be used with caution in these patients. Nabilone should not be used during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of data in this cohort. In experiments with animals, no reproductive toxicity has been described. N o studies on carcinogenesis have been performed. Minor risks of nabilone ( 1/10.000 to <1/1.000) include :  Confusion  Disorientation  Hallucination  Psychosis  Depression  difficulties in coordination  tremor  loss of appetite  anxiety  depersonalisation  tachycardia  abdominal pain The IMP can cause alterations of physical and mental capabilities which are essential for tasks requiring high attention e.g. driving or operating machines. The study medication can be detected in the body after withdrawal (total half -life 35 hours) which could lead to misinterpretation in case of a control through regulatory authorities e.g. police. 8.2 Definition of an Adverse Event (AE) An adverse event is “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment”. ( 47) An AE can therefore be any unfavourable a nd unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is considered to be clinically relevant by the physician and is temporally associated with the use of a medici nal"
76,page_76,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 77/109 (investigational) product , whether or not related to the study drug. Adverse events include:  Worsening or increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing disease or medical condition in an unexpected manner  Abnormal laboratory tests (clinically significant) Adverse events do not include:  Pre-planned interventions/hospitalizations  Medical or surgical procedures, e.g. surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion. However, the event leading to the procedure is an AE. If this event is serious, the procedure must be described in the SAE narrative.  Pre-existing disease or medical condition that does not worsen.  Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms. In order to ensure complete safety dat a collection, all AEs occurring during the study (i.e., after the signing of the ICF), including any post -treatment periods required by the protocol, must be recorded in source documents even if no investigational product was taken but specific study proce dures were conducted. This includes all AEs not present prior to the Screening / Baseline Visit and all AEs that occurred or worsened after the Screening / Baseline Visit. Events that occur prior to giving informed consent are captured as medical history. Signs or symptoms of the disease for which the investigational product is being studied should be recorded as an AE if their frequency or intensity increases in a clinically significant manner or their nature changes unexpectedly as compared to the clinic al course known to the investigator from the patient’s history, or the natural course of the disease. 8.3 Definition of a Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) “A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resu lts in death, is life -threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect”. ( 47) An adverse event is therefore considered serious by the definition by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines if it can be characterized by at least one of the following criteria:  Results in death"
77,page_77,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 78/109  is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of the investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer t o an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.  requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization  causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity (i.e. a substantial disruption of a pers on’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (including that occurring in a fetus)  or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above mentioned outcomes. (i.e. the development of drug dependency or drug abuse) Inpatient hospitalization is defined as an overnight stay in a hospital unit and/or emergency room that i ncludes at least one night (midnight to 06:00 AM). The following is not considered as a SAE and should be reported as an AE only:  Treatment of an emergency or outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling the definition of seriousness given above and not r esulting in hospitalization The following reasons for hospitalization are not considered as AEs or SAEs:  Standard monitoring of a pre -existing disease or medical condition that did not worsen, e.g. hospitalization for coronary angiography in a subject with stable angina pectoris  Elective treatment of a pre -existing disease or medical condition that did not worsen, e.g. hospitalization for chemotherapy for cancer, elective hip replacement for arthritis  Hospitalization for cosmetic elective surgery, social an d/or convenience reasons A change in vital signs, diagnostic tests (e.g., an electrocardiogram), or laboratory test results may be an SAE if the change meets one of the above criteria. 8.4 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) & Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction An ADR is any noxious and unintended response to an IMP related to any dose with at least a reasonably possible causal relationship with the IMP. Unexpected ADR means the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information avail able for the IMP. Expected ADRs are listed in the appropriate reference documents (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure)."
78,page_78,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 79/109 8.5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) A SUSAR is an event that is believed to be at least possible related to the administration of the study drug and is severe and unexpected. It therefore may illustrate a side effect of the drug. For clinical studies in which an IMP is used, the FDA defines an “unexpected” AE as an AE that has never been seen before, or is not consistent with the information about the drug´s risks in the relevant source documents (e.g. Investigator´s Brochure). 8.6 Pregnancy In the event a patient becomes pregnant after the fi rst intake of any IMP, the investigator and the Sponsor should be informed immediately. The patient should be withdrawn from the study as soon as pregnancy is known, and should immediately stop the intake of the IMP. If a pregnancy should be confirmed afte r informed consent has been obtained but prior to the initiation of the study drug, the patient must be excluded from the trial. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child. Pregna ncy complications (including spontaneous abortions) and elective terminations must be reported as an AE or SAE. Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study and consider ed by the investigator as possibly related to the IMP, mu st be promptly reported to the S ponsor. The participant should return for an Early Termination visit as soon as possible and should be followed by via a Safety Follow -Up Visit 14 days + 2 days after discontinuation of the study drug (if the ET is performed after 5 days after the last intake of study drug) . The investigator must inform the patient of currently known potential risks for pregnancy outcome and available treatment alternatives. In case the partner of a male patient enroll ed in the clinical study becomes pregnant, the Sponsor must be informed immediately by the investigator or designee and a decision of the further procedure will be made. The pregnancy will be documented in the source docume nts including the progression of the pregnancy and the eventual date of birth (if applicable) as well as the health of the mother and of the child. The health of the child must be followed for 30 days after birth for any significant medical issues. A preg nancy becomes an SAE in the following circumstances: miscarriage, abortion, or anomaly/birth defect of the child. Those SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor as described below."
79,page_79,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 80/109 As the consent for the study does not cover the consent for the follow -up of t he pregnancy, a separate consent has to be obtained. 8.7 Overdose of Investigational Medicinal Product If the patient has taken a dose beyond that prescribed in the protocol (including section on overdose) should be recorded in the source documents and in the Drug Accountability. These events are only considered to be AEs or SAE if there are associated clin ical signs and symptoms or if the act of taking the excess medicine itself is an AE or SAE (e.g., suicide attempt). Any SAE or nonserious AE associated with excessive dosing must be followed as any other SAE or AE. 8.8 Grading of Severity of Adverse Events The term “serious” in SAE refers to the outcome of a patient´s event that poses a threat to his/her life or functioning rather than to its intensity, which is described by the term “severity”. In the latter, the event itself may be of relatively minor medic al significance (such as a severe headache). Intensity of all adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03 on a five -point scale (grade 1 to 5) and reported in detail in the patien t´s records and CRF. Adverse events not listed in the CTCAE version 4.03 should be graded as follows: Table 4: CTC grading of Adverse Events CTC grade Equivalent to Definition Grade 1 mild Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity Grade 2 moderate Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity; no treatment or medical intervention is indicated although this could improve the overall wellbeing or symptoms of the patient. Grade 3 severe Inability to work or perform normal daily activity; treatment or medical intervention is indicated in order to improve the overall wellbeing or symptoms; delaying the onset of treatment is not putting the survival of the patient at direct risk. Grade 4 life-threatening / disabling An immediate threat to life or leading to a permanent mental or physical condition that prevents work or performing normal daily activities; treatment or medical intervention is required in order to maintain survival."
80,page_80,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 81/109 Grade 5 death AE resulting in death 8.9 Causality The assessment of relationship of adverse events to the administration of IMP is a clinical decision based on all available information and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying indication, coexisting dis eases, concomitant medication, etc. at the time of the completion of the patient´s record and case report form of this visit. The term “related” refers to the ability of the study drug to cause the AE implicating a relationship in time and that the event w ould not have happened without the effort of the study drug. The question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event?”, should be asked. Answer YES (possibly, probably or definitely related) if one or more of the following criteria apply:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug  The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the patient  The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug  The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug. (It should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness). Otherwise answer NO (not related). Moreover, t he relationship between the AE and the study drug can be described stepwise:  definitely related: an AE that follows a temporal relationship with implementing the study drug and a known response pattern to it and cannot be otherwise explained by the patient´s medical condition or conc omitant medication  probably related: meets all criteria mentioned above and has to improve after de - challenging the patient with the study drug.  possibly related: an AE that has a temporal relationship between administration of the study drug and its occur rence and is a known response pattern to the IMP but could also be explained by the patient´s medical history or treatment.  Unrelated : an AE without a relationship in time to study drug treatment and which is most likely explained by the patient´s medical condition or therapies."

Moreover, the rater will propose an open -ended, non -leading question to the participant to detect AEs. Documentation needs to be done in the patient´s medical record and in a special section for adve rse events in the CRF where the following details must be entered:  Type of adverse event (diagnosis or syndrome; if not known signs or symptoms)  Start (date)  End (date)  Severity (mild, moderate, severe, life -threatening/disabling, death)  Serious (no / yes)  Unexpected (no / yes)  Outcome (resolved, ongoing, ongoing – improved, ongoing – worsening)  Action taken (none, study medication dose reduced, study medication interrupted, study medication discontinued, medication therapy, surgical procedure, hospitalization, other)  Relation to study drug (possibly, probably or definitely related or not related ) The investigator should use syndromes or diagnosis of standard medical terminology to record adverse events, whenever possible. The Sponsor should be informed immediately by the investigator on -site, if an AE is thought to be at least probably related to the study drug treatment to discuss whether or not the administration of the IMP should be stopped. Certain events require im mediate reporting to allow the S ponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial. The inv estigator must report such events to the S ponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event. The following is a list of events that the i nvestigator must report to the S pons or within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug:  Serious adverse events"
82,page_82,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 83/109  Pregnancies The investigator must report new significant follow -up infor mation for these events to the Sponsor immediately (i.e. no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information). New significant information includes the following:  New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis.  Significant new diagnostic test results.  Change in causality based on new information.  Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery.  Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event. Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting SAEs to the local health authority and IRB/EC. Follow Up of Adverse Events An AE will be followed until the patient has recovered/ it has resolved, has reached a stable state, the investigator determines that it is no longer clinically significant, or the patient is lost to follow up. The end of an AE should be documented in the CRF and the patient´s record. If an AE is still ongoing at the end of the study for a patient, follow up will be provided until resolution/stable level is achieved, or until it no longer is clinically significant by the judgeme nt in the investigator, or until the patient is lost to follow up. In the latter the investigator has to take all possible actions in the discretion of his judgement to contact the patient and document a loss of follow -up in the source documents. In case of withdrawal from the study due to an AE, an Early Termination (ET) Visit will be scheduled as soon as possible followed by a Safety Follow -Up Visit after 2 weeks + 2 days of the ET (if the ET is performed after 5 days after the last intake of study drug) . 8.10.2 Recording, Reporting, and Follow -Up Procedures for Serious Adverse Events and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Reporting and Recording of Serious Adverse Events and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Investigators will seek information on SAEs and SUSARs at each patient contact throughout the trial. As for all AEs, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, SAEs and SUSARs will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Ad verse Event Section of the CRF."
83,page_83,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 84/109 In the event of a serious adverse event , the investigator has to use all supportive measures for best patient treatment. An SAE form must be completed by the investigator and reported no more than 24 hours after receiving n otice of the event. The site must provide the Sponsor with a detailed description containing at least the symptoms and course of events, the actions taken, the medication given and if the dose of the study drug was changed. The following details should be available with the initial report:  Patient number  Patient: date of birth, ethnic origin  Name of investigator and investigating site  Period of administration  The suspected investigational medicinal product (IMP)  The adverse event assessed as serious  Conco mitant disease and medication  Relevant medical history  Short description of the event and outcome  Description o Onset and if applicable, end o Therapeutic intervention o Causal relationship to each of the study drugs (for definition see: 8.2.1.) o Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization o Death, life -threatening, persistent or significant disability or incapacity This insight from the investigator is very important for the Sponsor to assess the safety of the IMP and in determining whether the SAE requires reporting to the regulatory authorities in an expedited manner. In case of a new development of the event , the initial report should be followed by the follow - up report, indicating the outcome of the SAE. A copy of the reports will be provided to AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals for safety records. SUSARs need to be reported and followed up in the same manner as SAEs. The Sponsor decides if the event needs to be classified as a SUSAR in discussion with the investigator. Therefore, detailed information about the event and the subsequent actions should be made available within 24 hours by the investigator and any relevant updates should be reported within 24 hours. SUSARs will be reported to the required regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and ethical committees in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good cl inical practice by the S ponsor and/or its designees."

Follow Up of Serious Adverse Events and SUSARs For SAE s, SUSARs and pregnancies, the S ponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g. from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. An SAE and SUSAR will be followed until it has resolved, has reached a stable state, the investigator determines that it is no longer clinically significant, or the patient is lost to follow up. If an SAE or SUSAR of a participant is still ongoing at the end of the study, follow up will be provided until resolution/ a stable level is achieved, or until the SAE or SUSAR is no longer clinically significant by the judgement in the investigator, or until th e patient is lost to follow up. In the latter the investigator has to take all possible actions in the discretion of his judgement to contact the patient. A loss of follow -up should be documented in the source documents. In case the IMP was withdrawn due to an SAE or SUSAR , patients will be advised to come to the hospital as soon as possible for an Early Termination Visit (see 5.7). A Safety Follow -Up Visit should be performed 2 weeks + 2 days after the last intake of study medication (if the Early Termination Visit occurs not longer than 5 days after the discontinuation of the study medication).

All collected data of this study have to be recorded on the CRF and/or the patient´s record by appropriate authorized persons. This also includes data of patients who dropped -out of the study. It has to be assured that all persons authorized for CRF entries can be identified. A list with signatures and identif ication codes of the persons must be archived in the ISF and TMF. Moreover, logs according to ICH E6 (e.g. Signature/Delegation/Screening/Drug Accountability log) will be imp lemented and maintained by the i nvestigator. The i nvestigator records the particip ation of a patient on a special identification list of patients (Screening Log) . This list gives the possibility for a later identification of the patients and contains the patient number, full name, date of birth and the date of the enro lment into the study. The identification list of patients remains in the study center after the closure of the study. Additionally, the participation of the patient in this clinical study has to be recorded in the patient`s medical record. Each patient will receive a unique patient identification number. Data will be documented using this code for each patient that will also be used for communication with the Sponsor and other authorities. Only the Investigator and his/her designees will be able to connect the number and the patient´s name. Data collection must be compl eted for each subject which has signed an ICF a nd was administered study drug. Patient´s data will be stored on -site in a locker to which only the investigator and his/her designees have access. Personal patient information (such as name, date of birth etc.) is stored separately from the research data. For all work involving data collections of human information, electronic or otherwise, the study centre will adhere to the law as laid down in the European Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Regulation (EU) of the european parliament and of the council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) ) as well as national data protection law. Adequate measur es to ensure data protection, confidentiality will be duly taken into account by the Investigators and all parties involved in the study."

Corrections have to be made in a way, that the previous entries remain readable (the use of any instrument of correction is not allowed). Corr ections have to be signed and dated by the authorised person, who made the corrections. Data, which are not available or were not collected, have to be clearly identifiable as such (NA). The reasons should be documented, if necessary. The in vestigator assu res, that all data of patients are recorded immediately, readable, completed, and correct in the patient ´s chart and in the CRFs. After the end of the study (end of the study defined as the last visit of the last patient) and after the verification regardi ng the plausibility and completeness by the Monitor, all documents and data relating to the study will be kept in an orderly manner by the investigator in a secure study file. Source data will be stored for 30 years (for medical records and other original data) after the end of the study (i.e. last visit of the last patient) according to local and national regulatories. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the Sponsor before study related documents will be destroyed. Monitors, auditors, a nd other authorized agents of the Sponsor or its designee, the EC/IRB approving the research, local law regulatory agents and appropriate authorities in conducting investigations for which the person´s medical history is necessary will be granted access to the study subject´s original medical records without violating the confidentiality of the subject to the extent permitted by the law and regulations. In any presentation of the results of this study or in publications, the subject´s identity will remain c onfidential. 9.2 Trial Folders The trial folders should serve as gapless documentation. Individually or together they should allow the evaluation of the trial implementation as well as quality of data. 9.2.1 Trial Master File (TMF) The paper -based TMF, established at the beginning of the trial and secured in a safe place, contains all essential documents that demonstrate that the trial is conducted in accordance"

The evaluation of the dat a takes place by the programmed range -, validity - and consistence checks. In addition to that a manual/visual evaluation of the plausibility in accordance with the requirements of the GCP is performed. Queries may occur, which will be forwarded to the investigator by the Monitor of the study. By means of the queries the i nvestigator has to evaluate and respond to the accrued discrepancies . After the record of all entries and clarification of all queries, the data based will be closed at the completion of th e study. This performance has to be documented. 11 Protocol Deviations All deviations to the study protocol have to be documented in the patient´s record with the explanation for variance. Deviations have to be announced to the Sponsor , who is responsible for their evaluation, within 24 hours after receipt of knowledge. The report should include the patient´s study code, sex, year of birth, a brief description of the event, the cause of it (if applicable), the time, the date, the duration of the event, and the corrective and preventive measurements performed. Protocol Deviations will be reported to the Sponsor to decide if the patient will be discontinued in the study or not. The Sponsor can terminate a trial during the course of it, whenever a reason for co ncern appears. The Sponsor or the investigator can discontinue a patient´s participation in the trial on their behalf (for criteria see 4.3). Reasons for termination of a trial or of a study participant have to be documented in the patient´s record or other source documents . In case of a security termination, the test person has to be further monitored. Deviations have to be analyzed whether cha nges of the clinical investigation plan or the closure of the study are necessary. If necessary, the ethics committee or the responsible authorities have to be informed. In case of a withdrawal from the study, the data will be included in the analysis up to the time of discontinuation."

The sample size for this study is not based on statistical considerations; Up to 48 subjects who completed the r andomized placebo -controlled , double -blind, parallel -group, enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal study and met patient exclusion/inclusion criteria will be enrolled. In the r andomized placebo -controlled , double -blind, parallel -group, enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal stud y a total of 38 patients (19patients per group) provided 80% power at two -sided 5% significance level to detect a statistically significant difference in the change from baseline to Termination visit in MDS -UPDRS Part I score between nabilone and placebo a ssuming a true difference of 2.5 points. This sample size calculation assumed a standard deviation of the change from randomization to week 4 to be 2.4 points . (46) With a drop- out quote of 25 % we planned to include 48 patients in the trial. We chose this design because it has the advantage that the patient population enrolled is enriched by including only responders. ( 48) The sample size calculation for the NMS -Nab Study was performed with the Program nQuery Advisor (Version 7). 12.2 Study Populations: Datasets or Populations analyzed Safety and tolerability summaries will be based on a safety set which will include all patients receiving at least one dose of study medication and completing at least V 1 will be analysed .The safety set will b e used for summaries of safety and tolerability. Additionally, summaries of baseline and demographic data will be produced out of the safety set. The efficacy analysis for the secondary endpoints will also be performed including all screened subjects with at least one Visit after the V 0 . All summaries for efficacy will be based on the set. In case of a drop -out, no interpolation can be performed. Therefore, the primary analysis is a per-protocol analysis."
92,page_92,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 93/109 12.3 Background and Demographic Characteristics All baseline and demographic summaries will be produced for the data of patients gained at the Screening / Baseline Visit out of the safety dataset . The number and characteristics of patients in the safety set , , the number of AEs, SAEs and SUSARs with description, the number of subjects with premature discontinuation from the study/or the study drug along with reasons for discontinuation will be provided. Furthermore, the number of screened subjects, the number of screening failures and reasons why they have been excluded will be given. A consort diagram will be provided. 12.4 Safety Analysis This is a phase III open -label trial to evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of nabilone for non -motor symptoms of patients with PD. Data analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Software and Microsoft Excel. The primary safety analysis will be performed with the safety data set.. Additionally, a safety analysis will be performed on all events as well as th e hallucination item, orthostatic hypotension item and day -time sleepiness item of Part I of MDS -UPDRS occurring through the overall study. This will be a descriptive analysis reporting overall number and frequencies of the item´s points score, AEs, SAEs, and SUSARs in patients taking nabilone. Separate summaries of AEs in regard of severity and relationship to the study drug, separate summaries of AEs leading to withdrawal from the study and separate summaries for SAEs will be provided. Tolerability measures will be provided in a descriptive analysis and will include the number of patients who discontinued from the study (%) and the number of patients who discontinued from the study due to an AE (%). Safety measures include vital signs i ncluding performance of active orthostatism, the hallucination item (1.2, 0 – 4 points) of MDS -UPDRS Part I, the orthostatic hypotension item (1.12, 0 – 4 points) of MDS -UPDRS Part I, the Daytime sleepiness item (1.8, 0 – 4 points) of MDS -UPDRS Part I, and the C -SSRS. All patients will therefore be questioned about the occurrence of an AE at each scheduled and unscheduled on -site visit or telephone visit. Vitals signs including performance of active orthostatism will be taken at any scheduled visit on-site. (see 7.2) In the latter the heart rate and blood pressure of the patient will be measured after 10 minutes of quiet resting in a supine position and at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 minutes - time points of active standing."

Mean and standard d eviation for the descriptive analysis will also be provided. P-values f or the change of the results will be given . The secondary efficacy criteria will be measured as the change in all clinical scales and questionnaires between V 1 and month 6, except for the MMSE and the MoCA . The changes of these scales will be measured as the change between the Screening Visit of the randomized placebo -controlled , double -blind, parallel -group, enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal study and the month 6 visit (V 3) of this study.For the study’s secondary efficacy analyses, mean changes from V 1 (or the Screening Visit of the NMS -Nab study for MMSE and MoCA) to the 6 month s visit will be analyzed by Wilcoxon matched -pairs test. ( 49) For all analyses, statistical significance will be set at the 2 -sided 5% level. To estimate the treatment effect, we will then compare mean change from V 1 to month 6 visit using a nalysis of covariance, with value at V 1 as covariate and the treatment group as main effect. Because an interpolation of data will not be performed in case of a drop -out, the primar y analysis is a per -protocol analysi s. Moreover, sensitivity to treatment will be assessed using effect sizes of the different outcome variables when using nabilone to treat non -motor symptoms in Parkinson´s disease. For CGI -I analyses, distributions of aggregated ratings (amelioration, aggrav ation) after 6 months will be analyzed with the Wilcoxon matched -pairs test.

Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or endorsed by the Sponsor will comply with ICH -GCP guidelines and local legal requirements to ensure acceptability of the study data and patient´s safety . 13.1 Qualifications The Sponsor is responsible f or selecting the investigator and Institution . Each investigator should be qualified by training and experience and should have adequate resources. Each individual involved in conducting a trial should be qualified by education, training and experience to perform his or her respective task(s) (see ICH GCP E6). To meet those objectives, every member of the study team must be GCP -trained. A Certificate of MDS -UPDRS Training, a C -SSRS Training Certificate, and experience in using the other scales (e.g. MMSE) must be provided by every investigator in the trial who intends to use these scales. The members of th e study team must be trained on the trial´s protocol and the completion of the source data entry (CRF and patient´s record) by the principal investigator or an authorized designee . This process has to be documented in the ISF. Authorization of a member of the study team to perform study related tasks have to be reported in the Delegation Log of the ISF. 13.2 Monitoring A study monitor will perform source document verification at regular intervals in accordance with GCP and ICH guidelin es. The objectives of the monitoring procedures are to ensure that the trial subject’s safety and rights as a study participant are respected, that accurate, valid and complete data are collected , used, and stored , and that the trial is conducted in accordance to the trial protocol , the principles of GCP and local legislation. All investigators agree that the monitor regularly visits the trial site . For monitoring, all study - related documents must be given access to the monitor by the investigator for confirmation of data. Moreover, the investigators assure that the Monitor will receive appropriate support in their activities at the trial site, as agreed in separate contracts. The Informed Consent Form (ICF) includes a statement that the Monitor has the right – while observing the p rovisions of data protection legislation – to compare CRFs with the trial subject’s medical records (doctor’s notes etc.)."

All representatives from regulatory authorities and the EC/IRB will be gained access to the study -related documents needed for their investigation. Protection of the patient´s personal data will be guaranteed to the extent possible. 13.3 Audits and Inspections During the course of a s tudy, a Quality Assurance audit or inspection can be performed by regulatory authorities, the ethics committees, or the Sponsor’s delegates . Therefore, the investigator has to grant direct access to all data and must provide support at all times. The aim o f an audit is to verify the validity, accuracy and completeness of data, to establish the credibility of the clinical trial, and to check whether the trial subject’s rights and trial subject safety are being maintained. The Sponsor may assign these activit ies to persons otherwise not involved in the trial (Auditors). These persons are allowed access to all trial documentation (especially the tria l protocol, CRFs, trial subject´s medical records, drug accountability documentation, and trial -related correspon dence). After each external audit an audit -certificate by the Audi tor has to be delivered to the investigator. This certificate has to be kept in the ISF to evidence the audit to the regulatory authorities in the case of an inspection by them. The audit -report is delivered to the Sponsor of the study. An audit -certificate will be attached to the final report at the end of the study. Additionally, according to the Austrian Medicines Law (AMG) audits and inspections by regulatory authorities may be performed.

Written approva l of the study, the protocol, the Informed Consent Form (ICF), all questionnaires, and all other relevant study documentation must be obtained before the first patient will be screened and the study drug is released to the investigator. Any necessary extensions or renewals of EC/IRB approval must be obtained for changes to the study such as amendments to the protocol, the ICF or other study documentation. The written approval of the EC/IRB together with the approved ICF must be filed in the study files . The investigator will report promptly to the EC/IRB any new information that may adversly affect the safety of the participants or the conduct of the study. The investigator will submit written summaries of the study statu s to the EC/IRB as required. On completion of the study, the EC/IRB will be notified that the study has ended. End of the study is the time when the last visit of the last patient has been performed (LPLV) . Regulatory Authorities All relevant s tudy documentation will be submitted to the regulatory authorities according to local/nation al requirements, for review and approval before initiating the study. On behalf of the AMG in Austri a, the Sponsor of the clinical t rial submits the application to the competent ethics c ommittee (EC) and the competent authority (CA). The CA reviews only the justification for and the relevance of the Clinical Trial. The EC acts as the “expert reviewer” for the CA and decides within 35 days, with only one “clockstop” possible to obtain supp lementary information. If the EC vote is negative, the CA issues a legal document (“Bescheid”) prohibiting the clinical trial."

Informed Consent The process of obtaining informed consent must be in accordance with applicable regulatory requirement(s) and must adhere to GCP. No subject will undergo any study related examination or activity in the responsibility of the investigator before he/she has give n written informed consent to participate in the study. The inve stigator or designee explains orally and in writing manner the nature, the duration, the importance, the relevance, the purpose of the study, the consequences, and the action of the drug in su ch a manner that the patient and a study partner (if applicable) are aware of potential risks, inconveniences, and adverse events of the study and the study drug. I t should also be straightened out that the subject is free to choose to take part in the stu dy or to withdraw from participation without consequences for his/her further care. The patient should be given the opportunity to ask fo r clarification of any points he/she does not understand and, if necessary, ask for more informatio n. At the end of the interview, the subject will be given ample time to consider his/her participation in the stud y. Subjects and the investigator will be required to sign and date the ICF. After signatures are obtained, th e ICF will be kept and archived by the investigator in the investigator’s site file. A signed and dated cop y of the Patient Information and Informed Consent Form will be provided to the patient. If new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to co ntinue participation in the study, a new I CF will be approved by the EC/IRB (and regulatory authorities, if required). The study subjects will be informed about this new information and re -consent will be obtained. Risks and Benefits Benefits: The patients participating in the study will receive specialized care and regular clinical monitoring. The results of this trial will be useful to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and effect s of nabilone on non -motor symptoms in PD. Moreover, ma nagement of NMS are an important area of unmet need in PD. Due to the overall impact of NMS in PD and based on the influence of the endocannabinoid system on NMS in broad manner in PD , we perform this trial of nabilone in PD patients. Hopefully, a symptoma tic improvement of the patient´s clinical condition could be achieved. Risks: Disadvantages of participation could be the additional time spent in the hospital, currently unknown risks of the study drug therapy, or allergies to components of the IMP the patient is unaware at inclusion in the study. Treatment care in the study population will not be affected by the trial because nabilone will be used as an add -on therapy ."
102,page_102,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 103/109 Generally, nabilone is well tolerated . In this trial we will only include patients that participated in the NMS -Nab Study and had no drug-related SAE or moderate or severe AE. Therefore, the risk of allergic reactions to components and SAEs related to the drug are minimized. Common adverse reactions (1/100 to <1/10) observed in patients are somnolence, vertigo, euphoria, ataxia, impaired vision, difficulties to concentrate, sleep disturbances, dysphoria, a headache , hypotonia, nausea , and a dry mouth. Controlled trials with patients taking nabilone showed that at least one side effect occurred per subject. Most patients develop a tolerance in regard of adverse events concerning the CNS and therefore somnolence and euphoria reside after some weeks. This effect is reversible. The potential to caus e mental addiction is unknown and no patient has shown withdrawal symptoms in clinical trials. Minor risks of nabilone ( 1/10.000 to <1/1.000) include confusion, disorientation, hallucination, psychosis, depression, difficulties in coordination, tremor, loss of appetite, anxiety, depersonalisation, tachycardia , and abdominal pain. All AEs will be rapidly detected by close clinical monitoring . In case of an AE the patient should be followed up until he/she has recovered/ it has resolved, has reached a stable state, the investigator determines that it is no longer clinically significant, or the patient is lost to follow up. Study treatment will b e stopped in the discretion of the investigator and appropriate measurements, reporting, and visits on -site will be performed. These controlled risks must be balanced against the prospect of identifying a new therapeutic option for non -motor symptoms in PD. All patients are not naïve to the investigational treatment. There are no known risks in relation to the Eye -tracking analysis. 17.3 Patient Insurance During their participation in the clinical trial the patients will be insured as defi ned by legal requirements. The S ponsor is providing insurance in order to indemnify (legal and financial coverage) the investigator/trial center against claims arising from the study, except for claims that arise from malpractice and/or negligence. The compensation of the subject in the event of study -related injuries will comply with the applicable regulations. This insurance covers for damage to research subjects through injury or death caused by the study. The insurance applies to the damage that becomes apparent dur ing the study. 17.4 Data Protection and Confidentiality All local legal requirements regarding data protection will be adhered to. All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The investigator and members of the"
103,page_103,"Clinical Study Protocol Version 1. 3, 04.June . 201 9 Page 104/109 research team must not disclose any information without prior written approval from the Sponsor. The pseudonymity of patients participating must be maintained. Throughout documentation and evaluation, the patients will be identified on CRFs and other documents by an ascending number according to their order of screening . Documents that identify the patient personally (e.g., the signed informed consent, patient identification list , patient´s record ) must be m aintained in confidence by the i nvestigator. The patients will be informe d in the ICF that all s tudy findings will be stored in a locked cabinet and on computer and handled in strictest confidence. 17.5 Discontinuation of the Study by the Sponsor The Sponsor or its representative is authorized to temporary hold or discontinue the st udy for any reason and at any time decided. The investigator/S ponsor will notify the accredited EC/IRB of the end of the study (LPLV) . The S ponsor or its representative will notify the EC/IRB immediately of a temporary halt of the study, including the reason of such an action. In case the study is ended prematurely, the Sponsor or its designee will notify the accredited EC/IRB within 15 days, including the reasons for the premature termination."
