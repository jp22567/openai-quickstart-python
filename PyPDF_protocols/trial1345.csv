INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study Lung cancer has been the most common cancer in the world for several decades, with an estimated 1.8 million new cases in 2012 (12.9% of all new cancers), and was also the most common cause of death from cancer in 2012, with 1.59 million deaths (19.4% of the total cancer deaths; GLOBOCAN 2012) . Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 80% to 85% of all lung cancers. Unfortunately, at the time of diagnosis, approximately 70% of patients with NSCLC already have advanced or metastatic disease not amenable to surgical resection. Furthermore, a significant percentage of patients with early-stage NSCLC who have undergone surgery subsequently develop distant recurrence and die as a result of their lung cancer (Pisters and LeChevalier 2005) . Despite advances in the diagnosis, imaging, staging, and treatment of NSCLC, the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) for patients in Europe and the United States (US) continues to be low (11% and 17%, respectively; D’Addario et al 2010, Howlander et al 2014) . Patients presenting with advanced NSCLC have a median OS of 10 to 12 months ( Bonomi 2010) . Patients without a targetable mutation (ie, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] or anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] mutation) demonstrate responses to systemic treatment of approximately 20% to 30% and progression-free survival (PFS) of 4 to 5 months (Sandler et al 2006, Scagliotti et al 2008, Schiller et al 2002) . The duration of responses (DoRs) is also limited, and toxicities can be a major limiting factor. Th e 1-year survival rate is 30% to 40% for patients with a good performance status. Common first-line treatment regimens for advanced NSCLC in major global markets are typically platinum-based doublets and include carboplatin and paclitaxel (eg, nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab] paclitaxel [Abraxane ®]), carboplatin and gemcitabine (squamous only), carboplatin and pemetrexed (non-squamous only), cisplatin and gemcitabine (squamous only), and cisplatin and pemetrexed (non-squamous only). Maintenance therapy, with either continuation or switch, has also been recommended for certain histologic subtypes of NSCLC; for example, maintenance with pemetrexed has been shown to improve OS and PFS, particularly in non-squamous histologies (Ciuleanu et al 2009, Paz-Ares et al 2013) . Although platinum-based doublets are interchangeable in terms of efficacy when used alone, these doublets vary to some extent with regard to convenience, associated toxicities, and cost, with the selection of a specific regimen often dictated by local practice and individualized on a case-by-case basis. Recently, pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC in patients with high programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L 1) expression and without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Regulatory approval was based on safety and efficacy data from the KEYNOTE-024 study. Results from the KEYNOTE-024 study, which included patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells (TC) and with no activating EGFR mutations or ALK fusions, demonstrated that patients treated with pembrolizumab had longer PFS (10.3 versus 6.0 mont hs) and OS (hazard ratio [HR] for death,"

The KEYNOTE-021 21G cohort is an expansion cohort of a Phase I/II study that compared the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed to carboplatin and pemetrexed alone as first-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC of non-squamous histology. Patients who were treated with first-line pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy had higher ORR (55%) compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone (29%) (Langer et al 2016) . Both of these studies have shown that pembrolizumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy can be an effective first-line treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC. 1.1.1 Immunotherapies It is increasingly understood that cancers are recognized by the immune system, and, under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors (Dunn et al 2004) . PD-L1 is part of a complex system of receptors and ligands that are involved in controlling T-cell activation. The PD-1 receptor (CD279) is expressed on the surface of activated T cells (Keir et al 2008) . It has 2 known ligands: PD-L1 (B7 H1; CD274) and PD-L2 (B7 DC; CD273) (Okazaki and Honjo 2007) . The PD-1 and PD-L1/PD-L2 belong to the family of immune checkpoint proteins that act as co inhibitory factors, which can halt or limit the development of T cell response. When PD-L1 binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signal is transmitted into the T cell, which reduces cytokine production and suppresses T cell proliferation. Tumor cells exploit this immune checkpoint pathway as a mechanism to evade detection and inhibit immune response. PD-L1 is constitutively expressed by B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Qin et al 2016) . Importantly, PD-L1 is commonly over expressed on tumor cells or on non transformed cells in the tumor microenvironment (Pardoll 2012) . PD-L1 expressed on the tumor cells binds to PD-1 receptors on th e activated T cells leading to the inhibition of cytotoxic T cells. These deactivated T cells remain inhibited in the tumor microenvironment. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway represents an adaptive immune resistance mechanism that is exerted by tumor cells in response to endogenous antitumor activity. The inhibitory mechanism described above is co-opted by tumors that express PD-L1 as a way of evading immune detection and elimination. The binding of an anti-PD-L1 agent to the PD-L1 receptor inhibits the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 and CD80 receptors expressed on ICs. This activity overcomes PD-L1-mediated inhibition of antitumor immunity. While functional blockade of PD-L1 results in T-cell reactivation, this mechanism of action is different from direct agonism of a st imulatory receptor such as CD28. PD-L1 is expressed in a broad range of cancers with a high frequency, up to 88% in some types of cancers. Based on these findings, an anti-PD-L1 antibody could be used therapeutically to enhance antitumor immune responses in patients with cancer. Results of non-clinical and clinical studies of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the PD-L1/PD-1"

In addition, a high mutational burden (eg, in bladder carcinoma) (Alexandrov et al 2013) may contribute to the responses seen with immune therapy. In contrast, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is constitutively expressed by regulatory T cells and upregulated on activated T cells. CTLA-4 delivers a negative regulatory signal to T cells upon binding of CD80 (B7.1) or CD86 (B7.2) ligands on antigen-presenting cells ( FDA Guidance 2011, Fife and Bluestone 2008) . A block of CTLA-4 binding to CD80/86 by anti-CTLA-4 antibodies results in markedly enhanced T-cell activation and antitumor activity in animal models, including killing of established murine solid tumors and induction of protective antitumor immunity. Ther efore, it is expected that treatment with an anti CTLA-4 antibody will lead to increased activation of the human immune system, increasing antitumor activity in patients with solid tumors. Pre-clinical data have now been added with a wealth of clinical data showing that blockade of negative regulatory signals to T-cells such as CTLA-4 and PD-L1 has promising clinical activity. Ipilimu mab was granted US FDA approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently under investigation for several other malignancies, while nivolumab and pembrolizumab, 2 anti-PD-1 agents, and atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 agent, have been granted approvals by agencies such as the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency approval for the treatment of a number of malignancies including metastatic melanoma, squamous and non-squamous cell NSCLC, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and urothelial carcinoma. In addition, there are data from agents in the anti- PD-1/PD-L1 class showing clinical activity in a wide range of tumor types. 1.1.2 Durvalumab Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a human mAb of the immunoglobulin G (Ig) G1 kappa subclass that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 (but not programmed cell death ligand 2 [PD-L2]) with PD-1 on T cells and CD80 (B7.1) on immune cells (ICs). It is being developed by AstraZeneca/MedImmune for use in the treatment of cancer (MedImmune is a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca/MedImmune will be referred to as AstraZeneca throughout this document). The proposed mechanism of action (MOA) for durvalumab is interference in the interaction of PD-L1 with PD -1 and CD80 (B7.1). Blockade of PD-L1/PD- 1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition of immune responses, including those that may result in tumor elimination. In vitro studies demonstrate that durvalumab antagonizes the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 on primary human T cells resulting in the restored proliferation of IFN- γ (Stewart et al 2015) . In vivo studies have shown that durvalumab inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models via a T cell dependent mechanism (Stewart et al 2015) . Based on these data, durvalumab is expected to stimulate the patient’s antitumor immune response by binding to PD-L 1 and shifting the balance toward an antitumor"

Durvalumab has been engineered to reduce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. To date, durvalumab has been given to more than 6000 patients as part of ongoing studies either as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer agents. Details on the safety profile of durvalumab monotherapy are summarized in Section 1.2.1.3 and Section 6.5. Refer to the current durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for a complete summary of non- clinical and clinical information including sa fety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics. 1.1.3 Trem elimumab Tremelimumab (MEDI1123, formerly CP-675,206) is a human Ig G2 mAb that is directed against CTLA-4 (cluster of differentiation [CD]152), a cell surface receptor that is expressed primarily on activated T cells and acts to inhibit their activation. Tremelimumab completely blocks the interaction of human CTLA-4 with CD80 and CD86, resulting in increased release of cytokines (interleukin-2 and IFN- γ) from human T cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and whole blood (Tarhini and Kirkwood 2008) . Tremelimumab is being developed by AstraZeneca for use in the treatment of cancer. To date, tremelimumab has been given to more than 1500 patients as part of ongoing studies either as monotherapy or in combination wi th anticancer agents other than durvalumab. Details on the safety profile of tremelimumab monotherapy are summarized in Section 1.3.2.2. Refer to the current tremelimumab Investigator’s Brochure for a complete summary of non-clinical and clinical information including safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics. 1.1.4 Durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab Because the mechanisms of action of CTLA-4 and PD-1 are non-redundant, targeting both PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways may have additive or synergistic activity (Pardoll 2012) ; therefore, in addition to evaluating both agen ts in the monotherapy setting in a number of cancer indications, AstraZeneca is also investigating the use of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy for the treatment of cancer. Study D4190C00006 is a Phase Ib dose-escalation study to establish the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. The study is ongoing and continues to accrue. In addition, other clinical studies have since started looking at the combination in both NSCLC and other oncology indications. To date, more than 3000 patients have received the combination using a number of doses and dosing schedules.

Systemic chemotherapy is associated with significant side effects, including neutropenia, nausea, vomiting and dehydration, and alopecia (Sandler et al 2006, Scagliotti et al 2008) . Recent progress in immunotherapy for first-line NSCLC has been mixed. While previously untreated patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells (PD-L1 TC ≥50%) NSCLC receiving the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab had a 44.8% response rate and median PFS of 10.3 months ( Reck et al 2016) , nivolumab failed to meet its primary endpoint of PFS in a similar population ( Socinski et al 2016) . These facts indicate that there is still a significant unmet medical need for additional treatment op tions for use in this patient population. In addition, patients with NSCLC may be partic ularly susceptible to these immunotherapies given the high mutational burden of this disease. Novel therapies are urgently needed to improve clinical outcomes, irrespective of PD-L1 status. 1.1.5.1 Rationale for the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab with chemotherapy Non-clinical and clinical studies have indicated that blockade of immune checkpoints (PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) can have a positive effect on antitumor immunity. One potential strategy is to combine these non-redundant and potential synergistic single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors, thereby producing an additive improvement in tumor response (Larkin et al 2015, Pisters and LeChevalier 2005, Postow et al 2015) . The use of combination chemotherapy is a mainstay of oncology therapy. The goal of combination chemotherapy is to utilize agents that affect cancer cells by different mechanisms, thus reducing the risk of developing resistance. Current studies are now adding immunotherapeutics to chemotherapeutics to broaden antitumor responses. Checkpoint inhibitors have been tested in NSCLC, either used alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Preliminary efficacy data fro m Study D4190C00006 have demonstrated that durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy is clinically active and w ell tolerated. As of 1 June 2015, in 63 patients with at least 24 weeks of follow-up, 17% achieved objective response and disease control at 24 weeks is 29%. Responses in both patients with PD-L1 TC≥25% and those with PD-L1 TC <25% demonstrated evidence of clinical activity. Investigator-reported confirmed objective responses were achieved by 23% of patients in the combined tremelimumab 1 mg/kg cohort, including 22% of patients with PD-L1 TC ≥25% and 29% of patients with PD-L1 TC <25% (Antonia et al 2016a) .

The antitumor activity of first-line nivolumab in combination with platinum doublets appeared highly promisi ng, and the safety profile of nivolumab in combination with either ipilimumab or with chemotherapy was tolerable (Sections 1.3.1.2 and 1.3.1.3, respectively). The safety and efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy have also been demonstrated across multiple tumor types. Data for durvalumab ± tremelimumab with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced cancers are being generated from 2 ongoing Phase I studies: the internal Study D419SC00001 (n=6) and a Phase Ib study (NCT02537418) run by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG; n=111 as of an October 2016 cut-off). The combinations tested are tolerable and toxicities manageable; details on the safety profile found in these studies are summarized in Sections 1.2.2 and 1.3.2.5. Preliminary results from the CCTG study were presented for the NSCLC cohorts at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2016 meeting; the overall ORR in NSCLC cohort (n=26) was 61.5%. In addition, KEYNOTE-021 is a multi-cohort Ph ase I/II study comparing pembrolizumab in combination with various chemotherapy regimens to chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment for NSCLC. In the cohort of patients receiving pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed), the objective response was 55% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 42 to 68) compared with 29% (95% CI: 18 to 41) in patients receiving chemotherapy (carboplatin a nd pemetrexed) alone. Objective response was significantly improved in patients receiving pembrolizumab with chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone (estimated treatment difference 26% [95% CI: 9% to 42%]; p=0.0016). In patients receiving pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, the response rate was 57% (95% CI: 34 to 79) in patients who had a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of less than 1% and was 54% (95% CI: 37 to 70) in patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of ≥1%. In patients receiving pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, median time to response was 1.5 months compared with 2.7 months in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Kaplan- Meier estimates of response duration of at least 6 months were 92% (95% CI: 73 to 98) in the pembrolizumab with chemotherapy group and 81% (95% CI: 51 to 93) in the chemotherapy alone group. In patients receiving pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, the most common Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were anemia (12%); decreased neutrophil count (5%); and acute kidney injury, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, neutropenia, sepsis, and thrombocytopenia (3% each). Additional results on tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy are discussed in Section 1.3.2.5 (Langer et al 2016) . In addition to these completed studies, a number of studies of immunotherapies in combination with chemotherapy in first-line NSCLC are ongoing. These include CheckMate 227 (nivolumab plus platinum doublet in PD-L1-negative NSCLC; NCT02477826); KEYNOTE-189 (pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed in non-squamous NSCLC; NCT02578680); KEYNOTE-407 (carboplatin and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel with or without pembrolizumab in first-line metastatic NSCLC; NCT02775435); and IMpower 130, IMpower 131, and IMpower 150 (atezolizumab plus carboplatin,"

In summary, the preliminary efficacy, safe ty, and tolerability data of durvalumab ± tremelimumab generated to date, together with early positive signals with other immunotherapies in combination with chemotherapy, support the continued development of these treatments in combination with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy in NSCLC. 1.2 Rationale for study design, doses, and control groups This study will utilize an open-label design due to the different treatment administration schedules and treatment durations. 1.2.1 Durvalumab and tremelim umab dose and treatment regimen justification 1.2.1.1 Durvalumab+ tremelimumab combination therapy dose rationale The durvalumab + tremelimumab combination ther apy doses and regimen selected for this study are based on the goal of selecting an optimal combination dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab that would yield sustained target suppression (PD-L1 and CTLA-4, respectively), demonstrate promising efficacy, and have an acceptable safety profile. Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics data Study D4190C00006 included dose cohorts with both a schedule of durvalumab in combination with a schedule of tremelimumab. The schedule was included to align with the dosing of tremelimumab. PK simulations from durvalumab monotherapy data indicated that a similar area under the serum drug concentration-time curve at steady state (AUC ss; 4 weeks) was expected following both dosing with durvalumab. The observed durvalumab PK data from the Study D4190C00006 were in line with the predict ed monotherapy PK data developed pre- clinically and in line with that seen in the first-time-in-human, single-agent study (CD-ON-durvalumab-1108) in patients with advanced solid tumors. This demonstrates similar exposure of durvalumab with no alterations in PK when durvalumab and tremelimumab (doses ranging from are dosed together. While the median maximum serum concentration at steady state (C max,ss) is expected to be higher with (approximately 1.5-fold) and median trough concentration at steady state (Ctrough,ss ) is expected to be higher with (approximately 1.25-fold), this is not expected to impact the overall safety and e fficacy profile, based on existing pre-clinical and clinical data. Monotonic increases in pharmacodynamic activity were observed with increasing doses of tremelimumab relative to the activity observed in patients treated with durvalumab monotherapy. There was evidence of augmented pharmacodynamic activity relative to durvalumab monotherapy with combination doses containing tremelimumab, including both the durvalumab + tremelimumab combinations.CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI"

Patients treated with doses of tremelimumab above 1 mg/kg had a higher rate of AEs, including discontinuations due to AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and severe AEs. Between the durvalumab + tremelimumab and durvalumab + tremelimumab cohorts treated at the schedule, the number of patients reporting any AE, Grade ≥3 AEs, SAEs, and treatment-related AEs was higher in the durvalumab + tremelimumab cohort than the durvalumab + tremelimumab cohort. A similar pattern was noted in the regimens, suggesting that, as the dose of tremelimumab increased above a higher rate of treatment-related events may be anticipated. Further, the SAEs frequently attributed to immunotherapy, pneumonitis, colitis, and other immune mediated events, were more commonly seen in cohorts using either of tremelimumab compared to the dose cohorts. Together, these data suggest that a combination using a tremelimumab dose of appeared to minimize the rate of toxicity when combined with durvalumab. As a result, all combination doses utilizing either the doses of tremelimumab were eliminated in the final dose selection. In contrast, cohorts assessing higher doses of durvalumab with a constant dose of tremelimumab did not show an increase in the rate of AEs. The data suggested that increasing doses of durvalumab may not impact the safety of the combination as much as the tremelimumab dose. Further, safety data between the cohorts were similar, with no change in safety events with increasing dose of durvalumab. In Study D4190C00006, of all treatment cohorts, the cohort of patients treated in the durvalumab + tremelimumab group had a tolerable safety profile but still showed strong evidence of clinical activity. No dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were re ported in this cohort. Preliminary clinical activity of the durvalumab and tremelimumab combination did not appear to change with increasing doses of tremelimumab. The durvalumab cohorts demonstrated objective responses at all doses of tremelimumab, and increasing doses of tremelimumab did not provide deeper or more rapid responses. Efficacy data suggested that the durvalumab + tremelimumab dose cohort may demonstrate equivalent clinical activity to those of other dose combinations. Altogether, the data suggested that a durvalumab + tremelimumab dose combination should be selected for further development.CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI"

Furthermore, the survival curve in this population reached a plateau at 3 years and was maintained through 10 years of follow-up (Sandler et al 2006, Schadendorf et al 2013) . Data from Study D4190C00006 (Phase I trial in NSCLC patients using the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab) also show an approximately dose-proportiona l increase in PK exposure for durvalumab over the dose range of durvalumab or (For further information on PK observations in Study D4190C00006, please see the current IB). The observed durvalumab PK data from the combination study were well in line with the predicted monotherapy PK data (5thmedian and 95thpercentiles) for a regimen. The durvalumab + tremelimumab combination regimen will be administered for 4 doses q3w in combination with chemotherapy followed by durvalumab monotherapy q4w until disease progression or unless other specific discontinuation criteria are met. One additional combination dose will be administered post-chemotherapy (see Section 1.2.2) . This is to account for the possibility that the ability of T cells to respond to tremelimumab may be dampened in the presence of cytotoxic chemotherapy. 1.2.1.3 Durvalumab monotherapy dose rationale A durvalumab dose of is supported by in-vitro data, non-clinical activity, clinical PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, and ac tivity data from St udy 1108 in patients with advanced solid tumors and from a Phase I study performed in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumor (D4190C00002). PK/pharmacodynamic data Based on available PK/pharmacodynamic data from ongoing Study 1108 with doses ranging from durvalumab exhibited non-linear (dose-dependent) PK consistent with target-mediated drug disposition. The PK approached linearity at suggesting near-complete target saturation (membrane-bound and soluble programmed cell death ligand 1 [sPD-L1]), and further shows that the durvalumab dosing frequency can be adapted to a particu lar regimen given the linearity seen at doses higher than The expected half-life with doses is approximately 21 days.

(For further in formation on immunogenicity, please see the current IB.) A population PK model was developed using the data from Study 1108 (doses (Fairman et al 2014) . Multiple simulations indicate that a similar overall exposure is expected following both regimens, as represented by AUC ss(4 weeks). Median C max,ss is expected to be higher with (~1.5-fold) and median C trough,ss is expected to be higher with (~1.25-fold). Clinical activity with the dosing regimen is anticipated to be consistent with with the proposed similar dose of expected to (a) achieve complete target saturation in majority of patients; (b) account for anticipated variability in PK, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity in diverse cancer populations; (c) maintain sufficient PK exposure in case of anti-drug antibody (ADA) impact; and (d) achieve PK exposure that yielded maximal antitumor activity in animal models. Given the similar area under the serum drug concentration-time curve (AUC) and modest differences in median peak and trough levels at steady state, the observation that both regimens maintain complete sPD-L1 suppression at trough, and the available clinical data, the regimens are expected to have similar efficacy and safety profiles, supporting further development with a dose of Clinical data Refer to the current durvalumab IB for a complete summary of clinical information including safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics at the regimen. 1.2.1.4 Rationale for fixed dosing A population PK model was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data from a Phase I study (Study 1108; N=292; doses solid tumors). Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of body weight on the PK of durvalumab (coefficient of ≤0.5). The impact of body weight-based and fixed dosing of durvalumab was evaluate d by comparing predicted steady-state PK concentrations (5th, median, and 95th percentiles) using the population PK model. A fixed dose of was selected to approximate (based on median body weight of ~75 kg). A total of 1000 patients were simulated using body weight distribution of 40 to 120 kg. Simulation results demonstrate that body weight-based and fixed dosing regimens yield similar median steady-state PK concentrations with slightly less overall between-patient variability with fixed dosing regimen. Similarly, a population PK model was developed for tremelimumab using data from Phase I through Phase III (N=654; doses metastatic melanoma) (Wang et al 2014) .

Similar to durvalumab, simulations indicated that both body weight-based and fixed dosing regimens of tremelimumab yield similar med ian steady- state PK concentrations with slightly less between-patient var iability with fixed dosing regimen. Similar findings have been reported by others (NCCN 2014, Ng et al 2006, Wang et al 2009, Zhang et al 2012, Narwal et al 2013) . Wang and colleagues investigated 12 mAbs and found that fixed and body size-based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies (Wang et al 2009) . In addition, they investigated 18 therapeutic proteins and peptides and showed that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing the between-patient variability in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters (Zhang et al 2012) . 1.2.2 Rationale for proposed Phase III dose and schedule The proposed dosing schedule is aligned with the standard fixed dosing of durvalumab + tremelimumab for followed by durvalumab monotherapy which is supported by efficacy and safety as well as tolerability data across multiple studies in multiple tumor types. To conform to the chemotherapy schedule in the study, we propose to use standard durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy dose and ratio at a dosing interval for the rather than the standard schedule. The safety of a dosing schedule in combination with chemotherapy has been explored in the ongoing Study D419SC00001 (described belo w), where tremelimumab is administered at in combination with durvalumab followed by durvalumab The combination has been declared tolerable and manageable (see below for more detail). The dose of durvalumab is the equivalent of the standard dose. The tremelimumab dose was not lowered proportionally to because is the lowest tested biologically effective dose. In this study, AstraZeneca proposes to use the Phase III fixed dose of durvalumab, so this study will combine 75 mg tr emelimumab with 1500 mg durvalumab q3w in combination with chemotherapy. The relative increase in dose density of durvalumab (ie, 1500 mg q3w instead of is supported by the fact that toxicities attributable to durvalumab do not appear dose dependent, and PK modeling reveals no meaningful differences in drug levels between dosing. After chemotherapy, the dose will be 1500 mg durvalumab q4w. Study BR.34 is a Phase II randomized trial of durvalumab and tremelimumab ± platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic (Stage IV) squamous or non-squamous NSCLC. Both Study BR.34 and the CCTG (NCT02537418) described below are assessing tremelimumab with durvalumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI"

AstraZeneca Phase I study (D419SC00001) This Phase I open-label study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy in combination with first-line chemotherapy regimens in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The tumor types originally included ovarian/peritoneal/fallopian tube cancer, SCCHN, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer. As of 6 December 2016, 6 patients with SCLC had completed of treatment with durvalumab + tremelimumab given concurrently with carboplatin AUC and etoposide followed by durvalumab monotherapy No DLT was reported during th e first cycle of treatment (a 21-day period). One patient developed Grade 4 hepatitis with elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl tr ansferase at Cycle 5 Day 1. Although the onset of this event was 1 day after the protoc ol-defined DLT period of 4 cycles, it was considered as a DLT following discussion with the Investigator. The liver enzymes were normalized with in 16 days after steroid use and was confirmed as not a Hy’s law case. As there was only 1 DLT reported in 6 patients, the safety profile of this combination with chemotherapy at the q3w schedule is declared tolerable and manageable. Additional details on safety are provided in Section 1.3.2.5. CCTG study (NCT02537418) This is an ongoing multi-center, Phase I study of single or double immunotherapy (durvalumab ± tremelimumab) in combination with multiple standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens in patients with incurable advanced or metastatic cancer and is sponsored and conducted by the CCTG. Chemotherapy regimens assessed in the study include cisplatin + pemetrexed, cisplatin + gemcitabine, cisplatin + etoposide, carboplatin + pemetrexed, carboplatin + gemcitabine, nab-p aclitaxel + carboplatin, and etoposide + carboplatin at standard doses for each regimen. The dose escalation and dose regimen are outlined below (Figure 2) . Another dose level (DL3, durvalumab + tremelimumab [maximum 6 doses of tremelimumab] with chemotherapy) was added after the protocol was initiated. A total of 4 dose levels of durvalumab ± tremelimumab are being assessed.CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI"

SCLC patients enrolled into the etoposide- carboplatin cohorts started immuno-oncology (IO ) treatment in Cycle 3 of chemotherapy; all other chemotherapy regimens assessed the IO combination starting at Cycle 1. Overall, toxicities related to the chemotherapy core regimen appeared as expected in severity and frequency (see Section 1.3.2.5 for more detail on the safety profile from this study). Overall, across all dose levels, there was no clear dose dependency in any of the reported AEs, and there was no DLT reported per protocol-defined criteria (DLT period of 21 days). Toxicities related to durvalumab and tremelimumab were also those expected for these agents, although a number of potential IO-related toxicities such as diarrhea, skin rash, hepatic function changes, or pneumonitis were diff icult to differentiate from those reported from cytotoxic agents. As expected, there were more IO-related toxicities reported for dose levels containing tremelimumab. In general, all regimens were tolerable and toxicities were manageable at all dose levels. There was no discernible difference in the tolerability profile when IO treatment was administered in Cycle 1 (including SCLC patients) versus Cycle 3 of chemotherapy for SCLC patients only. In general, the overall safety profile from thes e 2 studies with regard to the IO+IO treatment appears to be consistent with available safe ty and tolerability data for durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab. PK modeling PK modeling and simulation have been conducted to evaluate the switch from q4w dosing to q3w dosing for both durvalumab and tremelimumab.

For durvalumab, median C maxfollowing the 5th dose of the regimen and the 4th dose of the regimen was 689 and 624 μg/mL, median trough concentration at Week 16 was 125 and 94.5 μg/mL, and AUC 0-16wk was 28726 and 22772 μg*day/mL for the schedule, respectively. Therefore, PK modeling suggests that a schedule does not impose a significant increased safety risk based on expected durvalumab and tremelimumab exposures. Taken together, the totality of data provides sufficient safety data to support the combination of durvalumab + tremelimumab with chemotherapy. There is supportive safety data for the combination of durvalumab + tremelimumab followed by durvalumab from Study D419SC00001. The safety of the combination of durvalumab plus tremelimumab with chemotherapy has been assessed in more than 100 patients in the CCTG Phase I study. Clinical data from NSCLC patients in Study 006 suggest that increasing the dose of durvalumab has no significant impact on the safety and tolerability of the durvalumab and tremelimumab combination. In addition, PK modeling data suggest that there will be a minimal impact on investigational product (IP) exposure if the standard doses are given on a regimen. Additional dose of tremelimumab Patients in Treatment Arm 1 will receive an additional dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab after chemotherapy at Week 16 if they tolera te the combination and complete all 4 doses of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy during chemotherapy. The rationale to have an additional dose of tremelimumab after chemotherapy is based on the possibility that chemotherapy may limit th e responsiveness of T cells to tremelimumab and that tremelimumab given after chemotherapy will help control rapid progression that is inherent to the clinical course of NSCLC, thereby sustaining the responses that may have been achieved during induction.CCI CCICCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI"

Patients in the SoC treatment arm will receive treatment determined by the Investigator, from the SoC agents approved for use in NSCLC in their local market, until progression per standard practice. The SoC options provided in this study include agents that are commonly used in advanced or metastatic NSCLC and allow sufficient flexibility for Investigators and patients to select the agents that reflect their normal clinical practice and national guidelines ( NCCN 2014, Reck et al 2014) . 1.2.4 Rationale for endpoints The dual primary aims of this study are to assess the efficacy of durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy compared with SoC chemotherapy alone in terms of PFS and OS in all patients. The key secondary aims of the study are to assess the efficacy of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy compared with SoC chemotherapy alone in terms of PFS and OS in all patients. PFS may serve as a surrogate endpoint for OS when differences between treatment arms are of sufficient magnitude and clinical importance (FDA Guidance 2011, Paz-Ares et al 2013, Pazdur 2008) . In certain settings, the utility of survival as an endpoint may potentially be confo unded by subsequent therapies. Specifically, there are a number of molecules that target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, including pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab th at are now available for the treatment of NSCLC. Access to these agents creates challenges in being able to fully characterize the effects of study treatment on OS if patients subsequently receive these immunotherapeutic agents. Secondary aims of the study also include evaluation of the efficacy endpoints OS, PFS and ORR in biomarker defined populations, to further evaluate the antitumor effect and survival benefit of durvalumab + tremelimumab + SoC chemotherapy compared with SoC chemotherapy alone in such biomarker s elected patient population. The biomarker defined populations are those patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB high detected in tumor tissue and/or ctDNA, cut-offs to be detailed in the SAP), those patients with PD-L1 expression on less than 50% of tumor cells (PD-L1 TC <50%), patients with PD L1 expression on less than 25% of tumor cells (PD L1 TC <25%) and patients with PD-L1 expression on less than 1% of tumor cells (PD-L1 TC <1%).

This comparison is not currently included in the multiplicity-controlled statistical testing procedure because the proposed study is not powered for the comparison. However, the treatment difference will be summarized descriptively to evaluate the relative benefit-risk difference between the 2 experimental treatment arms. Antitumor activity will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) guidelines. The interim and primary analysis of PFS will be based on programmatically derived PFS calculated from the tumor scan assessments according to RECIST 1.1 by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). Secondary efficacy endpoints of proportion of patients alive and progression free at 12 months from randomization (APF12), ORR, DoR, best objective response (BoR), and time from randomization to sec ond progression (PFS2) will be examined to further evaluate the antitumor effect and survival benefit of durvalumab ± tremelimumab + SoC chemotherapy compared with SoC chemotherapy alone in all patients. The secondary endpoints of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] 30-item Core Quality of Life Questionnaire, version 3 [QLQ-C30 v3], and the 13-item Lung Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [QLQ-LC13]) will show the overall influence of the benefits and toxicity of the treatment from the patient’s perspective and will aid in assessing of the benefit-risk evaluation. These PRO questionnaires are well-established instruments that have been previously included in lung cancer clinical studies. The PK and immunogenicity of durvalumab and tremelimumab are being examined to assess any potential impact on PK, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy parameters. 1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment The following sections include summaries of the potential benefits and risks associated with durvalumab and tremelimumab prior to the overall benefit-risk assessment. 1.3.1 Potential benefits 1.3.1.1 Durval umab The majority of the safety and efficacy data currently available for durvalumab are based on the first-in-human, single-agent study (Study 1108) in patients with advanced solid tumors and the study of durvalumab monotherapy in NSC LC (Study D4191C00003 [ATLANTIC]).

Data from treatme nt-naïve patients with NSCLC in this study (n=59) showed a favorable disease control rate (DCR) at ≥12 weeks of 56% when durvalumab was given 10 mg/kg q2w (Antonia et al 2016b) . In PD-L1 unselected patients, the ORR, based on Investigator’s assessment per RECIST 1.1, ranged from 0% in uveal melanoma to 20.0% in bladder cancer, and DCR at 24 weeks ranged from 4.2% in triple-negative breast cancer to 39.1% in advanced cutaneous melanoma. PD-L1 status was known for 383 of the 456 response evaluable patients. Across the PD-L1-positive tumors (defined as PD-L1 TC ≥25%), ORR was highest (>10%) for bladder cancer, advanced cutaneous melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (33.3% each); NSCLC (26.7%); and SCCHN (18.2%). Moreover, in the PD-L1-positive subset, DCR at 24 weeks was highest (>10%) in advanced cutaneous melanoma (66.7%), NSCLC (36.0%), hepatocellular carcinoma and bladder cancer (33.3% each), and SCCHN (18.2%). A total of 444 patients with locally adva nced or metastatic NSCLC were treated in ATLANTIC. As of the data cut-off of 03 June 2016, in Cohort 2 (EGFR/ALK wild type/unknown, PD-L1 expression on ≥25% of TCs), durvalumab monotherapy showed clinically meaningful activity based on ORR in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had received at least 2 prior systemic treatment regimens. The responses were numerically greater in the PD-L1 TC ≥25% group (16.4%) compared with the PD-L1 expression on less than 25% of tumor cells (PD-L1 TC <25%) group (7.5%). The DCR at 6 months was 28.8% in the PD-L1 TC ≥25% group and 20.4% in the PD-L1 TC <25% group. The median OS was 10.9 months in the PD-L1 TC ≥25% patients and 9.3 months in the PD-L1 TC <25% patients. For the PD-L1 TC ≥25% patients, the OS rate at 6 and 12 months was 67.4% and 47.7%, respectively. For the PD-L1 TC <25% patients, the OS rate at 6 and 12 months was 60.3% and 34.5%, respectively. Observed PFS was numerically longer in the PD-L1 TC ≥25% group compared with the PD-L1 TC <25% group. In Cohort 3 (EGFR/ALK wild type/unknown, PD-L1 expression on ≥90% of TCs [PD-L1 TC ≥90%]), the ORR was 30.9%. The DCR at 6 months was 38.2%. Observed PFS and OS were similar to PD-L1 TC ≥25% patients in Cohort 2. For patients with PD-L1 ≥90% in the combined Cohorts 2 and 3, the ORR was 23.2%. The DCR at 6 months was 34.1%. Observed PFS and OS were similar to PD-L1 TC ≥25% patients in Cohort 2. For patients who responded, the response was durable across various subgroups (median DoR of 12.3 months in the PD-L1 TC≥25% group in Cohort 2). In Cohort 2, 66.7% of responders in the PD-L1 TC ≥25% group had their first response at the time of the first on-treatment tumor assessment (Week 8). The median time to response was 1.9 months. In Cohort 1 (EGFR/ALK positive), the ORR was numerically lower than in the EGFR/ALK wild type/unknown cohorts. The responses were numerically greater in the PD-L1 TC ≥25% group (12.2%) compared with the PD-L1 TC <25% group (3.6%). The DCR at ≥6 months was 28.8% in the PD-L1 TC ≥25% group, 20.4% in the PD-L1 TC <25% group, and 38.2% in the PD-L1 TC ≥90% group.

As of 1 June 2015, 63 patients with at least 24 weeks of follow-up were evaluable for response across various durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy dose regimens. Of these, 11 patients (17%) had achieved an objective response, and 18 patients (29%) had achieved disease control at 24 weeks (Antonia et al 2016a) . Nivolumab as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 mAb) has also been investigated as first-line treatment for NSCLC in the CheckMate 012 study. The ORRs reported were similar, 47% in nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2w plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q12w and 38% nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2w plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q6w. Median DoR was not reached in either cohort. The safety profile of the combination was tolerable (Hellmann et al 2017) . 1.3.1.3 Durvalumab + tremelimumab with chemotherapy Studies evaluating agents targeting PD-L1 or CTLA-4 in combination with chemotherapy have yielded encouraging results (see Section 1.1.5.1) . Durvalumab ± tremelimumab with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced cancers are being generated from an ongoing Phase Ib study (NCT02537418) run by the CCTG. Preliminary results were presented in IASLC 2016. Up to the October 2016 cut-off, a total of 111 patients have been dosed with various chemotherapy regimens and different tumor type. The overall ORR in the NSCLC cohort (n=26) was 61.5% (NSCLC data based on a data cut-off of July 2016) (Juergens et al 2016) . CheckMate 012 (NCT01454102) is a multi-arm Phase I study of nivolumab in combination with various anticancer agents or as monotherapy in chemotherapy-naïve patients with NSCLC. The results published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology showed that the ORRs for nivolumab 10 mg/kg plus gemcitabine-cisplatin, nivolumab 10 mg/kg plus pemetrexed- cisplatin, nivolumab 10 mg/kg plus paclitaxel-ca rboplatin, and nivolumab 5 mg/kg plus paclitaxel-ca rboplatin we re 33%, 47%, 47%, and 43%, respectively; 24-week PFS rates were 51%, 71%, 38%, and 51%, respectively. On the basis of these results, the antitumor activity of first-line nivolumab in combination with platinum-based doublets is highly promising (Rizvi et al 2016) . In addition, the Phase II KEYNOTE-021 study showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to SoC carboplatin and pemetrexed followed by pembrolizumab for 2 years and indefinite pemetrexed maintenance therapy significantly improved the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response compared with carboplatin and pemetrexed alone in patients with chemotherapy-naïve, advanced non-squamous NSCLC. In the study, 123 patients with Stage IIIB/IV, chemotherapy-naïve, non-squamous NSCLC were randomized to receive 4 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2q3w), with or without 24 months of treatment with pembrolizumab (200 mg q3w). Of 60 patients, 33 (55%; 95% CI: 42 to 68) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group achiev ed an objective response compared with 18 of 63 patients (29%; 95% CI: 18 to 41) in the chemotherapy alone group (estimated"

PFS was significantly longer in patients treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone (HR 0.53 [95% CI: 0.31 to 0.91]; p=0.010). Median PFS was 13.0 months (95% CI: 8.3 to not reached) for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and 8.9 months (95% CI: 4.4 to 10.3 months) for chemotherapy alone. No difference in survival was noted between treatment arms (22% of patients died in both treatment arms). On the basis of these clinical data, the antitumor activity of PD-L1/CTLA-4 in combination with first- line platinum-based doublets is highly promising. Given the synergistic potential of durvalumab and tremelimumab, the combination of both these drugs with chemotherapy has the potential to further improve the response rates and response durability. 1.3.2 Overall risks Monoclonal antibodies directed against immune ch eckpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 as well as those directed against PD-1 or CTLA-4, aim to boost endogenous immune responses directed against TC. By stimulating the immune system, however, there is the potential for adverse effects on other tissues. Most adverse drug reactions seen with the immune checkpoint inhibitor class of agents are thought to be due to the effects of inflammatory cells on specific tissues. These risks are generally events with a potential inflammatory mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or unique interventions such as immunosuppressants and/or endocrine replacement therapy. These immune mediated effects, can occur in nearly any organ system, and are most commonly seen as gastrointestinal AEs such as colitis and diarrhea, pneumonitis/ interstitial lung disease (ILD), hepatic AEs such as hepatitis and liver enzyme elevations, skin events such as rash and dermatitis and endocrinopathies including hypo- and hyper-thyroidism. 1.3.2.1 Durval umab Risks with durvalumab include, but are not limited to diarrhea/colitis, pneumonitis/ILD, endocrinopathies (ie, events of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency), hyper- and hypo-thyroidism, type I diab etes mellitus and diabetes insipidus), hepatitis/ increases in transaminases, nephritis/increases in creatinine, rash/ dermatitis(including pemphigoid), myocarditis, myositis/polymyositis, immune thrombocytopenia, infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, pancreatitis, serious infections, and other rare or less frequent inflammatory events including neuromuscular toxicities(e.g. Guillain barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis). For information on all identified and potential risks with durvalumab please always refer to the current version of the durvalumab IB. In monotherapy clinical studies, AEs at an inciden ce of > 20% include events such as fatigue, cough, decreased appetite, dyspnea and nausea. Approximately 10% of patients discontinued the drug due to an AE. Please see the current version of the IB for a detailed summary of the monotherapy data including AEs, SAEs, and CTC Grade 3 to 5 events reported across the durvalumab program."

In the AstraZeneca internal study (D419SC00001), 6 patients with SCLC were evaluable for safety as of 6 December 2016. Common adve rse events reported were neutropenia (6 patients), nausea (4 patients), decreased appetite (4 patients), rash (3 patients), diarrhea (2 patients) and pyrexia (2 patients). Diarrhea, sk in rash were generally low grade, with the exception of 1 Grade 3 erythroderma that res ponded to topical steroids. One patient with intermittent Grade 1 diarrhea required steroid treatment and resolved. Cycle 4 was modified in this patient where immunotherapy was held and chemotherapy was dose reduced to 75% due to Grade 4 neutropenia. Grade 3 and above events were febrile neutropenia (2 patients), platelet decrease (1 p atient), and lung infection (1 patient) which were considered to be chemotherapy related, hepatitis (1 patient), and erythroderma (1 patient) which were considered to be immune related. Febrile neutropenia, lung infection, hepatitis were reported as SAE. Two patients had Grade 3/4 lipase/amylase elevation at baseline and were considered not drug related; these were due to pancreatic metastasis at baseline confirmed by imaging. One patient died due to disease progression as primary cause and a secondary cause of lung infection. Two patients discontinued treatment due to immune-related hepatitis and persistent skin rash. Two patients continue on active study treatment and are being followed up for long term safety."

Overall, all patients experienced at least 1 AE; 96% were considered by the Investigator as causally related to chemotherapy, 75% were considered as causally related to durvalumab, and 55% were considered as causally related to trem elimumab. A total of 69 events (26% of all events) were Grade ≥3, regardless of causality. Of these, 20 events were considered by the Investigators as causally related to durvalumab treatment, and 15 events were considered as causally related to tremelimumab treatment. SAEs were reported in 38% of patients (39/103) regardless of causality; 19% was related to chemotherapy, 15% was considered by the Investigator as related to durvalumab, while 11% was related to tremelimumab treatment. Note that some events considered related to durvalumab and tremelimumab treatment may be reported in the same patient(s). Overall, the common AEs reported were Grade 1 to 2 with the most commonly reported being fatigue (93%), nausea (72%), dyspnea (63%), constipation (59%), and cough (52%) regardless of causality. The most common chemotherapy-related AEs were fatigue (62%), nausea (58%), vomiting (32%), anorexia (28%), alopecia (27%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (24%). The most common durvalumab-related AEs were fatigue (42%), rash maculo-papular (17%), nausea (16%), and diarrhea (12%). The most common tremelimumab- related AEs were fatigue (26%), rash maculo-papular (13%), and diarrhea (11%). The most common CTC Grade >3 events were fatigue (11 events), thrombotic events (9), dyspnea (7), lung infection (7), and diarrhea (7). Transient elevations in amylase and lipase were seen, but no patient had clinical or radiological evidence of pancreatitis. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) elevations of ≥5× upper limit of normal (ULN) were documented in 10 patients (10%), and 6 patients required initiation of thyroi d replacement therapy on study. Three of these patients with elevated TSH had a previous history of hypothyroidism. In all dose levels, dose delays of durvalumab were mostly for administrative reasons/patient request and neutropenia related to chemotherapy, while those for durvalumab ± tremelimumab were interrupted in 4 patients because of pneumonitis, colitis, or rash. Seven patients (6.7%) discontinued durvalumab ± tremelimumab due to the following AEs: pneumonitis (3 patients), hepatitis (1 patient), myocarditis (1 patient), hyperthyroidism (1 patient), and limbic encephalitis (1 patient). There were 7 deaths within 30 days of the last dose of protocol therapy. Two of these were considered to be at least possibly related to durvalumab or tremelimumab; 1 patient (Case No. had diarrhea, hyperthyroidism, a nd myocarditis, which was steroid responsive but later declined active therapy. The cause of death has not yet been determined. The final post-mortem examination has not been reported. One patient (Case No. had confusion and possible encephalitis.

Computed tomography (CT) abdomen showed liver metastasis, with inflammatory changes of duodenum suggestive of uncomplicated duodenitis or ulcer. The patient also dev eloped acute renal failure and pulmonary edema. On Cycle 1 Day 16, the patient presented with s/s of Grade 4 heart failure and myocarditis as well as Grade 3 thyroiditis that initially responded to steroid administration. was sent home only to be readmitted with weakness, fever, dizziness, and dehydration. The patient’s condition deteriorated despite steroids and supportive treatment (inotropic support, use of ace inhibitors) and eventually died. Preliminary autopsy report showed multiple metastases in the involved lungs (effusions), liver, and lymph nodes. Except for atherosclerosis, there was no evidence of myocardial infarction or pulmonary emboli. Case Report No. – An event of limbic encephalitis (Grade 5) occurred in a with metastatic SCLC who on Cycle 2 Day 27 presented with s/s of limbic encephalitis (eg, cognitive decline, restlessness, agitation, electroencephal ogram findings suggestive of encephalopathy, CSF findings of increased white blood cells and protein, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] finding of no intra-cranial mass), and despite treatment with antibiotics and steroids, the patient eventually died. Confounding factors that may likely also provide alternative cause/explanation for this event include the following: 1) a possible paraneoplastic effect of underlying SCLC, 2) concomitant medications that in cluded treatment with phenobarbitone and midazolam, 3) underlying diabetes mellitus for which the patien t had insulin/oral hypoglycemic treatment, and 4) possible central nervous system infection. Overall, toxicities related to the chemotherapy core regimen and to durvalumab and tremelimumab were as expected for these agents. In general, the combination of durvalumab + tremelimumab with chemotherapy appears tolerable and manageable. External clinical data also support these findings. In a randomized Phase III study in patients with extensive-stage SCLC treated with etoposide-platinum ± ipilimumab, the overall incidence of treatment-related Grade 3/4 AEs was 48% for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 44% for chemotherapy plus placebo. The most common irAEs in patients treated with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab involved skin (rash and pruritus) and gastrointestinal tract (diarrhea) (Reck et al 2014) . In the CheckMate 012 study, in patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab 10 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg plus plat inum-based doublet chemotherapy concurrently q3w for 4 cycles, the overall incidences of treatment-related Grade 3/4 AEs were 50% and 29%, respectively. Overall, the most common ( ≥5% of patients) treatment-related Grade 3/4 AEs were pneumonitis (7%), fatigue (5%), and acute renal failure (5%) (Rizvi et al 2016) . In KEYNOTE-021, in patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone, the incidence of treatment-related Grade 3 or worse AEs was 39% and 26%, respectively. In the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, the most common treatment-related Grade 3 or worse AEs were anemia (12%); decreased neutrophil count (5%); and acute kidney injury, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, neutropenia, sepsis, and thrombocytopenia (3% each). In the chemotherapy alone group, the most common treatment-related Grade 3 or worse AEs were anemia (15%) and decreased neutrophil count, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia (3% each).

Patients presenting with advanced NSCLC have a median OS of 10 to 12 months (Bonomi 2010) , and patients without targetable mutations (EGFR and ALK) show responses to treatment of approximately 20% to 30% and PFS of 4 to 5 months ( Sandler et al 2006, Scagliotti et al 2008, Schiller et al 2002) . The poor prognosis reflects the limited treatment options available, highlighting the need for the development of newer therapeutic options. There remains a significant unmet medical need for additional treatment options for patients with metastatic NSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 status, whose tumors lack activating EGFR mutations and ALK fusions and who have not received prior chemotherapy or any systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Treatment with durvalumab and/or tremelimumab has shown activity in several tumor types in a subset of patients deriving meaningful and durable benefit. Efficacy data for patients treated with durvalumab monotherapy have shown clinical activity across several tumor types. Preliminary data generated from patients with NSCLC treated with durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy have also shown early signs of clinical activity, and d ata from the literature indicate that th e combination may act synergist ically (Wolchok et al 2013) . Thus, these agents may potentially offer benefit to this patient population. Also as presented in Section 1.1.5.1, the studies evaluating agents targeting PD-L1 or CTLA-4 in combination with chemothe rapy have yielded encouraging efficacy data, with a seemingly tolerable toxicity profile. The study design also aims to minimize potential risks. For example, intensive monitoring, including early safety assessment, is in place for those risks deemed to be most likely based on prior experience with the IPs (ie, durvalu mab + tremelimumab combination therapy, durvalumab monotherapy) and SoC. Therefore, the rationale for this study is supported by the available non-clinical and clinical safety data, the limited survival benefit provide d by the currently available treatment options to patients, the limited life expectancy due to malignant disease, the activity seen with durvalumab alone and in combination with tremelimumab in a number of tumor types, the preliminary data on the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of PD-L1 or CTLA-4 with chemotherapy, and the strength of the scientific hypotheses evaluating the safety and tolerability of adding durvalumab and tremelimumab to first-line standard platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC. Based on these considerations, the proposed treatments may have the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit by generating durable clinical responses, thereby potentially extending survival. Therefore, the overall benefit-risk assessment supports the proposed study"

A schematic diagram of the overall study design is presented in Figure 3, and a detailed study flow chart is presented in Figure 4. SoC chemotherapy will be one of the following regimens: abraxane + ca rboplatin, pemetrexed + cisplatin or carboplatin, or gemcitabine + cisplatin or carboplatin. This study will randomize approximately 1000 eligible patients at sites worldwide. Once global enrollment is complete, enrollment may continue in mainland China only. A total of up to 180 patients, including up to 135 patients in total with PD-L1 TC <50%, from China will be randomized. Patients who fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio in a stratified manner according to the following: ∀ PD-L1 tumor expression status (PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells [PD-L1 TC ≥50%] versus PD-L1 TC <50%) ∀ Disease stage (Stage IVA versus Stage IVB) ∀ Histology (non-squamous versus squamous) Crossover will not be permitted as part of this study. Study treatment doses and regimens are described in Section 7.2. Assessments will be conducted as indicated in Table 2 and Table 3. Tumor evaluation scans will be performed at screening (as baseline) with follow-ups at Week 6±1 week from the date of rando mization, at Week 12±1 week from the date of randomization, and then every 8 weeks (q8w)±1 week until radiological progression. The management of patients will be based solely upon the results of the tumor evaluation scans conducted by the Investigator. The BICR of all radiologic scans will be performed to derive the PFS, ORR, DoR, BoR, and APF12 endpoints according to RECIST 1.1."

Issues identified w ill be addressed; for instance, this could involve amendments to the study protocol and letters to investigators. 1.6.1 Safety confirmation An IDMC composed of independent experts will be convened to confirm the safety and tolerability of the proposed dose and schedule of durvalumab ± tremelimumab in combination with SoC chemotherapy at 2 early stages of enrollment. A step-wise approach will be adopted. The initial safety review w ill take place when the first 30 patients (10 in each arm) have completed the first cycle of treatment. A second review will add an additional 30 patients (10 in each arm) who have completed the first cycle of treatment, making a total of 60 patients. At the time of the second review, it is expected that the initial 30 patients would have had at least 6 weeks of follow-up, with some patients having longer follow-up. These 2 reviews will be carried out by the IDMC in an unblinded manner. After a review of the unblinded data, the IDMC will make a recommend ation on whether the st udy should continue recruitment as planned or hold recruitment. Safety confirmation for Japan: An additional safety review for Japanese patients will take place when the first 3 patients in each treatment ar m in Japan have completed the first cycle of treatment. This review will be carried out by the IDMC in an unblinded manner. After review of the unblinded data, the IDMC will make a recommendation on wheth er the st udy should continue recruitment as pla nned or hold recruitment in Japan.

If a patient has squamous histology or is known to have a tumor with a KRAS mutation, then EGFR and ALK testing is not required. 5. No prior chemotherapy or any other systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Patients who have received prior platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or definitive chemoradiation for advanced disease are eligible, provided that progression has occurred >12 months from end of last therapy (see exclusion criterion 7). 6. Tumor PD-L1 status, confirmed by a reference laboratory using the Ventana SP263 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay, must be known prior to randomization. As such, all patients must be able to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy during screening or to provide an available tumor sample taken <3 months prior to enrollment. Tumor lesions used for newly acquired biopsies during screening period should not be the same lesions used as RECIST targ et lesions, unless there are no other lesions suitable for biopsy; and in this instance only core needle (not excisional/incisional) biopsy is allowed.

At screening (Days -28 to -1), the Investigat ors or the suitably trained delegate will do the following: ∀ Obtain signed informed consent from the potential patient before any study-specific procedures are performed. If laboratory or imaging procedures were performed for alternate reasons prior to signing consent, these can be used for screening purposes with consent of the patient. However, all imaging results must have been obtained within 28 days of randomization (Appendix E) . For patients with a single TL, if screening biopsy is collected prior to the screening imaging for baseline tumor assessment, allow approximately 2 weeks before imaging scans are acquired. (Informed consent of study procedures may be obtained prior to the 28-day screening window to permit tumor biopsy sample acquisition, which must be analyzed prior to randomization.) ∀ Obtain a unique enrollment number (E-code) through the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) in the following format: This number is the patient’s unique identifier and is used to identify the patient on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs). ∀ Obtain tumor sample and send for centralized PD-L1 testing. Obtaining the tumor biopsy sample should be given the highest priority, and as such, the sample may be obtained and sent for PD-L1 expression status evaluation prior to the 28-day screening window (after obtaining signed informed consent) to permit analysis prior to randomization. See Section 5.5.1 for details on tumor samples. The sample for centralized PD-L1 testing should be sent only for patients with known EGFR and ALK status. If a patient has squamous histology or is known to have a tumor with a KRAS mutation, then EGFR and ALK testing is not required. If EGFR and ALK status is unknown, then the tumor sample (archive or fresh, primary or metastatic) should be used first for local EGFR mutation and ALK fusion testing or, if not feasible, be sent directly to be EGFR/ALK tested centrally concomitantly with PD-L1, in accordance with inclusion criterion 4. Tumor samples will be used to determin e PD-L1 expression status (defined by the Ventana SP263 PD-L1 IHC assay) in which: !≥50% of TC with membrane staining for PD-L1 at any intensity (PD-L1 TC≥50%) !<50% of TC with membrane staining for PD-L1 at any intensity (PD-L1 TC <50%)PPD PPD"

At randomization, once the patient is confirmed to be eligible, the Investigator or suitably trained delegate will do the following: 1. Define the SoC treatment (based on the most appropriate option for the patient) that the patient will receive. This must be completed for all patients. The information will be recorded in the IVRS/IWRS system. Note: For all patients with non-squamous tu mor histology scheduled to receive pemetrexed, folic acid and vitamin B12 should commence prior to randomization for up to 7 days, in line with local practice. This is to ensure treatment can begin on Day 1. 2. Obtain a unique rando mization number via the IVRS/IWRS. Numbers w ill start at 001 and will be assigned strictly sequentially by IVRS/IWRS as patients are eligible for entry into the study. The system will randomize the eligible patient to 1 of the 3 treatment arms (PD-L1 expression status re sults must be received from the central laboratory by the IVRS/IWRS prior to randomization). Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio in a stratified manner according to the following: ∀ PD-L1 tumor expression status (PD-L1 TC ≥50% versus PD-L1 TC <50%) ∀ Disease stage (Stage IVA versus Stage IVB) ∀ Histology (non-squamous versus squamous) If the patient is ineligible and not randomized, the IVRS/IWRS status should be changed to screen failure. Patients will begin treatment on Cycle 1 Da y 1. Treatment should start no more than 3 working days after being randomized. Patients must not be randomized and treated unless all elig ibility criteria have been met. If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his or her enrollment/rando mization c ode cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients w ill not be replaced. 3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized patients Patients who fail to meet the eligibility cr iteria should not, under any circumstances, be randomized or receive study medication. There can be no exceptions to this rule. Patients who are enrolled but found to not meet all the eligibility criteria must not be randomized and must not be initiated on treatment and must be withdrawn from the study as a screen failure.CCI"

Th e Study Physician must ensure that all decisions are appropriately documented. In situations where an agreement cannot be reached, the patient should have their study th erapy stopped and be withdrawn from the study. 3.5 Methods for assigning treatment arms The actual treatment given to patients will be determined by the rando mization scheme in the IVRS/IWRS. The randomization scheme will be produced by a computer software program that incorporates a standard procedure for generating rando mization numbers. One randomization list will be produced for each of the randomization stratum. A blocked randomization w ill be generated, and all centers will use the same list to minimize any imbalance in the number of patients a ssigned to each treatment arm. Patients will be identified to the IVRS/IWRS per country regulations. Rando mization codes will be assigned strictly sequentially, within each stratum, as p atients become eligible for randomization. The IVRS/IWRS w ill provide the kit id entification number to be allocated to the patient at the randomization visit and subsequent treatment dispensing visits. 3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding (Not applicable) Not applicable; this study is not blinded. 3.7 Methods for unblinding (Not applicable) Not applicable; this study is not blinded. 3.8 Restrictions The following restrictions apply while the p atient is receiving study treatment and for the specified t imes be fore and after: 1.

Nonsterilized male patients who are not abstinent and intend to be sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from the time of screening throughout the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period (180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy). However, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. ! Female partners (of childbearing potenti al) of male patients must also use a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period (Table 1) . Note 1: Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or post- menopausal. Note 2: For male patients receving gemcitabine SoC chemotherapy, in addition to referring to the current local prescribing information, cryopreservation of male sperm should be considered due to the risk of infertility. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. Th e following age-specific requirements apply: ∀ Women <50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more follo wing cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution. ∀ Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more followi ng cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago. Highly effective methods of contraception, defined as those that result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, are described in Table 1. Note that some contraception methods are not considered highly effective (eg, male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper-containing intra-uter ine device; progestogen- only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibi tion of ovulation is not the primary mode of action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel, which is considered highly effective]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills)."

Restrictions relating to concomitant medications are described in Section 7.7. 3.9 Discontinuation of IP An individual patient will not receive any further IP (durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy, durvalumab monotherapy or SoC) if any of the following occur in the patient in question: ∀ Withdrawal of consent from further treatment wi th IP. The patient is, at any time, free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment. A patient who discontinues treatment is normally expected to continue to participate in the study unless they specifically withdraw their consent to further participation in any study procedures and assessments (see Section 3.10.2) . ∀ An AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator or AstraZeneca, contraindicates further dosing."

For patients in Treatment Arms 1 and 2, when SoC chemotherapy is discontinued due to treatment-r elated toxicity, durvalumab monothera py or durvalumab + tremelimumab may continue at the Investigator’s discretion when toxicity resolves to at least Grade 2 or less. Note: if the Investigator feels that a patient is ready to restart treatmen t prior to the toxicity resolving to Grade 2 or less, AstraZeneca should be consulted for an exception to this rule. 3.9.1 Procedures for discontinuation of patient from IP At any time, patients are free to discontinue IP without prejudice to further treatment. A patient who decides to discontinue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) for discontinuation and the presence of any AEs. If possible, they will be seen and assessed by an Investigator(s). AEs will be followed up (see Section 6). Patients who are permanently discontinued from further receipt of IP, regardless of the reason, will be identified as having permanently discontinued treatment. Patients who are permanently discontinued will enter the follow-up period (see Table 3) . Patients who permanently discontinue drug for reasons other than objective disease progression should continue to have RECIST scans performed at Week 6±1 week from the date of rando mization, Week 12±1 week from the d ate of rando mization, and then q8w±1 week thereafter until RECIST 1.1 defined ra diological progression plus an additional subsequent scan or death (whichever comes first) as defined in Table 3. All patients will be followed for survival until the end of the study. This follow-up must be performed even if the patient begins another therapy to treat their NSCLC. Patients who decline to return to the site for evaluations should be contacted by telephone as indicated in Table 3 as an alternative."

If a patient is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.10. 3.10 Criteria for withdrawal 3.10.1 Screen failures Screen failures are patients who do not fulfill the eligibility criteria for the study and therefore must not be randomized. These patients shoul d have the reason for st udy withdrawa l recorded as “eligibility criteria not fulfilled” (ie, pati ent does not meet the required inclusion/meets exclusion criteria). This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures (ie, not randomized patients). Patients may be rescreened a single time, but they cannot be re-randomized. Patients may notbe rescreened after enrollment to the study has closed. 3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IP and assessments) without prejudice to further treatment. Patients who withdraw consent for further participation in the study will not receive any further IP or further study observation, with the exception of follow-up for survival, which will continue until the end of the study unless the patient has expressly withdrawn their consent to survival follow-up. Note that the patient may be offered additional tests or tapering of treatment to withdraw safely. A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) for withdrawal and the presence of any AE. The Investigator will follow-up AEs outside of the clinical study. If a patient withdraws consent, they will be specifically asked if they are withdrawing consent to: ∀ All further participation in the study including any further follow-up (eg, survival contact telephone calls). ∀ Withdrawal to the use of any samples (see Section 5.5.6) . 3.10.2.1 Survival status for withdrawn consent and lost to follow-up patients Patients will be considered lost to follow-up only if no contact has been established by the time the study is completed (see Section 9.3), such that there is insufficient information to determine the patients’ status at that time. Patients who refuse to continue participation in the study, including telephone contact, should be documented as “withdrawal of consent” rather than “lost to follow-up.” Investigators should document attempts to re-establish contact with missing patients throughout the study period. If contact with a missing patient is re-established, the patient should not be considered lost to follow-up and evaluations should resume according to the protocol."

Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patients at the time of discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the eCRFs. All reasons for discontinuation of treatment must be documented. In terminating the study, AstraZeneca will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interests. If this study is discontinued, all other studies involving durvalumab or tremelimumab will remain open to enrollment and screening, if deemed appropriate by AstraZeneca. 4.

The schedule of study procedures for patients in long-term follow up is presented in Table 12, Table 13 in Section 9.3Study timetable and end of study. 5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS A Web-Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and query handling. The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs as specified in this study protocol and in accordance with the instructions provided. The Investigator will ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and the provision of answers to data queries according to the clinical study agreement (CSA). The Investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site. 5.1 Efficacy assessments The dual primary aims of this study are to assess the efficacy of durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy compared with SoC chemotherapy alone in terms of PFS and OS in all patients. Efficacy assessments of PFS, APF12, DoR, BoR, and ORR will be derived (by AstraZeneca) using BICR assessments according to RECIST 1.1. A sensitivity analysis of PFS and OS will be performed using Investigat or assessments. Seconda ry objectives will include OS and PFS of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy compared with SoC chemotherapy as well as APF12, DoR, BoR, ORR and PFS2. Tumor evaluations utilize images from CT [preferred] or MRI, each preferably with IV contrast, of the chest and abdomen (including the entire liver and both adrenal glands), collected during screening/baseline and at selected timepoints during the study treatment. Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual patients. The RECIST 1.1 guidelines ( Appendix E) provide a method of assessment of change in tumor burden in response to treatment. Screening/baseline imaging should be performed no more than 28 days before the date of rando mization and ideally s hould be performed as close as possible to and prior to the date of randomizat ion. The RECIST 1.1 assessments of baseline images identify target lesions (TLs [defined as measurable]) and non-target lesions (NTLs), and each lesion (and any new lesion) is evaluated in subsequent, on-treatment follow-up images. This allows the determination of follow-up TL response, NTL response, New Lesions, and overall t imepoint tumor responses (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], progressive disease [PD], or not evaluable [NE]). 5.1.1 Central reading of scans All images, including unscheduled visit scans, will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to an AstraZeneca-appointed imaging Contract Research Organization for quality control (QC) and storage. A BICR of images will be performed at the direction of"

Results of these independent reviews will not be communicated to Investigators, and the management of patients will be based solely upon the results of the RECIST 1.1 assessment conducted by the Investigator. The BICR of all radiological scans will be performed to derive the ORR, PFS, DoR, BoR, and APF12 endpoints according to RECIST 1.1. The BICR will include assessment by RECIST 1.1 and Only Investigator assessments will be captured in the RAVE system in RECIST folders. 5.1.2 Survival assessments Assessments for survival must be made at Months 2, 3, and 4, and then every 2 months (8 weeks±2 weeks) following treatment discontinuation. Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the patient or the patient’s family, or by contact with the patient’s current physician. These assessments must be performed even if the patient begins another therapy to treat their NSCLC. The details of first and subsequent therapies for cancer, after discontinuation of treatment, will be co llected. In addition, patients on treatment or in surv ival follow-up will be contacted following the data cut-off for the primary analysis and all subsequent survival analyses to provide complete survival data. These contacts should generally occur within 7 days of the data cut-off. Survival assessments may continue as per protocol (every 2 months) post the final analysis of OS for superiority. 5.2 Safety assessments 5.2.1 Laboratory safe ty assessments Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be taken at the times indicated in the assessment schedules and as clinically indicated (see Table 2 and Table 3) . Clinical laboratory safety tests, includi ng serum/urine pregnancy tests (on women of childbearing potential), thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine, according to Table 2 and Table 3, will be performed in a licensed clinical laboratory according to local standard procedures. Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary depending on the laboratory method used and routine practice at the site. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results should be repeated as soon as possible (preferably within 24 to 48 hours). Pregnancy tests, on either urine (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) or blood (serum β-hCG) samples, will be performed for pre-menopausal women of childbearing potential at screening and subsequent visits as specified in the assessment schedule ( Table 2 and Table 3) . Tests will be performed by the hospital’s local la boratory. If results are positive, the patient must not start or continue treatment. In the event of a suspected pregnancy during the study, the test should be repeated. Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator. The date, time of collection, and results (values, units, and reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. CCI"

These cases should be reported as SAEs if, after evaluation, they meet the criteria for a Hy’s Law case or if any of the indi vidual liver function test parameters fulfill any of the SAE criteria. All patients should have further hematology and clinical chemistry profiles performed at 28 days (±3 days), 2 months (±1 week), and 3 months (±1 week) after permanent discontinuation of IP (see Table 3) . Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values should be repeated as clinically indicated and recorded on the eCRF. Situations in which laboratory safe ty results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 6.3.7. All patients with Grade 3 or 4 laboratory valu es at the time of completion or discontinuation from study treatment must have further tests performed until the laboratory values have returned to Grade 1 or 2, unless these values are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease. 5.2.2 Physical examination Physical examinations will be performed according to the assessment schedules ( Table 2 and Table 3) . Full physical examinations will include assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, musculoskeletal, neurological, dermatological, hematologic/lymphatic, and endocrine systems.

Situations in which physical examination results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 6.3.6. 5.2.3 Electrocardiogram Resting 12-lead ECGs will be recorded at screening and as clinically indicated throughout the study (see Table 2) . ECGs should be obtained after the patient has been in a supine position for 5 minutes and recorded while the patient remains in that position. In case of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) value >470 ms, 2 additional 12-lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (eg, 30 minutes) to confirm the finding. Situations in which ECG results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 6.3.7. 5.2.4 Vital signs Vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse rate, temperature, and respiration rate) will be evaluated according to the assessment schedules (Table 2 and Table 3) . Body weight is also recorded at each visit along with vital signs. First infusion On the first infusion day, patients in Treatmen t Arms 1 and 2 will be monitored and vital signs will be collected/recorded in the eCRF prior to, during, and after infusion of IP as presented in the bulleted list below. Patients in Treatment Arm 3 will be monitored pre-dose and as clinically indicated before every infusion or administration. BP, pulse rate, temperature and respiratory ra te will be collected from patients in Treatment Arms 1 and 2 prior to, during, and after each infusion at the following times (based on a 60- minute infusion): ∀ Prior to the beginning of each infusion (measured once from approximately 30 minutes before up to 0 minutes [ie, the beginning of the infusion]) ∀ Approximately 30 minutes during the infusion ( halfway through infusion) ∀ At the end of the infusion (after approximately 60 minutes ±5 minutes) If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes, then BP and pulse rate measurements should follow the principles as described above or be taken more frequently if clinically indicated. A 1-hour observation period is recommended after the first infusion of durvalumab and tremelimumab. Additional monitoring with assessment of vital signs will be at the discretion of the Investigator per standard clinical practice or as clinically indicated. Subsequent infusions BP, pulse rate, and other vital signs should be measured and collected/recorded in the eCRF prior to the start of the every subsequent infusio n. Patients should be carefully monitored, and BP and other vital signs should be measured during and after infusion as per institution"

Situations in which vital signs results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 6.3.7. For any AEs of i nfusion reactions, please enter the vital signs values into the eCRF. 5.2.5 Early patient review for safety Patients will be evaluated 7 days after the first dose of each cycle of chemotherapy across all treatment arms to ensure early identif ication a nd management of toxicities. It is st rongly recommended for any patient experiencing Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is administered according to local practice. 5.2.6 WHO/ECOG perf ormance status WHO/ECOG performance status will be assessed at the times specified in the assessment schedules (see Table 2 and Table 3) based on the following: ∀ 0 = Fully active; able to carry out all usual activities without restrictions ∀ 1 = Restricted in strenuous activity, but ambulatory and able to carry out light work or work of a sedentary nature (eg, light housework or office work) ∀ 2 = Ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to carry out any work activities; up a nd about more than 50% of waking hours ∀ 3 = Capable of only limited self-care; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours ∀ 4 = Completely disabled; unable to carry out any self-care and totally confined to bed or chair ∀ 5 = Dead Any significant changes from baseline or screening must be reported as an AE. 5.2.7 Other safety assessments If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (eg, dyspnea) or radiological abnormality suggestive of pneumon itis/interstitial l ung disease is observed, toxicity management, as described in detail in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines (please see Section 6.9.1) , will be applied. The results of the full diagnostic workup (including high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans, blood and sputum culture, hematological parameters, etc) will be captured in the eCRF. It is strongly recommended to perform a full diagnostic workup, to exclude alternative causes such as lymphangitic carcinomatosis, infection, allergy, cardiogen ic edema, or pulmonary hemorrhage. In the presence of confirmatory HRCT scans where other causes of respiratory symptoms have been excluded, a diagnosis of pneumonitis (ILD) should be considered and the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines should be followed."

PROs have become a significant endpoint when evaluating effectiveness of treatments in clinical studies. The following PROs will be administered in this study: EORTC QLQ-C30 v3 (core questionnaire), EORTC QLQ-LC13 (lung cancer m odule), (see Appendix F) . The PRO instruments will be completed by the patients using a handheld electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) device. All assessments should be completed without assistance from anyone according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 and Table 3) . It will take approximately 30 minutes for patients to complete the questionnaires; therefore, the burden to the patient should be moderate. 5.3.1.1 EORTC QLQ-C30 The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3 questionnaire is included for the purpose of assessing HRQoL and is a well-established measure of HRQoL/health status and is commonly used as an endpoint in cancer clinical studies. It assesses HRQoL/health status through 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), and a global health and quality of life (QoL) scale.

For each of the 15 domains, final scores are transformed such that they range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater functioning, greater HRQoL, or greater level of symptoms (Aaronson et al 1993) . 5.3.1.2 EORTC QLQ-LC13 For patients with NSCLC, a disease-specific 13 -item self-administered questionnaire for lung cancer was developed (EORTC QLQ-LC13; Appendix F) to be used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Bergman et al 1994) . It comprises both multi-item and single-item measures of lung cancer-associated symptoms (ie, coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and pain) and treatment-related symptoms from conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy (ie, hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, and dysphagia ). Similar to the EORTC QLQ-C30, all questions except 1 have a 4-point scale: “not at all,” “a little,” “quite a bit,” and “very much”. One question (no. 43: “Did you take any medicine for pain?”) has a response option of “yes” or “no.” The scoring approach for the EORTC QLQ-LC13 is similar to the EORTC QLQ-C30. 5.3.1.3 5.3.1.4 5.3.1.5CCI CCI CCICCI CCI CCI"

Each center must allocate the responsibility for the administration of the PRO instruments to a specific individual (eg, a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a back-up person to cover if that individual is absent. The PRO questionnaires must be administered and completed at the clinic as per the schedule of assessments. The PRO questionnaires will be administered on the days specified in the schedules of assessments (see Table 2 and Table 3) . The EORTC QLQ-C30 should always be completed prior to the EORTC QLQ-LC13 m odule. It is important that the significance and relevance of the data are explained carefully to participating patients so that they are motivated to comply with data collection. The following best practice guidelines should be followed when collecting PRO data via an electronic device: ∀ It is preferred that PRO questionnaires are completed prior to any other study procedures (following informed consent) and before discussion of disease progression to avoid biasing the patient’s responses to the questions. ∀ PRO questionnaires must be completed in private by the patient. ∀ Patients should be given sufficient time to complete the PRO questionnaires at their own speed. ∀ The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is confidential.

An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver), or the abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, ECG). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. The term AE is used to include both SAEs and non-serious AEs. For cases where it could be suspected that a tissue-derived medicine has been contaminated by a pathogen, information about any of the abov e conditions (includi ng infection) should be collected. 6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), which fulfils one or more of the following criteria: ∀ Results in death ∀ Is immediately life-threatening ∀ Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization ∀ Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ∀ Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect ∀ Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above For further guidance on the definition of an SAE, see Appendix A. 6.3 Recording of adverse events 6.3.1 Time period fo r collection of adverse events AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time of the patient signing the informed consent form until the follow-up period is completed (90 days after the last dose of durvalumab ± tremelimumab or SoC). If an event that starts post the defined safety follow up period noted above is considered to be due to a late onset toxicity to study drug (for all arms) then it should be reported as an AE or SAE as applicable. 6.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events During the course of the study, all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up for each patient for as long as the event is ongoing. Ever y effort should be made to obtain a resolution"

Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study are followed up by the Investigator for as long as medically indicated but without further recording in the eCRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 6.3.3 Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: ∀ AE (verbatim) ∀ Date when the AE started and stopped ∀ Maximum CTCAE grade reported ∀ Changes in CTCAE grade (report only the maximum CTCAE grade for a calendar day) ∀ Whether the AE is serious or not ∀ Investigator causality rating against the IPs (yes or no) ∀ Action taken with regard to IPs ∀ Administration of treatment for the AE ∀ Whether the AE caused the patient’s withdrawal from the study (yes or no) ∀ Outcome In addition, the following vari ables will be collected for SAEs: ∀ Date the AE met criteria for SAE ∀ Date the Investigator became aware of SAE ∀ Seriousness of criteria ∀ Date of hospitalization ∀ Date of discharge ∀ Probable cause of death ∀ Date of death ∀ Whether an autopsy was performed ∀ Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s) ∀ Causality assessment in relation to other medication, as explained in Section 6.3.4 ∀ Description of SAE"

For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, the recommendation the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate, and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used. A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.03 can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov) . It is important to distinguish between SAEs and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 6.2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but it is not an SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke, but it would be an SAE if it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2. 6.3.4 Causality collection The Investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IPs and each AE and answer “yes” or “no” to the question, “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?” For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for other medications and study procedures. Note that, for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal relationship is implied as “yes.” A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A. 6.3.5 Relationshi p to protocol procedures The Investigator is also required to provide an assessment of the relationship of SAEs to protocol procedures on the SAE report form. Th is includes both non-treatment-emergent (ie, SAEs that occur prior to the administration of IP) and treatment-emergent SAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required during the study (eg, blood collection). The following guid elines should be used by Investigators to assess the relationship of SAEs to the protocol: ∀ Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure or intervention that was described in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the patient’s medical record. ∀ Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other than the procedure or intervention that was described in the protocol. The alternative etiology must be documented in the study patient’s medical record. 6.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or reported in response to the open question from the study personnel, “Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?” or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF."

However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 6.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests The results from protocol-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs measurements will be summarized in the CSR. Deterioration as compared with baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values and vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IPs. If deterioration in a laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result or vital sign will be considered as additional information. Whenever possible, the reporting Investigator should use the clinical term rather than the laboratory term (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AEs. Deterioration of a laboratory value that is unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. 6.3.8 Hy’s law Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN may need to be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix D for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s law. 6.3.9 Disease progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to the disease for which the IP is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symp toms of the disease. The development of new or progression of existing metastasis to the prima ry cancer under study s hould be c onsidered as disease progression and not an AE. Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 6.3.10 New cancers The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE. New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the ad ministration of the study treatment and have been identified after the patient’s inclusion in this study."

The report should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of PD, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death. ∀ Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. It should also be documented in the Statement of Death page in the eCRF. A post-mortem may behelpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed, a copy of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to AstraZeneca Patient Safety or its representative within the usual timeframes. Deaths occurring after the protocol defined safety follow-up period after the administration of the last dose of study drug should be documented in the Statement of Death page. If the death occurred as a result of an event that started after the defined safety follow-up period and the event is considered to be due to a late onset toxicity to study drug, then it should also be reported as an SAE. 6.3.12 Safety Data To Be Collected following the final DCO of the study For patients continuing to receive durvalumab/tremelimumab treatment and/or SOC chemotherapy after final DCO and database closure, it is recommended that the patients continue the scheduled site visits and investigators monitor the patient’s safety laboratory results prior to and periodically during treatment with durvalumab/tremelimumab in order to manage AEs in accordance with the durvalumab/tremelimumab toxicity management guidelines (TMG Annex) and per label information of chemotherapy. All data post the final DCO and database closure will be recorded in the patient notes but, with the exception of Serious Adverse Events, will not otherwise be reported for the purposes of this study. All SAEs that occur in patients still r eceiving durvalumab/tremelimu mab treatment and/or SOC chemotherapy (or within the 90 days following the last dose of durvalumab/tremelimumabs treatment and/or SOC chemotherapy) post the final DCO and database closure must be reported as detailed in Section 6.4."

All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. If any SAE occurs during the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel should inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening AEs in which important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately. The Investigator or other site personnel will inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar day, ie, immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the Investigator or other site personnel indicates that an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an automated e-mail alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel will report the SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator or study site personnel how to proceed. The reference documents for the definition of expectedness or listedness are the IBs for durvalumab and tremelimumab and the EU Summary of Product Characteristics for the active comparator product (including any AstraZeneca comparator). The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures and expertise are available to handle medical emergencies during the study. A medical emergency usually constitutes an SAE and is to be reported as such . 6.5 Treatment Arms 1 and 2 adverse events of special interest An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of the scientific and medical interests specific to understanding the IP and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of this IP. AESIs for durvalumab ± tremelimumab include, but are not limited to, events with a potential inflammatory or immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent"
120,page_120,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab Study Code D419MC00004Version 6.0 Date 09 July 2021 121(225)monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants, and/or hormone replacement therapy. These AESIs are being clo sely monitored in clinical studies with durvalumab monotherapy and combination therapy. An immune-mediated adverse event (imAE) is defined as an AESI that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the imAE. If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an imAE, the Investigator should promptly contact the Study Physician. AESI/imAEs observed with anti PD-L/PD-1 agents such as durvalumab and durvalumab in combination with tremlimumab include pneumon itis, hepatitis, diarrhea/colitis, intestinal perforation, endocrinopathies (hypo- and hyper-thyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis/hypopituitarism and Type 1 diab etes mellitus), nephritis, rash/dermatitis, myocarditis,myositis/polymyositis, pancreatitis and rare/less frequent imAEs including neuromuscular toxicities such as myas thenia gravis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Other inflammatory responses that are rare/less frequent with a potential immune-mediated etiology include, but are not limited to, pericarditis, sarcoidosis, uveitis, and other events involving the eye, skin, hematological, rheumato logical events, vasculitis, non-infectious meningitis and non-infectious encephalitis. It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs In addition, infusion- related reactions and hypersensiti vity/anaphylactic reactions with a different underlying pharmacological etiology are also considered AESIs. Further information on these risks (eg, presenting symptoms) can be found in the current version of the durvalumab and tremelimumab IB. More specific guidelines for their evaluation and treatment are described in d etail in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines (please see Section 6.9.1 and TMG Annex. These guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assist the Investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities. These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to the study drug/study regimen by the reporting Investig ator. In the event of an AESI or suspected AESI, the AstraZeneca study team may request relevant clinical information (including images) for those patients who demonstrate the event and may request the independent review. 6.6 Overdose 6.6.1 Durvalumab or tremelimumab Use of durvalumab or tremelimumab in doses in excess of that specified in the protocol is considered to be an overdose. There is currently no specific treatment in the event of"

If an overdose of an AstraZeneca IP occurs during the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel will inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site. For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply (see Section 6.4). For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days. 6.6.2 Standard of care For patients randomized to the SoC (Treatment Arm 3) group, refer to the local prescribing information for treatment of cases of overdose. If any overdose is associated with an AE or SAE, record the AE/SAE diagnosis or symptoms only in the relevant AE modules of the eCRF. 6.7 Pregnancy All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca except for: ∀ Pregnancy discovered before the study patient has received any study drugs. 6.7.1 Maternal exposure If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the IPs should be discontinued immediately. Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IP under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Congenital abnormalities or birth defects a nd spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital a bnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study."

The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 to 5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies. The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.6.7.2 Paternal exposure Male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy, 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy, or 90 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab, whichever is the longer time period. Please follow the local prescribing information relating to contraception and the time limit for such precautions for SoC agents. Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy, 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy, or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy, whichever is the longer time period, should, if possible, be followed up and documented. Where a report of pregnancy is received, prior to obtaining information about the pregnancy, the Investigator must obtain the consent of the patient’s partner. Therefore, the local study team should adopt th e generic ICF template in line with local procedures and submit it to the relevant Ethics Committees (ECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) prior to use. 6.8 Medication Error For the purposes of this clinical study, a med ication error is an uninte nded failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that either causes harm to the patient or has the potential to cause harm to the patient. A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug but rather a human or process-related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or patient."

If medically appropriate, dose modifications are permitted. ∀ All dose modifications should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation of the approach taken. ∀ In the event that durvalumab ± tremelimumab is discontinued or delayed as part of the toxicity management guidance SoC may st ill be administered as scheduled. All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03. 6.9.1 Specific toxicit y management and dose modification information - Durvalumab and durvalumab + tremelimumab Comprehensive toxicity management guidelines (TMG) have been developed to assist investigators with the recognition and managemen t of toxicities associated with the use of the immune-checkpoint inhibitors durvalumab [Medi4736] (PD-L1 inhibitor) <<and tremelimumab (CTLA-4 inhibitor)>. Given the similar underlying mechanisms of toxicities observed with these two compounds, these guidelines are applicable to the management of patients receiving either drug as monotherapy or in combination. Additionally, these guidelines are applicable when either drug is used alone or in combination and is administered concurrently or sequentially with other anti- cancer drugs (i.e. antineoplastic chemotherapy, targeted agents), as part of a protocol specific treatment regimen. The TMGs provide information for the management of immune-med iated reactions, infusion-related reactions, and non-immune mediated reactions that may be observed with checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy or combination checkpoint inhibit or regimens, with specific instructions for dose modifications (including discontinuations) and treatment interventions. Investigators are advised however to use local practice guidelines and consult local references for the management of toxicities observed with other cancer treatment The most current version of the TMGs entitled “Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune- Mediated, Infusion-Related, and Non-Immune Mediated Reactions (MEDI4736) Monotherapy or Combination Therapy with Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab Monotherapy” is provided to the investigative site as an Annex document and is maintained within the Site Master File. Patients should be thoroughly evaluated and appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, m etabolic, toxi n, or other etiologic causes of the imAE. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE"

In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, events should be considered potentially immune related. In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab and tremelimumab should be permanently discontinued (see Section 3.9of this protocol and the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines in TMG Annex). Following the first dose of IP, subsequent administration of durvalumab and tremelimumab can be modified based on toxicities observed as described in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines in TMG Annex. These guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assist the Investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities. These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to durvalumab monotherapy and the durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy regimen by the reporting Investigator. Dose reductions are not permitted. In case of doubt, the Investigator should consult with the Study Physician. 6.9.2 Standard of care agents Chemotherapies are associated with a number of unwanted effects. SoC-r elated toxicity management and dose adjustment, including dose delays and reductions, should be performed as indicated in the local prescribing information for the relevant agent. In the event of unfavorable tolerability, patients can switch between cisplatin and carboplatin therapy at any point on study (assuming eligibility for the switched therapy is met). In the event that an AE can reasonably be attributed to SoC, dose adjustment of SoC should be attempted before modifying the administration of durvalumab ± tremelimumab. In the event that SoC is delayed, durvalumab ± tremelimumab should also be delayed. Every effort should be made to ensure patients re ceive at least 4 cycles of SoC across all treatment arms in the study, if conditions allow. 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT AND OTHER TREATMENTS 7.1 Identity of investigational products AstraZeneca will supply durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab, while the SoC chemotherapies will be supplied locally (Table 7) .

Patients with rapid tumor progression or with symptomatic progression that requires urgent medical intervention (eg, central nervous system metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor compression, or spinal cord compression) will not be eligible for starting retreatment with durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy. For all patients in Treatment Arm 1 who begin retreatment, the Investigator should ensure the patients do not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate restarting treatment would not further benefit the patient. Patients in Treatment Arm 1 meeting the retreatment criteria below will follow the same treatment guidelines followed during the origin al ‘post-chemotherapy’ q4w treatment period (Table 2) : Patients who meet the criteria for retreatment may only receive retreatment once. Crossover within the study will not be permitted. Patients randomized to the durvalumab + tr emelimumab combination therapy arm (Treatment Arm 1) may undergo retreatment with the combination as described below: ∀ Patients who complete the 5 dosing cycles of the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab portion of the regimen (with clinical benefit per Investigator judgment), but subsequently have evidence of clinical progression or radiological PD during the durvalumab monotherapy portion of the combination regimen (see Appendix E) , may restart treatment with the combination.CCI"

As durvalumab is a mAb and therefore a protein, it will be degraded to small peptides and amino acids and will be eliminated by renal and reticuloendothelial clearance. It is therefore not expected that durvalumab will induce or inhibit the major drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 pathways. As a result, there are no expected pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. The mechanism of action of durvalumab involves binding to PD-L1, and therefore significant pharmacodynamic drug in teractions with the commonly administered concomitant medications are not expected. Despite this, appropriate clinical monitoring in all of the planned clinical studies will be conducted to evaluate any potential drug-drug interactions. 7.8 Post-study access to study treatment Patients receiving study treatment at the time of study completion (ie, after final data cut- off date) may continue to receive study treatment up to meeting discontinuation criteria(see section 3.9) if, in the opinion of the Investigator, th ey are continuing to receive benefit from treatment. The provision of durvalumab/tremelimumab treatment at study completion may include, but is not limited to, transition to a roll-over study, continuous supply within this trial (for example in countries where regulatory approval is not obtained for a roll-over study) or switching to commercial drug as permitted by local regulations.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES 8.1 Statistical considerations All statistical analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives. A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized within 3 months of the first randomized patient, and any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments completed prior to the reporting of the data. The dual primary aims of this study are to assess th e efficacy of durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy compared with SoC chemotherapy alone in terms of PFS and OS in all patients. 8.2 Sample size estimate The study will enroll approximately 2000 patients to randomize approximately 1000 patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy, durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy, or SoC chemotherapy alone (approximately 333 patients in each treatment arm), including at least 250 patients in each treatment arm with PD-L1 TC <50%. Once global enrollment is completed, the recruitment may continue in mainland China only. A total of up to 180 patients , including up to 135 p atients in total with PD-L1 TC <50%, from China will be randomized (refer to Section 8.6for more details). The study is sized for dual primary endpoints to characterize the PFS and OS benefits of durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC chemotherapy alone in the intent- to-treat (ITT) population. Sample size and power analysis for the dual primary endpoints are described below. Refer to Section 8.5for the multiple testing procedure and Section 8.5.9 for alpha allocation and alpha spending. One interim analysis of PFS will be performed when approximately 80% of the target PFS events have occurred. Three interim analyses of overall survival (OS) will be performed; the first at the time of the interim PFS analysis (approximately 45% of the target OS events), the second at the time of the primary PFS analysis (approximately 61% of the target OS events) and the third when approximately 84% of the target OS events have occurred. The alpha will be split between the interim and final analyses using the Lan and DeMets (Lan and DeMets 1983) spending function that approximates an O’Brien Fleming approach, with the boundaries for the treatment comparison derived based upon the exact number of events at the time of analysis. The final (primary) PFS analysis for superiority will be performed when the following conditions have been met:"

For each patient, the BICR will define the overall visit response data (CR, PR, SD, PD, or NE). If a patient has had a tumor assessment that cannot be evaluated, then the patient will be assigned a visit response of NE (unless there is evidence of progression, in which case the response will be assigned as PD). Endpoints (of PFS) will be derived from the scan dates. Further details of the BICR will be documented in the Imaging Charter. Investigator RECIST 1.1-based assessments All RECIST 1.1 assessments, whether scheduled or unscheduled, will be included in the calculations. This is also regardless of whether a patient discontinues study treatment or receives another anticancer therapy. At each visit, patients will be programmatically assigned a RECIST 1.1 visit response of CR, PR, SD, or PD depending on the status of their disease compared with baseline and previous assessments. Baseline will be assessed within the 28 days prior to randomization. If a patient has had a tumor assessment that cannot be evaluated, then the patient will be assigned a visit response of NE (unless there is evidence of progression, in which case the response will be assigned as PD). The definitions of CR, PR, SD, and PD are given in Appendix E. 8.4.2.1 Dual primary endpoints PFS and OS comparing durvalumab monotherapy +SoC versus SoC alone are the dual primary endpoints. Progression-free survival PFS (per RECIST 1.1 using BICR assessments) will be defined as the time from the date of randomization until the d ate of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomized therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment. However, if the patient progresses or dies after 2 or more missed visits, the patient will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment. If the patient has no evaluable visits or does not have baseline data, they will be censored at 0 days unless t hey die within 2 visits of baseline. The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates not visit dates. RECIST 1.1 assessments/scans contributing towa rds a particular visit may be performed on different dates. The following rules will be applied: ∀ The date of progression will be determined based on the earliest of the scan dates of the component that triggered the progression for the adjudicated reviewer selecting PD or of reviewer, where both select PD as a timepoint response and there is no adjudication for central review (BICR)."

Note: For target lesions, only the latest scan d ate will be recorded out of all scans performed at that assessment for the target lesions. Similarly, for non-target lesions, only the latest scan date will be recorded out of all scans performed at that assessment for the non-target lesions. For Treatment Arms 1 and 2, patients with a single disease progression and with no further tumor assessment scans will be treated as PD in the analysis. In the absence of significant clinical deterioration, the investigational site will be advised to have the patient continue in their randomized experimental arms until ra diological progression is confirmed ( Appendix E) . If progression is not confirmed, the patient should continue in their randomized experimental arms and on-treatment assessments. For Treatment Arm 3, at least 1 scan documenting unequivocal radiographic progression. Overall survival OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Note: Survival calls will be made following the d ate of data cut-off for the analysis (these contacts should generally occur within 7 days of the data cut-off). If patients are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is after the data cut-off date, these patients will be censored at the date of data cut-off. Death dates may be found by checking publicly available death registries. 8.4.2.2 Secondary endpoints Objective response rateORR (per RECIST 1.1 using BICR assessments) is defined as the number (%) of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR. Data obtained up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR. Patients who go off treatment without progression, receive a subsequent therapy, and then respond will not be included as responders in the ORR.

Second progression status will be reviewed (q6w for the first 12 weeks relative to the date of rando mization a nd q8w thereafter) following the progression event used for the primary variable PFS (the first progression) and status recorded. Patients who are alive and in wh om a second disease progression has not been observed should be censored at the last time known to be alive, without a second disease progression, that is, censored at the latest of the PFS or PFS2 assessment date if the patient has not had a second progression or death. Proportion of patients alive and progression free at 12 months The APF12 will be defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed using BICR assessments) at 12 months. Best objective response BoR will be calculated based on the overall visit responses from each RECIST 1.1 assessment, described in Appendix E. It is the best response a patient has had during their time in the study up until RECIST progression or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of RECIST 1.1 progression, as determined by BICR. Categorization of BoR will be based on RECIST (Appendix E) using the following response categories: CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE. BoR will be determined programmat ically base d on RECIST 1.1 using all BICR assessments up until the first progression event.

AEs (both in terms of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] preferred terms and CTCAE grade) will be listed individually by patient. Any AE occurring before treatment with IP will be included in the data listings but will not be included in the summary tables of AEs. Any AE occurring within 90 days of discontinuation of the last dose in all treatment arms, may be included in the AE summaries, but the majority of those summaries will omit those AEs observed after a patient has received further systemic non-protocol therapy for cancer. Further details will be provided in the SAP. Any events in the period that occur after a patient has received further therapy for cancer (following discontinuation of IP) will be flagged in the data listings. A separate data listing of AEs occurring more than 90 days after discontinuation of study drug in all treatment arms will be produced. These events will not be included in AE summaries. 8.4.3.2 Other significant adverse events During the evaluation of the AE data, an AstraZeneca medically qualified expert will review the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation. Based on the expert’s judgment, significant AEs of particular clinical importance may, after consultation with the Global Patient Safety Ph ysician, be considered as other significant adverse events (OAEs) and reported as such in the CSR. A similar review of laboratory/vital signs/ECG data will be performed fo r identification of OAEs. Ex amples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities and certain events that lead to intervention (other than those already classified as serious) or significant additional treatment. 8.4.3.3 Safety assessments For the change from baseline summaries for v ital signs, laboratory data, ECGs, a nd physical examination, the baseline value will be the latest result obtained prior to the start of study treatment.

All PRO analyses will be based on the full analysis set (FAS; ITT population) and the PD-L1<50% analysis sets, unless otherwise stated. The clinical meaningfulness threshold of the PRO analyses described below will be provided in the SAP. 8.4.4.1 EORTC QLQ-C30 The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions that can be combined to produce 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, a nd social), 3 symptom s cales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), 5 individual items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, and diarrhea), and a global measure of health status. The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be scored according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual ( Fayers et al 2001) . An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 will be derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items, each of the functional scales, and the global health status scale in the EORTC QLQ- C30 according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual. Higher scores on the global health status and functioning scales indicate better health status/function, but higher scores on symptom scales/items represent greater symptom severity. Changes in score compared with baseline will be evaluated. For each subscale, if <50% of the subscale items are missing, then the subscale score will be divided by the number of non-missing items and multiplied by the total number of items on the subscales (Fayers et al 2001) . If at least 50% of the items are missing, then that subscale will be treated as missing. Missing single items are treated as missing. The reason for any missing questionnaire will be identified and recorded. If there is evidence that the missing data are systematic, missing values will be handled to ensure that any possible bias is minimized. Time to HRQoL/function deterioration For the following HRQoL items of the EORTC QLQ-C30, time to deterioration will be analyzed: ∀ The Global Health Status/ QoL scale consisting of items 29 and 30 of the EORTC QLQ-C30.

Patients are asked to rate their overall health and overall quality of life on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). Time to deterioration will be defined as the time from the date of rando mization until the date of the first clinically meaningful deterioration that is confirmed at a subsequent visit or death (by any cause) in the absence of a clinically mean ingful deterioration, re gardless of whether the patient withdraws from study treatment or r eceives another anticancer therapy prior to HRQoL/function deterioration. Patients wi th a single deterioration and with no further assessments will be treated as deteriorated in the analysis. Death will be included as an event only if the d eath occurs within 2 visits of the last PRO assessment where the HRQoL/function change could be evaluated. Patients whose HRQoL (as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30) has not shown a clinically meaningful deterioration and who are alive at the time of the analysis will be censored at the time of their last PRO assessment where the HRQo L/function could be ev aluated. Also, if HRQoL deteriorates after 2 or more missed PRO a ssessment visits or if the patient dies after 2 or more missed PRO assessment visits, the patient will be censored at the time of the last PRO assessment where HRQoL/function could be evaluated. If a patient has no evaluable visits or does not have baseline data they will be censored at 0 days. Symptom improvement rate The symptom improvement rate will be defined as the number (%) of patients with 2 consecutive assessments at least 14 days apart that show a clinically meaningful improvement in that symptom from baseline. HRQoL/function improvement rate The HRQoL/function improvement rate will be defined as the number (%) of patients with 2 consecutive assessments at least 14 days apart that show a clinically meaningful improvement in that scale from baseline. 8.4.4.2 Lung cancer module (EORTC QLQ-LC13) The QLQ-LC13 is a lung cancer specific module from the EORTC for lung cancer comprising 13 questions to assess lung cancer symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and site-specific pain), treatment-related symptoms (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication. Changes in score compared with baseline will be evaluated. Time to symptom deterioration For each of the following key symptom scales /items in the QLQ-LC13 and QLQ-C30, time to deterioration will be analyzed: ∀ Dyspnea: multi-item scale based on 3 questi ons: (“Were you short of breath when you rested; walked; climbed stairs?”), LC13,"

The scoring approach for the QLQ-LC13 is ident ical in principle to that for the symptom scales/single items of the EORTC QLQ-C30. Time to symptom d eterioration will be defined as the time from the date of rando mization until the date of the first clinically meaningful symptom deterioration that is confirmed at a subsequent visit or death (by any cause) in the absence of a clinically meaningful symptom deterioration, regardless of whether the patien t withdraws from study treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to symptom dete rioration. Patients with single deterioration and no further assessments will be treated as deteriorated in the analysis. Death will be included as an event only if th e death occurs within 2 visits of the last PRO assessment where the symptom change could be evaluated.

Hypotheses will be tested using a multiple testing procedure with an alpha-exhaustive recycling strategy (Burman et al 2009) . With this approach, hypotheses will be tested in a pre-defined order as outlined in Figure 6. According to alpha (test mass) splitting and alpha recycling, if the higher level hypothesis in the MTP is rejected for superiority, the next lower level hypothesis will then be tested. The test mass that becomes available after each rejected hypothesis is recycled to lower level hypotheses not yet rejected. This testing procedure stops when the entire test mass is allocated to non- rejected hypotheses. Implementation of this pre-defined ordered testing procedure, including recycling, will strongly control type I error at 5% (2-sided), among all the dual primary endpoint s and the secondary endpoints included in MTP. The overall 5% type 1 error will be first split between the dual primary endpoints of PFS and OS so an alpha level of 1% will be allocated to the primary PFS analysis and 4% will be allocated to the primary OS analysis. If PFS primary endpoint is significant, the 1% alpha level will be recycled to the key secondary PFS comparison of Arm 1 vs Arm 3. If OS primary endpoint is significant, the 4% alpha level will be recycled to the key secondary OS comparison of Arm 1 vs Arm 3. If PFS comparison of Arm 1 vs Arm 3 is significant, the 1% alpha level will be recycled to OS comparison of Arm 1 vs Arm 3. If OS comparison of Arm 1"

If both PFS and OS comparisons of Arm 1 vs Arm 3 are significant, the available alpha level may be recycled to other comparisons. The recy cle scheme of these additional compariosns, if included in MTP, will be specified in SAP prior to DBL. The primary and secondary PFS endpoints are tested at 2 timepoints, 1 interim analysis and 1 final analysis. The primary and the key sec ondary OS endpoints are tested at 4 timepoints: 3 interim analyses and 1 final analysis. The tests including the interim and the final analyses that are for the same comparison/endpoint (ie, shown in 1 rectangle box in Figure 6) will be considered as 1 test family. As long as 1 tes t in the family can be rejected, the family is rejected. Thus, the assigned total alpha to the family will be recycled to next MTP level. So, if the interim or final analyses indicate superiority in the tested hypothesis, then subsequent analyses of endpoints will be performed hierarchically in accordance with the MTP strategy. The alpha level allocated to th e interim or final analyses will be determined by the Lan DeMets (Lan and DeMets 1983) spending function that approximates an O’Brien Fleming approach, where the alpha level applied at the interim depends upon the proportion of information available at time of the analysis. A separate Lan DeMets (O’Brien Fleming) spending function will be used to determine the alpha level at the interim and final analyses for the next lower level of hypothesis tes ting under MTP based on the information proportion of that lower level of hypothesis. If the interim results do not meet the criterion of stopping for superiority for a given hypothesis, then follow-up will continue until the next target number of events for that comparison has been observed, following which the hypothesis will be re-tested. If the hypothesis is then rejected, subsequent testing will continue hierarchically in accordance with the MTP strategy. Assuming that 1% alpha level is available to a PFS hypothesis testing, if exactly 80% of the final target PFS events are available at the time of the interim, the 2 sided alpha level to be applied for the interim and final analyses of PFS would be 0.0034 and 0.009, respectively. Assuming that 4% alpha level is available to a OS hypothesis testing, and if exactly 45%, 61% and 84% of the OS events required at the time of the final OS analysis are available at the times of the interim analyses, the 2-sided alpha level to be applied for the first interim, second interim, third interim and final analyses of OS would be 0.001, 0.0055, 0.0204 and 0.033 respectively.

The effect of experimental arms versus SoC arm will be estimated by the HR together with its corresponding 95% CI and p-value. The HR and its CI can be estimated from the Cox proportional hazards model ( Cox 1972) .

The midpoint between the time of progression and the previous evaluable RECIST assessment will be analyzed using a log-rank test. For patients whose death was treated as PFS event, the date of death will be used to derive the PFS time used in the analysis. This approach has been shown to be robust even in highly asymmetric assessment schedules (Sun and Chen 2010) . Attrition bias will be assessed by repeating the PFS analysis except that the actual PFS event times, rather than the censored times, of patients who progressed or died in the absence of progression immediately following 2 or more non-evaluable tumor assessments will be included. In addition, patients who take subse quent therapy prior to progression or death will be censored at their last evaluable assessment prior to taking the subsequent therapy. This analysis will be supported by a Kaplan-Meier plot of the time to censoring where the censoring indicator of the PFS analysis is reversed. Ascertainment bias will be assessed by analyzing the site Investigator data. The stratified log-rank test will be repeated on the programmatically derived PFS using the site Investigator data based upon RECIST 1.1. The HR and CI will be presented. If there is an important discrepancy between the primary analysis using the BICR assessments and this sensitivity analysis using Investigator assessments, the proportion of patients with site but no central confirmation of progression will be summarized; such patients have the potential to introduce bias in the central rev iew due to informative censoring. An approach that imputes an event at the next visit in the central review analysis may help inform the most likely HR value (Fehrenbacher et al 2016, Fleischer et al 2011) , but only if an important discrepancy exists. Subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing PFS (per RECIST 1.1) between experimental arms versus SoC arm in the following subgroups of the FAS (but not limited to): ∀ Sex (male versus female) ∀ Age at randomization (<65 versus ≥65 years of age) ∀ PD-L1 status (PD-L1 TC ≥50% versus TC <50%) ∀ Histology (squamous versus non-squamous) ∀ Chemotherapy (abraxane doublet versus pemetrexed doublet versus gemcitabine doublet) ∀ Smoking (current smoker, former smoker, never smoker) ∀ Race (Asian versus non-Asian)CCI"

The purpose of the subgroup analyses is to assess the consistency of treatment effect across expected prognostic and/or predictive factors. No adjustment to the significance level for testing of the subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be made since all these analyses will be considered supportive of the analysis of PFS. Unless there is a marked difference between the results of the statistical analyses of the PFS from the BICR data and that of the site Investigator tumor data, these subgroup analyses will only be performed on the PFS endpoint using the BICR data. Cox proportional hazards modeling will be employed to assess the effect of covariates on the HR estimate. Before embarking on more detailed modeling, an initial model will be constructed containing treatment and the stratification factors alone to ensure that any output from the Cox modeling is likely to be consistent with the results of the stratified log-rank test. Interactions between treatment and stratification factor will also be tested to rule out any qualitative interaction using the approach of Gail and Simon (Gail and Simon 1985) . Additionally, for each subgroup, the HR (for the treatment comparisons of interest) and 95% CI will be calculated from a single model that contains treatment and subgroup.

Details of the plan and communication process will be provided in the SAP and the IDMC Charter. In addition, one interim analysis of PFS will be performed when approximately 80% of the target PFS events have occurred. Three interim analyses of overall survival (OS) will be performed; the first at the time of the interim PFS analysis (approximately 45% of the target OS events), the second at the time of the primary PFS analysis (approximately 61% of the target OS events) and the third when approximately 84% of the target OS events have occurred. The interim analyses will be performed for the analyses specified in multiple testing procedure, refer to Section 8.5. It is expected that global recruitment will have completed prior to the results of the interim analyses being available. The Lan DeMets spending function that approximates an O’Brien Fleming approach will be used to account for multiplicity i ntroduced by including the interim analysis for superiority (Lan and DeMets 1983) .

This is to ensure adequate Chinese patient participation to satisfy CFDA requireme nts to evaluate consistency in safety and efficacy in Chinese patients. If China enrollment cannot complete prior to the last patient first visit (LPFV) of the global cohort, then the follo wing portion of this section will be applied. The global cohort will enroll approximately 2000 patients to randomize approximately 1000 patients. The China cohort consists of all patients from sites in China and enrolled prior to the last patient last visit of the global cohort. The China cohort has up to 180 randomized patients, including up to totally 135 patients with PD-L1 TC <50%. The global cohort consists of all patients recruited by the documented date of LPFV of the global cohort. Global recruitment will be complete once approximately 1000 patients have been randomized. The recruitment across all sites will then be closed except for those sites in China, where recruitment of patients will continue. Hence, a patient randomized in the China cohort prior to the LPFV of the global cohort enrollment will be included in both the global FAS and the China FAS. A patient randomized in the China cohort after the LPFV of the global cohort enrollment will be included only in the China FAS. Per CFDA guidance, in addition to the eval uation of the global cohort data for primary, secondary and safety objectives, evaluation of consistency in efficacy and safety in Chinese and Asian populations is required to facilitate the benefit-risk assessment for Chinese patients. Hence, the safety and efficacy data in the China cohort will be analyzed separately where the same endpoint definitions (as described in Section 8.4) and the same analysis methods (as detailed in Section 8.5) are applied. The China FAS will include all patients randomized in the China cohort and will be used for all China-only eff icacy analyses. The China safety analysis set will consist of all patients recruited in the China cohort who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and for whom post-dose data are available. Efficacy analyses for the China cohort w ill be pe rformed when the PFS and/or OS data from the patients from China are of similar maturity at which significant clinical efficacy is established in the global cohort, eg, if PFS efficacy is established at the PFS interim analysis, a similar maturity will be used for the consistency evaluation. All statistical an alyses will be considered exploratory and only performed if sufficient numbers of events or patients are available (eg, ≥20 OS or PFS events). Unless specified otherwise, descriptive statistics only will be prese nted. No adjustment for multiplicity will be made and the procedure for hierarchical testing detailed in Section 8.5will not be followed. PFS and OS efficacy evaluation for the China cohort will be performed once, respectively. Details of the China cohort and Asian population analyses, including the vendor to perform the analyses, will be specified in the China supplementary SAP, which is to be finalized before the global cohort data locks for analysis."

Hospitalization Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself an SAE, although the reasons for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not consid ered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided th at it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. Important medical event or medical intervention Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalization, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgment must be used. ∀ Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring IV hydrocortisone treatment ∀ Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine ∀ Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm ∀ Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization ∀ Development of drug dependency or drug abuse"

Exposure to suspect drug. Has the patient actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? ∀ Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties? ∀ De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug? ∀ No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another etiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. ∀ Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge. ∀ Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory inve stigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship. In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: ∀ Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug? ∀ Is there a known mechanism? Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’. Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility."

Introduction This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately report cases of Hy’s Law. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistry. Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalities can be found in Sections 5.2.1 and 6.3.8 of the protocol. During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry. The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for the determination of PHL and HL events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study vi sits and other visits including central and all local laboratory evaluations even if collected out side of the study visits; for example, PHL criteria could be met by an elevated ALT from a central laboratory and/or elevated TBL from a local laboratory. The Investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations in liver biochemistry) for possible PHL events. The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in the review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alterna tive explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting procedures. D2. Definitions Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥2 × ULN at any point during the study following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)."

For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur. D3. Identification of Potential Hy’s Law cases In order to identify cases of PHL it is importan t to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination: ∀ ALT ≥3 × ULN ∀ AST ≥3 × ULN ∀ TBL ≥2 × ULN Local laboratories being used: The Investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the identif ication criteria are met will: ∀ Notify the AstraZeneca representative ∀ Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see 2 definitions within this Appendix for definition) by reviewing la boratory reports from all previous visits ∀ Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory eCRF D4.

Additional special guidance is provided for determination of confirmation of radiological progression. Definition of measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions Only patients with measurable target disease at baseline should be included in the study. Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable lesion which has not been previously irradiated. Tumor lesions selected for screening biopsy should not be selected as target lesions (TLs), unless imaging occurred at least ~2 weeks after biopsy, allowing t ime for healing. Measurable: A lesion that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis 1diameter of ≥15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. Non-measurable: ∀ All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 mm to <15 mm short axis diameter at baseline2). ∀ Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by CT or MRI. ∀ Previously irradiated lesions 3(see exception below for Target lesions) 1 The short axis is defined as the longest axis perpendicular to long axis 2 Nodes with <10 mm short axis diameter are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed as non-target lesions (NTLs). 3. Localised post-radiation changes which affect lesion sizes may occur. Therefore, lesions that have been previously irradiated are typically considered non-measurable and should be selected as NTL at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment."

Blastic lesions are considered non-measurable. ∀ Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for measurability from a radiological point of view , but if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these should be selected as TLs. Target lesions: A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TLs at baseline. Lymph nodes, in any location (local/regional and distant), are collectively considered as a single organ, with a maximum of 2 lymph nodes as TLs. A bilateral organ (eg, adrenal glands), a segmented organ (eg, liver), or multilobed organ (eg, lung) is each considered as a single organ. If there are no other target lesions available, previously irradiated lesions may be considered measurable and selected as TLs provided they fulfil the other criteria for measurability. Tumor lesions selected for screening biopsy should not be selected as TLs, unless imaging occurred at least ~2 weeks after biopsy, allowing time for healing. Non-target lesions: Additional measurable lesions not recorded as TL and non-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as NTLs at baseline. Methods of assessment ∀ The same method of assessment on the same imaging technique should be used to characterize each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow-up visits. ∀ A summary of the methods to be used for RECIST 1.1 assessment is provided in Table 14, and those excluded from tumor assessments for this study are highlighted with the rationale provided."

CT and MRI CT and MRI, each preferably with intravenous (IV) contrast, are generally considered to generate the best currently available and reproducible images for measurement of TL, assessment of NTL, and identification of any new lesions. It is recommended that CT examinations of the chest and abdomen (including the entire liver and both adrenal glands) will be used to assess tumor burden at baseline and follow-up visits. Any other areas of disease involvement (eg, pelvis, brain) should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual patients. In patients who are sensitive to IV CT contrast, a non-contrast CT examination of the chest and an MRI with IV contrast of the abdomen (and pelvis) is appropriate. In patients with severely compromised renal function a non-contrast CT examination of the chest and abdomen is appropriate. For brain lesion assessment, MRI with IV contrast is the preferred method over IV contrast enhanced CT. It is strongly recommended to maintain use of the same imaging modality (CT or MRI), acquisition protocol, facility and scanner across all imaging time points per patient. Clinical examination Clinical examination of tumors (by visual inspecti on or manual palpation) will not be used for RECIST 1.1 assessments. Tumors identified by clinical examination will need to be assessed by correlative CT or MRI anatomical scans. Chest X-ray Chest X-ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL. Chest X-ray can, however, be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions. Plain X-ray Plain X-ray may be used as a method of assessment for bone NTL and to identify the presence of new bone lesions. Ultrasound Ultrasound examination will not be used for RECIST 1.1 assessment of tumors as it is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumor size, and it is"

Tumors identified by ultrasound will need to be assessed by correlative CT or MRI anatomical scan. Endoscopy and laparoscopy Endoscopy and laparoscopy will not be used for tumor assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumor assessment. Tumor markers Tumor markers on cytological or histological (biopsy) samples will not be used for tumor response assessments as per RECIST 1.1. Histology and Cytology Histology on tumor biopsy samples will not be used as part of the tumor response assessment as per RECIST 1.1. Results of cytological examination for the neoplastic origin of any fluid accumulation/effusion (e.g. ascites, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion) that appears or worsens during the study will not be used as part of the tumor response assessment in this study. An effusion that appears or significantly worsens (from trace to large) radiologically by CT/MRI anatomical scans will be considered to be disease progression due to New Lesions or progression of NTLs, respectively. Isotopic bone scan Bone lesions identified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by CT, MRI, or X-ray at baseline should be recorded as NTL and followed by the same method as per baseline assessment. Isotopic bone scans may be used as a method of assessment to identify the presence of new bone lesions at follow-up visits. New lesions may be recorded in case positive hot-spots appear on a bone scan that were not present on a previous bone scan; however, a newly observed equivocal hot-spot on a bone scan which cannot be verified with correlative imaging (CT, MRI, X-ray) of the same anatomical region shall not be the only trigger for a progressive disease (PD) assessment at that timepoint. FDG-PET scan 18F-Fluoro-de oxyglucose positron emission to mography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, according to the following algorithm: New lesions will be recorded where there is positive 18F-Fluoro-d eoxyglucose uptake3not present on baseline or prior FDG-PET scan or in a location corresponding to a new lesion on CT/MRI at the same follow-up visit. If there is no baseline or prior FDG-PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on CT/MRI scans 3"

At present, low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined FDG-PET/CT scan are of limited use in anatomically-based efficacy assessments, and it is therefore suggested that they should not substitute for dedicated diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT scans for tumor measurements by RECIST 1.1. In exceptional situations, if a site can document that the CT performed, as part of a PET/CT examination, is of identical diagnostic quality (with IV contrast) to a dedicated diagnostic CT scan, then the CT portion of the PET/CT can be used for RECIST 1.1 tumor assessments. Caution that the PET portion of the PET/CT could introduce additional data that may bias an Inve stigator if it is not routinely or serially performed. Tumor response evaluation Schedule of evaluation The methods of assessment of tumor burden used at baseline CT/MRI scans of the chest and abdomen (including the entire liver and both adrenal glands) must be used at each subsequent follow-up assessment. Additional imaging may be performed based on the signs and symptoms of the patient, eg, new lesions at follow-up. Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before the date of randomization, and id eally should be performed as close as possible to the start of IP. Efficacy by RECIST 1.1 for all patients will be assessed according to the schedules described in Table 2 and Table 3 of the CSP. If an unscheduled assessment is performed, and the patient has not progressed, every attempt shoul d be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their scheduled imaging visits. For patients who discontinue study drug due to tox icity in the absence of clinical progression or unequivocal radiologic evidence of progression, tumor assessments should be continued according to the original imaging schedule (Table 2 and Table 3 of the CSP). Target lesions Documentation of target lesionsA maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including lymph nodes collectively considered as a single organ), representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline. TLs should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions or short axis diameter for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected. The site and location of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes). All measurements should be recorded in"

At baseline the sum of the diameter s for all TL will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters. Special cases: ∀ For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter. For pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis. ∀ If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is >5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan. ∀ If a TL has completely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. If a lesion appears in the same location on a subsequent scan, it will be recorded as a New Lesion. ∀ If a TL splits into two or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts. ∀ If two or more TLs merge then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be recorded for one of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion(s). ∀ If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned. If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. ∀ If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large , provide an estimate of the size of the lesion. ∀ When a TL has had any intervention eg, definitive radiotherapy, embolization, surgery, etc during the study, the size of the TL should st ill be provided where possible and the intervention recorded in the RECIST case report form for that time-point and in all subsequent TL assessments (see ‘Not evaluable’ in Table 15) . If a TL has been completely remove d (surgery) or disappears following an intervention, the diameter should be recorded as 0 mm.

A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more NTLs is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. New lesions Details of any new lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment. The presence of one or more new lesions is assessed as progression. The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumor assessments should be continued until the previously new lesion has been assessed as unequivocal and then the progression date should be declared using the date of the initial scan when the new lesion first appeared. A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new les ion and will indicate disease progression. If a TL has completely disappeared and a lesion appears in the same location on a subsequent scan, it will be recorded as a New Lesion. Symptomatic deterioration Symptomatic (clinical) deterioration is not a descri ptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy. Patients with ‘symptomatic deterioration’ requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective radiological evidence of disease progression at that time should continue to undergo tumor assessments where clinically feasible on their regular imaging schedule.

The management of patients will be based in part upon the results of the RECIST 1.1 assessment conducted by the Investigator. Further details of the BICR will be documented in the Independent Review Charter, (also referred to as ‘Imaging Charter’). Specifications for radiological anatomical imaging These notes are recommendations for use in clinical studies. The use of standardized protocols for CT and MRI allows comparability both within and between different studies, irrespective of where the examination has been undertaken. If specified, all images will be collected, quality ch ecked and stored centrally by the imaging CRO appointed by AstraZeneca. Guidelines for image acquisition, anonymization/deidentification, storage at the inve stigative site as source data and transfer to the imaging CRO will be provided in a separate document. The management of patients will be based solely upon the local assessments conducted by the Investigator. Also if specified, further details of the BICR will be documented in the Independent Review Charter (also referred to as the ‘Imaging Charter’). CT Scan CT scans of the chest and abdomen should be contiguous throughout all the anatomic region of interest. The most critical CT image acquisition para meters for optimal tumor evaluation using RECIST 1.1 are anatomic coverage, contrast administration, slice thickness, and reconstruction interval. a. Anatomic coverage: Optimal anatomic coverage for most solid tumors is the chest and abdomen. Coverage should encompass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the disease under evaluation and should additionally investigate areas that may be involved based on signs and symptoms of individual patients. Because a lesion later identified in a body part not scanned at baseline would be considered as a new lesion representing disease progression, careful consideration should be given to the extent of imaging coverage at baseline and at subsequent follow-up time points. This will enable better consistency not only of tumor measurements but also identification of new disease. b. IV contrast administration : Optimal visualization and measurement of metastases in solid tumors requires consistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrast as well as t iming of scanning. Typically, most abdominal imaging is performed during the portal venous phase and (optimally) about the same time frame after injection on each examination. An adequate volume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are demonstrated to best effect and a consistent method is used on subsequent examinations for any given patient. It is very important that the same techni que be used at baseline and on follow- up examinations for a given patient. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non-contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or"

Each case should be discussed with th e radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward. Care must be taken in measurement of TLs on a different mod ality and interpretation of non-target disease or new lesions, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size using a new modality. Oral contrast is recommended to help visualize and differentiate structures in the abdomen. If iodine contrast media is medically contraindicated at baseline or at any time during the course of the study then the recommended met hods are: CT thoracic (chest) examination without contrast and abdominal (and pelvic) MRI with contrast. If MRI cannot be performed then CT without IV contrast is an option for the thorax and abdomen (and pelvis) examination. For brain imaging, MRI with IV contrast is the preferred method. c. Slice thickness and reconstruction interval: It is recommended that CT scans be performed at 5mm contiguous slice thickness and this guideline presumes a minimum 5 mm thickness in recommendations for measurable lesion definition. Exceptionally, particular institutions may perform medically acceptable scans at slice thicknesses greater than 5 mm. If this occurs, the minimum size of measurable lesions at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scans. All window settings should be included in the assessment, particularly in the thorax where lung and soft tissue windows should be considered. When measuring lesions, the TL should be measured on the same window setting for repeated examinations throughout the study. All images from each examination should be included in the assessment and not “selected” images of the apparent lesion. MRI Scan MRI has excellent contrast, spatial and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. The modality used at follow-up s hould be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. Generally, axial imaging of the abdomen (and other anatomies eg pelvis, neck) with T1 and T2 weighted imaging along with gadolinium-enhanced imaging can be performed. The field of view, matrix, number of excitations, phase encoding steps, use of fat suppression and fast sequences should be optimized for the specific body part being imaged as well as the scanner utilized. CT of the chest is typically recommended over MRI due to significant motion artefacts (heart, major blood vessels, breathing) associated with MRI. It is beyond the scope of this appendix to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques if possible. For these reasons, CT is the imaging modality of choice."

These changes should only be implemented if allowable by local/regional guidelines and following agreement from the sponsor. G 1 Reconsent of Study Participants During Study Interruptions During study interruptions, it may not be possib le for the participants to complete study visits and assessments on site and alternative means for carrying out the visits and assessments may be necessary, eg, remote visits. Reconsent s hould be obtained for the alternative means of carrying out visits and assessments and should be obtained prior to performing the procedures described in Sections 0to 0. Local and regional regulations and/or guidelines regarding reconsent of study participants should be ch ecked and followed. Reconsent may be verbal if allowed by local and regional guidelines (note, in the case of verbal reconsent the ICF should be signed at the participant’s next contact with the study site). Visiting the study sites for the sole purpose of obtaining reconsent should be avoided. G 2 Rescreening of Participants to Reconfirm Study Eligibility Additional rescreening for screen failure due to study disruption can be performed in previously screened participants. The investigator should confirm this with the designated study clinical lead. In addition, during study disruption there may be a delay between confirming eligibility of a participants and either enrolment into the study or commencing of dosing with study intervention. If this delay is outside the screening window specified in Section 4.1 the participant will need to be rescreened to reconfirm eligibility before commencing study procedures. This will provide another opportunity to re-screen a participant in addition to that detailed in Section 3.10.1. The procedures detailed in Section 4.1 must be undertaken to confirm eligibility using the same randomisation number as for the participant."

Supplies will be provided for a safe and efficient visit. The qualified HCP will be expected to collect information per the CSP. G 4 Telemedicine Visit to Replace On-site Visit (Where Applicable) In this appendix the term telemedicine visit refers to remote contact with the participants using telecommunications technology including phone calls, virtual or video visits, and mobile health devices. During a civil crisis, natural disaster, or public health crisis, on-site visits may be replaced by a telemedicine visit if allowed by local/regional guidelines. Having a telemedicine contact with the participants will allow AEs, concomitant medication to be reported and documented. G 5 Data Capture During Telemedicine or Home/Remote Visits Data collected during telemedicine or home/remote visits will be captured by the qualified HCP from the study site or TPV service in the source documents, or by the participant themselves . G 6 COVID-19 Risk Assessment The safety of participants is of primary impor tance. Any potential risks of participating in the study, particularly with the added challenges due to COVID-19 outbreak, should be weighed against the anticipated benefit (see also principle 2.2 of ICH GCP). Investigators are advised to use clinical judgment in determining infection prevention precautions for study participants. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 presents a potential safety risk for cancer patients. Participants enrolling in this study may require more frequent visits to the site for study treatment administration and for study assessmen ts compared to participants receiving standard of care. Therefore, several risk mitigation factors have been implemented related to study conduct during the COVID-19 outbreak, for patient management in an event of COVID-19, and actions to be taken on study treatment (see Section 0). With these measures in place, it is considered that the anticipated potential benefits for the participants enrolled in this study outweigh the potential risks. All implemented measures prioritise trial participant safety and data validity; in case these two conflict with each other, trial participant safety s hould always prevail (see also European Medicines Agency Guidance on the management of clinical trials during the COVID-19 [coronavirus] pandemic [EMA 2020] )."

G 7 Potential Risks during COVID-19 Every effort should be made to follow the CSP. Section 0provides a dose modification and management plan for participants with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who are being treated with study intervention durvalumab and tremelimumab. The risk-benefit assessment should be carefully considered for each participant enrolling in the study based on the known safety risks related to COVID-19, individual needs, and local guidelines and restrictions. Investigators must continue to use their best clinical judgment in determining the most optimal care for participants and utmost diligence in determining their eligibility for study participation, continued study treatment, and overall assessment of benefit/risk of study treatment or participation. The sponsor must be promptly notified of a site’ s inability to perform study activities due to COVID-19 outbreak in order to minimise any potential risks. G 8 New Participant Enrolment (Only applicable for China tail) Study sites may continue to recruit new pa rticipants into the st udy provide d the following activities to preserve study integrity can be met: Upon discussion with the si te monitor, the study site has confirmed the ability to e nrol and manage new participants effectivel y and in compliance with the protocol. Data will continue to be entered into the eCRF and queries resolved in a timely manner. Per CSP Exclusion Criterion 1 (see CSP Section 3.2), participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection are not eligible for the study participation and hence such participants (including those who have confirmed COVID 19) should not be included for study participation. G 9 Study Treatment Administration If an AE or SAE is associated with COVID-19, the investigator should determine whether the participants’ treatment with investigational product should continue, be interrupted, or be discontinued in accordance with the CSP. AEs, SAEs, cycle delays and/or treatment suspensions associated with COVID-19 along with logistical i ssues should be reported according to the eCRF Completion Guidelines."

In case it is not feasible to perform safety assessments, study intervention should be interrupted until such assessments can be completed. G 10.1 If a Participant has an Event Suspected to be COVID-19 Delay or omit study intervention as a ppropriate and test for COVID-19 per local health authority or institutional guidance. -Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 include but are not limited to new onset of fever, new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and sometimes abnormal chest imaging and may be similar to those of an imAE. -In accordance with the CSP and the TMGs for imAEs, thorough evaluation should be performed to accurately identify the underlying pathology in case an AE is encountered for a participant. -If COVID-19 is ruled out, study intervention may be resumed per the CSP. -If COVID-19 is confirmed or diagnosis still suspected after evaluation , manage COVID- 19 per local guidance until full recovery. G 10.2 Participants with Confirmed COVID-19 Participants with confirmed COVID-19 (by local laboratory testing and/or combination of key symptoms) should have study interventi on withheld and COVID-19 managed per local guidance. In case of confirmed COVID-19 and a simultaneous imAE requiring treatment, investigators are advised to apply clinical judgement regarding the use of corticosteroids as per the durvalumab/tremelimumab TMGs. This includes also the consideration of alternate immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids for imAE management, depending on the individual participant’s presentation (Curigliano et al 2020) . G 10.3 Restarting Study Intervention Study intervention must not be resumed until recovery from COVID-19 (eg, confirmed by imaging, lab testing and/or absence of symptoms) and COVID-19-specific treatment has been completed per local guidance."

G 10.4 Vaccination Against COVID-19 Protocol restrictions applying to live attenuated vaccines are relevant for live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines as well. Investigators should apply their discretion assessing the risk-benefit of other types of COVID-19 vaccines for participants in clinical trials. Ideally, administration of the vaccine should be done on a different day other than the day of study drug administration to differentiate any potenti al AEs seen from the vaccine and study drug. The administration of the vaccine and any potential AEs associated with the vaccine are to be documented on the concomitant medication and AE eCRFs, respectively.
