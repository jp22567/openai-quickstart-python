Compare the impact on submaximal exercise endurance of pharmacologic therapy aimed primarily at increasing intramuscular perfusion (KNO3) versus combination therapy to increase intramuscular perfusion and mitochondrial reserve (KNO3 + NR + PLC). 2. Assess the relationship between the individual response of submaximal exercise endurance to our pharmacologic interventions and the individual response of SkM OxPhos to supplemental oxygen (O2). Primary Endpoint: 1. The primary endpoint will be the change in submaximal exercise endurance (time to fatigue at 75% of peak workload) between the interventional therapies and active control (KCl) Secondary Endpoints: 1.

While the incidence of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has decreased, that of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) continues to rise,1-5 accounting for ~50% of HF hospitalizations,4, 6, 7 and disproportionately affecting females.2, 8 Patients with HFpEF suffer mentally and physically,9, 10 similar to their HFrEF counterparts.11-16 Yet in contrast to HFrEF, there are no effective therapies for HFpEF,17 despite numerous clinical trials.18-20 One reason trials have failed may be the significant heterogeneity found across HFpEF patients,21, 22 precluding a “one-size-fits-all” approach to treatment. Indeed, this type of approach, where phenotypic differences between subjects are ignored and all subjects are treated similarly, may have masked clinically-significant benefit in some.23-25 Yet no study has prospectively evaluated a strategy to determine which HFpEF patients are likely to respond to a specific drug intervention. In this protocol, we will test novel therapies that specifically target abnormalities identified in HFpEF patients and that are associated with impaired exercise capacity. We will also test an MRI-based strategy to determine which HFpEF participants are more likely to benefit from our different therapeutic approaches. 2.2 Background The determinants of exercise capacity among HFpEF patients are heterogenous. Reduced aerobic capacity is the hallmark of HFpEF, yet exactly what limits an individual patient may be varied between individuals. In an in-depth analysis of oxygen (O2) transport during exercise by Houstis et al., 79 subjects with HFpEF and 55 controls underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing with invasive hemodynamic measurements.20 The authors found significant heterogeneity across patients with regard to the site(s) of impairment in O2 transport, even across participants with similar peak oxygen uptake (VO2,peak).20 Specifically, nearly all of the participants studied had ³ 2 significant impairments (<80% of control values) in the steps of O2 transport and utilization (alveolar ventilation, lung diffusion capacity, cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration, skeletal muscle diffusion capacity, and mitochondrial oxidative capacity). These data suggest that although exertional intolerance is the common final result, exactly which factors along the O2 transport pathway are impaired may be different among HFpEF patients, suggesting that there is marked heterogeneity in the patient population regarding the factors that limit exercise. The skeletal muscle of HFpEF patients may be an important site of exercise limitation. The study by Houstis et al. also identified that the arteriovenous O2 content difference (DAVO2) at peak exercise, a marker of skeletal muscle (SkM) oxygen utilization, is consistently impaired in HFpEF patients across several studies.20, 26, 27 In our preliminary studies, we evaluated exercise capacity in healthy individuals (n=20), HFpEF 050100150mL O2/min/kg Leg Lean MassHealthyHTNHFpEFPeak VO2, Indexed to Leg Lean Mass 51015202530mL O2/dL BloodHealthyHTNHFpEFPeak AVO2 DiffOverall p<0.001 ********Overall p<0.001**** Figure 1 – Peak VO2 and the arteriovenous O2 content difference are reduced in HFpEF.

Echocardiography was used to determine cardiac output, and the DAVO2, a marker of SM oxygen utilization, was solved using the direct Fick equation. *** adjusted p£0.001, ** adjusted p£0.01, * adjusted p<0.05"

Importantly, HFpEF subjects had a diminished DAVO2 (Fig. 1), while peak cardiac output was no different, suggesting to us that the SkM may be an important site of exercise limitation in HFpEF. The rate of skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) is reduced in HFpEF. Focusing our attention on the skeletal muscle, we then assessed SkM OxPhos (Healthy=20, HTN=17, HFpEF=14) using a novel MRI-based technique developed by our collaborators at UPenn: Creatine Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CrCEST, Fig. 2).29-33 CrCEST measures free Cr concentration, which increases during exercise as it releases from phosphocreatine (PCr) to generate ATP, and decreases during recovery as the mitochondria generate ATP and reform PCr.31, 34 CrCEST imaging has the ability to interrogate oxidative capacity in an anatomically-resolved manner, allowing for recovery parameters to be determined for individual muscle groups, without the confounding influence of non-activated intervening tissue (e.g. fat, inactivate muscle) which contributes to 31P measurements.29, 31-33 Using CrCEST, we found that the half-time of Cr recovery (t1/2,Cr) of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle, the muscle most activated by our plantar flexion protocol, was markedly prolonged in HFpEF participants, compared to both healthy and age-matched hypertensive controls (Fig. 3). Moreover, among all study participants, t1/2,Cr correlated with Peak VO2, indexed to leg lean mass (Spearman’s rho:-0.28, p=0.047) and the ventilatory threshold (VTleg lean, Spearman’s rho: -0.34, p=0.01), demonstrating an association between SkM OxPhos and a patient’s aerobic capacity. Mitochondrial function is normal in HFpEF. The prolonged SkM OxPhos seen in our HFpEF subjects (Fig. 3) may be attributable to several different abnormalities: (1) impaired mitochondrial function; (2) diminished mitochondrial volume; or (3) diminished O2 availability to respiring mitochondria.35 To investigate these possibilities further, we invited participants back to undergo a muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis (Healthy=12, HTN=9, HFpEF=11). To examine mitochondrial function, we measured O2 flux from freshly isolated mitochondria that were given a saturating level of ADP, pyruvate, and malate, finding no difference among groups. We also subjected muscle homogenates to tritiated palmitate and assessed rates of palmitate flux,36, 37 again finding no difference among groups. We then assessed mitochondrial morphology (n=50 mitochondria/subject) on electron microscopy, finding no difference in CrCEST Contrast (%) Time (s) exercise 25 20 15 10 5 0 -100 0 400 500 100 200 300 Figure 2 – Example of exercise-induced changes in Free Cr, measured by CrCEST.

While there are limitations to these techniques, including the use of isolated mitochondria as opposed to permeabilized fibers,38 these findings suggested to us that, at least at rest, isolated mitochondria in HFpEF and controls are morphologically and functionally similar. However, it could be that HFpEF patients have a lower mitochondrial volume density.35, 39 We therefore assessed SkM mitochondrial content, both by measuring citrate synthase activity and by quantifying mitochondria volume density on our electron microscopy images. We did not find evidence for decreased mitochondrial volume density in our HFpEF samples using either technique. However, a report (Healthy=17, HFpEF=20) by Dr. Kitzman’s group at Wake Forest demonstrated reduced citrate synthase activity in HFpEF,40 suggesting reduced mitochondrial content. We considered whether the discrepancy between the findings represents a Type II error, or alternatively, that decreased mitochondrial content, and hence mitochondrial reserve capacity, is a HFpEF phenotype not present in all patients. Yet whether this is the case, and determining which HFpEF patients have impaired mitochondrial reserve and thus may benefit from a mitochondrially-directed intervention, can currently only be done with a muscle biopsy. Intramuscular perfusion may be different than bulk blood flow. Finally, impaired blood flow to the lateral gastrocnemius muscle during exercise and recovery could also explain the impaired SkM OxPhos in HFpEF. In fact, numerous studies,41-43 including ours,28 demonstrate an impaired vasodilatory reserve during cycle ergometry exercise in HFpEF subjects, suggesting that HFpEF patients cannot efficiently redistribute blood flow to locomotive exercising muscle. In our initial efforts to investigate this possibility, we measured popliteal artery bulk blood flow using the same plantar flexion exercise protocol (Healthy=7, HTN=8, HFpEF=5), repeated immediately after the CrCEST studies. Although popliteal artery blood flow increased with exercise, we found no difference in peak popliteal artery blood flow between groups (p=0.26), suggesting that bulk arterial blood flow could not explain the differences in SkM OxPhos seen among the groups. Novel MRI technique to assess intramuscular perfusion: beyond bulk blood flow. Our collaborators have developed a novel technique to simultaneously quantify conduit artery flow velocity and intramuscular perfusion following plantar flexion exercise with high temporal resolution (4s): Velocity and Perfusion, Intravascular Venous Oxygen saturation, and T2* (vPIVOT).44-46 In a prior study in healthy individuals, conduit artery blood flow rate peaked 8±3 seconds after the cessation of plantar flexion exercise, yet intramuscular gastrocnemius perfusion, the muscle most activated by plantar flexion, did not peak until 101±53s (Fig. 4). The physiologic concept of importance is noting that oxygen can only be consumed after it has reached the mitochondria. To this end, measuring intramuscular perfusion, as we propose to do here using vPIVOT, is more physiologically relevant than conduit artery bulk blood flow in interpreting SkM OxPhos. VO2 kinetics are an important determinant of exercise capacity and are impaired in HFpEF. In our preliminary studies, we measured the half-time of VO2 recovery following our maximal effort cycle ergometry studies. We found that VO2 recovery was prolonged in HFpEF subjects (Half-time of VO2 recovery: Healthy Figure 4 – Conduit artery blood flow characteristics, such as peak timing, are different than those of directly measured intramuscular perfusion following plantar flexion exercise.

Importantly, across all subjects, the half-time of VO2 recovery correlated with SkM OxPhos on CrCEST (Spearman’s rho: 0.29, p=0.045) and the ventilatory threshold (Spearman’s rho: -0.29, p=0.03), reinforcing the notion that recovery kinetics are related to SkM OxPhos and portend important relationships to functional capacity.47, 48 Our results are in line with other studies that found slowed VO2 kinetics in HFpEF patients.49, 50 In healthy individuals, speeding VO2 kinetics has been shown to improve exercise endurance.51-53 However, in HFpEF, the interplay between submaximal exercise endurance, SkM OxPhos, intramuscular perfusion, and VO2 kinetics is not well-understood. We seek to fill this gap and test the hypothesis that submaximal exercise tolerance in HFpEF patients can be increased by improving SkM OxPhos. Improved exercise tolerance will allow HFpEF patients to perform his/her activities of daily living more comfortably and enhance the likelihood that a patient may engage in prescribed exercise training.54 We will test this hypothesis by evaluating pharmacologic strategies to improve submaximal exercise in HFpEF patients, while also determining the impact of our interventions on SkM OxPhos and VO2 kinetics. The therapies to be tested in this study are affordable and expected to be well-tolerated, based on many prior studies that utilized these agents. Importantly, even a small improvement in exercise tolerance is expected to allow patients to perform more activities of daily living, increasing their quality of life and independence, while potentially reducing the burden on the healthcare system. Thus, our study has the potential to have a major impact on the lives of millions of patients who suffer from this debilitating condition and who currently are without any pharmacologic treatment options. 2.2.1 Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology – Rationale for Dose Selection a) Rationale and drug dosing for inorganic nitrate, an intervention primarily targeting SkM perfusion While nitric oxide (NO) has many functions, including contributing to fuel metabolism36 and myocardial stiffness,55 NO also contributes to the exercise vasodilatory response.48, 56-59 This is particularly important for HFpEF patients, in whom numerous studies document an impaired ability to decrease systemic vascular resistance with exercise.42 In a pilot study, we tested the hypothesis that supplementation with inorganic nitrate, which can be reduced to NO in the hypoxic and acidic environment of exercising muscle,60-63 improves exercise capacity in HFpEF.64 In a 2x2 cross-over trial of 17 HFpEF subjects, we found that a single dose of 12.9 mmol of inorganic nitrate led to significant improvements in the vasodilatory reserve during exercise, allowing for greater cardiac output, higher peak VO2, and higher ventilatory thresholds (Fig. 5).64 Using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on the calf muscle during exercise, we found a tendency for oxyhemoglobin to fall to a lesser degree during exercise following inorganic P=0.0055101520Oxygen Consumption (mL/min/kg)PlaceboNitratePeak VO2P=0.03−60−40−200% Change Peak Versus BaselinePlaceboNitrateSystemic Vascular ResistanceP=0.0060100200300% Change Peak Versus BaselinePlaceboNitrateCardiac Output Figure 5 – Inorganic nitrate enhances the vasodilatory reserve in HFpEF, allowing for higher cardiac output and peak VO2 in HFpEF subjects (n=17).

Notably, other reports have identified a similar vasodilatory effect of inorganic nitrate, including a reduction in blood pressure65-74 and vascular stiffness,71, 75 and an increase in vascular conductance during exercise.48, 76, 77 These data suggest to us that the predominant effect of inorganic nitrate is to improve intramuscular perfusion during exercise.58, 78 Relevant to this proposal, we also found a trend towards improved SkM OxPhos using NIRS and a forearm exercise paradigm (p=0.083),79, 80 and a trend towards improved VO2 kinetics following submaximal exercise (p=0.089). Unfortunately, however, our experimental design precluded an assessment of whether these physiologic changes reflected improved flow or improved mitochondrial oxidative capacity, a topic to be addressed in the current proposal. One additional study also identified an ergogenic benefit to inorganic nitrate specifically in HFpEF. In a cross-over trial, Eggebeen et al. treated 20 subjects with HFpEF with 6 mmol of inorganic nitrate daily for 7 days. Submaximal exercise tolerance, defined as the exercise time at 75% peak workload, was significantly increased by inorganic nitrate (inorganic nitrate: 449±180 vs. placebo: 363±125 s, 24% increase, p=0.02).74 Other studies have also shown an improvement in VO2 kinetics with inorganic nitrate,51, 52, 81 yet none of these studies provided mechanistic data to explain the benefit. KNO3 dosing regimen. We then performed a dose finding study of potassium nitrate (KNO3) capsules specifically in HFpEF.82 We demonstrated that 6 mmol of KNO3 given three times daily appeared to be well tolerated in HFpEF patients, without clinically significant hypotension or methemoglobinemia. Additionally, we found an improvement in exercise time and quality of life.82 Based on our data, we will use a 6 mmol dose of KNO3 three times daily in this study. b. Rationale and drug dosing of nicotinamide riboside (NR) and propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC), as the intervention targeting mitochondrial reserve As shown in Fig. 5, we found several (n=4, 24%) non-responders in our study of acute inorganic nitrate, despite their having increased blood levels of nitric oxide metabolites (e.g. nitrate and nitrite).64 Similarly, in the Eggebeen et al. study, ~25% of the HFpEF subjects did not experience an increase in exercise endurance with inorganic nitrate.74 To realize the salutary benefits of inorganic nitrate, the skeletal muscle mitochondria must have the reserve capacity to utilize the additional oxygen delivered; therefore, we hypothesized that individuals who did not respond to inorganic nitrate might have impaired mitochondrial reserve. This led us to consider whether we could identify individuals who have a skeletal muscle metabolic signature consistent with an impairment in mitochondrial reserve. We executed a prospective skeletal muscle biopsy study to answer this question. As above, we did not find a decrease in mitochondrial content. However, we did find reductions in intramuscular NAD+, propionyl-CoA, and acetylcarnitine in our HFpEF muscle biopsy samples compared to controls (Fig. 6), indicating metabolic perturbations that may lead to energetic deficits and impair mitochondrial reserve. Rationale for NAD+ supplementation. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is essential for energy production given its role in carrying electrons to the electron transport chain, and it is also a necessary co-factor for the sirtuins, which deacetylate a host of proteins, including those involved in fuel metabolism83-91 and mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1a and HIF-1).91-93 NAD+ declines with aging,91, 94-98 and is lower in murine models of diabetes and obesity,86 conditions of great importance to HFpEF. Additionally, deficiencies in NAD+ limit mitochondrial ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation and render muscle more prone to weakness,97 as seen in HFpEF patients.99"

We found NAD+ concentrations to be significantly reduced in resting muscle biopsy tissue of HFpEF patients compared to controls (Healthy: 0.01±0.003, HTN: 0.01±0.003, HFpEF: 0.009±0.003 AU, p=0.039, Fig 6). Concentrations of NAD+ correlated with our CrCEST metrics of SkM OxPhos (Spearman’s rho: -0.47, p=0.01), suggesting that NAD+ supplementation has the potential to improve SkM OxPhos, perhaps by increasing mitochondrial reserve. In line with this, prior studies demonstrated several beneficial effects of increased NAD+ on the mitochondria: improved SkM OxPhos in models of aging;91, 92, 97 improved SkM oxidative metabolism and glucose tolerance in high-fat diet induced obesity;89, 93, 100 improved SkM OxPhos and mitochondrial biogenesis in mitochondrial disease models;100-105 improved exercise endurance in transgenic mouse models of increased NAD+,106, 107 increased mitochondrial respiration in humans with diabetes108 or mitochondrial myopathy104, and an increased capacity to generate acetylcarnitine in overweight/obese humans.109 Finally, supplementation with NR enhanced peripheral blood mononuclear cell mitochondrial respiration, isolated from adults with HFrEF.110 Table Examining NR Supplementation in Human Subjects (compiled Sept 2020) Author Population, n Dose/Duration Primary Outcome Results Adverse Events Airhart, 2017111 Healthy volunteers n=8 250 mg BID escalating to 1000 mg BID 9 days Whole blood [NR] and [NAD+] 1.

Importantly, while several studies have shown that NR increases whole blood NAD+ (see table above), more recent studies have additionally demonstrated that NR supplementation leads to increased markers of NAD+ metabolism specifically within human skeletal muscle.109, 117 Safety of NR Supplementation: Several studies have demonstrated the safety of NR supplementation in humans.109, 111, 113-118, 123 In a study of 8 healthy individuals, increasing doses of up to 1000 mg po BID for 2 days were well tolerated, increasing whole blood NAD+ levels by nearly 100%.111 In another study, 40 obese sedentary men were randomized to 12 weeks of NR 1000 mg po BID versus placebo. NR was well-tolerated, and there was no increase in adverse events.114 In 12 elderly men, 1000 mg of NR daily for 21 days did not lead to any adverse events.117 One additional study tested combined NR + Pterostilbene (NRPT) in 120 older adults (age 60-80) for 8 weeks. No serious adverse events were noted; however, a small increase in cholesterol (LDL and total cholesterol) was noted in the combined NR+PT groups.112 In the largest study to date,140 obese middle-aged individuals were treated with increasing doses of NR up to 1000 mg/day. This maximal dose was shown to be safe, suggesting that 1000 mg/day was consistent with the tolerable upper limit of intake,116 and in line with the findings of the European Scientific Committee that suggested an upper limit of 900 mg/day for nicotinamide in adults.124 No change in LDL/Total cholesterol was seen in the NR group. Based on these data, we will use a dose of NR of 300 mg po TID. Rationale and dosing for propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC). Our preliminary data demonstrate a reduction in propionyl-CoA and acetylcarnitine in HFpEF (Fig. 6). Acetylcarnitine acts as a supply depot for acetyl-CoA when acetyl-CoA generation is limited.125-127 It is produced by the reaction of acetyl-CoA with carnitine, via carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT), and functions to maintain a low intra-mitochondrial acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio and adequate availability of CoA for ongoing fat metabolism. Because increasing acetyl-CoA can also reduce flux through the PDH complex, maintaining a low acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio by shuttling acetyl-CoA into acetylcarnitine may also improve carbohydrate metabolism.128 In fact, L-carnitine has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and carbohydrate metabolism in both murine and human subjects.126, 129, 130 Oral L-carnitine supplementation has been shown to increase muscle carnitine levels in athletes, along with increases in PDH complex activity, demonstrating the potential utility of oral supplementation.131, 132 In our biopsy studies, muscle acetylcarnitine negatively correlated with the half-time of CrCEST recovery (Spearman’s rho: -0.42, p=0.02), suggesting that increasing acetylcarnitine could speed SkM OxPhos. In one small study of 31 HFpEF subjects, improvements in diastolic function and shortness of breath were seen following 3 months of treatment with 1500 mg of L-carnitine daily.133 In a small study of HFrEF patients, 3 grams/day of L-carnitine for 120 days led to significant increases in the maximal workload achieved during cycle ergometry.134 In another study, 2 grams/day of L-carnitine improved exercise capacity at 3 months in a randomized trial of 80 HFrEF subjects. Following this blinded period, subjects were continued in their groups for 3 years, noting an improvement in survival with L-carnitine. The only adverse effect noted was minor gastrointestinal upset in 3 subjects assigned to L-carnitine, though this did not require withdrawal.135 Propionyl-CoA is generated via the breakdown of odd chain fatty acids and branched chain amino acids (BCAA). It is then converted to succinate, providing carbons to be used in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.136-140 During exercise, TCA intermediate concentrations increase,141, 142 perhaps in order to sustain high rates of acetyl-CoA oxidation and NADH production.143 This suggests that reductions in propionyl-CoA may slow TCA cycling by impairing the expansion of its intermediates. In our preliminary data, muscle propionyl-CoA Figure 7 – NAD+ can be synthesized from nicotinamide riboside (NR). From Yoshino, 2018."

As propionic acid is toxic,139, 144, 145 prior investigation has focused on giving propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC), which is acted upon by CrAT to yield propionyl-CoA and L-carnitine.127, 138, 144, 146 As an additional benefit, PLC may have better penetration into the cell due to its more lipophilic properties than L-carnitine alone.138, 139, 147, 148 When given exogenously, PLC is taken up by the heart and skeletal muscle.149 PLC has been studied previously in HFrEF, where smaller studies demonstrated improvements in exercise capacity and left ventricular performance, using a dose of 1.5 g/day.150, 151 However, in a larger study of over 500 HFrEF subjects randomized to 1 gram PLC twice daily for 6 months, PLC did not improve exercise tolerance, though supplementation was safe.152 Interestingly, in the subgroup of patients with higher LV ejection fractions (>30% vs <30%), an increase in exercise time was seen.

Post-hoc: Subjects with a baseline LVEF between 30-40% had an improvement in exercise duration with PLC p=0.882 Additionally, several studies have examined the use of PLC for the treatment of claudications in peripheral arterial disease (reviewed in154), providing additional safety data. In the largest study, 485 patients with peripheral arterial disease and claudication were randomized to PLC 1000 mg po BID or placebo for 12 months in a parallel design across 38 centers.155 Five subjects died in each of the PLC and PB arms. Adverse events requiring treatment discontinuation occurred in 27 in the PLC arm and 30 in the PB group, and adverse events not requiring discontinuation occurred in 38 in the PLC group and 98 in the PB group.155 In the second largest study, 245 patients were studied in a randomized placebo-controlled parallel design study of up to 3 grams/day of PLC based on exercise response for 24 weeks across 13 centers.156 Eleven adverse events leading to drug discontinuation occurred in the PLC group, as compared to 3 in the placebo group; however, the adverse events requiring drug discontinuation in the PLC group were judged to be unrelated to study medication. There were 7 adverse events not requiring treatment discontinuation in the PB group and 5 in the PLC group – the most common adverse events were nausea and gastric pain. Moreover, minimal benefit was demonstrated for increasing the dose of PLC beyond 2 grams/day. Overall, these studies add to the evidence that PLC supplementation has an acceptable safety profile, with excellent tolerability. Based on all of the above, we will use a dose of PLC 1000 mg po BID. 3 Rationale for potassium chloride (KCl), as an active control Potassium is known to impact the vasculature and blood pressure.157 To isolate the benefits of our intervention to either inorganic nitrate, or the combination of inorganic nitrate+NR+PLC, we will use potassium chloride as an active control. KCl will be given in the same doses as KNO3: 6 mmol three times a day. 3.1.1 Known Potential Risks a. Potassium Nitrate – Inorganic nitrate has been tested in several human studies in HFpEF to date and is very well tolerated.64, 74, 82 In our Dose-Finding study of 12 individuals with HFpEF, 9 were treated with KNO3 as we propose to do in this study.82 KNO3 did not lead to clinically significant hypotension or methemoglobinemia.82 There was a systolic blood pressure lowering effect (approximately 12 mmHg),72, 82 though we note that HFpEF patients generally have elevated blood pressures.2 Gastrointestinal symptoms and headache were the most common side effects. Anecdotally, the gastrointestinal side effects can be mitigated by taking study medications with a meal,69 and may be related to the potassium content, as potassium is known to cause GI side effects in clinical practice.158 b. Propionyl-L-Carnitine – PLC has been used in humans with heart failure previously.152 In the largest study, 537 patients with HFrEF were randomized to PLC versus placebo (271 received PLC) at the same dose to be used in this protocol.

Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) - Several studies have reported results on various endpoints using NR supplementation in humans.111, 113, 114, 116, 118, 123 In a study of 8 healthy individuals, increasing doses of up to 1000 mg po BID for 2 days were well tolerated, increasing NAD+ levels by nearly 100%.111 More recently, 40 obese sedentary men were randomized to 12 weeks of NR 1000 mg po BID versus placebo. NR was well-tolerated, and there was no increase in adverse events with supplementation.114 Finally, in the largest study to date,140 obese middle-aged individuals were treated with increasing doses of NR up to 1000 mg/day. This maximal dose was shown to be safe, suggesting that 1000 mg/day was consistent with the tolerable upper limit of intake,116 and in line with the findings of the European Scientific Committee which suggested an upper limit of 900 mg/day for nicotinamide in adults.124 We therefore selected this dose (NR 300 mg po three times daily) to be used in this proposal. i. Possible side effects related to NR noted in the above studies include: 1. GI upset: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, transient changes in stool, bloating 2. Muscle soreness/cramping 3. Rash/flushing 4. Headache d. Potassium Chloride: The main side effect of potassium chloride in clinical practice are gastrointestinal symptoms.69, 158 We will ask subjects to take study medications with food to minimize this. Potassium itself also has an effect on the vasculature, lowering blood pressure (average of ~3/2 mmHg).158, 159 We do not expect this to lead to clinically-significant hypotension in our HFpEF participants who are generally hypertensive. Subjects with a baseline potassium >5.0 mEq/L will be excluded from the study. We note that our study seeks to use a combination of therapies in one interventional arm: • Potassium nitrate + Propionyl-L-Carnitine + Nicotinamide riboside It is possible that there will also be additional/different side effects when the combination of the above medications is administered. For example, a small study in trained individuals demonstrated that glycine propionyl-L-carnitine increased plasma nitric oxide species, suggesting that there may be an added effect with potassium nitrate due to additional nitric oxide release from PLC.160 Another study in HFrEF individuals found that PLC reduced systemic vascular resistance,139, 151 which is also a target of KNO3. On the other hand, in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, the combination of NR + L-carnitine attenuated weight gain and hepatic steatosis to a greater extent than monotherapy with either agent,161 suggesting the possibility of additional salutary benefits to the combination group. Overall, these data suggest that additional risks/benefits may be present in the combination group that will require close monitoring. As enumerated in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan, we will ensure adequate safeguards are in place for these side effects to be identified, acted upon as necessary, and documented (please see Data Safety and Monitoring Plan for additional details). Risks and Benefits Assessment: The side effect profile of the study drugs, in isolation, demonstrate acceptable tolerability. Our preliminary data, and additional data from other patient populations, support the conclusion that the supplementation strategies to be tested are rationale. At this time, there are no pharmacologic strategies that consistently show a benefit in HFpEF. Even a small improvement in exercise tolerance is expected to allow"

(b) We will also assess the respiratory exchange ratio, a metric of whole-body substrate metabolism obtained from expired gas analysis, at these same time points. Comparisons at 4 minutes of exercise will be the focus. Inorganic nitrate, PLC, and NR all have been shown to impact muscle metabolism and may alter substrate preference during submaximal exercise. Assess the impact of our interventions on muscle metabolomics Tissue metabolite concentrations: Muscle tissue concentrations of NAD+ and the NAD+ metabolome, propionyl-CoA, and the acylcarnitine profile, and inorganic nitrate will be measured. We will assess the efficacy of our supplementation strategy on altering tissue concentrations of relevant metabolites. Assess the impact of our interventions on muscle tissue respirometry Ex vivo tissue measures of substrate metabolism. We will measure tissue rates of substrate (fat and carbohydrate) metabolism in isolated mitochondria and saponin-skinned fibers. Citrate synthase, a marker of mitochondrial content, will also be assessed. In addition to our CrCEST-based measures of SkM OxPhos, we will also perform tissue-based measurements to complement the in vivo findings. Assess the impact of our interventions on the muscle proteome Muscle Proteome: Relative abundances of proteins related to NAD+ metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitochondrial OxPhos will be measured. Our supplementation strategy may alter concentrations of the proteins involved in substrate utilization and mitochondrial biogenesis AIM 2: IMPACT OF SUPPLEMENTAL O2 ON SKELETAL MUSCLE OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION CAPACITY OBJECTIVES ENDPOINTS JUSTIFICATION FOR ENDPOINTS To assess the response of SkM OxPhos to supplemental oxygen We will compare SkM OxPhos, assessed using the half-time CrCEST recovery, under both room air (FIO2=0.21) and 100% Oxygen (FIO2=1.0) conditions If a mitochondrial reserve is present, supplemental oxygen should speed SkM OxPhos. On the other hand, if no reserve is present, minimal"

This test will identify HFpEF individuals who harbor additional impairments at the mitochondria (O2-non-responsive) who are more likely to benefit from mitochondrially-directed interventions. To assess whether the contrast in the individual response to our pharmacologic interventions (KNO3 versus KNO3+PLC+NR) on submaximal exercise endurance correlates to the response of SkM OxPhos to supplemental O2 on CrCEST We will assess the correlation between the change in SkM OxPhos to supplemental oxygen and the contrast in submaximal exercise endurance between the KNO3 and the KNO3+PLC+NR arms. While KNO3 is hypothesized to improve muscle blood flow, NR and PLC are hypothesized to additionally improve mitochondrial reserve. In patients with intact mitochondrial reserve at baseline, the majority of the benefit to our supplementation strategy will be by increasing muscle blood flow, thus there will be little additional benefit to the NR+PLC. On the other hand, in patients with impaired mitochondrial reserve, the addition of NR+PLC to KNO3 will lead to more substantial improvements in exercise endurance. We will use the CrCEST response to 100% oxygen as a marker of mitochondrial reserve, which should track with the increased exercise response to combination therapy over KNO3 alone."

This design was chosen so that each participant receives all interventions in a pre-specified order across 3 periods; thus, within-subject comparisons of each pair of interventions are possible. Each interventional period will be 6 weeks in duration, separated by a 2-week wash-out period. The Investigational Drug Services (IDS) at UPenn will formulate the KCl and KNO3 capsules; the commercially obtained NR and PLC capsules will be over-encapsulated to maintain blinding. While changes to the mitochondrial proteome occur early after the initiation of an exercise program (1-2 weeks),162, 163 the timing of mitochondrial biogenesis in humans is less well known, suggesting that the longer duration of therapy chosen in this study is warranted.164 Similarly, data are unavailable to specify the washout period for a mitochondrial intervention. In a forced bedrest study, mitochondrial content and OxPhos proteins all decreased after 7 days, demonstrating rapid mitochondrial plasticity.165, 166 This suggests that our 2-week washout period is reasonable, particularly since this washout ensures an 8-week interval for measuring the outcomes after completion of one intervention. Randomization schemes will be determined by the statistician and transmitted to the pharmacy. We will split the set of 6 sequences into two sub-sequences (ABC: BCA: CAB) or its dual (ACB: BAC: CBA) and use the full sequence and the sub-sequence to create random blocks of 3 (corresponding to one of the two subsequences) or 6 (the complete sequence). To achieve a balanced design, once one sub-sequence is used, it will not be used again until its dual is selected. We will enroll 53 subjects to account for drop out. In the case of medical necessity, the Principal Investigator can request the randomization codes from IDS. Following completion of the interventional study enumerated above, subjects will return for a one-day MRI visit during which the response of SkM OxPhos to supplemental inspired oxygen (100% O2) will be assessed. The results from this MRI visit will be compared to the results obtained during the exercise tests. 5.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design HFpEF subjects suffer from multiple comorbidities that may impact exercise capacity.167-169 As such, a cross-over design, in which each participant receives all 3 interventions in randomized order, can better account for these phenotypic differences and more efficiently identify any changes in exercise endurance with our interventions, as compared to a parallel design. The limitations of a cross over study include the need for an adequate washout period, as discussed above, and the more marked impact of dropout on data acquisition. 5.3 Justification for Dose A discussion of the doses to be used in this protocol are enumerated in Section 2.2.1. The 3 arms to be tested during the supplementation portion of the study are: (1) Potassium Nitrate alone"

Both the KNO3 and the KCl will be made by the UPenn IDS, as we have done previously,82 with pharmaceutical grade product obtained from a commercial supplier (e.g. Spectrum Laboratory Products (Gardenia, CA)). Both Nicotinamide Riboside and Propionyl-L-Carnitine will be obtained commercially and delivered to UPenn IDS. UPenn IDS will over encapsulate the pills in order to maintain blinding."

Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with the completion of the study. This may include comorbid or psychiatric conditions that may impede successful completion of the protocol, or logistical concerns (e.g. inability to travel to the exercise unit). Additionally, specific exclusion criteria exist for the performance of the MRI studies**: – ANY intra-luminal implant, filter, stent, or valve replacement – ANY type of life assist device, pump, or prosthetic – ANY vascular clip or clamp – ANY surgically placed clips or clamps or bands on visceral organs – ANY intracranial implants of any type other than dental fillings – ANY non-removable piercings, jewelry, or medicinal patch – ANY personal history of intraocular injury or fragment in or around the orbit that cannot be cleared through radiologic examination – ANY personal history of bullet, shrapnel, or stabbing wounds that cannot be cleared through radiologic evaluation. ** If any of the above apply, we may investigate the issue further to ensure subject safety. This may include obtaining X-rays or reports from prior radiographic studies. We may also discuss the case with our radiologists and MRI technicians. In these circumstances, an MRI will only be performed if deemed safe by an attending radiologist on a case-by-case basis. **We note that many contemporary ICD/pacemakers are MRI-compatible. In participants with an implantable device (defibrillator or pacemaker), the specific details of the device will be reviewed and discussed with our radiologists in order to ensure the safety of the participant with that device during scanning at 3T. The participant will only undergo the MRI scan if it is deemed to be safe. If a subject is interested in participation in the study but has contraindications to the MRI portion, the subject can still be enrolled, and the MRI assessments will be omitted. 6.3 Lifestyle Considerations The following lifestyle changes will be requested during the study:"
32,page_32,"Protocol 844627 The MPMA HFpEF Trial KNO3 + PLC + NR vs. KNO3 vs. KCl in HFpEF Page 33 of 97 Confidential – V1; 12/21/20 • Subjects will be asked to follow a low-nitrate diet, avoiding the excessive intake of certain food items such as beets and arugula. • Subjects will be asked to avoid strenuous exercise for 48 hours prior to each study visit • A standardized low-nitrate dinner will be provided to each subject prior to each visit • Subjects will be asked to come to each study visit following an overnight fast • Subjects will be asked to avoid caffeine for 24 hours prior to each visit due to caffeine’s impact on SkM OxPhos and substrate utilization.174, 175 • Subjects will be asked to avoid antibacterial mouthwash during the study. Antibacterial mouthwash alters the mouth flora which is a key component in the activation of inorganic nitrate.176-179 6.4 Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not subsequently randomly assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE). Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of a specific modifiable or transient factor, such as an acute illness which is expected to improve or a recent change in medications, may be rescreened in the future when medically stable. Additionally, if a previously screen-failed subject’s clinical status changes or more information becomes subsequently available, a subject can be rescreened for inclusion. 6.5 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention 6.5.1 Recruitment Plans 1. Participants who have participated in prior research studies with our group: Over the past few years, we have successfully completed several studies in HFpEF subjects.28, 64, 82, 180 As part of our consent process, we ask for permission to contact participants in the future regarding new studies as they become available. As such, we have a list of HFpEF patients who are interested in participating in research. 2. Active recruitment of new subjects: We will leverage an existing recruitment pipeline for heart failure currently used by the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Unit (CCRU) at the University of Pennsylvania. The CCRU team includes clinical research coordinators with extensive experience in the screening of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction for participation in clinical trials (including REDUCE-LAP and various NIH funded Heart Failure trials, such as NEAT-HFpEF, KNO3CKOUT-HFpEF, and INDIE-HFpEF). Strategies and Tools to Support Study Recruitment. Numerous recruitment avenues are in place and may be used in parallel to maximize enrollment. 1. CCRU recruitment databases: The CCRU has extensive experience recruiting interested patients for HFpEF trials, including many who have expressed interest in continued engagement with new protocols after having positive experiences with our group and/or participation in Heart Failure Clinical Research Network trials and"
33,page_33,"Protocol 844627 The MPMA HFpEF Trial KNO3 + PLC + NR vs. KNO3 vs. KCl in HFpEF Page 34 of 97 Confidential – V1; 12/21/20 others. 2. Directed advertising: This may include postings on the Cardiovascular Medicine divisional website, email blasts, clinics, and cardiovascular clinical laboratories. 3. Focused efforts in high yield environments: We will conduct directed recruitment in settings where HFpEF patients are likely to present in the course of routine clinical care, including outpatient cardiology practices, the clinical echocardiography laboratory, the clinical stress testing laboratory, and inpatient cardiovascular services. 4. PennSeek and other Electronic Medical Record query tools: PennSeek is a tool to search unstructured or semi-structured medical documents currently residing in Penn Medicine’s EPIC electronic medical record and diagnostic applications (Radiology, Pathology, Cardiology, Ambulatory, etc.) to analyze and mine this data for patient care and research. PennSeek is designed to allow both refinement of search criteria and immediate review of identified cohort data to achieve the desired degree of specificity. PennSeek is available at CCRU workstations and will be used to identify lists of patients that meet eligibility for the proposed trials. Other similar search tools are available at UPenn, and new search tools are likely to be developed; these too may also be employed to identify potential participants. 5. Real-time subject identification through EPIC: The CCRU has worked with our health system electronic health records in the past to identify eligible patients and to enable ‘pop-ups’ when a patient who meets selection criteria is in clinic or is admitted to hospital. These efforts may again be employed. In addition, these events can generate notifications to the study team, providing real-time identification of potential candidates. Once identified, research coordinators may approach potential candidates and/or their physicians. 6.5.2 Retention Plans Our participant retention strategies begin with the introduction to the study and relies on frequent communication with our participants about the study protocol and the value they bring by participating in research. We include frequent phone calls to the prescreened and enrolled subjects at specified time points, including phone calls regarding the status of visits, check-ins for enrolled participants, and reminders for upcoming visits. Moreover, the frequent study visits in the describe protocol (8 visits within ~6 months) will allow many contact points between the study team and the participant, improving communication and the relationship between the participant and the study team. We will provide adequate participant compensation and will use the existing facilities in the CHPS unit, which allow flexibility of scheduling according to participants’ needs, greatly facilitating study visits, retention, and satisfaction. Based on recent experience, our retention rate is high (91% to date in the KNO3CK OUT-HFpEF trial). We plan to exclude participants who are unlikely to complete study visits due to non-compliance, psychiatric illness or major comorbidities that would impede successful completion of the protocol, substance abuse, or other social or logistic circumstances that will be judged on a case-by-case basis. In the event that recruitment is slow and jeopardizing the goals laid out in the milestones, we will consider several strategies to boost enrollment. If enrollment falls significantly below accrual benchmarks, we will expand recruitment efforts to include Penn Medicine hospitals that are farther from downtown Philadelphia, such as Chester County Hospital and Lancaster General Hospital. If enrollment is still below the benchmark, we will seek partnership with other local institutions such as Temple University and Lankenau Medical Center."

We also provide subject compensation for patient time and transportation to mitigate the burden of participation according to the following schedule: (1) Baseline Visit: Cycle exercise: $50 (2) Visit 2: Muscle Biopsy and cycle exercise: $100 (3) Visit 3: MRI study: $50 (4) Visit 4: Muscle Biopsy and cycle exercise: $100 (5) Visit 5: MRI study: $50 (6) Visit 6: Muscle Biopsy and cycle exercise: $100 (7) Visit 7: MRI study: $50 (8) Visit 8: 2 MRI studies (room air and 100% oxygen): $100 Total: $600 Participants will be paid via by Greenphire clincard after completing each visit. The study coordinator will keep track of patients using an electronic database to build-in schedule reminders. We also maintain close communication via phone/email with previous and active research subjects to mitigate patients becoming lost to follow-up. 6.6 End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all phases of the study including the last visit or the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (SoA), Appendix Section 12.1. This will include the baseline study visit, the 3 endpoint assessments (submaximal exercise and CrCEST MRI studies) following each interventional period, as well as the final MRI visit (CrCEST with and without supplemental oxygen), unless the subject chooses to curtail participation earlier for any reason. Subjects may also be removed from the study by the PI due to non-compliance, inability/unwillingness to comply with study instructions, or other unforeseen circumstances."

Study medications are to be taken with meals to minimize the risk of GI upset. One Week Tolerability Assessment: After approximately one week (range 5-9 days to account for weekends/holidays), subjects will be contacted using his/her preferred method (for example, telephone, televideo, phone, text or email) to assess tolerability. Dietary restrictions will be reinforced during this interaction. Subjects will be asked about side effects, including headache, dizziness, GI upset, nausea and lightheadedness. The presence of symptoms suggestive of orthostatic hypotension (i.e. sustained lightheadedness upon standing that does not dissipate quickly) will prompt an assessment for orthostatic vital signs (a drop in the systolic blood pressure of >20 mmHg 2-3 minutes after moving from the supine to standing position), and/or hypotension (systolic Bp<90 mmHg). If difficulties/barriers/subject preference preclude coming in for an in-person assessment (such as concerns regarding COVID-19), a subject may use a home Bp cuff to perform the orthostatic assessment, with guidance from the study staff: 1. Lie supine for approximately 5 minutes and then check the blood pressure. 2. Gradually move to a sitting position, rest there for a moment (~10-30s), and then stand upright. Subjects may hold on to something for balance. 3. Check blood pressure 2-3 minutes after standing. 4. Note the presence of any symptoms at the 2-3-minute mark after standing Note – transient lightheadedness that occurs soon after standing, but that resolves soon thereafter does not constitute a positive response. The presence of an orthostatic response (drop in systolic blood pressure of > 20 mmHg approximately 2-3 minutes after the transition from supine to standing) or hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) will lead to exclusion from the study if confirmed on a repeat assessment. In cases in which home monitoring suggests resting or orthostatic hypotension, the study subject will be encouraged to come to UPenn for a formal assessment."

As an extra safety precaution, we will perform an additional assessment of the serum potassium following drug uptitration during the first phase of the study in participants who may be at higher risk for hyperkalemia, defined as: 1. Subjects who have a baseline serum K between 4.8 and 5.0 mEq/L, AND 2. Either: (a) Potassium-sparing diuretic use (e.g. amiloride, spironolactone, triameterene), OR (b) Estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-39 mL/min/1.73m2 In these individuals, we will check a serum potassium ~1 week after the implementation of the 18 mmol/d dose. A serum potassium >5.5 mEq/L will prompt exclusion from the study. Noting that the potassium content of all 3 interventional regimens is the same (18 mEq/day), this additional safety laboratory assessment will only be done following the first study drug intervention. This laboratory assessment may be performed locally if more convenient for the participant and does not need to be fasting. Given the small amount of potassium in our supplementation strategy, we will not plan to routinely alter a participant’s pre-existing potassium supplementation, unless a high potassium (>5.0 mEq/L) is identified on baseline laboratories, prior to receiving any study medications. Changes to a participant’s background medications will be done in conjunction with the participant’s provider, and the potassium level will be rechecked following the change but prior to study drug administration. Participants will only be given study medications if the potassium upon recheck following withdrawal/reduction of potassium supplementation is < 5.0 mEq/L. 6.7.3 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability All study medications will be dispensed by the UPenn IDS in a randomized double-blind manner. (A) Potassium Nitrate: Potassium nitrate crystals will be purchased and placed into oral gelatin capsules with an inert filler (lactose monohydrate). Capsules will be prepared at the University of Pennsylvania Investigational Drug Service. Each capsule will contain 610 mg KNO3-, corresponding to 6.03 mmoles of NO3-, plus 190mg of lactose monohydrate, spray dried, NF. The dose for this trial will be 18 mmoles of NO3-/day, given as one capsule (6 mmoles) three times a day. A certificate of analysis will be obtained by the manufacturer. (B) Potassium Chloride: Potassium chloride, granular, USP (450mg) plus lactose monohydrate, spray dried, NF (300mg) will be combined and packed into an identical capsule shell. The dose for this trial will be 18 mmoles of KCl per day, given as one capsule (6 mmoles) three times a day. A certificate of analysis will be obtained by the manufacturer. (C) Nicotinamide Riboside Chloride: NR will be purchased from Chromadex as 300 mg capsules. The dose in this trial will be 300 mg three times a day. Capsules will be over-encapsulated to maintain blinding. A placebo pill of similar weight and color will be constructed by UPenn IDS. (D) Propionyl-L-Carnitine: PLC will be purchased from Biovy as 1000 mg capsules and will be over-encapsulated by UPenn IDS to maintain blinding. A placebo pill of similar weight/color will be constructed by UPenn IDS."

The commercial supplier will provide a certificate of analysis. IDS will also furnish the placebo capsules for PLC and NR that are of similar color and weight to the study medications. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) will be obtained commercially (TruNiagen). Propionyl-L-Carnitine will be obtained commercially (Biovy). The study team will randomly test and verify the composition of a random set of NR and PLC pills using mass-spectrometry and quantitative methods. Sealed bottles will be delivered to UPenn IDS. One NR/PLC pill from each lot will be given to the study team by IDS prior to dispensation of study medication from that lot to verify the authenticity of the compound using mass spectrometry/quantitative methods. The purity of the PLC/NR pills will be compared against PLC and NR obtained from a commercial supplier (e.g. SigmaAldrich) who provides a certificate of analysis. These results will be furnished to IDS and the PI prior to dispensation of study medications from that lot. We note that Niagen has been given “Generally Recognized As Safe” status. During this determination, data on the chemical purity of the compound (>99% purity) was presented (https://www.fda.gov/files/food/published/GRAS-Notice-000635--Nicotinamide-riboside-chloride.pdf; accessed 1/13/2020). 6.7.5 Formulation, Appearance, Packaging, and Labeling Potassium nitrate and potassium chloride will be obtained commercially (e.g. from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals) and encapsulated by the UPenn IDS. Nicotinamide riboside chloride will be obtained commercially from Chromadex. Propionyl-L-Carnitine will be obtained commercially from Biovy. The NR and PLC pills will be over-encapsulated to maintain blinding. UPenn IDS will construct a placebo pill for NR and PLC that will be similar in weight and appearance to the study medications. 6.8 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding Subjects will be randomized to one of six pre-specified sequences of interventions as shown in the Table below. Sequences use in the balanced 3-period 3-treatment crossover design Sequence Order of Intervention1 1 ABC 2 ACB 3 BAC 4 BCA 5 CAB"
40,page_40,"Protocol 844627 The MPMA HFpEF Trial KNO3 + PLC + NR vs. KNO3 vs. KCl in HFpEF Page 41 of 97 Confidential – V1; 12/21/20 6 CBA 1Each letter corresponds to one of the three interventions The 3x3 crossover design involves 2 interventions plus an active control and 3 periods, leading to a total of 6 unique sequences (e.g. KCl in period [P] 1; KNO3 in P2; KNO3+NR+PLC in P3). Each sequence thus includes all three possible interventions e.g. in Sequence 1, coded ABC, one possible coding is A=KCl alone, followed by B=KNO3 alone, followed by C= KNO3+ PLC + NR. UPenn IDS will assign the codes linked to the intervention and will provide study medication based on the sequence code to which the subject is randomized. For purposes of blinding, none of the study team will have access to the IDS-assigned codes except in an emergency or at unblinding. If emergency unblinding is necessary, the investigators will access the treatment code by contacting UPenn IDS. This is unlikely given the safety profile of the study medications, and if time allows will be done in consultation with the medical monitor. Regardless, in the event of emergency unblinding, both the medical monitor and the Data Safety Monitoring Board overseeing this study will be informed. RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURE: The study statistician, Dr. Putt, will prepare a randomization table for inclusion in Redcap. Each subject who enrolls and consents will be randomized to the next available sequence based on consecutive rows of the table. In the event that a subject consents and enrolls but does not obtain medication, their sequence will be assigned to the next available subject. To ensure balance over the study duration, the randomization table will be prepared in random blocks of 6 or 12. 6.9 Study Intervention Adherence Subjects will bring all study medications to their final endpoint assessment for each phase (i.e. Visit 3 for Period 1, Visit 5 for Period 2). Study coordinators will manually count the remaining pills in each bottle and compare against the number of pills expected to be taken to determine compliance. Non-compliance will be defined as taking < 80% of study medications. Remaining study medications will be returned to UPenn IDS for disposal. 6.10 Concomitant Therapy For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a properly authorized/licensed clinician. Medications to be reported in the Case Report Form (CRF) are concomitant prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and supplements. Subjects will continue on all of their previously prescribed medications during this trial. Except in cases of clinical necessity, alterations to background medications will be discouraged. Due to concerns regarding excessive nitric oxide bioavailability and over-vasodilation, the following medication classes will not be permitted during this study: • Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil or tadalafil) • Organic nitrates (e.g. isosorbide mononitrate, sublingual nitroglycerin) Changes to the medication regimen will be assessed during subject encounters."

The investigator may withdraw a patient from the study due to: • Protocol non-compliance • Significant non-compliance with study medications (<80%) • Incorrect enrollment or randomization • Any other reasons related to participant safety • Termination of the study by the DSMB or regulatory authorities The reason for study discontinuation will be recorded on the source documents. All such subjects will be asked to complete an early termination visit if possible. During this visit, we will document: (1) vital signs (2) compliance with the medications, including pill counts (3) adverse effects (4) specific reason for withdrawal We note circumstances may make the performance of an in-person early termination visit challenging; therefore, this visit may also be performed virtually (e.g. over video conferencing). 7.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons: • Pregnancy • Significant non-compliance with study medications (<80%) • If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant • If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that precludes further study participation The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on a specific Case Report Form (CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form and who are randomized, but receive no study intervention, will be replaced. 7.3 Loss To Follow-Up A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she fails to return for an endpoint assessment and is unable to be contacted by the study site staff. Given the cross-over nature of this study design, the study-team will make significant efforts to retain all randomized subjects. The following actions will be taken if a participant fails to return for a required study visit: • The study team will attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible. Study medications may need to be extended, provided no limiting side-effects are present."

These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s study file. • Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up."

Subjects may be sent a copy of the informed consent for review. Data may be abstracted from the electronic medical record, and/or in conversation with the subject, to determine potential eligibility. Specific data to be reviewed and collected may include: • Name, MRN, date of birth, gender • Medical history and review of prior office visits, admissions/discharges, procedures, and surgeries • Results of prior testing (e.g. echocardiograms, heart catheterizations, stress tests) • Current medications and allergies • Tobacco, alcohol, and drug use Subjects will be asked to come to the Baseline visit in the fasted state, after avoiding caffeine for 24hrs, and strenuous activity for 48hrs prior. Baseline Visit: The main objectives of the baseline visit are to obtain written informed consent from the subject, ensure subject eligibility, and determine the submaximal workload to be used in future assessments (primary endpoint). Study procedures will not commence until after written informed consent has been obtained. The following will be performed during the baseline visit: • Anthropomorphic measurements, including height and weight • Physical examination, including seated blood pressure measurement and orthostatic blood pressure assessment • Urinary pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential • Blood analysis and storage: o Comprehensive metabolic profile o NT-proBNP o Complete Blood Count (hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet) o Coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR) o Methemoglobin"

Images will be obtained from the parasternal long axis, short axis, apical 5-, 4-, 3-, and 2-chamber, subcostal, and suprasternal views for offline analysis. Dedicated ventricular chamber images will be obtained in the 4- and 2-chamber apical positions for determination of left ventricular volumes. Mitral inflow velocities, including color M-mode interrogation, will be assessed in the 4-chamber view. Tissue Doppler imaging will be performed, approximately 1-cm apical to the mitral valve plane. Additional images may be obtained in the parasternal short axis at the level of the papillary muscles, 2-chamber, and 4-chamber apical views for assessment of myocardial strain. Pulse-wave Doppler interrogation of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) will be performed in the apical 5-chamber view. Additional echocardiographic images may also be taken, as new echocardiographic techniques become available, noting that there are no known risks associated with obtaining echocardiographic images. • Arterial tonometry: Arterial tonometry will be performed using a high-fidelity applanation tonometer. Assessments may be obtained at the radial, carotid, brachial, and femoral arteries. Waveforms will be stored for offline analysis. Waveforms will be calibrated to the brachial blood pressure using a validated blood pressure device. Body surface measurements may be made to determine distances between anatomic landmarks and measurement sites, such as the suprasternal notch to the carotid, radial, femoral, and brachial arteries. • Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry: A DEXA scan will be performed. This data will be used to normalize exercise parameters to lean muscle mass and to assess body composition. • Maximal effort cardiopulmonary exercise test: Participants will perform a maximal effort supine bicycle exercise test with expired gas analysis using a Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400 device. The device will be calibrated prior to each study. We will use a supine cycle ergometer designed for stress echocardiography (e.g. Stress Echo Ergometer 1505, Medical Positioning, Inc, Kansas City, MO) and a graded-exercise protocol, with resistance beginning at 15 W for 3 minutes, increasing to 25 W for 3 minutes, and then increasing by 25 W every 3 minutes thereafter until exhaustion.64, 82 Electrocardiographic and vital sign monitoring will be performed during this test. Verbal encouragement will be given to encourage maximal effort. o Echocardiographic images will be obtained during the exercise tests. Lung ultrasound may be performed at rest and during exercise to identify B-lines, a marker of congestion.183 o Peak workload (PW) will be defined as the maximal workload that could be sustained for at least 30 seconds. o Peak oxygen consumption will be defined as the average rate of oxygen consumption over the last 30 seconds of exercise."

Given the high prevalence of ‘false-positive’ ECG stress tests in HFpEF,184 isolated EKG abnormalities, in the presence of preserved echocardiographic wall motion, will not be exclusionary. • Submaximal workload verification study: After a rest interval of at least 1 hour and a standardized low-nitrate lunch, subjects will undergo a submaximal exercise test at 75% of the peak workload (75%PW) achieved during the preceding maximal effort test. Subjects will begin with 1 minute of unloaded (0W) exercise, followed by a step increase to 75%PW, performed until exhaustion. o A pedal cadence of 60 RPMs will be maintained, and exhaustion will be determined as the time at which the subject indicates that he or she cannot continue, or as an inability to maintain the pedal cadence >50 RPM for >10s, despite verbal encouragement.185 o The cycle ergometer allows for increments of 5W. If the 75%PW does not fall exactly on a possible value that can be input into the cycle ergometer (e.g. a number that is not divisible by 5), the nearest integer divisible by 5 will be selected (e.g. 92.5 Wà 95W; and 91W à 90W.) • Workload titration for subsequent submaximal studies: The primary exercise endpoint of this study is the time to exhaustion during submaximal exercise. Following the submaximal verification study during the baseline visit, we will titrate the workload to be used in subsequent assessments in order to target a time to exhaustion of 3-6 minutes, as longer tests may be limited by boredom or discomfort as opposed to a physiologic limitation.185 If the subject exercises for >6 minutes during the submaximal workload verification study, the workload to be used in subsequent assessments will be increased by 10W or 15%, whichever is a greater change (but not greater than the peak workload during the maximal effort test); if the exercise time is <3 minutes, the workload will be reduced by 10W or 15%, whichever is a lesser change. A similar schema previously used in HFpEF patients led to exercise times within the desired range.74 Submaximal Workload Titration Table Based on Results of Verification Test: Peak Workload during Maximal Effort Study 75% PW from Maximal Effort Study >6 min to Exhaustion on SubMax Verification Study (+10W or 15%, whichever ∆ is greater) <3 min to Exhaustion on SubMax Verification Study (-10W or 15%, whichever ∆ is less) 15 10 15* 5** 25 20 25* 15 50 40 50 35 75 55 65 45 100 75 85 65 125 95 110 85 150 115 130 105 175 130 150 120 * Targeted workload cannot be greater than peak workload achieved. ** 5W is the minimum loaded workload allowable by the cycle ergometer o The workload determined after this titration procedure will be used during all subsequent submaximal exercise assessments for the subject. o We note that some individuals may not be able to maintain a pedal cadence of 60 RPMs. In these instances, the self-selected cadence that can be maintained during the submaximal verification study will be recorded. During subsequent visits, the subject will be coached to maintain this same"

Baseline Visit – List of Procedures o Eligibility assessment o Informed consent o Medical history and ascertainment of concomitant medications o Dietary counseling re: low nitrate diet o KCCQ administration o Physical exam (including orthostatic vital signs, anthropometric measurements) o Laboratory tests, blood, urine and saliva collection o Urine pregnancy test, as applicable o Echocardiography and arterial tonometry o Maximal effort cardiopulmonary exercise test o Standardized Low-Nitrate Meal o Submaximal workload verification study We note that several studies have demonstrated that inorganic nitrate supplementation does not lead to clinically significant increases in methemoglobin;82, 186-188 therefore, this will not be serially measured during our study. However, subjects with a significantly increased methemoglobin level at baseline (> 5%, where ~1% is considered normal),189 will not be enrolled, as these individuals may harbor defects in their endogenous capacity to reduce methemoglobin and manage oxidant stress. Following the baseline study visit, the data will be verified to ensure inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Subjects will then be randomized, and the study intervention will be delivered to the subject. One-week Assessment: As described in Section 7.1.2, subjects will start on the initial doses of study medications. Subject will be contacted approximately one week later to assess tolerability of the study medications and for adverse effects. The following may then result: (a) The subject describes mild/no side effects at which point study medications will be up-titrated, as detailed in Section 7.1.2; (b) The subject describes moderate side effects that are tolerable, and the subject and the investigators which to continue – in this case, study medications will be maintained at the initial doses; (c) The subject describes limiting side effects at which point study medications will be discontinued, an early termination visit will be attempted to be arranged, and the subject will be terminated from the study. Visit 2 – Assessment #1: Muscle Biopsy and Submaximal Exercise Endurance After taking study medications for 6 weeks (range 5-7 weeks), subjects will return to the exercise unit. Prior to this visit, subjects will receive an actigraphy monitor to be worn for the week prior to the visit. This device will collect activity information, including steps taken per day. The average steps per day during the monitoring period will be calculated. The subject will return this device at the study visit."

Subjects will be asked to refrain from caffeine for 24hrs prior to this visit, and to avoid strenuous activity for 48 hours prior. A standardized low-nitrate meal will be sent to subjects for the evening meal prior to the study visit, and the last doses of study medications will be taken in the evening prior to this visit. We note that muscle markers of NAD+ metabolism,117 and blood and muscle nitrate82, 190 remain elevated well after the last dose. This approach will allow for trough sampling on the morning of the study visit, reflective of our chronic supplementation strategy, and minimize differences in muscle metabolite concentration levels consequent to differences in the timing of the last dose of study medications and the performance of the biopsy and exercise test. The following will be performed: • Anthropometric measurements • Physical exam: including seated and orthostatic blood pressure assessments • Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire • Intravenous catheter placement: 2 venous catheters will be placed: (a) antecubital and (b) a retrograde intravenous catheter on the dorsum of the hand • Blood draw: o Comprehensive metabolic panel o Complete blood count o Storage of blood for later analysis, including whole blood, plasma, and serum • Saliva and urine collection for storage • Urine pregnancy test: for female of childbearing potential • Skeletal muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis: Prior to exercise, the lateral aspect of the thigh will be sterilized and anesthetized using local anesthetic (e.g. lidocaine with sodium bicarbonate). A small incision will be made overlying the muscle and extended down through the fascia. A modified Bergstrom needle, with suction, will be used to obtain at least 200 mg of muscle tissue.191 Multiple passes through the same incision may be required to obtain sufficient muscle. o The following studies may be performed on muscle tissue: § Mitochondrial respiration – both isolated mitochondrial and permeabilized fiber preparations will be made. Respiration may be assessed following the provision of carbohydrate and fatty acid substrate. Citrate synthase activity may be assessed as a marker of mitochondrial content and used to normalize the respirometry data. § Muscle metabolomics – including measurement of the NAD+ metabolome, acylcarnitine profile, Acyl-CoA species (including propionyl-CoA), and nitrate/nitrite concentrations"

Strong verbal encouragement will be given to encourage maximal effort until the time of exhaustion. While time to exhaustion is the primary endpoint, several other pieces of data will be obtained. We will mainly compare data obtained at 4 minutes, when steady state hemodynamic conditions are likely to be present: o Arteriovenous Metabolite Concentrations: The hand with the retrograde IV in its dorsum will be placed in a heated hand box prior to, and during, cycle ergometry. Heated hand boxes have been used to ‘arterialize’ the blood within the vein, allowing us to obtain blood that approximates arterial content without the use, and risk, of an arterial catheter. The hand will be placed in the hand box prior to exercise (at least 10 min prior to exercise) and remain in the chamber throughout exercise for sampling. The hand box air temperature will be set at < 55°C (for comparison, typical sauna temperatures are >65 °C). When used appropriately, and for periods of up to 4 hours for serial sampling, no skin burns have been reported (http://www.uvm.edu/~dmatthew/dem_res/?Page=heated_hand.html, accessed on 9/29/20). Arterialized and venous blood will be obtained immediately prior to exercise, at 4 minutes of exercise when steady-state conditions likely are present, and at the time of exhaustion. Substrates to be measured may include: § Glucose § Lactate § Non-esterified fatty acids § Triglycerides Other metabolites/hormones/proteins, such as insulin and acylcarnitines, may also be measured. o Aortic input impedance: Radial arterial tonometry and echocardiographic cardiac flow from the left ventricular outflow tract Doppler signal will be obtained at rest, at 4 minutes, and at the time of exhaustion. We will primarily compare differences in arterial hemodynamics at the 4-minute time point across submaximal exercise transients (V2/V4/V6). The vasodilatory reserve (the percent change in systemic vascular resistance relative to baseline) will be the main endpoint. o Respiratory exchange ratio: the ratio of the rate of carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and the rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) will be assessed (VCO2/VO2) as a marker of systemic substrate metabolism.192 Lower values (RER of 0.7) correspond to greater fatty acid oxidation, as compared to carbohydrate (RER of 1.0).192-195 The RER will be compared at 4 minutes of exercise and will"

Our interventions may impact VO2 kinetics, as they affect SkM OxPhos. Both “on” and “off” VO2 kinetics may be modeled from the submaximal studies using state-of-the-art single- and double- exponential models, as appropriate.201 o Myocardial diastolic parameters and surrogate markers of congestion – Given that our interventions may impact arterial properties, which in turn, can impact myocardial performance,202-208 we will also measure the mitral inflow velocity (E) and tissue doppler signals to arrive at the E/e’ ratio, a non-invasive surrogate for left ventricular filling pressures.209, 210 We may also interrogate echocardiographic estimates of RV function including the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity211 and the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion.212 Lung ultrasound may also be performed using echocardiography.183, 212 Note: if the subject is willing, an additional muscle biopsy may be performed at the time of exhaustion. This will be done through the same incision as the resting biopsy performed earlier in the day, using a fresh sterile needle biopsy set-up, though the needle may be angled in a different orientation to sample undisturbed tissue. We note that many studies have employed serial muscle biopsies either during one study visit or on a different days following an intervention,117, 163, 190, 213-236 demonstrating the acceptability of this practice. We also note that the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC), an NIH sponsored collaborative effort to understand the impact of exercise on the human body, employs serial muscle biopsies before and at several time points following exercise (pre-exercise, 0.5 hours after exercise, 4 hours after exercise, and 24 hours following exercise).236 Visit 3 – Assessment #2: SkM MRI for SkM OxPhos and Intramuscular Perfusion The subject will continue on study medications for an additional 3-10 days prior to returning to UPenn for the CrCEST/vPIVOT MRI assessment. Subjects will be given a standardized low-nitrate meal for the evening prior to the scan. The last dose of study medications will be taken with this standardized meal in the evening prior to the MRI assessment. Subjects will come to the MRI scanner in the morning and in the fasted state, though routinely prescribed medications should be taken according to their schedule. Subjects will be asked to refrain from caffeine for 24hrs prior to this visit, and to avoid strenuous activity for 48hrs prior. Subjects will be asked to arrive at the MRI scanner at least 1 hour prior to their scan time, to avoid the confounding influence caused by travel. A standardized low-nitrate meal will be given during this rest period prior to the MRI scan. Subjects will be screened for metal objects on their clothes and in their pockets and asked to remove such items. Then the subject will be placed on the MRI patient bed and the radiofrequency coil placed around the part of the body under investigation. The subject will be given earplugs to dampen the sound made by the scanner during the imaging process. The subject will then be placed inside the magnet until the part of the body under investigation is in the center. The study will then proceed. The MR operator will be in constant two-way voice communication with the subject. The subject will be given periodic updates throughout the examination. Subjects will not be asked to remain in the magnet for more than 1.5 hours. During the scan, the subject will be asked to perform 2 bouts of plantar flexion exercise against a pneumatically controlled foot pedal. Immediately following exercise, SkM OxPhos (CrCEST protocol, following the first bout of exercise) and intramuscular perfusion (vPIVOT protocol, following the second bout of"
50,page_50,"Protocol 844627 The MPMA HFpEF Trial KNO3 + PLC + NR vs. KNO3 vs. KCl in HFpEF Page 51 of 97 Confidential – V1; 12/21/20 exercise) will be assessed during the post-exercise recovery period (Figure 8). When the study is complete, the subject will be brought out of the magnet, the coil will be removed, and the subject will be allowed to get up slowly. Subjects are encouraged to take their time in getting up from the patient bed in order not to induce lightheadedness after the prolonged supine period. Data may be reviewed during the scan session to assess for quality. If one portion of the scan is deemed to be of insufficient quality for accurate data interpretation (CrCEST or vPIVOT portion), a third exercise bout may be performed at the end of the study to repeat this portion, if time allows and the subject is willing. For each MRI scan, the following represent the main measures: • CrCEST-based metrics of SkM OxPhos: o Half-time of CrCEST recovery (t1/2,Cr) – primary outcome measure for this assessment o The linear slope of CrCEST recovery over the early phase (first 2 minutes) of recovery o Baseline and increase in CrCEST asymmetry with exercise in the posterior compartment muscle groups, including the lateral gastrocnemius • vPIVOT measures: o Baseline and peak intramuscular perfusion of the muscles involved in calf plantar flexion exercise, as well as the recovery characteristics of intramuscular perfusion, particularly of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle. o Baseline and peak conduit artery (e.g. popliteal artery) blood flow o Relative measure of capillary oxygenation (T2*) before and serially after exercise The primary endpoint of the MRI assessment will be the half-time of CrCEST recovery of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle, used as an in vivo metric of SkM OxPhos. Additional endpoints include the slope of early (first 2 minutes) Cr recovery, peak lateral gastrocnemius perfusion and its timing and recovery characteristics, relative capillary oxygenation (T2*) and its timing and recovery characteristics, and peak conduit (popliteal) artery blood flow and its timing and recovery characteristics. Scans will be performed on a 3T MRI scanners. The sequences used in this protocol are not FDA approved. Appropriate language stating as such has been added to the informed consent, as suggested by CAMRIS. Following both the MRI and exercise assessment, the subject will have completed Period 1. All study medications will be collected and counted by the study team to determine medication compliance. Study medications will then be returned to the UPenn IDS for disposal. Figure 8. CrCEST and vPIVOT imaging protocol. Following rest, the scanning protocol begins with anatomic and baseline CrCEST imaging. A standardized plantar flexion exercise protocol is then started for 2 minutes. Additional CrCEST images are obtained every 30s during recovery for 8 minutes. After a rest period, anatomic and baseline vPIVOT images are obtained, followed by an identical exercise transient and vPIVOT data collection during recovery. In vPIVOT, bulk conduit artery blood flow (A – bulk conduit artery flow), intramuscular perfusion (B – Perfusion), and relative T2* (C – T2*) are measured serially.

In this instance, a delay of at least 2 days will be arranged to minimize the small potential for the calf exercise performed during the MRI assessment to impact the cycle ergometry exercise study. In all cases, the subject will remain on study medications until both the exercise and MRI assessments for the period are completed. Wash-Out Period and Subsequent Periods: (Visits 4-7) Subjects will then enter a 2-week washout period, before beginning Period 2. After the washout, the next study intervention in the subject’s sequence will be given to the subject by UPenn IDS. The exact same study procedures and protocols enumerated for Period 1 will be repeated, including Assessment #1: Muscle Biopsy and Submaximal Exercise Endurance (Visit 4) and Assessment #2: SkM MRI for SkM OxPhos and Intramuscular Perfusion (Visit 5). Following Period 2, the subjects will again have a 2-week washout period, before entering Period 3, which will again be identical in its performance (Visit 6 – Muscle biopsy and submaximal exercise and Visit 7 – SkM MRI), as the subject receives the final treatment in his/her sequence. Visit 8 – Assessment #3: The Response of SkM OxPhos to Supplemental Oxygen: A central goal of this proposal is to understand the relationship between SkM OxPhos and SkM O2 delivery with exercise. If oxygen delivery to, and within, the skeletal muscle is impaired and insufficient to meet mitochondrial needs, SkM OxPhos will be reduced. Increasing O2 delivery will increase SkM OxPhos only if mitochondrial reserve capacity is present and mitochondrial rates of oxidative energy production are less than the rate of SkM energy utilization. In healthy individuals for large muscle mass exercise, maximal rates of isolated mitochondrial O2 consumption exceed maximal systemic and skeletal muscle VO2 achieved during exercise, demonstrating an excess mitochondrial reserve capacity.237-239 Accordingly, in athletes, SkM OxPhos and PCr recovery kinetics are speeded with supplemental oxygen, demonstrating functional mitochondrial reserve.240 On the other hand, in sedentary individuals, decreased mitochondrial reserve may limit SkM OxPhos, such that supplemental oxygen is of lesser benefit.241-243 Disease state may also impact the SkM response to oxygen. A recent elegant study demonstrated that supplemental O2 did not speed SkM OxPhos in sedentary controls, but it did in sedentary diabetics.244 These findings were all the more intriguing as diabetic patients were found to have reduced mitochondrial content on muscle biopsy,244 demonstrating that even in the context of impaired mitochondrial content, a mitochondrial reserve may be present such that SkM OxPhos rates could be increased with supplemental O2. At least 30 days from the last dose of study medications, subjects will again come to the MRI scanner for a final visit. This will be a single-day, 2x2 cross-over study to assess the impact of supplemental O2 on SkM OxPhos in HFpEF. Equal numbers of subjects will be randomized to receive either low (FIO2=0.21, room air) followed by high (FIO2=1.0) FIO2 or high followed by low FIO2. Inhaled gas randomization sequence will be prespecified and stored in RedCap in order to ensure balance (50% with FIO2=0.21 first and 50% with FIO2=1.0 first). Subjects may be sent a standardized meal for the evening prior to the MRI scan. Subjects will arrive at least one hour prior to their scan time in the fasted state and will then rest, to avoid any confounding influence caused by travel. Subjects will be asked to avoid caffeine for 24 hrs prior to the MRI scan,174, 175 and to avoid strenuous activity for 48hrs prior. Water intake will not be restricted, and the subjects will take their usually prescribed medications according to their schedule. Upon arrival and during rest, a standardized meal will be given to the subject. Aside from the inspired gases (FIO2=0.21 or FIO2=1.0), the MRI scanning procedure will be identical. The subject and the MRI technician who will interpret the images will both be blinded to the FIO2"
52,page_52,"Protocol 844627 The MPMA HFpEF Trial KNO3 + PLC + NR vs. KNO3 vs. KCl in HFpEF Page 53 of 97 Confidential – V1; 12/21/20 order. Both scans will be performed on the same day to minimize biologic variability,175, 245-248 with at least an hour separating each session to allow for adequate rest and oxygen washout. The same standardized meal will be given to the subject an hour before the second scan. We note that previous studies in sedentary individuals used between 5-30 minutes of rest between repeat studies.241, 242, 244 Tanks with room air and 100% oxygen will be kept in the control room and attached to a non-rebreather facemask with a reservoir to ensure constant delivery throughout the scanning protocol. Inhaled gases will be started ~15 minutes prior to each scanning sequence for adequate equilibration.249 (Note: Regulators providing 25L/min of flow are available for 100% oxygen; however, regulators for room air are only available that provide a maximum of 15L/min. As the subjects will be breathing the inhaled gases through a reservoir, and the contents of the room air gas should be identical to the content of the air in the MRI scanner, additional intake of ambient room air should not lead to any significant difference than if regulators were able to provide 25L/min of room air. Should a room air regulator that provides 25 L/min of flow become available, this will be used). Primary Endpoint. The primary endpoint will be the change in SkM OxPhos on CrCEST in response to supplemental oxygen (DSkM OxPhos). We hypothesize that two basic HFpEF phenotypes of impaired SkM OxPhos will emerge in response to 100% O2: 1. O2-Responsive (↑DSkM OxPhos): Those with moderate or major SkM OxPhos improvements with O2, suggesting available mitochondrial reserve, but a defect in O2 delivery. 2. O2-non-responsive (↔DSkM OxPhos): Those with no or little improvement in SkM OxPhos with O2, suggesting a lack of mitochondrial reserve. In addition to defining differences between the O2-responsiveness/non-responsive subjects, we will also compare DSkM OxPhos to the contrasts in exercise duration from the interventional portion of this study. The difference in submaximal exercise duration between the KNO3 vs KNO3+NR+PLC interventions may be attributable to the addition of agents selected to improve mitochondrial reserve (NR+PLC). Therefore, we predict that individuals with large improvements in submaximal exercise duration following combination therapy versus KNO3 will be O2-non-responsive, harboring a lack of mitochondrial reserve (↔DSkM OxPhos) at baseline. In contrast, individuals with small differences in submaximal exercise duration following combination therapy versus KNO3 alone will be O2-responsive (↑DSkM OxPhos), demonstrating the presence of mitochondrial reserve at baseline. It is possible that in the future, the response to supplemental O2 could be used to phenotype HFpEF patients, identifying those HFpEF individuals who are more likely to benefit from a mitochondrial intervention and enriching clinical trials that otherwise have been hampered by the heterogenous nature of the disease.250 8.2 Subject Safety and Risk Assessments Potential Risks 1. Cardiopulmonary exercise test: Exercise testing is used extensively for research purposes with minimal risk to subjects. The most significant risks of the test are dysrhythmias or other cardiovascular complications, which are extremely rare.251 These procedures will be performed by qualified personnel according to established American Heart Association guidelines.252, 253 Non-revascularized myocardial ischemia, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications with exercise,254 is an exclusion criterion for the study, as is current angina due to epicardial coronary artery disease. Subjects may feel uncomfortable as a result of pushing themselves during an exercise test. Subjects will likely feel short of breath and tired as a result of the exercise test. Various other complaints, such as nausea, lightheadedness, and other aches and pains are also possible as a result"
53,page_53,"Protocol 844627 The MPMA HFpEF Trial KNO3 + PLC + NR vs. KNO3 vs. KCl in HFpEF Page 54 of 97 Confidential – V1; 12/21/20 of exercise. Although exercise testing may result in exhaustion, rarely do people develop abnormal heart rhythms or significant cardiovascular complications, such as an acute myocardial infarction,254 during exercise tests. The risk of this happening is the same as if the participant were to exert him/herself during stressful situations or during exercise elsewhere, though subjects are monitored in our exercise lab setting. We will perform EKG, heart rate, and blood pressure monitoring during our exercise test. In addition to the blood pressure (generally increases) and heart rate (generally increases) changes during exercise, we will also monitor arterial saturation non-invasively using a pulse oximeter. Of note, oxygen levels can decrease with exercise, even in individuals without significant cardiopulmonary disease.255, 256 If the arterial saturation falls to below 88% (“severe exercise induced hypoxemia”256), we will alert the subject and his/her care provider, if possible, as this may prompt consideration for additional/alternative causes for arterial hypoxemia and shortness of breath. 2. Echocardiography: Our exercise protocols routinely incorporate echocardiography during exercise for determination of cardiac output.64, 82 This is a non-invasive procedure and does not have any known significant risks. It is possible that subjects may experience mild, temporary discomfort or skin irritation from the echo probe, or from wearing the electrodes needed to monitor heart rate during the examination. We may also use the ultrasound machine to obtain images of the lungs for signs of congestion.183 3. Skeletal muscle vastus lateralis biopsy: Muscle needle biopsy with suction will be performed,191 following local anesthesia (for example, with 1% lidocaine with sodium bicarbonate). In a large series of 13,500 muscle needle biopsies performed at one center, the overall complication rate was 0.16% in adult patients: From Tarnopolsky et al. Muscle Nerve 2011; 43: 717. The most significant risks occurring in adults included arterial bleeding (1/13,626 = 0.007%) and local skin infection (8/13,626 = 0.06%). To date, we have performed vastus lateralis biopsies in over 50 subjects without significant complications. We note that our protocol of pre-exercise muscle biopsies has been extensively employed in many prior physiologic studies.217, 218, 220-228, 230, 257-263 Moreover, several studies have employed serial muscle biopsies either during one study visit or on a different days following an intervention,117, 163, 190, 213-232, 235, 236 demonstrating that this is an acceptable study procedure. We note that in many of these studies, muscle biopsies were performed before and after exercise, or multiple times during a single exercise transient. In fact, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC), an NIH sponsored collaborative effort to understand the impact of exercise on the human body, employs serial muscle biopsies before and at several time"
54,page_54,"Protocol 844627 The MPMA HFpEF Trial KNO3 + PLC + NR vs. KNO3 vs. KCl in HFpEF Page 55 of 97 Confidential – V1; 12/21/20 points following exercise (pre-exercise, 0.5 hours after exercise, 4 hours after exercise, and 24 hours following exercise).236 Other considerations specific to the muscle biopsy: • Post-exercise muscle biopsy: In individuals who elect to also allow us to obtain a post-exercise muscle biopsy, we do not anticipate a significant increase in risk, noting that a new sterile needle will be used through the same skin incision as the biopsy performed prior to exercise, though we may attempt to angle the needle into a different segment of muscle. • Thrombocytopenia: Biopsies will not be performed on individuals with platelet count < 100k on baseline laboratories (Visit 1), unless a subsequent check shows that the platelet count has recovered or was erroneous. • Treatment with anticoagulation (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixiban, rivaroxaban, or a different anticoagulant): Given the significant prevalence of atrial fibrillation in HFpEF (~35% in recent large clinical trials such as PARAGON and TOPCAT264, 265), we expect that a substantial proportion of enrolled subjects will be on anticoagulation. In these instances, risk stratification regarding the temporary cessation of anticoagulation will be performed (see Table): Table from Spyropoulos and Douketis, 2012266 • In subjects at high risk for thromboembolic events, anticoagulation will not be interrupted, and the muscle biopsy will not be performed. • In individuals at intermediate (expected to be the majority of subjects) or low (expected to be infrequent, given the age and comorbidities in HFpEF subjects) risk for thromboembolic events, we will have an informed conversation with the subject about his/her risk with withholding anticoagulation for the performance of the muscle biopsy. Anticoagulation will only be held if the subject consents to do so. We may also discuss this with the subject’s provider. • For illustrative purposes, an average of 5 days of non-therapeutic anticoagulation in a subject with intermediate risk of thromboembolic events would translate to: o 4-10%/year risk à 7% average annual risk à 0.02% daily risk à 0.1% 5-day risk à 1:1000 risk of a thromboembolic event during the peri-biopsy period."
55,page_55,"Protocol 844627 The MPMA HFpEF Trial KNO3 + PLC + NR vs. KNO3 vs. KCl in HFpEF Page 56 of 97 Confidential – V1; 12/21/20 • With the subject’s consent, and generally after a discussion with the subject’s provider, anticoagulation will be discontinued prior to the muscle biopsy (~5 days prior for warfarin, and 2 days prior for direct oral anticoagulants). This is similar to what is done for clinical procedures, such as a routine colonoscopy. • In the case of warfarin, the INR will be checked prior to the biopsy, and the biopsy will be performed if the INR is <1.5266 If the INR is >1.5, we will attempt to reschedule the study visit, if possible, or forego the biopsy. • Warfarin may be restarted on the evening of the biopsy, and oral anticoagulants may be restarted 2 days following the biopsy. • Antiplatelets: Biopsies can be performed while on aspirin.191 Additional antiplatelet agents (e.g. clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel) will be treated similarly to anticoagulation and will not be interrupted without a discussion with the subject and his/her provider. Biopsies will not be performed in subjects on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, in addition to another antiplatelet). • Allergy to lidocaine or related anesthetic medication. In these cases, the nature of the allergy will be discussed with the subject, and the use of an alternative agent may be pursued. For example, in subjects with a lidocaine allergy, which is an amide local anesthetic, alternatives could include the use of an esther local anesthetic (such as tetracaine) or diphenhydramine.267 These decisions will be made in discussion with the Investigational Drug Pharmacy and the subject, and in light of the agents that the subject may have received previously for local anesthesia. 4. Phlebotomy and blood draws: The CHPS unit in which the studies will be performed employs a critical-care trained nurse practitioner and a research nurse who have extensive experience in blood draws and maintaining venous catheters. Risks from the peripheral (e.g. antecubital fossa) venous catheterization include minor discomfort, minor bruising, bleeding, hematoma and/or fainting associated with the drawing of blood. There is also a very small chance (less than 1%) of infection at the blood draw site. We anticipate that completion of the entire protocol (all visits) will lead to less blood drawn than that which is removed during a standard red-blood cell donation (approximately 1 pint or 473 mL): Baseline Visit Period 1: Assessment #1 Period 2: Assessment #1 Period 3: Assessment #1 Resting CMP – 5 mL CMP – 5 mL CMP – 5 mL CMP – 5 mL NTproBNP – 5 mL CBC – 3 mL CBC – 3 mL CBC – 3 mL Met-hgb – 6 mL (Coag – 3 mL)* (Coag – 3 mL)* (Coag – 3 mL)* CBC – 3 mL Coag – 3 mL Storage: WB: 5 mL Plasma: 15 mL Serum: 10 mL Submaximal Exercise “Arterialized” & Venous Blood Rest (0-min): Rest (0-min): Rest (0-min): WB: 5 mL WB: 5 mL WB: 5 mL Plasma: 20 mL Plasma: 20 mL Plasma: 20 mL Serum: 15 mL Serum: 15 mL Serum: 15 mL"

Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA): DEXA scanning will occur during Visit 1 in the dedicated and certified lab space of the CHPS unit according to the practice guidelines of the American College of Radiology.268 Participants will be instructed to never look directly into laser of the scanning arm that passes over the body. In most instances, scans will occur one time. However, in the event that the images and data collection from the first scan are not clear, a second scan may occur. However, in any event, no more than 2 scans will occur for a participant. The length of a single scan will take approximately 15 minutes. The radiation dose received during a DEXA scan is less than that of a chest X-ray.269 This data will be used to normalize exercise parameters to lean muscle mass. 6. Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire: Participants may become uncomfortable with questions or feel sadness as a result of completing questionnaires. 7. Lower Extremity MRI: The non-invasive nature, lack of ionizing radiation, and lack of gadolinium contrast make the risks associated with our MRI studies small. MRI scans requires the subject to be in a partially enclosed space inside the scanner, which some people may find uncomfortable. The MRI scanner produces different noises during a scan. Patients are given special earplugs to reduce the noise. The MRI scanner has a strong magnet that attracts certain metals. If anyone has these types of metal in their body, the MRI’s strong magnetic field can cause the metal to move, which may cause injury. Screening of MRI-related exclusion criteria will be done during the baseline visit and with an on-site questionnaire at the time of, or prior to, the first scan. Subjects with be thoroughly screened for the presence of body metal and excluded from the MRI portion of the study if they are unable to safely undergo an MRI. We will not perform MRI scans in subjects who are not suitable candidates for an MRI. The presence of the following will be evaluated: a. Central nervous system aneurysm clips b. Implanted neural stimulators c. Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator d. Cochlear implant e. Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings) f. Other implanted medical devices: (e.g. drug infusion ports) g. Insulin pump h. Metal shrapnel or bullet i. Severe claustrophobia j. Extreme obesity rendering the patient unable to fit into narrow-bore scanners k. Unwillingness of the patient to undergo an MRI scan."

Pregnancy: Women with childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test as part of each period assessment during the interventional medication portion of this study. Attestation of non-pregnant status will be obtained prior to the MRI scans and during Assessment #3 (MRI with and without oxygen). We note that the subject’s assent of non-pregnancy status is an acceptable practice put forth by CAMRIS. All patients with metallic implants will be individually evaluated prior to the first MRI. In cases where there is uncertainty, we will consult with our radiologists/MRI technicians. In these cases, the MRI will only be performed if deemed to be safe by our radiologists/technicians. Standard safety practices, as per our institutional standards, will be followed. Voice contact with patients will be maintained throughout the scan. Some individuals may experience leg stiffness/soreness as a result of lying on the table in the MRI scanner with his/her leg relatively still in between bouts of calf exercise. This is anticipated to be minor and should abate as the participant gets off the table and begins to walk around. **We note that many contemporary ICD/pacemakers are MRI-compatible. In participants with an implantable device (defibrillator or pacemaker), the specific details of the device will be reviewed and discussed with our radiologists in order to ensure the safety of the participant with that device during scanning at 3T. The participant will only undergo the MRI scan if it is deemed to be safe. 8. Confidentiality: There is a potential for a breach of confidentiality. We are committed to protecting confidentiality as described in detail below. 9. Active Pharmacologic Therapy: This proposal includes 3 different pharmacologic interventions/combinations: (a) potassium nitrate; (b) potassium nitrate + nicotinamide riboside (NR) + propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC); (c) potassium chloride. Risks are described in Section 3.1.1. 10. Acute Oxygen Supplementation: There are little data to guide the risk/benefit discussion of acute oxygen supplementation in heart failure overall, and no data in HFpEF specifically, in the absence of hypoxia.270 As in non-HF patients, hyperoxia can have negative hemodynamic effects in HFrEF patients, such as an increase in systemic vascular resistance and reductions in cardiac output.271-273 Despite this, oxygen supplementation has been shown to increase exercise time in HFrEF subjects.274 The impact of oxygen in HFpEF is unknown. Over longer periods of time than that in this study (not anticipated to exceed 1.5-2 hours), supplemental oxygen can have a detrimental effect on lung function. In studies of monkeys, more than 5 days of exposure to 90% oxygen were needed before symptoms developed.275 Exposure to FIO2=0.5 in healthy subjects for a mean of 44 hours led to an increase in inflammatory mediators found on bronchoalveolar lavage.276 Pre-existing pathology may also exacerbate oxygen toxicity. In a study of human subjects who were intubated (therefore presumably with some degree of lung injury present), excessive FIO2 above that needed to maintain saturations to >92% have been associated with worse oxygenation at 48 hrs.277 Indeed, pre-existing lung injury can exacerbate/predispose to oxygen toxicity, worsening lung injury.275 Even in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction, where less lung injury is reasonably expected to be present than in acute respiratory distress syndromes, supplemental oxygen can have detrimental effects in the absence of hypoxia.278, 279 Hyperoxia can be associated with absorption atelectasis due to the higher solubility of oxygen in blood than nitrogen.280 In patients with severe COPD and baseline hypoxia, supplemental oxygen can lead to a decrease in respiratory drive.281 We note, however, that our study will be performed in stable outpatient in whom known significant pulmonary disease (as defined in the exclusion criteria) will be exclusionary. Moreover, subjects with clinically significant coronary artery disease (as defined above, and per investigator judgement) will be excluded from the study, minimizing"

Additionally, the increase in arterial oxygen content with supplemental oxygen may help mitigate the impact of decreased coronary flow on oxygen delivery. During the scan, we will maintain verbal contact with the subjects, checking in on them frequently. The study will be stopped if the subject experiences significant untoward or concerning side effects such as chest pain. 11. Actigraphy and Step Counts: The actigraphy monitor is a watch-like device. There are no risks associated with actigraphy and acquisition of the step count data. It is possible that a subject might get mild irritation from the “watch strap” if the monitor is worn on the wrist. In that case, the device may be worn on the hip. 8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Adverse events All adverse events will be reported following FDA guidelines. The research team will keep a log of all adverse events that occur in the trial, and any reportable events will be reported per protocol following applicable regulations. The study team in charge of the conduct of the trial is up to date on all trainings pertaining to safety guidelines and adverse event reporting. Adverse events will be reported to the IRB and the Data Safety Monitoring Board in a timely fashion (i.e., at continuing review). Definitions: Adverse Event: An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in a subject whether or not considered drug or biologic related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the pharmaceutical product. Suspected Adverse Reaction: A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. “Reasonable possibility” suggests there is a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. Serious Adverse Events (SAE): An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if the investigator or Medical Monitor believes any of the following outcomes may occur: • Death • Life-threatening AE: Places the subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event as it occurred. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. • Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption in the ability to conduct normal life functions. • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization. • Congenital anomaly or birth defect. • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition above. • This determination is based on the opinion of either the investigator or Medical Monitor (i.e., if any one of these believes it is serious, it must be considered serious). Unanticipated Problem: An Unanticipated Problem (UP) is a medical adverse event OR a non-medical event that is: (1) unforeseen (unexpected), AND (2) suggests that research places subjects at greater risk than was previously known or recognized, AND"

Classification of Adverse Events for Causal Relationship to Study Interventions Not related There is not a reasonable causal relationship to the investigational product and the adverse event. This also includes “unlikely related” events (No temporal association or the cause of the event has been identified, or the drug or device is unlikely to be implicated, or there is a low likelihood that a causal relationship exists) Related There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. This includes the category of “possibly related (reasonable evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and adverse event) 1 Mild AE: Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated; no treatment required 2 Moderate AE: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may warrant intervention. In the latter scenario, AE responds to treatment 3 Severe AE: Incapacitating, limiting usual/normal activities or significantly affects clinical status requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization. 4 Life-threatening or disabling 5 Fatal AE Expectedness: The expectedness of an AE/ADE or SAE shall be determined according to the specified reference document containing safety information (e.g., most recent protocol or informed consent). Any AE/ADE that is not identified in nature, severity, or specificity in the current study reference document(s) is considered unexpected. Events that are mentioned in the reference documents as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation, are considered unexpected.

UPs will be reported in an expedited manner per applicable regulations. • AEs occurring from the time of signed informed consent to one week after the administration of the last study drug, or one day after the final MRI visit if participating in MRI studies, will be collected. • AEs will be classified according to the guidelines/definitions specified above. • We note that given the pharmacology of our study medications, events occurring > 2 days after the last dose are unlikely to be related to their administration.82, 123, 282 As an additional safety margin, we will consider the possibility of an AE being related to study medications up to 5 days after the last dose. • Any AE rated >=3 in severity and all SAEs must be reported within 1 working day of first becoming aware of the event to the medical monitor. The IRB should also be notified per their reporting guidelines. • The medical monitor will make a determination about the necessity to modify the protocol, include additional information in the consent form, inform previous participants, temporarily hold enrollment of subjects, or terminate the study. In addition, we will report AEs/SAEs to NIH, FDA, and the DSMB per their regulations, as applicable. • The investigator or qualified designee will enter the required information regarding the AE into the appropriate module of the eCRF. • All study procedures and cumulative adverse events are subject to full IRB review at least yearly. The DSMB will review adverse events at regularly scheduled meetings. Meetings will be convened based on landmarks in participant completion, for example: o First 5 participants complete o 10 participants complete o 30 participants complete o Enrollment complete (53 participants) § Additional meetings may be convened at the request of the DSMB chair § The above schedule may be modified by the DSMB • Events significant enough to necessitate modification of study drug dosing will be captured on an appropriate eCRF module. Safety Event Follow-up The Investigator will record follow-up safety information according to the same process used for reporting the initial event as described above. The Investigator will follow all safety events until resolution, stabilization, improvement, or the event is otherwise explained. The DSMB will review detailed safety data, as detailed above. Management of Suspected (Related) Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction AEs that meet the criteria of serious, related to study intervention, and unexpected for the study intervention, qualify for expedited reporting to the regulatory authorities (e.g. DSMB, NIH, etc.). The Principal Investigator, along with the Medical Monitor, will assess all SAEs and evaluate for “unexpectedness” and relationship to study drug. The Principal Investigator is required to complete a report for any event identified as serious, study drug related, and unexpected, and submit it to the Medical Monitor within 1 working day of the PI becoming aware of it."

Pregnancy occurring during the study period, although not considered an SAE, must be reported within the same timelines as an SAE, and to the IRB per local requirements. The pregnancy will be recorded on the appropriate note to file. Study drugs will be discontinued immediately, and the subject terminated from the trial, but the pregnancy will be followed until final outcome. Any associated AEs or SAEs that occur to the mother or fetus/child will be recorded in the AE or SAE case report form. 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1 Statistical Hypotheses Statistics for the Trial Evaluating the Impact of Study Medications on Submaximal Exercise Endurance: The primary analyses will be intention-to-treat. The 3x3 crossover design involves 2 interventions plus an active control and 3 periods, leading to a total of 6 unique sequences (e.g. KCl in period [P] 1; KNO3 alone in P2; KNO3+NR+PLC in P3). For each block of 6 participants, the design is ‘balanced’ across periods, with each treatment appearing twice in each period. Each subject will have paired measurements of the primary outcome, submaximal exercise endurance, on each treatment pair (KNO3 vs KCl), (KNO3+NR+PLC vs KCl) and (KNO3 vs KNO3+NR+PLC). We will analyze each treatment pair contrast (e.g. KNO3 vs. KCl) separately using least squares regression, to minimize assumptions on the covariance matrix of the repeated measurements.283 The regression model will be adjusted for period effects and for baseline submaximal exercise endurance.283, 284 The model-based estimates and hypothesis tests will be used to determine which, if any, of the individual interventions is/are effective. The proposed sample size of study completers is 48 (8 subjects per each of 6 treatment sequences); we will enroll 53 subjects to account for dropouts. For the primary outcome, and Bonferroni adjusting for two multiple comparisons of each intervention (KNO3 or KNO3+NR+PLC) to control (KCl), the proposed sample size yields at least 80% power to detect mean differences in submaximal exercise time on the order of 80 seconds. The calculation uses a family-wise two-sided Type I error rate of 0.05 and conservatively assumes a standard deviation (SD) of submaximal exercise time of 170 seconds, around 20% larger than the roughly 140 seconds reported by Eggebeen et al.74 This effect is hypothesized to be clinically important given the severity of impairment in this cohort (mean submaximal exercise duration of 363±125 s seen in Eggebeen et al.).74 The comparison of KNO3+NR+PLC versus KNO3 alone is expected to yield somewhat smaller effects; without adjustment for multiple comparisons, we have 80% power to detect a mean difference of 70 seconds. In addition to hypothesis testing, 95% confidence intervals will be created to evaluate potential effect sizes for possible future studies. In general, for the secondary endpoints (e.g. CrCEST recovery time, VO2 recovery kinetics, vasodilatory reserve, respiratory exchange ratio, steps per day, KCCQ overall summary score), we have 80% power to detect reasonable effect sizes (Mean difference/SD) of 0.41. Within each of the physiologic outcome groups (e.g. quality of life, muscle metabolomics, arteriovenous substrate gradients, mitochondrial respirometry and muscle proteome), we will follow the general strategy described above. In these exploratory analyses, in addition to hypothesis testing, we will focus attention on confidence intervals. Conclusions will be based on the coherence of the results for the individual endpoints within pre-defined outcome groups. The statistical analysis will be blinded to intervention group; exploratory analyses will stratify by sex as a biological variable in order to assess whether males and females tend to respond differently to the interventions. The study is not powered to detect these differences between groups, but sex effects will be more rigorously examined in future studies should differences be apparent.

Proteomics Analysis: The protein assignment and MS2 intensity values will be generated by Spectronaut (Biognosys AG; or similar software) and used to analyze the proteome data. Perseus (or similar software) will be used for proteomics data processing and statistical analysis.286 The data will be log2-transformed and normalized by subtracting the median for each sample after each intervention. Protein intensities will be compared between matched intervention pairs using paired Student’s t-tests. Proteomic comparisons between KNO3, KNO3+NR+PLC, and KCl will identify differentially abundant proteins, and volcano plots will be generated using EnhancedVolcano package in R (or similar software). Comparisons will be made between individual proteins that are key regulators of fatty acid oxidation (e.g. CD36, FABP3, SLC27A6, FABP5, CPT1B, CPT2, CRAT, ACADVL, ACADM, ACADS, ACADSB, HADHA, HADHB, ECHS1, HADH, ACAA2, ACAD9, ECI1, ECI2, DECR1, ECH1, ACC), mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1a, HIF-1, NRF1/2, ERRa, TFAM, MXI1, C-MYC, AMPK, ANT, and mTOR), NAD+ metabolism (SIRT1&SIRT3,83 FOXO,91 CD38,287 PARPs,108 NAMPT, NAMNT, NRK, and CX43288), and energy fuel metabolism, with adjustment for multiple comparisons. Additionally, lists of differentially abundant proteins will be used for downstream bioinformatic analysis using the STRING database (string-db.org) and MetaCore (Clarivate Analytics) to identify pathway enrichment, and its associated false discovery rate,289-291 for each comparison (other similar software may be used). Metabolomics Analysis: Period-adjusted levels of metabolites will be compared between matched intervention pairs using paired Student’s t-tests. Candidate metabolites will be selected based on an FDR no greater than 0.05. Visit 7 – Assessment #3: The response of SkM OxPhos to Supplemental Oxygen: The design and analysis plan is similar to that of the main trial, except that the design is an AB:BA (two-treatment, two-period) crossover trial with each letter corresponding to two different oxygen levels (FIO2=0.21 or FIO2=1.0). Briefly, Dr. Putt will provide a coded randomization sequence in RedCap, which the study coordinator will access on the day of each subject’s study. Statistics for the Impact of Supplemental Oxygen on SkM OxPhos. The primary endpoint will be the change in SkM OxPhos on CrCEST in response to supplemental oxygen (DSkM OxPhos) using paired statistics. We will then graph the distribution of SkM OxPhos for the individual FIO2 levels as well as for the change in FIO2 levels, as a function of FIO2 order. We hypothesize that the HFpEF population represents a mixture of two ‘classes’ of response to O2 i.e., ‘responders’ and ‘non-responders’. Under this hypothesis, the variability in SkM OxPhos under 100% FIO2 should far exceed that seen under room air, with some individuals showing a pronounced increase in SkM OxPhos with 100% FIO2 compared to room air, and others showing little change. To formally test this hypothesis, we will fit the change in SkM OxPhos to a latent class model. We will fit two models, one with a single class, and one with two classes and compute the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). We will then repeatedly permute the assignment of the randomization sequence (Room air followed by 100% O2 or vice versa) in order to determine the distribution of the AIC under the null hypothesis of a single class of response to 100% O2. The observed AIC will be compared to the permutation distribution in order to determine a p-value. Additionally, we will use the latent class model to estimate the proportion of O2-responders by assigning individuals to a class based on the larger of their individual probabilities of class membership. A 95% confidence interval for this proportion will be"

Based on individual participants’ class assignment, we will estimate the threshold in the change in SkM OxPhos corresponding to a ‘responder’ versus a ‘non-responder’. Comparison with data from Submaximal Exercise Studies: We will then regress the outcome variable, the change in skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation capacity on CrCEST (DSkM OxPhos) with 100% oxygen supplementation, on the difference in submaximal exercise duration for combination therapy versus KNO3, adjusting for baseline exercise duration. Submaximal exercise duration post-intervention will be pre-adjusted for period effects. We hypothesize a negative slope; individuals with large improvements in submaximal exercise duration between combination therapy and KNO3 should be O2 non-responsive (↔DSkM OxPhos); whereas, individuals with limited improvement in submaximal exercise duration between combination therapy and KNO3 are likely O2-responsive (↑DSkM OxPhos). With 48 subjects and a Type I error rate of 0.05, we have 80% power to detect moderate Pearson correlations on the order of 0.39 or larger (%& of at least 0.15). Further analyses will allow us to probe our findings. First, we will regress submaximal exercise endurance on combination therapy as a function of submaximal exercise endurance on KNO3. We anticipate a large positive intercept term and a moderate slope as combination therapy is expected to be most effective in rescuing the mitochondrial deficit in individuals with low response to KNO3 alone. Alternatively, combination therapy may uncover mitochondrial reserve across the spectrum of KNO3 response; in this case we anticipate a positive intercept term and a null slope. We will regress DSkM OxPhos on period-adjusted exercise duration separately for each of the three interventions. We hypothesize a null slope for KCl, a strong positive slope for KNO3, and a positive slope to KNO3 for the combination therapy (which also contains KNO3). The strong positive slope for KNO3 is anticipated based on previous findings; we cannot yet predict the results for the combination as this will depend on which subjects are most impacted by improvements in mitochondrial reserve. Linearity will be assessed by including spline terms in the model and comparing the spline-based models and the linear model using an information criteria (AIC or BIC). Analyses will be repeated, stratified by male versus females, and assessed for evidence of sex-specific differences in the response. The secondary analysis will consider individual level DSkM OxPhos and include only those individuals in the lower and upper quartiles of DSkM OxPhos. The outcome variable will be submaximal exercise endurance under each of the treatment regimens. Using a two-group t-test, we will assess whether there are differences in the mean exercise endurance for each treatment group between the upper and lower quartiles of DSkM OxPhos. We predict that mean submaximal exercise endurance under the KNO3 intervention will be higher in the upper versus lower quartiles of DSkM OxPhos response; mean submaximal exercise endurance under the combination intervention will be higher in the lower versus upper quartiles of DSkM OxPhos response. Using only the 24 subjects with the highest and lowest quartiles of DSkM OxPhos, we have 80% power to detect differences in the mean submaximal exercise endurance of 203 seconds. The calculation assumes a familywise Type I error rate of 0.05 adjusted for the two different models and standard deviation of submaximal exercise endurance of 170 seconds."

This will be performed in accordance with the guidelines and under the supervision of the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. The study procedures, interventions, and the associated risks will be explained to participants during the informed consent process. Only IRB-approved consent forms will be used. We expect that all privacy practices put in place by those entities should translate into sufficient privacy for all participants. All informed consent procedures will be carried out by personnel approved to work on the study. The consent process will be carried out in a private area. Each potential participant will be given the consent form to read for him/herself and given adequate time to read the entire consent form. Study personnel will go through the consent form with the potential participant, answering any questions. We will explain the HIPAA form to all potential participants. Potential participants will also be informed of the voluntary nature of their participation and the lack of direct benefits. If the participant agrees to participate, an approved study team member will witness the participant sign and date the consent form, and then verify the process by signing the form as well. At no point will any undue influence be applied to the potential participant by any means including the embellishment of monetary compensation or understatement of risks associated with this study. The language to be used in the consent form will be written such that all potential participants can understand what is being asked of them, should they voluntarily choose to participate in the study. Consent forms will be kept in a locked file cabinet within the Principal Investigator’s research space. Although not directly targeted, economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, and/or employees or students of the University of Pennsylvania will not be denied enrollment and any special protections and/or additional safeguards will be undertaken in order to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects from coercion or undue influence, as appropriate. 10.1.2 Study Discontinuation and Closure This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board, the Medical Monitor, or the PI if there is sufficient reasonable cause.

This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participants. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible. The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the Institutional Review Board (IRB), or regulatory agencies may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records. The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored for internal use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing IRB, institutional policies, or sponsor requirements. Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will be maintained indefinitely in an electronic database. This will not include the participant’s contact or identifying information. Rather, individual participants and their research data will be identified by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by clinical sites and by the research staff will be secured and password protected. At the end of the study, all study databases will be de-identified and archived. If any data or samples are shared with collaborators at UPenn or elsewhere, only de-identified samples/data will be given, without any linking information. 10.1.4 Future Use of Stored Specimens and Data Data collected for this study will be analyzed and stored at UPenn.

Collaborators and study investigators may be provided with information linking the biological specimens with the phenotypic data from each participant, while maintaining the blinding/confidentiality of the identity of the participant. During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to have biological specimens stored for future research. In this case, no future specimens will be collected. However, biosamples and specimens already collected may be retained and used. When the study is completed, access to study data and/or samples will be provided through the Principal Investigator. Commercial Products: Samples/data may be shared with other entities, including for-profit companies, for research purposes. Any company/entity (at UPenn or elsewhere) receiving information/samples related to this study may ultimately discover products, drugs, tests, etc. as a result, which may lead to commercial products. Study participants will not be entitled to compensation for these discoveries. This information has been included in the informed consent. 10.1.5 Safety Oversight Safety oversight will be under the direction of a Medical Monitor and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) composed of individuals with the appropriate expertise, including a cardiologist and a statistician. Members of the DSMB should be independent from the study conduct and free of conflict of interest, or measures should be in place to minimize perceived conflict of interest. The DSMB will meet regularly to assess safety data on each arm of the study. The DSMB will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed at the organizational meeting of the DSMB. At this time, each data element that the DSMB needs to assess will be clearly defined. The DSMB will provide its input to the Principal Investigator and the Medical Monitor. 10.1.6 Clinical Monitoring A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan has been assembled for this study and is enumerated within a separate document. 10.1.7 Quality Assurance and Quality Control All monitoring and audits are to be performed according to ICH GCP E6(R2).
