Short-duration LCDs lead to rapid and significant weight loss1, and the combination of LCD and highly structured hypo-caloric diets including meal replacements with increased physical activity and frequent behavioural counselling (in combination known as IBT) is the current gold-standard for lifestyle interventions which increases the likelihood of achieving and maintaining significant weight loss2, 3. Objectives and endpoints Primary objective To compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to IBT in subjects with overweight or obesity. Key secondary objectives To compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to IBT in subjects with overweight or obesity: !Cardiovascular risk factors !Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs) Primary estimand The estimand will quantify the average treatment effect of semaglutide relative to semaglutide placebo after 68 weeks, as an adjunct to IBT in cluding an initial 8-week LCD, in all randomised subjects regardless of adherence to treatment and regardless of starting rescue interventions (weight management drugs or bariatric surgery) (“effectiveness”/“treatment policy” est imand). The estimand will cover all effect-related objectives. The following expansion of the primary estimand w ill cover the supportive secondary endpoint “Change from baseline at week 0 to week 8 in body weight (%)”. The estimand will quantify the average treatment effect of semaglutide relative to semaglutide placebo after 8 weeks, as an adjunct to IBT including LCD, in all randomised subjects regardless of adherence to treatment and regardless of starting rescue interventions. CONFIDENTIAL"

The medical and societal imp acts are considerable and obesity and overweight are some of the most significant public health challenges worldwide5-11. Obesity and overweight are associated with increased risk of a variety of comorbidities including hyperglycaemia, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, atheroscle rosis, osteoarthritis, urinary incontinence, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis, cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer, and risk of early death 12- 26. Moreover, obesity adversely affects physical and men tal health and reduces health related quality of life27, 28. Obesity is also associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, which also increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality29. The risk of obesity-related complications and comorbidities increases with increasing body mass index (BMI), and a weight loss of 5 −10 % has significant health benefits in terms of slowing progression to T2D.30-33Furthermore, a weight loss of 5 −10% improves many other obesity related comorbidities as well as physical symptoms and quality of life.34-41Finally, studies suggest a beneficial impact of weight loss on cardiovascular risk and mortality in both people with diabetes and obesity.42-44 Lifestyle intervention in the form of diet and exercise is first line treatment for obesity and overweight, but most people with obesity and ove rweight struggle to achieve and maintain their weight loss.45-54Surgical treatments offer an effective alternative for some people with severe obesity, but surgery carries a risk in connection with the procedure and is not without complications. Furthermore, surgery requires close follow-up of the individual which can be cumbersome and costly. 45-50, 55, 56Pharmacotherapy may therefore serve as a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention for individuals with obesity and overweight in order to achieve and sustain a clinically relevant weight loss, to improve comorbid conditions and to facilitate a healthier lifestyle. Few anti-obesity medications are currently available and there is a need for more safe and effective therapeutic options for treatment of obesity, especially treatments that also target weight maintenance, prevention and treatment of co-morbidities. 45-49, 57, 58 3.2 Background 3.2.1 Semaglutide Semaglutide is the next generation glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) currently under development by Novo Nordisk for the treatment of weight management (NN9536). Semaglutide has been optimised resulting in a longer half-life of approximately 160 hours, making it suitable for once-weekly dosing59. GLP-1 RA is a physiological regul ator of appetite and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation60. CONFIDENTIAL"

A total of 957 randomised subjects with obesity (without diabetes) were exposed to semaglutide (n=718), liraglutide 3.0 mg (n=103) or placebo (n=136). In this trial, an overall monotone dose-dependent weight loss was observed across the 5 semaglutide doses tested (0.05 to 0.4 mg once-daily). The estimated weight loss at week 52 was 13.84% at the highest dose tested (0.4 mg once-daily) compared to the weight loss of 2.3% achieved by diet, exercise and placebo alone 61 Clinical62-66and non-clinical data67indicate that the body weight-reducing effect of semaglutide is mainly mediated by a reduced energy intake. No unexpected safety findings were identified and the tolerability and safety profile was overall consistent with previous findings in the T2D development programme and the GLP-1 RA class in general. A comprehensive review of results from the non-clinical and clinical studies of semaglutide can be found in the current edition of the investigator’s brochure (IB)61and any updates hereof. 3.2.2 Trial population The trial population w ill consist of subjects with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) and weight-related comorbidities. Thes e subjects represent a clinically relevant population for pharmacotherapeutic weight management as they are at significant risk for weight- related morbidities and mortality, and are likely to benefit from weight reduction. Information about weight-related comorbidities, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea or cardiovascular disease, will be collected systemat ically at screening by the investigators as part of the medical history. Subjects with T2D are excluded from the trial. Sub jects with overweight or obesity and T2D will be addressed in a dedicated trial. First line treatment in weight management should always be lifestyle modification through a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. Thus only subjects who have tried but failed a dietary weight loss intervention w ill be included in accordance with regulatory guidelines. 68 69 3.3 Benefit-risk assessment 3.3.1 Benefits Subjects will be treated with a regimen anticipated to be better than or equal to the weight management they receive at the time of entry into th e trial. Results from the phase 2 trial (NN9536- 4153) demonstrated that semaglutide once-daily as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity was effective for weight loss in subjects with obesity, while displaying a satisfactory tolerability profile. Overall, a monot one dose-dependent weight loss was observed across all tested doses of semaglutide (0.05 to 0.4 mg once-daily). The weight loss was 11.55 CONFIDENTIAL"

Weight loss was accompanied by a consistent improvement in the weight-related comorbidities, indicated by cardiovascular risk factors, lipid profile and glycaemic factors, as well as improvements in clinical outcome assessments. In addition, it is expected that all subjects will be nefit from participation through close contact with the trial site and counselling by a dietician, all of which will most likely result in intensified weight management. 3.3.2 Risks and precautions The sections below describe identified and potential risks associated with semaglutide treatment. The identified/potential risks are based on findings in non-clinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks !Gastrointestinal adverse events !Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutide were ga strointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. !Cholelithiasis !Events of cholelithiasis were the most frequently reported gallbladder events in the phase 2 weight management trial (NN9536-4153) and were in a few instances co-reported with the event adjudication committee (EAC) confirmed acute pancreatitis. As a precaution, if cholelithiasis is suspected, appropriate clini cal follow-up is to be initiated at the investigator’s discretion. !Acute pancreatitis !Acute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 RA drug class. As a precaution, subjects with a history of chronic pancreat itis or recent acute pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, trial produc t should be discontinued in case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis in accordance to Section 8.1. Potential risks !Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) !Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid.  CONFIDENTIAL"
17,page_17,"Protocol CONFIDENTIALDate: 17 January 2018 Novo Nordisk Trial ID: NN9536-4375 Version: 1.0 Status: Final Page: 16 of 95 Accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor-mediated C-cell changes in humans is considered to be low. However, as a precaution, exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) ha ve been implemented in the trial. !Pancreatic cancer !There is currently no support from non-clinical studies, clinical trials or post-marketing data that GLP-1 RA based therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer, but pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by European Medicines Agency. As a precaution, subjects with a history of malignant neoplasms within the past 5 years prior to screening will be excluded from the trial. !Allergic reactions !As is the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide are at risk of developing immunogenic and allergic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to semaglu tide or related products will not be enrolled in this trial. Other risks !Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) !Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 3.3.3 Conclusion on benefit-risk profile Necessary precautions have been implemented in the design and planned conduct of the trial in order to minimise the risks and inconveniences of participation in the trial. The safety profile for semaglutide generated from the clinical and non-clinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly. The results of the phase 2 trial (NN9536-4153) indicate that semaglutide will provide a clinically meaningful weight loss. In conclusion, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and outweighed by the anticipated benefits that semaglutide w ould provide subjects in cluded in the trial. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of semaglutide may be found in the IB 61and any updates hereof.  CONFIDENTIAL"

The 7 weeks follow-up period is incl uded to account for the exposure and long half-life of semaglutide. A 68-week treatment duration (in cluding 52 weeks on target dose) is considered sufficient to assess weight loss, safety and tolerability in the phase 3 weight management development programme in accordance with regulatory guidelines 68 69. A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, two-armed, parallel group, multi-centre trial design is chosen to minimise bias in the assessment of the effect and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to IBT. Short-duration LCDs lead to rapid and significant weight loss1. By transitioning subjects from LCD to a highly structured hypo-caloric diet while combining with increased physical activity and frequent behavioural counselling the trial follow the current gold-standard for long term lifestyle interventions. 5.5 Justification for dose Results from the phase 2 dose-finding trial (NN9536-4153) showed that the semaglutide 0.4 mg once-daily dose was most effective in terms of weight loss while displaying an acceptable tolerability profile. Using population pharmacokinetic modelling, it was estimated that a once-weekly maintenance dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide will result in similar C maxat steady-state as that obtained by the onc e-daily 0.4 mg s emaglutide dose in trial NN9536-4153. A maintenance dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly has been chosen for the phase 3 weight management development programme. The once-week ly dosing is anticipated to ease the burden of drug administration in clinical practic e. Subjects will be initiated at a once-weekly dose of 0.25 mg and follow a fixed-dose escalation regimen, with dose increases every 4 weeks (to doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg/week), until the target dose is reached after 16 weeks. It is well known that to mitigate GI side effects with GLP-1 RA treatment, dose escalation to the target dose is required. Based on experience from the semaglutide T2D development programme, a similar fixed-dose escalation regimen was selected, with dose escalation every 4 weeks until the target dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks. Please refer to Section 7.1for more details on treatment doses. CONFIDENTIAL"

If a subject achieves a BMI ≤ 22.5 kg/m 2, the recommended energy intake should be re-calculated with no caloric deficit for the remainder of the trial. Subjects will receive and use an activity tracker and will be instructed to record their food intake in order to assist their lifestyle intervention. The activity tracker, food diary/app and content of the subject hand out from IBT guide will be used for counselling purposes by the dietician or a similarly qualified healthcare professional at all visits. Data from the activity tracker collected in this trial will be used for exploratory purposes. Subjects will be allowed to keep the activity tracker after approval by the independent ethics committee(IEC)/institutional review board (IRB). Subjects may use a food registry tool of their own choice (paper/app/other tool) for dietary recording, ensuring it can be reviewed during the counselling sessions. Subjects must receive instructions in how to capture food intake and should be encouraged to keep the diary on a daily basis. 7.2 Dose modification Not applicable for this trial.

The investigator can be queried to provide additional information related to the reported AE, e.g. alternative aetiology, underlying cause(s) and/or clinical details. !EAC-identified events: When reviewing source documents provided for another event for adjudication, the EAC can identify additional events in scope for adjudication that were not initially reported by the investigator. In these instances, the investigator w ill be notified of the newly identified event and has the option to report the EAC-identified event. Regardless of whether the investigator decides to report the event, it will undergo adjudication. Occasionally, EAC-identified events may require the inve stigator to collect additional source documents which should be provided by uploading to the event adjudication system. With the exception of EAC-identified events, an event-specific adjudication form for the event in question should be completed in the CRF within 14 calendar days of the investigator's first knowledge of the event. Copies of collected source documents should be labelled with trial ID, subject and AE number, redacted (anonymised of personal identifiers) and uploaded to the event adjudication system (EAS) within 4 weeks according to instructions outlined in the event adjudication site manual. If no, or insufficient source documents are provided to the adjudication supplier, the investigator can be asked to complete a clinical narrative to be uploaded to the EAS. If new information becomes available for an event sent for adjudication, it is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the new information is uploaded to the EAS. 9.2.2 Method of detecting AEs and SAEs Care should be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non- leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about events. 9.2.3 Follow-up on AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or if the event is otherwise explained (e.g. chronic condition) or the subject is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 8.3).

If the subject refuses to be referred to a MHP, the subject’s decision shoul d be documented in subject’s medical record and the investigator must assess if it is safe for the subject to continue in the trial or if the subject should be discontinued from trial product. If a subject’s psychiatric disorder can be adequately treated with psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapeutic treatment, then the subject, at the discretion of the investigator (and in agreement with the MHP), may continue in the tr ial. Otherwise, the subject must be discontinued from trial product due to safety con cern as judged by the investigator. 9.4.2 Physical e xaminations !A physical examination will include assessments of the general appearance, thyroid gland, breast (females), and abdomen, as well as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. !Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 9.4.3 Vital signs !The method for measuring systolic and diastolic blood pressure needs to follow the standard clinical practice at site. !Blood pressure (diastolic and systolic blood pressure) and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the subject in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g. television, cell phones). !Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed in a sitting position with a completely automated device.

Note, this is done per assessment and per subject; subjects may be a different type for different assessments (a subject may have “available on randomised treatment (AT)” for body weight but “missing on randomised treatment (MT)” for waist circumference).

These are also called non-retrieved subjectsMD 10.1 Sample size determination The sample size and thereby the power for this trial is primarily defined to support safety. However, no formal statist ical inference is planned based on number of adverse events. Given the trial sample size, the power of statistical tests for effect endpoints is described below. The tests of superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg to semagl utide placebo for the primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints are performed using the fixed-sequence statistical strategy. This strategy tests the endpoints using a predefined hierarchical order, all at the significance level of 5%, moving to test the next endpoint only after a statistically significant superiority result (p-value < 5%) on the previous endpoint. The test hierarchy is given in Table 10-2 with underlying assumptions, marginal power and effective pow er. The effective power is calcula ted under the assumption of independence of endpoints by multiplying the respective marginal powers  CONFIDENTIAL"

As the two primary endpoints are included in the statistical testing hierarchy, significant superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs . semaglutide placebo must be demonstrated for each of the primary endpoints. In the analysis approach addressing the primary estimand, week 68 assessments from retrieved subjects (AD) is used. These data are also used to impute missing measurements at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD). The imputation is done separately within each treatment arm (see description below). However, for the power calculations missing values (MT and MD), regardless of treatment arm, are assumed to be similar to semaglutide placebo subjects. These assumptions are likely conservative with respect to the power, and correspond to the jump to reference sensitivity analysis planned below. CONFIDENTIAL"

Given these assumptions, the sample size of 600 subjects (400 in the semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly and 200 in the semaglutide placebo arm), gives an effective power (marginal powers multiplied) of 86% for the first seven endpoints in the hierarchical testing procedure.

Several approaches for imputation will be applied. First, a description of the primary imputation approach to address the primary estimand for the primary endpoints is given followed by a description o f the sensitivity analyses used to assess the robustness of the primary analysis results. The sensitivity analyses investigate how assumptions on body weight development after discontinuation of randomised treatment impact the estimated treatment contrasts between semaglutide 2.4 mg and semaglutide placebo.

Missing body weight measurement at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD) are imputed using assessments from retrieved subjects (AD) in each randomised treatment arm. This will be done according to the timing of last available observa tion (LAO) of body weight. Missing body weight measurements at week 68 for subjects on randomised treatment (MT) are imputed by sampling from available measurements at week 68 from subjects on randomised treatment (AT) in the relevant randomised treatment arm. The multiple impu tation approach is done in three steps: 1.Imputation : Defines an imputation model using retrieved subjects (AD) from FAS and done within groups defined by randomised treatment and the timing of the LAO of body weight. The model will be a linear regression of body weight (kg) at week 68 with gender (male/female), baseline BMI (kg/m 2) (in categories 27-<35, 35-<40, ≥40) as factors and baseline body weight (kg) and LAO of body weight (kg) as covariates. No interactions will be included. The grouping of timing will be done by quarters (intervals of 17 weeks). If timing by quarters is too restrictive, halves (intervals of 34 weeks) or excluding timing will be used. If any subjects are MT, an imputation model for missing body weight measurements at week 68 for MT subjects will also be defined using AT subjects in a similar way. The estimated posterior distribution for the parameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation models are then used to impute missing week 68 body weight values f or each randomised treatment arm. This will be done 1,000 times and results in 1,000 complete data sets. 2.Analysis : Analysis of each of the 1,000 complete data sets, using the analysis models (ANCOVA and logistic regression) results in 1,000 times 2 estimations. 3.Pooling : Integrates the 1,000 times 2 estimation results into two final results using Rubin’s formula. Based on NN9536-4153 phase 2 results 1,000 copies should be sufficient to establish stable results. If 1,000 copies are insufficient, 10,000 copies will be used. The multiple imputations will be generated using Novo Nordisk trial number 95364375 as seed number. Sensitivity analysis Jump to reference multiple imputation approach (J2R-MI): Missing values of body weight at week 68 (MT and MD) for both the semaglutide 2.4 mg and semaglutide placebo group are imputed by sampling among all available assessments at week 68 in the semaglutide placebo group (AT and AD). This approach makes the assumption that subjects instantly after discontinuation lose any effect of randomised treatment beyond what can be expected from semaglutide placebo treatment as adjunct to IBT including an initial 8-week LCD 78. The multiple imputation approach is done as above with the first step replaced by: CONFIDENTIAL"

The model will be a linear regression of body weight (kg) at week 68 with gender (male/female), BMI (kg/m2) (in categories 27-<35,35-<40, ≥40) as factors and baseline body weight (kg) as covariate. No interactions will be included. The estimated posterior distribution for the parameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation models are then used to impute missing week 68 body weight values for each randomised treatment arm. This will be done 1,000 times and results in 1,000 complete data sets. The jump to reference approach is the basis for the sample size calculations. A single imputation approach as done by Sacks 79(S1-SI and S2-SI) : Missing weight measurements at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD) are imputed using a weight regain rate of 0.3 kg/month after LAO but truncated at no change from baseline whenever the extrapolation would lead to a positive weight gain relative to baseline. If a subject's weight at drug discontinuation represented a gain in weight relative to baseline, no additional gain will be imputed, and the unfavourable gain is carried forward to week 68. The weight regain imputation will be done for both randomised arms (S1-SI). Additionally, a version where only the se maglutide 2.4 mg arm uses the regain rate while the placebo arm uses last available observation (corresponding to a weight regain rate of 0 kg/month) will be performed (S2-SI). For both ve rsions, missing weight measurements at week 68 for subjects on randomised treatment (MT) are imputed by using LAO. Tipping-point multiple imputation analysis (TP-MI) : First, missing data are imputed according to the primary multiple imputation approach. Second, for the semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment arm a penalty will be added to the imputed values at week 68. The approach is to gradually increase this penalty until all confirmed conclusions from the primary analysis are reversed. For each hypothesis tested the specific value of the penalty that reverses the conclusion will be used to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results. This sens itivity analysis evaluates the robustness of the superiority conclusions. Mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) : This ‘MMRM for effectiveness’ will use all assessments regardless of adherence to randomised treatment, including assessments at week 68 for retrieved drop-outs (AD). The MMRM for effectiv eness will be fitted using the same factor and covariate as for the primary analyses all nested wi thin visit. An unstructured covariance matrix for measurements within the same subject will be employed, assuming that measurements for different subjects are independent. Non-retrieved subjects as non-responders : For the 5% responder analysis an analysis using non- retrieved subjects as non-responders in the logistic regressions will be done. CONFIDENTIAL"

The Semaglutide s.c. safety committee may recommend unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an independent ad hoc group will be established in order to maintain the blinding of the trial personnel. Event adjudication committee An independent external EAC is established to perform ongoing blinded adjudication of selected types of events and deaths (see Table 9-1 andAppendix 4 ). The EAC will evaluate events sent for adjudication using pre-defined definitions and guidelines in accordance with the EAC Charter. The evaluation is based on review of pre-def ined clinical data collected by the trial sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering all required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact on trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The assessment made by both the EAC and the investigator will be presented in the clini cal trial report. In this trial, cardiovascular events will be adjudicated in order to adequately characterize the cardiovascular safety profile, since cardiovascular disease is an important and serious comorbidity of obesity 82. In addition, events of acute pancreatitis will be adjudicated because Novo Nordisk monitors these events closely as treatment with GLP-1 agonists has been associated with acute pancreatitis. 7) Publication policy The information obtained during the conduct of this trial is considered confidential, and may be used by or on behalf of Novo Nordisk for regulatory purposes as well as for the general development of the trial product.

The information obtained during this trial may be made available to other investigators who are conducting other clinical trials with the trial produ ct, if deemed necessary by Novo Nordisk. Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled, Novo Nordisk may grant access to information obtained during this trial to researchers who require access for research projects studying the same disease and/or trial product studied in this trial. Novo Nordisk may publish on its clinical trials website a redacted clinical trial report for this trial. One (or two) investigator(s) w ill be appointed by N ovo Nordisk to review and sign the clinical trial report (signatory investigator) on behalf of all participating investigators. The signatory investigator(s) will be appointed based upon the criteria defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for research publications 83. Communication of results Novo Nordisk commits to communicate and disclose results of trials regardless of outcome. Disclosure includes publication of a manuscript in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, abstract submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting or disclosure by other means. The results of this trial will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to international and national regulations. Novo Nordi sk reserves the right to defer the release of data until specified milestones are reached, for example when the clinical trial report is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may influence the results of the entire trial. At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property. In all cases the trial results will be reported in an objective, accurate, balanced and complete manner, with a discussion of the strengths and limitations. In the event of any disagreement on the content of any publication, both the investigators’ and Novo Nordisk opinions will be fairly and sufficiently represented in the publication.

All authors will be provided with the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports needed to evaluate the planned publication. Where required by the journal, the investigator from each trial site will be named in an acknowledgement or in the s upplementary m aterial, as specified by the journal. Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s) For a multicentre clinical trial, analyses based on single-site data usually have significant statistical limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare professionals or subjects, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. Thus, Novo Nordisk may deny a request or ask for deferment of the publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. In line with Good Publication Practice, such individual reports should not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Investigator access to data and review of results As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database. Individual investigators will have their own subjects' data, and will be provided with the randomisation code after results are available. 8) Dissemination of clinical trial data Information of the trial will be disclosed at clinicaltrials.gov and novonordisk-trials.com. It will also be disclosed according to other applicable requirements such as those of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) 84, the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA)85, European Commission Requirements23, 86, 87 , 88, 89and other relevant recommendations or regulations. If a subject requests to be included in the trial via the Novo Nordisk e-mail contact at these we b sites, Novo Nordisk may disclose the investigator’s contact details to the subject. As a result of increasing requirements for transparency, some countries require public disclosure of investigator names and their affiliations. The Primary Completion Date (PCD) is the last assessment of the primary endpoint, and is for this trial Last Subject First Treatment (LSFT) + 68 weeks corresponding to ‘End of tr eatment’ visit. If the last subject is withdrawn early, the PCD is considered the date when the last subject would have completed ‘end of treatment’ visit. The PCD determines the deadline for results disclosure at clinicaltrials.gov according to FDAAA. CONFIDENTIAL"

Events meeting the AE definition !Any abnormal laboratory test results or safety assessments, including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. !A CLAE: a clinical abnormal laboratory finding which is clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. !Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. !Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. !Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of trial product regardless of intent. !A ""lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition. Events NOT meeting the AE definition !Pre-existing conditions, anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing conditions, including those identified during screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product. Note: pre-existing conditions should be r ecorded as medical history/concomitant illness. !Pre-planned procedures, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. Definition of an SAE An SAE is an AE that fulfils at least one of the following criteria: !Results in death !Is life-threatening The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. !Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation oHospitalisation signifies that the subject has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalisation are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalisation” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. oHospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. CONFIDENTIAL"

In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. !When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) related to the event. !There may be instances when copies of source documents (e.g. medical records) for certain cases are requested by Novo Nordisk. In such cases, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be redacted on the copies of the source documents before submission to Novo Nordisk. !For all non-serious AEs the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved or at the end of the trial at the latest. For sign-off of SAE related forms refer to “SAE reporting via paper CRF” later in this section. !Novo Nordisk products used as concomitant medication: if an AE is considered to have a causal relationship with a Novo Nordisk marketed product used as concomitant medication in the trial, it is important that the suspected relationship is reported to Novo Nordisk, e.g. in the alternative aetiology section on the safety information form. Novo Nordisk may need to report this AE to relevant regulatory authorities. Assessment of severity The investigator will assess intensity for each event reported during the trial and assign it to one of the following categories: !Mild : An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. !Moderate : An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities. !Severe : An event that prevents normal everyday activities. Note: Severe is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both an AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the outcomes described in the definition of an SAE and not when it is rated as severe. Assessment of causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between trial product and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. Relationship between an AE/SAE and the relevant trial product (s) should be assessed as: !Probable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. !Possible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. !Unlikely - The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product. Alternative aetiology, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant medication, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to trial product administration will be considered and investigated. CONFIDENTIAL"

For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical records that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, it is important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send a follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Final outcome The investigator will select the most appropriate outcome: !Recovered/resolved: The subject has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial-related activity after the subject signed the informed consent. !Recovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. !Recovered/resolved with sequelae: The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequelae meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. !Not recovered/not resolved: The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged or the outcome is not known. !Fatal: This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with a fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. !Unknown: This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. Follow-up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Novo Nordisk to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible (e.g. severe hypersensitivity reactions). This may include additional laboratory tests (e.g. skin prick test) or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a subject dies during participation in the trial or during a recognised follow-up period, the investigator should provide Novo Nordisk with a copy of autopsy report including histopathology.

Postmenopausal female !A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or Hormonal Replacement Therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. !Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the trial. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before trial enrolment.

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C- cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical in terpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (> 100 ng/L) as likely ind icative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !tobacco use !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical c onditions and in different patient po pulations (i.e. with various comorbidities) is poorly unde rstood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells.

For classification and further details of the risks, please refer to the current version of the IB or any updates hereof. The identified/potential risks are base d on findings in non-clinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks !Gastrointestinal adverse events !Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RA s, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutide were gastrointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Potential risks !Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) !Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks expos ure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid. Accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor-mediated C-cell changes in humans is considered to be low. However, as a precaution, exclusio n and discontinuation criteria related to medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) have been implemented in the trial. Other risks !Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) !Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women.

Subjects will switch from semaglutide B 3.0 mg/mL PDS290/semaglutide placebo to sema glutide B 3.2 mg/mL PDS290/semaglutide placebo at week 60 (visit 29). !Confirmatory, supportive secondary and exploratory endpoints related to WRSSM have been updated. Based on new data from recently reported trials, the WRSSM has showed to have substantial ceiling effects and low responsiveness within our target population.
