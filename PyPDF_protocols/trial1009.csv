The study consists of an up to 7- day Screening Period, a 26 -week Initial Evaluation Period and an Extension Period until the product is registered or appro ved (in accordance with country -specific regulations) or for up to 4.5 years , whichever occurs first . Patients will receive a weight- based loading dose of ALXN1210 IV (≥ 40 to < 60 kg = 2400 mg; ≥ 60 to < 100 kg = 2700 mg; ≥ 100 kg = 3000 mg ) on Day 1, followed by weight- based maintenance doses of ALXN1210 IV (≥ 40 to < 60 kg = 3000 mg; ≥ 60 to < 100 kg = 3300 mg; ≥ 100 kg = 3600 mg) on Day 15 and once every 8 week s (q8w) thereafter for a total of 26 week s of treatment in the Initial Evaluation Period followed by maintenance dos es q8w in the Extension Period . The end of trial is defined as the last patient’s last visit. Weight -based dosing is based on the patient’s body weight recorded at the last visit or more recently . Number of Patients (planned): Approximately 55 patients are planned for enrollment. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Patients must meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria. Patients who fail any of the eligibility criteria may be rescreened based on discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor . Patients may be rescreened a maximum of 2 times . Evaluation of Inclusion Crit eria 2a and 2b may be based on local laboratory results within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period or laboratory results obtained during the Screening Period from a local or central laboratory. If a local laboratory is used to define eligibility, additional samples will be collected during the Screening Period for LDH, platelet count, hemoglobin and serum creatinine and tested at the central laboratory. If patients are found to not meet the eligibility criteria for serum creatinine (Inclusio n Criterion 2c) based on central laboratory results, they must not be enrolled into the study; if the subject has received the first dose of ALXN1210 the patient must be withdrawn from the study, and may be replaced. All analyses in this study will be base d on results from the central laboratory. A central laboratory result for Inclusion Criterion 2c may not be available prior to first dose; results received after the first dose indicating that eligibility is not satisfied could lead to discontinuation and replacement of the patient. The study will enroll at least 6 and up to 10 adolescent (12 to < 18 years of age at Screening) patients and at least 10 and up to 25 patients with prior kidney transplants . A minimum of 30 patients who meet all laboratory criteria for TMA (platelet count of < 150,000 per microliter, LDH ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), hemoglobin ≤ lower limit of normal (LLN), and serum creatinine level ≥ ULN) as determined by the central laboratory at Day 1, will be enrolled .

11,page_11,"Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -311 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 4, 07 May 2019 Page 11 of 86 CONFIDENTIAL The Investigator will evaluate extra -renal signs or symptoms of aHUS using a composite of clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs, and an organ system review. Safety The long-term safety and tolerability of ALXN1210 will be evaluated by physical examination s, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECG) , laboratory assessments, and incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs ). The proportion of patients who develop antidrug antibodies (ADA) will also be assessed. Sample Size: Approximately 55 patients will be enrolled in this study in order to yield at least 50 evaluable patients by Day 183. This sample size is deemed appropriate to provide complete safety information and the necessary precision level for the planned estimation. Assuming a proportion of Complete TMA response of 65%, 50 patients would yield a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the proportion of response with a half -width of approximately 15%. The sample size was increased to 55 patients to account for a potential 10% drop -out rate, thus yielding a total planned sample size of 55 patients. Statistical methods: General : All data collected will be presented using summary tables, figures, and data listings. All analyses will be performed using SAS® release, version 9. 4 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) or other validated statistical software. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of observations and mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency counts and percentage of patients. An interim clinical study report (CSR) will be prepared at the end of the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, which will include efficacy, safety, and PK /PD analyses. A final CSR to summarize long -term efficacy, safety, and PK/PD will be produced at study completion. Available exploratory data will be summarized after study completion but may not be included in the CSR . All data collected will be presented using summary tables, figures, and data listings. Efficacy : Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set ( FAS). The analysis of the FAS will be the primary analysis. The FAS will be based on a modified intent to treat ( mITT ) approach where patients that were enrolled and treated based on verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria through local laboratory results and the assumption that all inclusion and exclusion criteria were satisfied will be excluded from the FAS if it is later shown that certain of the inclusion and exclusion criteria were in fact not satisfied once all Screening laboratory results are available. Based on the above, the FAS will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210, have at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment, and meet all of the following criteria: • Patients who satisfy Inclusion Criterion number 2 c • Patients who satisfy Exclusion Criteri on number 1 • Patients who satisfy Exclusion Criterion number 2 The FAS will be determined prior to database lock and prior to the database snapshot for the analysis performed at the end of the 26 -week Initial Evaluation Period. Primary efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint is Complete TMA Response during the 26 -week Initial Evaluation Period. The primary analysis will consist in estimating the proportion of complete TMA responders among ALXN1210 treated patients. This will be performed by calculating the point estimate and a 95% CI for the proportion of complete TMA responders in ALXN1210 treated patients. The CI will be based on the asymptotic Gaussian approximation method with a continuity correction. Secondary efficacy: For the secondary efficacy endpoint of time to Complete TMA Response, a Kaplan -Meier cumulative distribution curve will be generated along with a 2- sided 95% CI. The corresponding summary table will present the cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) estimate, the number of patients at risk, the number of patients responding, and the number of patients censored at each post baseline time point. The table will also present first quartile,"

Amendment 4, 07 May 2019 Page 12 of 86 CONFIDENTIAL median, and third quartile, along with corresponding 2-sided 95% CI, of time to complete response. Complete TMA response will also be summarized over time by presenting the number and proportion of responders along with a 2-sided 95% CI for each postbaseline time point. A similar approach will be used to summarize the number and proportion of patients with an increase from baseline in hemoglobin ≥ 20 g/L, observed at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between. Kidney function (dialysis requirement status, eGFR , CKD stage) as well as hematologic parameters (platelets, LDH, hemoglobin) will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline time point . Descriptive statistics for continuous variables (eGFR, platelets, LDH, hemoglobin) will be used to summarize the observed value as well as the change from baseline. A mixed model for repeate d measures (MMRM) with the fixed, categorical effect of visit and fixed, c ontinuous effect of the specific test’s baseline value as covariates may be fit to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point. Dialysis requirement status and CKD stage will be summarized over time. Dialysis requirement status will be summarized among patients receiving dialysis within 5 days prior to ALXN1210 treatment initiation by presenting the number and proportion of those patients receiving and not receiving dialy sis at each time point. A 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion receiving dialysis will be provided . CKD stage will be summarized over time by presenting the number and proportion of patients that improved (excluding those with Stage 1 at baseline as they cannot improve), worsened (excluding those with Stage 5 at baseline as they cannot worsen), and stayed the same compared to CKD stage at baseline. Stage 5 will be considered the worst category, while Stage 1 will be considered the best catego ry. A 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion will be provided for each category. Quality of life will be evaluated using EQ-5D-3L (all patients), FACIT Fatigue v ersion 4 (patients ≥ 18 years of age), and Pediatric FACIT Fatigue (patients < 18 years of age) questionnaires. These measures will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the observed value as well as the change from baseline. A MMRM with the fixed, categorical effect of v isit and fixed, continuous effect of the specific test’s baseline value as covariates may be fit to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point. Safety: Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Set defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of ALXN1 210. The incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) overall, by severity, and by relationship to treatment. Observed values and c hanges from baseline (last assessment prior to ALXN1210) in ECGs, vital signs, and laboratory assessments, as well as presence of ADA will be summarized. Shifts from baseline in laboratory assessments will be summarized for all study visits. Pharmacokinetics/Pharm acodynamics : Sparse PK and PD (free C5) samples will be collected over the course of the study . Individual serum concentration data for all patients who receive at least 1 infusion of ALXN1210 and who have evaluable PK data will be used to derive the PK parameters for ALXN1210. Graphs of mean serum concentration- time profiles will be constructed . Graphs of serum concentration -time profiles for individual patients may also be provided. Actual dose administration and sampling times will be used for all calc ulations. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for serum concentration data at each sampling time, as appropriate. Assessment of population -PK may be considered using data from this study or in combination with data from other studies. The PD effects of ALXN1210 administered IV will be evaluated by assessing the absolute values and changes and percentage changes from baseline in free C5 serum concentrations over time , as appropriate . Assessments of PK/PD relationships may be explored using data from t his study or in combination with data from other studies. Pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed for all patients who receive at least 1 infusion of study drug and who have evaluable PD data. For PD parameters, summary tabulations of mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum values will be presented for actual, change and percentage change from baseline. The relationship between changes in PD parameters, exploratory biomarkers, and the effects of treatment outcome may be evaluated."

INTRODUCTION Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), most often caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the alternative pathway of complement (APC) or by autoantibodies against APC regulatory proteins ( Noris, 2010). Patients with aHUS are at risk for life -threatening manifestations of disease resulting from endothelial damage, including thromboc ytopenia, intravascular hemolysis, acute renal failure, and extra- renal tissue damage. Importantly, approximately 20% of patients experience extra-renal manifestations of disease, including central nervous system, cardiac, gastrointestinal, distal extremity, and severe systemic organ involvement ( Loirat, 2011 ; Brodsky, 2015). Before the availability of eculizumab, m ortality rates among patients with aHUS were as high as 15% during the acute progressing phase of the disease ( Noris, 2010; Sellier -Leclerc, 2007). Up to 50% of patients progressed to end- stage kidney disease (ESKD), often within a year of disease onset, and required dialysis or kidney transplant to sustain life. Chronic, uncontrolled terminal complement activation, specifically, activation of com plement component 5 (C5) and dysregulation of complement activity, is central to the pathogenesis of aHUS and the devastating manifestations of this disease. As a result, the targeted blockade of C5, with selective inhibition of generation of C5a and C5b- 9, represents an important therapeutic mechanism of treatment. Eculizumab (Soliris ®) is the standard of care for aHUS patients. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity. Eculizumab has no known off- target interactions with other proteins in vitro or in vivo. In addition, eculizumab is predicted to be effectorless, having no detectable binding to complement C1q or most Fcγ receptors (FcγR I, IIb/c IIIa, IIIb) and more than 10- fold weaker binding than an IgG1 isotype to FcγR IIa. Upon binding to the complement protein C5, eculizumab blocks cleavage to C5a and C5b by C5 convertase; which prevents generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. These attributes underlie the establ ished safety and therapeutic efficacy profile of eculizumab as demonstrated in the 3 pivotal Phase 2 clinical studies (C10 -003, C10-004, and C08- 002A/B) and supported by subsequent postmarketing experiences. ALXN1210 and eculizumab are both recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibodies against human complement protein C5 sharing over 99% amino acid sequence homology. The goal of treatment with these complement inhibitors is to achieve immediate, complete, and sustained blockade of terminal complement activi ty. ALXN1210 is produced in Chinese hamster cells and was designed through minimal targeted engineering to substitute 4 amino acids in the eculizumab heavy chain to extend antibody half- life. These changes are designed to increase the half-life of ALXN1210 relative to eculizumab, increasing the duration of complete terminal complement inhibition, while preserving both the high degree of specificity for binding to C5 and the effectorless nature of the antibody. Two studies of ALXN1210 are ongoing in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who are naïve to treatment with complement inhibitors. Study ALXN1210- PNH -103 is a Phase 1b, open-label, multiple dose study, and Study ALXN1210 -PNH-201 is a Phase 2, open-label, multiple dose study. ALXN1210- PNH -103 is designed to assess dose ranging over a 2-fold range of trough exposure levels, while Study ALXN1210- PNH- 201 is designed to assess"
23,page_23,"Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -311 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 4, 07 May 2019 Page 23 of 86 CONFIDENTIAL dose intervals of 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks. Each study in patients with PNH also includes a 2- year extension phase. In addition, Study ALXN1210- HV-104 is being conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ALXN1210 in healthy Japanese subjects. Preliminary data from ALXN1210- PNH-103, indicate ALXN1210 treatment resulted in rapid reductions in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in 100% of patients, which were sustained through 2 to 4 monthly dosing intervals, consistent with the extended half- life (t½) of ALXN1210 ( Lee, 2016). There was a notable decrease in the need for blood transfusions. These prelim inary LDH data suggest that rapid, complete, and sustained complement inhibition with ALXN1210 results in highly effective blockade of intravascular hemolysis. More information about the PK, mechanism of action, known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated adverse events (AEs) of ALXN1210 may be found in the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 5.1. Benefits and Risks Assessment 5.1.1. Potential Benefits ALXN1210 and eculizumab are recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibodies that bind the same epitope on complement protein C5 and deliver rapid, sustained, and specific inhibition of C5 activation and the terminal complement cascade through identical mechanisms of action. Due to its close pharmacological relationship to eculizumab and s pecificity for C5, ALXN1210 is anticipated to allow longer dosing intervals while having a safety and efficacy profile similar to eculizumab. While eculizumab is an effective therapy for the treatment of aHUS, chronic administration of the eculizumab regim en may pose an important burden to patients, many of whom have to miss days of work or school to accommodate once- every -2-week treatment. In some cases, patients may refuse treatment or are not compliant due to the frequency of treatment. Practice survey research supports the assumption that less frequent once- every -8-week infusions associated with ALXN1210 will have a positive impact on daily life for patients and their caregivers. 5.1.2. Identified and Potential Risks 5.1.2.1. Infections (N. Meningitidis and Other Encaps ulated Organisms) Increased susceptibility to infection with encapsulated bacteria, particularly N. meningitidis , is a known risk associated with complement inhibition. Similar to eculizumab, the main risk associated with ALXN1210 is the risk of meningococcal infections. Specific risk mitigation measures are in place to address this risk, as described in Section 9.8. 5.1.2.2. Immunogenicity Therapeutic proteins, including humanized mAbs like ALXN1210 , may be associated with immunogenicity reactions. Consequently, monitoring of immunogenicity is in place for this study, as described in S ection 7.3 and Section 11.6. No immunogenicity reactions have been observed to date in clinical studies with ALXN1210."

Summary of Study Design Study ALXN1210-a HUS -311 is a Phase 3 , open-label, single arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALXN1210 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion to adolescent (12 to < 18 years of age) and adult (≥ 18 years of age) patients with aHUS. The study will enroll approximately 55 patients to receive ALXN1210. All patients must be naïve to complement inhibitor treatment and include at least 6 and up to 10 adolescent (12 to < 18 years of age at Screening) patients and at least 1 0 and up to 25 patients with prior kidney transplants . A minimum of 30 patients who meet all laboratory criteria for TMA (platelet count of < 150,000 per microliter, LDH ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), hemoglobin ≤ lower limit of normal (LLN), and serum creatinine level ≥ ULN) as determined by the central laboratory at Day 1, will be enrolled. The study consists of an up to 7 day Screening Period, a 26- week Initial Evaluation Period, and an Extension P eriod until the product is registered or approved (in accordance with country-specific regulations) or for up to 4.5 years, whichever occurs first. Dos ages are based on the patient’s body weight recorded at the last visit or more recently (Table 6). Patients will receive a loading dose of ALXN1210 IV (2400 mg for patients weighing ≥ 40 to < 60 kg, 2700 mg for patients weighing ≥ 60 to < 100 kg, 3000 mg for patients weighing ≥ 100 kg) on Day 1, followed by maintenance doses of ALXN1210 IV (3000 mg for patients weighing ≥ 40 to < 60 kg, 3300 mg for patients weighing ≥ 60 to < 100 kg, 3600 mg for patients weighing ≥ 100 kg) on Day 15 and once every 8 weeks (q 8w) thereafter for a total of 26 weeks of treatment in the Initial Evaluation Period followed by maintenance dos es q8w in the Extension Period ( Figure 1) . The end of trial is defined as the last patient’s last visit. Figure 1 illustrates the study design. Figure 1: Study Design Schematic for Clinical Protocol ALXN1210- aHUS -311 7.2. Discussion of Design This Phase 3, open- label, single arm study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with ALXN1210. Although no formal comparison analyses are planned for this study, results from ALXN1210 -treated patients will be evaluated in the context of results reported in eculizumab"

Individuals who do not satisfy the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened based on discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. Patients may be rescreened a maximum of 2 times . Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permit ted. 8.1. Inclusion Criteria Patients are eligible for enrollment in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria and none of the exclusion criteria: 1. Male or female patients ≥ 12 years of age and weighing ≥ 40 kg at the time of consent . 2. Evidence of TMA, including thrombocytopenia, evidence of hemolysis, and kidney injury , based on the following laboratory findings: a. Platelet count < 150,000 per microliter (µL) during the Screening Period or within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period , and b. LDH ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) during the Screening Period or within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period , and hemoglobin ≤ lower limit of normal ( LLN ) for age and gender during the Screening Period or within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period , and c. Serum creatinine level ≥ ULN during the Screening Period in adults (≥ 18 years of age), or ≥ 97.5 th percentile for age ( Appendix A ) at Screening in adolescents (12 to < 18 years of age) (patients who require dialysis for acute kidney injury are also eligible ). 3. Among patients with a kidney transplant: a. Known history of aHUS prior to current kidney transplant, or b. No known history of aHUS, and persistent evidence of TMA at least 4 days after modifying the immunosuppressive regimen (eg, suspending or reducing the dose) of calcineurin inhibitor ([ CNI]; eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor ([ mTORi ]; eg, sirolimus, everolimus). 4. Among patients with onset of TMA postpartum , persistent evidence of TMA for > 3 days after the day of childbirth . 5. To reduce the risk of meningoc occal infection ( Neisseria meningitidis ), all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections within 3 years prior to, or at the time of,"

Patients who receive a meningococcal vaccine less than 2 weeks before initiating ALXN1210 treatment must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Patients who have not been vaccinated prior to initiating ALXN1210 treatment should receive prophylactic antibiotics prior to and for at least 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination. 6. Patients < 18 years of age must have been vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae according to national and local vaccination schedule guidelines. 7. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must follow protocol-specified guidance ( Section 9.10) for avoiding pregnancy while on treatment and for 8 months after last dose of study drug. 8. Willing and able to give written informed consent and comply with the study visit schedule. For pati ents < 18 years of age, patient's legal guardian must be willing and able to give written informed consent and the patient must be willing to give written informed assent (if applicable as determined by the central or local Institutional Review Board [IRB]/ Institutional (or Independent) Ethics Committee [ IEC]). Evaluation of Inclusion Criteria 2a and 2b may be based on local laboratory results within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period or laboratory results obtained during the Screening Period from a local or central laboratory. If a local laboratory is used to define eligibility, additional samples will be collected during the Screening Period for LDH, platelet count, hemoglobin and serum creatinine and tested at the central laboratory. If patients are found to not meet the eligibility criteria for serum creatinine (Inclusion Criterion 2c) based on central laboratory results, they must not be enrolled into the study; if the subject has received the first dose of ALXN1210 the patient must be withdrawn from the study, and may be replaced. All analyses in this study will be based on results from the central laboratory. A central laboratory result for Inclusion Criterion 2c may not be available prior to first dose; results received after the first dose indicating that eligibility is not satisfied could lead to discontinuation and replacement of the patient. 8.2. Exclusion Criteria Patients will be excluded from study enrollment if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Known familial or acquired ‘ a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13’ ( ADAMTS13 ) deficiency (activity < 5%). Eligibility may be defined using results from tests carried out as standard of care for the treatment of the current TMA prior to a patient giving informed consent. In these cases informed consent will be provided prior to collecting the data for the trial. 2.

In addition, a follow- up phone c all will be performed 8 weeks ( 56 days) ± 5 days following the patient’s last dose of ALXN1210 , to collect concomitant medications, nonpharmacological therapies and procedures, and AEs. At the time of the termination, if there is an ongoing AE or an unresolved laboratory result that in the opinion of the investigator, is significantly outside of the reference range and clin ically significant ( Section 11.4 ), the Investigator will attempt to provide follow -up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or AE is achieved . The reason for early termination will be recorded on the eCRF. Patients who terminate early from the study will not be replaced. 8.3.2. Discontinuation of ALXN1210 T reatment and Continuation in the Study Patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment will be allowed to continue in the study for the remainder of the visits without receiving ALXN1210 dosing. Patients should be perm anently discontinued from ALXN1210 treatment if any of the following occur during the study: • Serious infusion reaction (such as bronchospasm with wheezing or requiring ventilator support or symptomatic hypotension, refer to Appendix C ) or serum sickness -like reactions manifesting 1 to 14 days after drug administration; • Pregnancy or planned pregnancy; or • The Sponsor M edical M onitor or the Investigator deems it is in the best interest of the patient. The Investigator should notify the Medical Monitor as soon as possible prior to discontinuing a patient ’s study treatment and provide the rationale for discontinuing. If a patient is discontinued from ALXN1 210 treatment, but remains in the study, patient should continue attending his or her scheduled protocol visits until Day 1863. During these visits, all assessments except for ALXN1210 administration as described in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3) should be performed. The PK/PD (1 sample at any time) and ADA samples will be collected as per protocol schedule until about 39 weeks after the last dose of the study drug. Any patient who discontinue s the ALXN1210 treatment but remain s in the study and develops abnormal TMA parameter (as specified in Section 8.3.2.1) before Day 1863, will have the opportunity for retreatment (Section 8.3.2.1). If the study drug is discontinued again (after retreatment) , then the patient will be terminated from the study and ET procedures and follow-up will be performed as described in Section 8.3.1. The reason for the treatment discontinuation will be recorded on the eCRF. If a female patient is permanently discontinued from ALXN1210 treatment due to pregnancy, the Investigator will attempt to follow -up until the outcome of the pregnancy ( Section 11.8 )."

Retreatment of Patients who Discontinue ALXN1210 Treatment A patient who discontinues ALXN1210 treatment, but remains in the study, and develops abnormal TMA parameter (as indicated by criteria No. 1 below) before Day 1863, may be restarted on ALXN1210 , if all 3 conditions below are fulfilled : 1. Evidence of TMA, including thrombocytopenia, evidence of hemolysis, or kidney injury based on any one of the following laboratory findings: • Platelet count < 150,000/μL, or • LDH > 1.5 × ULN with hemoglobin ≤ LLN for age and gender, or • Serum creatinine ≥ ULN in adults (≥ 18 years of age), or ≥ 97.5th percentile for age (Appendix A ) in adolescents (12 to < 18 years of age). Note: The TMA laboratory parameter must be confirmed on at least one repeated measure. The above laboratory results can be obtained at either the central laboratory (preferable) or the site’s local laboratory . 2. The Investigator believes that the patient will potentially benefit from retreatment, initiates a discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor, and provides a medically justified rationale. The Investigator and Medical Monitor mutually agree on retreatment, and the decision is documented. 3. The patient agrees to the consent addendum for retreatment . If the decision to re-treat with ALXN1210 occurs on a scheduled study visit, then dosing may begin on that day. • Patient will receive a loading dose of ALXN1210 IV based on the weight recorded at the last visit or more recently (2400 mg for patients weighing ≥ 40 to < 60 kg, 2700 mg for patients weighing ≥ 60 to < 100 kg, 3000 mg for patients weighing ≥ 100 kg). All assessments will be performed per the protocol schedule ( Table 2 and Table 3). If start of the re treatment occurs on a visit which does not include PK/PD sample collection, PK/PD samples will be collected predose and at EOI, along with a predose ADA sample. • Two weeks af ter the loading dose, the patient will receive a supplemental maintenance dose of ALXN1210 IV at an unscheduled visit, based on the weight at the last visit or more recently (≥ 40 to < 60 kg = 3000 mg; ≥ 60 to < 100 kg = 3300 mg; ≥ 100 kg = 3600 mg) . An abbreviated physical examination will be conducted, vital signs will be collected, and the safety card will be reviewed with the patient. Pharmacokinetic /PD samples will be collected predose and at EOI along with a predose ADA sample. • Six weeks after the su pplemental m aintenance dose, the patient will return to the site at the scheduled study visit. At this visit, patient will receive maintenance dose of ALXN1210, undergo a ll assessments per the protocol schedule ( Table 2 and Table 3), and then continue to attend the visits every 8 weeks per the protocol schedule."

Treatments Administered Patients will receive ALXN1210 for 26 week s during the Initial Evaluation Period . ALXN1210 will be administered as a n IV infusion over approximately 2 hours. ALXN1210 must NOT be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. The dose regimen for ALXN1210 during the Initial Evaluation Period is based on the patient’s last recorded study visit body weight ( Table 6 ). Patients will receive a loading dose of ALXN1210 IV on Day 1, followed by maintenance dosing of ALXN1210 IV on Day 15 and q8w thereafter . Table 6: Loading and Maintenance Treatment Regimens Body Weighta Loading Dose (Day 1) Maintenance Dose (Days 15, 71, and 127) ≥ 40 to < 60 kg 2400 mg 3000 mg ≥ 60 to < 100 kg 2700 mg 3300 mg ≥ 100 kg 3000 mg 3600 mg a Body weight as recorded at the last study visit. After the Initial Evaluation Period, all patients will roll over into an Extension Period ( which will continue until the product is registered or approved [ in accordance with country -specific regulations] or for up to 4.5 years, whichever occurs first) during which all patients will receive ALXN1210 q8w. The actual time of all dose administrations (including any re treatment/ supplemental dose for retreatment [Section 8.3.2.1]) will be recorded in the patient’s eCRF. 9.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment This is an open -label study. Patients who satisfy all criteria for enrollment will be assigned to study treatment with ALXN1210 at the Baseline Visit (Day 1). The interactive voice - or web - response system ( IxRS ) will be used to assign vials containing ALXN1210 to each patient. 9.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study The weight- based dosages of ALXN1210 in this study ( Table 6 ) are premised on PK/PD data from early development studies in healthy adult volunteers as well as the available data from patients with PNH in an ongoing Phase 1 b dose-finding study (ALXN1210- PNH-103) and an ongoing Phase 2 proof- of-concept study (ALXN1210- PNH-201). The selection of ALXN1210 dose regimen for patients with aHUS is based on targeting immediate, complete and sustained inhibition of terminal complement in patients with PNH, which is expected to correspond to immediate, complete and sustained inhibition of terminal complement in patients with aHUS. 9.5. Special Treatment Considerations Infusion of other monoclonal antibodies has been associated with infusion reactions, with onset typically during or shortly after completion of the infusion. Please refer to Appendix C for guidance on identifying and managing potential drug infusion reactions."

Prior and Concomitant Medications and Nonp harmaco logic Procedures Prior medications (including vitamins and herbal preparations)—including those discussed in the exclusion criteria (Section 8.2) and procedures (any therapeutic intervention, such as surgery/biopsy or physical therapy) the patient takes or undergoes within 28 days prior to the start of Screening until the first dose of ALXN1210 —will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF. In addition, history of meningococcal vaccination must be collected for the 3 years prior to first dose of study drug, and for patients < 18 years of age at the time of enrollment, vaccination history for Hib and Streptococcus pneumoniae must be collected from birth. All medication use and procedures undertaken during the study will be recorded in the patient’s source document /medical chart and eCRF. This record will include all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, over- the-counter medications, and current medications. Concomitant medications will be recorded from the first infusion of study drug through 56 days after the patient’s last dose of study drug. Any changes in concomitant medic ations also will be recorded in the patient’s source document /medical chart and eCRF. Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the patient’s standard of care during the study, or for the treatment of any AE, along with the allowed medications described below may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding all medication s are recorded in full in the patient’s source document /medical chart and eCRF . 9.7. Prohibited Medications and Procedures Patients are prohibited from receiving any of the following medications and procedures at any time after the first dose of study drug for all patients in the study ( even those who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment but remain in study) until completion of the study or early termination of the patient from the study: • Eculizumab or other complement inhibitors • Use of any other investigational drug or device as part of a clinical trial. • IVIg (unless for an unrelated medical need e.g. hypogammaglobinemia) • Rituximab • PE/PI • New dialysis within the first 48 -hour period following the first dose of ALXN1210 unless there is a compelling medical need as assessed by ( 1) hypervolemia unresponsive to diuretics, (2) refractory electrolyte imbalance, or (3) new-onset uremic encephalopathy. Exceptions must be approved prior to administration of dialysis on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor. The following concomitant medications and procedures are allowed under certain circumstances and with the following restrictions: • Use of other immunosuppressive therapies (such as steroids, mTORi [eg, sirolimus, everolimus], CNI [eg, cyclosporine or tacrolimus]) during the study are not allowed unless: a) part of an established post- transplant antirejection regime, or b) patient has"
48,page_48,"Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -311 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 4, 07 May 2019 Page 48 of 86 CONFIDENTIAL confirmed anti-complement factor antibodies requiring immunosuppressive therapy, or c) steroids are being used for a condition other than aHUS (eg, asthma), or d) steroids initiated empirically prior to enrol lment and are being tapered as standard of care. Any patients receiving other complement inhibitors (including eculizumab) or undergoing PE/PI after the first dose of study drug will be withdrawn from the study. 9.8. Vaccination Due to its mechanism of action, the use of ALXN1210 increases the patient’s susceptibility to infection. To reduce the risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated against N. meningitidis. Patients must be vaccinated against N. meningitidis within 3 years prior to , or at the time of , receiving the first dose of ALXN1210. Patients who will be treated with drug less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines against sero types A, C, Y, W135, and B, where available, are recommended to prevent common pathogenic meningococcal serotypes. Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national vaccination guidelines or local practice for vaccination use with c omplement inhibitors (eg, eculizumab). It is recognized that some patients who have not been vaccinated against N. meningitidis within 3 years prior to receiving the first dose of ALXN1210 may not be able to receive a vaccination at the time of the first d ose. Patients who have not been vaccinated prior to initiating ALXN1210 treatment should receive prophylactic antibiotics prior to and for at least 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination. Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration should be given per official guidance and local practice on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. All patients should be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infection, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and trea ted with appropriate antibiotics, if necessary. To increase risk awareness and promote quick disclosure of any potential signs or symptoms of infection experienced by the patients during the course of the study, patients will be provided a safety card to carry with them at all times and for 8 months after last dose of ALXN1210. Additional discussion and explanation of the potential risks, signs, and symptoms will occur at specific time points as part of the review of the patient safety card and throughout the study as described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3). Patients < 18 years of age must also be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae according to national and local vaccination schedule guidelines, prior to, or at the time of, receiving the first dose of ALXN1210. Vaccination status for N. meningitidis , Hib, and S. pnemoniae will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF. 9.9. Treatment Compliance Patients will be administered study drug in a controlled setting under the supervision of the Investigator or designee, thereby ensuring compliance with study drug administration. The Investigator or designee will ensure that all patients are adequately in formed on the specific"

Amendment 4, 07 May 2019 Page 49 of 86 CONFIDENTIAL dosing regimen required for compliance with the study protocol, ensure that the patient receives the appropriate dose at the designated time points during the study and that adequate safety monitoring occurs during the infusion ( Section 9.5 ). 9.10. Contraception Guidance Before receiving study drug, f emale patients who consider themselves to be postmenopausal must provide evidence of menopause based on a combination of amenorrhea for at least 1 year and increased serum follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) level (> 30 IU/L) (eg, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy, dietary phytoestrogens). Female patients of childbearing potential must use a highly effective or acceptable method of contraception (as defined below), starting at Screening and continuing for at least 8 months after the last dose of study drug. Highly effective contraceptive met hods include: 1. Hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 2. Intrauterine device 3. Intrauterine hormone -releasing system 4. Bilateral tubal occlusion 5. Vasectomized partner, provided that the partner is the patient’s sole sexual partner 6. Sexual abs tinence, defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug treatment; reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient Acceptable contraceptive methods include: 1. A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) The above- listed method(s) of contraception chosen for an individual patient can be determined by the Investigator with consideration for the patient’s medical history and concomitant medications. Male patients with a female spouse/partner of childbearing potential or a pregnant or breastfeeding spouse or partner must agree to use double barrier contraception (male condom plus appropriate barrier method for the female partner ) while on treatment and for at least 8 months after the last dose of study drug. Double barrier contraception is required even with documented medical assessment of surgical success of a vasectomy. Male patients must not donate sperm while on treatment and for at least 8 months after the last dose of study drug."

SAFETY ASSESSMENTS The I nvestigator or his/her designee will meet with patients to discuss the potential safety risks of ALXN1210 and to give the Investigator the opportunity to address any of the patient’s safety concerns regarding the study. The collection of AEs will be monitored from the time informed consent is obtained until study completion. Investigators are instructed to follow any AEs through to their conclusion (resolution or stabilization) as described in Section 11.7.6. In the event of patient withdrawal from the study, AE monitoring should continue through the last patient’s last study visit if possible. The timing of the c linical and laboratory assessments to be performed is specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3). Any clinically significant abnormal results should be followed until resolution or stabilization. 11.1. Demographic/Medical History 11.1.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics A review of demographic parameters, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity will be performed. A complete medical history will be taken and documented. Weight and height will be recorded. Height will be measured at Screening only. 11.1.2. Disease Characteristics The patient’s aHUS medical history, including onset of first aHUS symptom and date of diagnosis, will be documented at the Screening Visit . 11.1.3. Medical History The patient’s medical hist ory, including prior and concomitant conditions/disorders, will be recorded at the Screening Visit. Medication (prescription or over- the-counter, including vitamins and/or herbal supplements) use within 28 days prior to the start of Screening will also be recorded . Meningococcal vaccination within 3 years prior to the first dose of study drug, and for patients < 18 years of age at the time of enrollment, vaccination history for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae from birth, wi ll also be recorded, as described in Section 9.6. 11.2. Physical Examinations A physical examination will include the following assessments: general appearance; skin; head, ear, eye, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; chest; heart; abdominal cavity; limb; central nervous system; and musculoskeletal system. An abbreviated physical examination consists of a body system relevant examination based upon Investigator judgment and patient symptoms."

Vital Signs Vital sign measurements will be taken after the patient has been resting for at least 5 minutes, and will include systolic and dia stolic BP (millimeters of mercury [mm Hg]), pulse oximetry, heart rate (beats/minute), respiratory rate (breaths/minute), and temperature (degrees Celsius [°C] or degrees Fahrenheit [°F]). 11.4. Laboratory Assessments Samples for serum pregnancy, hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis will be performed at the times specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3). Specific laboratory assessments are provided in Appendix D . Samples for laboratory assessments will be collected before each study drug administration. Evaluation of Inclusion Criteria 2a and 2b may be based on local laboratory results within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period or laboratory results obtained during the Screening Period from a local or central laboratory. If a local laboratory is used to define eligibility, additional samples will be collected during the Screening Period for LDH, platelet count, hemoglobin and serum creatinine and tested at the central laboratory. If patients are found to not meet the eligibility criteria for serum creatinine (Inclusion Criterion 2c) based on central laboratory results, they must not be enrolled into the study; if the subject has received the first dose of ALXN1210 the patient must be withdrawn from the study, and may be replaced. All analyses in this study will be based on results fro m the central laboratory. Laboratory results for Exclusion Criterion 1, Exclusion Criterion 2, and/or a central laboratory result for Inclusion Criterion 2c may not be available prior to first dose; results received after the first dose indicating that eligibility is not satisfied could lead to discontinuation and replacement of the patient. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for time windows for collection and detailed instructions for collecting, processing, storing, and shipping blood samples for safe ty assessments. Laboratory reports will be made available to the I nvestigators in a timely manner for clinical management of patients. It is anticipated that some laboratory values may be outside the normal value range due to the underlying disease. The Investigator s should use their medical judgment when assessing the clinical significance of these values. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in laboratory measurements that has medical relevance and which results in a change in medical care. If clinically significant laboratory changes from baseline value are noted, the changes will be documented as AEs on the AE eCRF. The Investigator will also assess the relationship to study treatment for all clinically significant out- of-range values ( Section 15.9.3). The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient through additional laboratory assessments until (1) values have returned to the normal range or baseline level, or (2) in the judgment of the Investigator, values that are outside the normal range are not related to the administration of study drug or other protocol- specific procedures. 11.4.1. Pregnancy Screen For females of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test (ie, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β -hCG]) will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3)."
53,page_53,"Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -311 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 4, 07 May 2019 Page 53 of 86 CONFIDENTIAL 11.4.2. Hematology Blood samples will be analyzed for the hematology parameters listed in Appendix D . 11.4.3. Serum Chemistry Blood samples will be analyzed for the serum chemistry parameters listed in Appendix D . Indirect bilirubin is calculated from total and direct bilirubin values; therefore, indirect bilirubin results will not be available if direct bilirubin is below the limit of quantification. Serum FSH level will be measured during Screening for postmenopausal female patients to confirm the ir postmenopausal status. Chemistry assessments will be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3). The eGFR will be calculated for all visits at which serum chemistries are collected using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula in patients ≥18 years of age and Schwartz formula in patients < 18 years of age . 11.4.4. Coagulation Blood samples will be analyzed for the coagulation parameters listed in Appendix D . 11.4.5. Urinalysis and Urine Chemistry Urine samples will be analyzed for the parameters listed in Appendix D . A microscopic examination of urine samples will be performed if the results of the macroscopic analysis are abnormal. Urine samples will also be analyzed to measure proteins and creatinine in order to calculate the urine total protein:creatinine ratio. 11.5. Electrocardiograms For each patient, single 12- lead digital ECGs will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3). Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collection and remain supine but awake during ECG collection. The Investigator or designee will be responsible for reviewing the ECG to assess whether the ECG is within normal limits and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be indicated on the CRF. For any clinically significant abnormal ECG results, the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the patient’s continued eligibility to participate in this protocol. 11.6. Immunogenicity Blood samples will be collected to test for presence and titer of ADAs to ALXN1210 in serum prior to study drug administration as indica ted in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3). Further characterization of antibody responses may be conducted as appropriate, including binding and neutralizing antibodies, PK/PD, safety, and activity of ALXN1210. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for time windows for collection and detailed instructions for collecting, processing, storing, and shipping blood samples for immunogenicity analysis."

Adverse Event Management An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (eg, hospitalization for elective surgery if planned before the start of the study, admissions for social reasons or convenience), and anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen are not AEs. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish drug effect. A medication error (including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose of the product) or use other than what is defined in the protocol is not considered an AE unless there is an untoward medical occurrence as a result of a medication error. Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposure to investigational product are to be reported within 24 hours of Investigator/site awareness . Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding will be collected for regulatory reporting and safety evaluation. Adverse events should be recorded from the time of signed consent. An AE reported after informed consent but before study drug administration will be considered a pretreatment AE. Alexion has reporting standards for AEs that are to be followed as described in Section 11.7.6 regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent. 11.7.1. Targeted Adverse Events The following events are important identified risks in this study: • Meningococcal infections 11.7.2. Severity Assessment The severity of AEs will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ) version 4.03 or higher. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. Each CTCAE term is a Lowest Level Term ( LLT) per the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ®). Each LLT will be coded to a MedDRA preferred term (PT) . Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE assigns a grade of 1 through 5, with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE ( Table 7)."

Amendment 4, 07 May 2019 Page 55 of 86 CONFIDENTIAL Table 7: Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale Grade Description Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ( ADL )a Grade 3 Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospi talization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADLb Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE. Abbreviations: ADL = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event a Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. b Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. Any change in the severity of an AE should be documented based on specific guidelines in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. Severity and seriousness must be differentiated: severity describes the intensity of an AE, while the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met specific criteria for a SAE as described in Section 11.7.4. 11.7.3. Causality Assessment An Investigator must provide a causality assessment (Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite) fo r all AEs (both serious and nonserious) based upon the Investigator’s medical judgment and the observed sym ptoms associated with the event (Table 8). This assessment must be recorded on the eCRF and any additional forms as appropriate. Table 8: Causality Assessment Descriptions Assessment Description Not Related/Unrelated Suggests that there is no causal association between the investigational product and the reported event. Unlikely Related Suggests that the clinical picture is highly consistent with a cause other than the investigational product but attribution cannot be made with absolute certainty and a relationship between the investigational product and AE cannot be excluded with complete confidence. Possibly Related Suggests that treatment with the investigational pro duct may have caused or contributed to the AE (ie, the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the investigational product, but could also have been produced by other fact ors). Probably Related Suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with the investigational product administration exists and the likely causal association of the event with the investigational product. This will be based upon the known pharmacological action of the investigational product, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the investigational product or class of drugs, or judgment based on the Investigator ’s clinical experience. Definitely Related Temporal relationship to th e investigational product, other conditions (concurrent illness, concurrent medication reaction, or progression/expression of disease state) do not appear to explain event, corresponds with the known pharmaceutical profile, improvement on discontinuation, reappearance on rechallenge."

Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: • Results in death • Is life -threatening (ie, patient was at risk of death at the time of the event) • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization , may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. The expectedness of an SAE will be determined by Alexion, based on the current version of the IB. Information pertaining to the collection and reporting of SAEs is provided in Section 11.7.6. 11.7.5. Suspected Unexpec ted Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the Investigator identifies as related to investigational product or procedure. United States Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or national regulatory requirements in participating countries require the reporting of SUSARs. Alexion has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regulations and the associated detailed guidances. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the national competent authority and IRBs /IECs where applicable. 11.7.6. Collection and Reporting of Adverse Events 11.7.6.1. All Adverse Events All AEs (serious and nonserious) will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until 8 weeks ( 56 days ) after the last dose of study drug. For patients who discontinue study drug, but remain in the study, AE data collection will continue at subsequent visits per the Schedule of Assessments, until the patient's last visit. For patients who terminate early from the study, an ET visit will be conducted as soon as possible, and a follow-up phone c all will be performed 8 weeks (± 5 days) following the patient’s last dose of the study drug. All AEs must be recorded on the eCRF upon the Investigator or his/her staff becoming aware of their occurrence. Investiga tors will be instructed to report the SAE including their assessment (eg, severity, seriousness, and potential relatedness to study drug) to Alexion Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV) within 24 hours of first awareness of the event via the Safety Gateway ."
57,page_57,"Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -311 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 4, 07 May 2019 Page 57 of 86 CONFIDENTIAL If a patient’s treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly capture the circumstances and data leading to any such dose interruption or discontinuation of treatment in the AE and Exposure pages of the eCRF. 11.7.6.2. Serious Adverse Events All SAEs will be recorded regardless of the Investigator ’s assessment of causality. No time limit exists on reporting SAEs that are thought to be causally related to the study drug. Investigators are at liberty to report S AEs irrespective of causali ty at any time. For all SAEs, the Investigator must provide the following: • Appropriate and requested follow- up information in the time frame detailed below • Causality of the SAE(s) • Treatment of/intervention for the SAE(s) • Outcome of the SAE(s) • Supporting m edical records and laboratory/diagnostic information All SAEs must be reported to Alexion GPV within 24 hours of the Investigator or site staff awareness. These timelines for reporting SAE information to the sponsor need to be followed for the initial SAE report and for all follow-up SAE information . The Investigator or designee must record the SAE data in the eCRF and verify the accuracy of the information with corresponding source documents . The SAE report should be submitted electronically via the Safety Gateway . In the event that either the electronic data capture ( EDC) or the Safety Gateway is unavailable at the site(s) , the SAE must be reported on paper. Facsimile transmission or email may be used in the event of electronic submission failure. Email: Facsimile: (NOTE: A local facsimile number will be provided for non- US sites) When further information becomes available, the eCRF should be updated with the new information and an updated SAE report should be submitted to Alexion GPV via Safety Gateway . If applicable, additional information such as relevant medical records should be submitted to Alexion GPV via the email address or fax number noted above. All paper forms and follow-up information submitted to the sponsor outside of the Safety Gateway (eg, discharge summary) should be kept in the appropriate section of the study file. 11.7.7. Sponsor Reporting Requirements Alexion GPV or its legal representative is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of SAEs meeting the reporting criteria. This protocol will use the current IB as the Reference Safety Document. The expectedness and reporting criteria of an SAE will be determined by the sponsor from the Reference Safety Document.

Investigator Reporting Requirements The Investigator must fulfill all local regulatory obligations required for the study Investigators. It is the PI’s responsibility to notify the IRB /IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site , as required per IRB/IEC SOPs . Investigators will also be notified of all SUSAR events that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB/IEC of these additional SAEs as per IRB/IEC S OPs. 11.8. Exposure During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Pregnancy data will be collected during this study for all patients and female spouse/partner of male patients. Exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in utero) can be the result of either maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal exposure. For all Alexion products, both in development or postapproval, exposure during pregnancy must be recorded and the pregnancy followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (ie, spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality), even if the patient discontinues study drug or withdraws from the study. If a female patient or a patient’s female partner becomes pregnant during the conduct of this study, the Investigator must submit the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome/Breastfeeding” form to Alexion GPV via fax or email ( Section 11.7.6.2). When the outcome of the pregnancy becomes known, the form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GPV. If additional follow-up is required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information. Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during breastfeeding must also be reported (via the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form/Breastfeeding”) and any AEs experienced by the infant must be reported to Alexion Global Pharmacovigilance or designee via e mail or facsimile (Section 11.7.6). Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. However, complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy are AEs and may meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly). Elective abortions without complications should not be reported as AEs. 11.9. Safety Monitoring The Alexion medical monitor, G PV physician, or both will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study. Alexion will review all information pertaining to the SAEs within the time frames mandated by company procedures. The Alexion medical monitor will, as appropriate, consult with the G PV safety physician, to review trends in safety data."

General Considerations All data collected will be presented in summary tables and tabulations . All data, as well as any outcomes derived from the data, will be presented in detailed data listings. Graphical displays may also be provided, when appropriate. All ana lyses will be performed using SAS® release, version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) or other validated statistical software. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of observations and mean, standard deviation (SD) , median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency counts and percentage of patients. Prior to finalizing and locking the database, all decisions concerning the inclusion or exclusion of data from the analysis for each patient will be determined by appropriate medical and statistical personnel. Any and all exclusions will be documented in patient listings. Details of the statistical analyses described below will be specified in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) before database lock and analysis. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment only if it changes the primary or key secondary objectives or the study conduct. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol or SAP, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report (CSR). Additional exploratory analyses of the data may be conducted as deemed appropriate. An interim CSR will be prepared at the end of the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period , which will include efficacy, safety , and PK /PD analyses. A final CSR to summarize long -term efficacy, safety , and PK /PD will be produced at study completion. Available exploratory data will be summarized after study completion but may not be included in the CSR. For patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment, but remain in study, their data will be summarized along with data from patients remaining on treatment for 8 weeks (56 days) after their last dose of study drug. Data beyond this point w ill be presented in separate supplemental listings strictly l imited to these patients. I f such patients start retreatment with ALXN1210, their data from the time of study treatment restart will also be presented in separate supplemental listing s limited to patients who will have restarted study treatment. Howeve r, data on AE , concomitant medications , and nonpharmacologic therapies and procedures from the time of treatment restart will be considered t reatment emergent or con comitant , and will be summarized as such, co mbined with data from patients who rem ained on treatment throughout the study. Pharmacokinetic/PD and ADA data f rom patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment, but remain in study, will be summarized along with data from patients remaining on treatment, until 8 weeks after their last dose of study drug. Data beyond this point will be presented in separate supplemental listings limited to these patients. If such patients start retreatment with ALXN1210, their PK/PD and ADA data from the time of study treatment restart will also be presented in separate supplemental listings limited to patients who will have restarted study treatment."

Determination of Sample Size Approximately 55 patients will be enrolled in this study in order to yield at least 50 evaluable patients by Day 183. This sample size is deemed appropriate to provide complete safety information and the necessary precision level for the planned estimation . Assuming a proportion of Complete TMA response of 65%, 50 patients would yield a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the proportion of response with a half-width of approximately 15%. The sample size was increased to 55 patients to account for a potential 10% drop -out rate, thus yielding a total planned sample size of 55 patients. 15.3. Analysis Sets Efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS . The analysis of the FAS will be the primary analysis. The FAS will be based on a mITT approach where patients that were enrolled and treated based on verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria through local laboratory results and the assumption that all inclusion and exclusion criteria were satisfied will be excluded from the FAS if it is later shown that certain of the inclusion and exclusion criteria were in fact not satisfied once a ll Screening laboratory results are available. Based on the above, the FAS will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210, have at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment, and meet all of the following criteria: • Patients who satisfy Inclusion Criterion number 2c • Patients who satisfy Exclusion Criterion number 1 • Patients who satisfy Exclusion Criterion number 2 The FAS will be determined prior to database lock and prior to the database snapshot for the analysis performed at the end of the 26- week Initial E valuation Period. Safety analyses will be performed on the Saf ety Set, defined for all patient s who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. Pharmacokinetic and PD analyses will be performed on all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and who have evaluable PK and PD data. 15.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including medical history and transplant history, will be summarized for the FAS and Safety Set. 15.5. Patient Disposition All patients will be included in the summaries of patient disposition, wh ich will describe the frequency and percentage of patients enrolled and treated and who completed or withdrew from the study, along with reason for withdrawal from the study.

Medications will be summarized by Anatomic-Therapeutic- Chemical (ATC) class and preferred drug name using frequency c ounts and percentages of patients in the Safety S et. 15.7. Treatment Compliance The number of infusions received per patient will be tabulated for the FAS and Safety S et. 15.8. Efficacy Analyses All efficacy analyses will be conducted for the FAS. The FAS is the prima ry analysis set for all efficacy analyses. 15.8.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary efficacy endpoint is Complete TMA Response during the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period. The primary analysis will consist in estimating the proportion of complete TMA respon ders among ALXN1210 treated patients . This will be performed by calculating the point estimate and a 95% CI for the proportion of complete TMA responders in ALXN1210 treated patients . The CI will be based on the asymptotic Gaussian approximation method with a continuity correction. 15.8.2. Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses 15.8.2.1. Dialysis Requirement Status For patients requiring dialysis within 5 days prior to ALXN1210 treatment initiation, the proportion of patients no longer requiring dialysis will be summarized over time. A 2 -sided 95% CI for the proportion receiving dialysis will be provided. 15.8.2.2. Time to Complete TMA Response For the secondary efficacy endpoi nt of time to C omplete TMA R esponse, Kaplan -Meier cumulative distribution curve s will be generated along with 2-sided 95% CI s. The corresponding summary table will present the cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) estimate, the number of patients at risk, the number of patients responding, and the number of patients censored at each postbaseline time point. The table will also present first quartile, median, and third quartile, along with corresponding 2-sided 95% CI, of time to complete response."

A value for eGFR wi ll be imputed for patients requiring dialysis for acute kidney injury. A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the fixed, categorical effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the baseline value as covariates may be fit to test whether change s differ from zero at each time point. 15.8.2.5. CKD Stage CKD stage ( Appendix J ) will be summarized over time by presenting the number and proportion of patients that improved (excluding those with Stage 1 at baseline as they cannot improve), worsened (excluding those with Stage 5 at baseline as they cannot worsen), and stayed the same compared to CKD stage at baseline. Stage 5 will be consid ered the worst category, while stage 1 will be considered the best category. A 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion will be provided for each category. 15.8.2.6. Hematologic Parameters Hematologic parameters (platelets, LDH, hemoglobin) will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the observed value as well as the change from baseline. A MMRM with the fixed, categorical effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the specific test’s baseli ne value as covariates may be fit to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point. 15.8.2.7. Hemoglobin Response The number and proportion of patients with an increase from baseline in hemoglobin ≥ 20g/L, observed at 2 separate assessments obtained at le ast 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between , will be summarized over time by presenting the number and proportion of responders along with a 2-sided 95% CI for each postbaseline time point. 15.8.2.8. Quality of Life Quality of life will be evaluated using EQ -5D- 3L (all patients; Appendix E ), FACIT Fatigue version 4 Questionnaire (patients ≥ 18 years of age ; Appendix F ), and Pediatric FACIT Fatigue Questionnaire (patients < 18 years of age ; Appendix G ). The EQ -5D-3L and FACIT Fatigue data will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the observed value as well as the change from baseline. A MMRM with the fixed, categorical effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the specific test’s baseline value as covariates may be fit to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point."

Immunogenicity Abnormal immunogenicity findings, including the incidence and titers for ADAs to ALXN1210 will be presented at each postbaseline time point in tabular format. The proportion of patients ever positive and the proportion of patients always negative may be explored. 15.10. Pharmacokinetic /Pharmacodynamic Analyses Individual serum concentration data for all patients who receive at least 1 infusion of ALXN1210 and who have evaluable PK data will be used to derive PK parameters for ALXN1210. Graphs of mean serum ALXN1210 concentration- time profiles will be constructed . Graphs of serum concentration- time profiles for individual patients may also be provid ed. Actual dose administration and sampling times will be used for all calculations. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for serum concentration data at each sampling time, as appropriate. Assessment of population-PK may be considered using data from this study or in combination with data from other studies. The PD effects of ALXN1210 administered IV will be evaluated by assessing the absolute values and changes and percentage changes from baseline in free C5 serum concentrations over time , as appropr iate. Assessments of PK/PD relationships may be explored using data from this study or in combination with data from other studies. Pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed for all patients who receive at least 1 infusion of study drug and who have eval uable PD data. For PD parameters, summary tabulations of mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum values will be presented for actual, change and percentage change from baseline. The relationship between changes in PD parameters, exploratory biomarkers, and the effects of treatment outcome may be evaluated . 15.11. Exploratory Analyses 15.11.1. Biomarker and APC Activity Analyses For exploratory biomarker analyses, summary statistics will be presented for actual, change and percentage change from baseline. The relationship between ALXN1210 concentration and exploratory biomarkers or the correlation between clinical benefit and key exploratory biomarkers may be assessed by graphical display. Exploratory analysis and potential relationships between clinical outcomes, PK/PD, genetic profile , and biomarker levels may also be performed. APC activity and autoantibody results will be summarized if evaluated. 15.11.2. Genetics Exploratory genetic s may be performed to investigate genetic variants in genes known to be associated with aHUS, as well as to identify novel genetic variants associated with aHUS, complement dysregulation, or metabolism or efficacy of ALXN1210."

Resource Utilization Questionnaire data and Patient -reported aHUS Symptoms Questionnaire data will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline assessment using discrete data summary statistics. 15.12. Other Statistical Issues 15.12.1. Missing or Invalid Data If a Day 1 assessment is missing, the Screening assessment will be used as the baseline assessment. For evaluation of Complete TMA Response during the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period (primary endpoint), patients missing an efficacy assessment that is part of the definition of Complete TMA Response while still on-study, will have their last observation carried forward (LOCF). For patients who will have terminated early from the study prior to Week 26, their data up to the time of discontinuation will be used to assess Complete TMA Response. Missing data for QoL instruments will be handled as specified in the instructions for each instrument. 15.13. Interim Analyses An interim analys is is planned for this study at the end of the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period after all patients have completed or withdrawn from the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period .

ANTIBODY MEDIATED RE JECTION CRITERIA The revised (Banff 2013) classification of acute/active antibody- mediated rejection in renal allografts will be used to assess antibody mediated rejection. All 3 features must be present for diagnosis. Criteriaa,b,c Histologic evidence of acute tissue inj ury, including one or more of the following: Microvascular inflammation (g score > 0d and/or ptc score > 0) Intimal or transmural arteritis (v score > 0)e Acute thrombotic microangiopathy, in the absence of any other cause Acute tubular injury, in the absence of any other apparent cause Evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with vascular endothelium, including at least one of the following: Linear C4d staining in peritubular capillaries (involving at least 10% of ptc by immunofluorescence on frozen sections, or any ptc by IHC on paraffin sections) At least moderate microvascular inflammation (sum of g and ptc scores ≥ 2)f Increased expression of gene transcripts in the biopsy tissue indicative of endothelial injury, if thoroughly validatedg Serologic evidence of donor -specific antibodies (HLA or other antigens) Source: Haas, 2014a a For all antibody -mediated rejection (ABMR) diagnoses, it should be specified in the report whether the lesion is C4d-positive [involving ≥ 10% of ptc by immun ofluorescence on frozen sections or any ptc by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paraffin sections] or without evident C4d deposition (< 10% of ptc by immunofluorescence on frozen sections; completely negative by IHC on paraffin sections). b These lesions may be clinically acute, smoldering, or subclinical. Biopsies showing 2 of the 3 features, except those with donor specific antibody ( DSA ) and C4d without histologic abnormalities potentially related to AMR or cell-mediated rejection (the latter seen mainly in ABO -incompatible renal allografts) may be designated as ‘suspicious’ for acute/active ABMR. c Modified from Haas, 2014b. d Recurrent/de -novo glomerulonephritis should be excluded. e It should be noted that these arterial lesions may be indicative of ABMR, T -cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), or mixed ABMR/TCMR. Arterial lesions are only scored in arteries having a continuous media with 2 or more smooth muscle layers. f In the presence of acute TCMR, borderline infiltrates, or evidence of infection, ptc score at least 2 alone is not sufficient to define moderate microvascular inflammation, and glomerulitis must be present (g score ≥ 1). g At present, the only validated molecular marker meeting this criterion is ENDAT expression, and this has only been validated in a single center (University of Alberta). The use of ENDAT expression at other centers or other test(s) of gene expression within the biopsy as evidence of ABMR must first undergo independent validation as was done for ENDAT expression by Sis, 2009."

MANAGEMENT OF POTENT IAL DRUG INFUSION REACTIONS Infusion of other monoclonal antibodies has been associated with infusion reactions, with onset typically during or shortly after completion of the infusion. For this reason, patients will be carefully observed during each infusion. Patients who develop AEs of rash, hives, itching, or dysphagia of mild to moderate intensity during their infusion of ALXN1210 may continue to receive the infusion if deemed to be medically appropriate by the Investigator . Medical intervention may include, but is not limited to, slowing of the infusion rate (with or without treatment) or interrupting or stopping the infusion. Any acute reaction should be treated according to standard medical practice depending upon clinical signs and symptoms. If a patient requires medical intervention, the patient should remain at the investigational site until his or her condition stabilizes. The AE and any associated concomitant medications must be captured on the patient’s source document and eCRF. Some patients treated with IV infusions of monoclonal antibodies have experienced concurrent reactions with signs or symptoms that can be classified as acute allergic reactions/hypersensitivity reactions or cytokine release syndrome. Signs and symptoms include headache, fever, facial flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, erythema, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, hypertension, lightheadedness, hypotension, palpitations, and somnolence. Anaphylaxis might occur at any time during an infusion; therefore, patients will be monitored closely during the infusion. In addition, the re- administration of some monoclonal antibodies has been associated with serum sickness- like reactions manifesting 1 to 14 days after drug administration. All AEs that may indicate an infusion- related response will be graded according to CTCAE Version 4.03 or higher. Before any infusion is started, the treating physician and other appropriate personnel must make certain that medication (ie, adrenaline, inhaled beta agonists, antihistamin es, corticosteroids) and other equipment to treat anaphylaxis are readily available. The infusion must be stopped immediately if Grade ≥ 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (including drug fever) or Grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome/acute infusion reac tion occurs. The sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of any infusion reaction requiring interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Patients who experience a reaction during the administration of study drug should be treated according to institutional guidelines. For a Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion reaction, the infusion should be temporarily stopped and treatment with an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg orally [PO] or equivalent) and acetaminophen (650 mg orally or equivalent) may be considered. If the patient’s signs and symptoms have resolved (with or without administration of the above medication), the infusion may be restarted. However, the patients should be infused at a slower rate and be monitored closely for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during the remainder of the infusion. Patients experiencing an infusion reaction should be observed in the clinic until resolution of the reaction, or until the Investigator determines the patient is no longer at risk. Patients who experience a severe reaction during administration of study drug resulting in discontinuation of study drug should undergo all scheduled safety, PK, and PD evaluations required by the protocol."
77,page_77,"Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -311 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 4, 07 May 2019 Page 77 of 86 CONFIDENTIAL If anaphylaxis occurs according to the criteria listed below, then administration of subcutaneous epinephrine (1/1000, 0.3 to 0.5 mL , or equivalent) should be considered. In the case of bronchospasm, treatment with an inhaled beta agonist also should be considered. Patients administered an antihistamine for the trea tment or prevention of an infusion reaction should be given appropriate warnings about drowsiness and impairment of driving ability before being discharged from the center. Table 9: Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue -uvula), and at least 1 of the following: a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow (PEF), hypoxemia) b.
