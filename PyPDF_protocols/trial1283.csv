The primary efficacy variable is change from baseline in weekly itch severit y score ( ISS7 )at Week 12. The daily itch score is the average of the morning and evening itch severit y scores. The baseline ISS7 is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over the 7 days prior to the randomization Day 1 visit, and the ISS7 at Week 12 is the sum of daily itch scores over the 7 days prior to the Week 12 visit. A mixed -effect linear model with repeated measures (MMRM )will be used to obtain the least squares mean (LSM)estimate for each treatment group for change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 12.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU )is defined as the spontaneous occurrence of daily , or almost daily , hives and itching for at least 6 weeks without an obvious cause (Zuberbier et al 2014) . The prevalence of CSU is estimated as 0.5% -1% of the population in Western countries. Women are affected twice as often as men and all age groups can develop CSU; the incidence peak of CSU is between 20 and 40 years (Maurer et al 2011 ). In China, prevalence data for CSU are not available an d an epidemiological survey conducted by China Dermatologist Association is ongoing. According to an epidemiological survey of urticaria conducted by Third Military Medical University in China, CSU accounted for about half of the total urticaria population . Distributions of gender and age among CSU patients were similar to those reported in Western countries (Luo Jie et al 2011) . A recent hospital -based multicenter epidemiological study in the Chinese population found CSU to be the most common subty pe in patients diagnosed with chronic urticaria (61% of all cases ) (Zhong et al 2014 ). Among the proposed etiologies of CSU include those indicating an infectious origin (e.g., Helicobacter pylori ), non- allergic hypersensitivity reactions to foods and drugs (pseudoallergic ),and autoimmunity (Fiebiger et al 1995 ,Tong et al 1997 ,Zweiman et al 1998, Fukuda et al 2004) . In patients suspected of having an autoimmune etio logy of CSU, urticaria symptoms are considered to result from mediator release following the cross -linking of high- affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE)receptors (FcÎµRI ) on mast cells and basophils. Chronic spontaneous urticaria is associated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against IgE receptor Î± subunit in 35-40% of patients and against IgE in an additional 5-10% (Kaplan and Greaves et al 2009 ). The currently recommended treatment for CSU in the EAACI /GA2LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines (Zuberbier et al 2014) is similar to that in the Chinese Society of Dermatology guideline (CSD 2007) in which non-sedating H1 antihistamines (H1AH )are recommended as first-line treatment. In case of inadequate response to H1AH, switching to another H1AH is recommended. As general practice, use of higher, off-label doses of H1AH is uncommon in China. Other off-label used treatment options in Chinese guideline sinclude leukotriene receptor antagonists or H2 antihistamine therapy . For some CSU patients refractory to H1AH, the guidelines recommend the use of systemic immunosuppressants, such as systemic corticosteroids or cy closporine. However, these drugs are associated with poor tolerabilit y and adverse events in many patients. Further treatment options include psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation, narrow- band ultraviolet phototherap y, dapsone, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglo bulin. Although approximately half or more of CSU patients are considered to be well-controlled by H1AH at approved doses, the treatment options for those who remain symptomatic on treatment with H1AH are quite limited. Some patients benefit from the addit ion of LTRA or H2 antihistamines, systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, but there is insufficient"
13,page_13,"Novartis Confidential Page 14 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 evidence for these therapies and many are not approved for CSU. Because chronic spontaneous urticaria has a profound negative impact on patientsâ quality of life (Choi WSet al 2016 )there is a high unmet medical need for a new treatments in CSU patients refractory to H1AH. XolairÂ® (omalizumab )is a humanized anti-IgE recombinant monoclonal antibody approved in 96 countries ,including the US and the EU, totreat allergic asthma. Omalizumab binds to IgE, preventing its binding to FcÎµRI on the surface of mast cells andbasophils. Reduction of free IgE also leads to reduced cell surface expression of FcÎµRI. Reduction in free IgE and in cell surface FcÎµRI limits the extent ofrelease of mediators from mast cells and basophils in the allergic response. The hypotheses for the mechanism of action of omalizumab in CSU patients are (1)lowering free IgE to near undetectable levels leads to down -regulation of IgE receptors, so that IgG autoantibody cannot cross -link the high- affinity receptor (FcÎµRI ), and (2)the down regulation of FcÎµRI may be accompanied by an increase in the threshold above which degranulation of mast cells is triggered. The main studies contributing to efficacy data for the CSU indication include a Phase II dose - finding study Q4577g and 3 Phase III placebo -controlled studies (Q4881g, Q4882g, and Q4883g ). Other sources of efficacy data include an initial placebo -controlled study (ADE05 ) conducted locall y in Germany prior to the Phase III program in CSU and small investigator - initiated placebo -controlled pilot study(Kaplan et al 2008) . The studies used for pooled efficacy analysis were Q4881g and Q4882g. Efficacy was assessed using well -established and validated endpoints, based on the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS ). The Phase III studies were designed to select adult and adolescent patients (12 years and older )with severe, significant impairment of quality of life and refractoriness to current standard therapy . The pivotal efficacy studies, Q4881g and Q4882g, used doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg administered every 4 weeks during 24 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively . A consistent dose response was observed across the primary and secondary endpoints. On the basis of the efficacy observed in the Phase III program, omalizumab 300 mg and 150 mg, given subcutaneously every 4 weeks , are recommended doses for the treatment of CSU. The safet y profile in CSU is consistent with that previously reported for the allergic asthma indication. Four studies ,one Phase II (4577g )and three Phase III studies (Q4881g ), (Q4882g ), and (Q4883g ), with a total of 1,068 patients, contributed data to the integrated evaluation of safet y of omalizumab in CSU, including 802 patients who received one or more doses of omalizumab. There were no deaths or major organ toxicity and a similar incidence of adverse events and severe adverse events among the treatment groups was apparent, with no age- specific safet y concerns. Omalizumab is now approved for the treatment of CSU in 53 countries worldwide including the US, the EU (counted as one), Canada, and Australia (as of April 2016). In the EU, only the 300 mg dose of omalizumab is approved whereas 300 mg and 150 mg are approved in most other regions. 1.2 Purpose The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab, compared with placebo, as an add -on to H1AH therapy in adult patients suffering from CSU who remain"

Patients will be randomized into three treatment arms (omalizumab 300 mg s.c., omalizumab 150 mg s.c., and placebo )in a 2:2:1 ratio, stratified by latent TB status at baseline. Approximately 420 patients will be enrolled at approximately 30 study sites. The study will consist of three distinct epochs over 24weeks, as outlined below (see also Figure 3 - 1). ï·Screening epoch: Day -28to Day -1 ï·Randomized -treatment epoch: Day 1 to Week 12 ï·Post-treatment follow- up epoch: Week 12 to Week 20"
17,page_17,"Novartis Confidential Page 18 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 Figure 3-1 Study design Eligible patients will be required to visit at Day -28~-14 and Day -7 during the 2-4 week screening epoch. Onlyin casesof outstanding laboratory results will an extended screening epoch be permitted. For the duration of t he screening epoch, patients are recommended to stay on a stable CSU H1AH treatment. In addition, for patients requiring treatment for latent TB, screening epoch will be extended in order to allow for a 4-Week treatment period prior to randomization. On Day 1, eligible patients will be randoml y assigned (in a 2:2:1 ratio with an Interactive Response Technology [IRT] )to receive omalizumab (150 mg or 300mg)or placebo by subcutaneous injection every 4 w eeks (on Day 1, Week 4, and Week 8)during the 12-week double -blind randomized- treatment epoch. Approximately 168 patients will be randomized to the omalizumab 150mg, approximately 168 patients to omalizumab 300mg and approximately 84 patients will be randomized to receive placebo. For the duration of the randomized- treatment epoch, patients are recommended to stay on the same CSU H1AH treatment that they were using during the pre-randomization period. The last dose of study drug during the randomized -treatment epoch will be administered at Week 8 study visit. The primary endpoint will be assessed at Week 12. After the completion of the 12-week randomized- treatment epoch, all patients will enter an 8-week post-treatment follow -up epoch to allow for further characterization of omalizumab and collection of additional efficacy and safety data. All these evaluations will"
18,page_18,"Novartis Confidential Page 19 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 also be done for those who withdraw from the study within 12 weeks of randomization. During the post -treatment follow- up epoch, patients would be allowed to add one more H1AH therap y to their treatment regimen for CSU. This is expected to help limit patient dropout and ensure that patients return for safety evaluations during the post -treatment follow- up epoch. For the duration of the study , patients will visit the study center at 4-week intervals. No study drug treatment will be given during the post-treatment follow -up epoch. The blind will be maintained for the full 20 weeks of the study (after randomization ). For the duration of the study , all patients will be provided di phenh ydramine (25mg)tablets as rescue medication ( see Section 5.5.6 )for additional itch relief on an as -needed basis (up to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours or less, based on local regulations ). No other medication for itch relief will be allowed during the screening and treatment phases of the study . 3.2 Rationale for study design This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of omali zumab in Chinese patients with CSU who remain s ymptomatic despite H1AH therap y compared with placebo. The study design is aligned with previous pivotal efficacy studies Q4881g and Q4882g. Efficacy is determined using the primar y endpoint of change from bas eline in the weekl y itch severit y score at Week 12 because itching is the sy mptom of greatest concern to patients, with the greatest impact on their quality of life (Mathias et al 2010) . As CSU is both a disease of hives and intense itch, it is appropriate to evaluate clinical response assessing hives, as well as using a composite endpoint, UAS, which incorporates assessment of both symptoms. Therefore the UAS will be incorporated as a secondary endpoint. The validity and reliability of UAS in CSU has been established in previous studies (Mylnek et al 2008 ,Mathias et al 2012 ). The selection of Week 12 as the time point for primary efficacy assessment is consistent with previous studies conducted with omalizumab in CSU and is supported by the finding that response to omalizumab plateaued after 12 weeks in these studies. The reason for including only patients who are refractory to approved doses of H1AH therapy is that H1AH drugs are the approved first line therapy for CSU (Zuberbier et al 2009 ,Hide and Hiragun 2012) , and the unmet medical need in CSU is highest in patients refractory to these drugs. Omalizumab will be used as an add -on therap y on top of H1AH treatment in this study . 3.3 Rationale for dose/regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment The doses for this study are selected based on the results of the Phase III studies Q4881g and Q4882g that tested omalizumab doses of 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and placebo. The doses for these Phase III studies were selected based on the results from the Phase II dose finding study Q4577g that tested a broad array of omalizumab doses (75, 300, and 600 mg)as a single subcutaneous injecti on in patients with CSU refractory to H1AH. Based on the results from these studies, 300 mg and 150 mg doses are the recommended doses and have been approved in most regions worldwide. Efficacy and safet y with these doses is expected to be similar in the C hinese population. The rationale for the dose/regimen chosen for this study is summarized as follows:"
19,page_19,"Novartis Confidential Page 20 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 ï·In the phase II study Q4577g, the 300 mg and 600 mg omalizumab dose groups both demonstrated efficacy superior to the placebo group, but there was no additional benefit observed for the 600 mg omalizumab group compared with the 300 mg omalizumab group. In exposure -response anal ysis, exposure levels at 300 mg appeared to approach the plateau of the exposure âresponse curve. ï·In studies Q4881g and Q4882g, on th e primary endpoint (change from baseline to Week 12 in weekl y itch severit y score ), omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg given every 4 w eeks demonstrated consistent and statistically significant treatment effects relative to placebo. The 75 mg dose did not show a consistent effect on the primary endpoint and most secondar y endpoints. ï·The safet y profile for omalizumab in CSU is consistent with the profile previously reported for the allergic asthma indication. The safety profile was similar for the 150 mgand 300 mg doses in studies Q4881g and Q4882g, and consistent with the profile for the 300 mg dose used in the safet y stud y Q4883g. ï·Based on exposure -response analy sis of omalizumab in CSU, there was a dose response in efficacy (itch improvement and percent complete UAS7 responders )across the dose range tested (75 mg to 300 mg every 4 w eeks), and no clear impact of body weight, body mass index (BMI)and baseline IgE on efficacy within each dose level. This result was again confirmed in phase III studies. Flat dosing (ie., without adjustment for baseline body weight and/or IgE level )is therefore supported. ï·The 4 weeks dosing interval is selected because in the phase II study Q4577g maximum effect was observed 4 weeks post-dose. The appropriateness of the 4 week dosing interval was confirmed by PK/PD itch and hives time course modeling using the Phase IIIstudy data. An interval of 4 weeks is considered to minimize breakthrough CSU symptoms while avoiding accumulation resultin g from dosing omalizumab more frequently than necessary . ï·There was no clinically significant difference found in PK and PD of omalizumab between Chinese and Caucasian populations. Thus, Chinese subjects should respond similarly to Caucasians when omalizuma b is given with the same dose/regimen as used in the previous studies (A2102, A2204 and A2206). ï·Flat dosing Based on these findings, it is considered appropriate to select 150 mg and 300 mg doses for E2305 study . This study would attempt to further charact erize the dose response profile for omalizumab in CSU with the objective of identify ing the optimal dose in Chinese patients. The rationale for a treatment (study drug administration )period of 12 weeks isdescribed below: ï·Treatment with omalizumab results in a rapid reduction of CSU symptoms .The global phase III studies demonstrated that the time to achieve the minimally important difference response (decrease in UAS7 â¥ 5) was 1 to 2 weeks after the start of treatment. ï·The global phase III studies showed no clear differences in therapeutic efficacy after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, indicating that efficacy beyond Week 12 can be extrapolated from the Week 12 response."
20,page_20,"Novartis Confidential Page 21 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 The rationale for establishing an 8-week follow -up epoch after the end of the treatment epoch is that this is deemed sufficient to provide safety data and assessment of anti-therapeutic antibodies ( ATA ). 3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator In this trial ,omalizumab is investigated as add -on therapy to H1AHs and compared to placebo to determine the efficacy and safet y of omalizumab as add -on therapy . During the 12 weeks of the treatment epoch, placebo will be given to the 150 mg group (150 mg omalizumab a nd 150 mg placebo )and placebo group (150 mg placebo x 2 ) (Table 3 -1). All patients must take study -defined H1AH medications at approved doses during the screening, treatment, and post-treatment follow -up epochs, which is typical for placebo - controlled trials where an add-on therap y is studied for a disease with apre-existing standard of care. Patients should remain on a stable H1AH treatment regimen throughout the study . Diphenhy dramine will be allowed as rescue medication (seeSection 5.5.6 ).Diphenh ydramine 25 mg will be provided and used on an as -needed basis ( up to a maximum of three doses of 25 mg in 24 hours according to the Chinese label )during the screening, randomized treatment, and post-treatment follow -up epochs. Patients will be permitted to add up to one additional H1AH therapy after the primary endpoint has been assessed at Week 12to reduce patient dropout during the post -treatment follow -up epoch. The use of placebo arm in this trial is deemed mandatory to demonstrate the efficacy and safet y of Xolair in Chinese patients suffering from CSU. The 2:2:1 randomization serves to limit the proportion of patient that will receive placebo during the study to 20% of patients. Moreover, patients in the placebo arm will receive standard of care treatment with H1AH therap y throughout the study and will be allowed to receive rescue medication.

Patients treated with omalizumab can achieve a clinicall y relevant reduction in persistent and debilitating symptoms associated with the disease, while maintaining a safety profile consistent with the known safet y profile in allergic asthma."
21,page_21,"Novartis Confidential Page 22 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 Omalizumab has been approved for allergic asthma in 96 countries worldwide based onthe positive benefit -risk ratio from the submitted clinical trials. Omalizumab was approved for the treatment of CSU in the EU and in th e US in 2014. As of May 2016, omalizumab is approved for CSU in 83 countries worldwide including USA, EU, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia. For CSU, significant and consistent results were apparent across all the Phase III studies. On thebasis of the efficacy observed in the phase III program, omalizumab doses of 300 mg and 150 mg administered every 4 w eeks, result in a fast onset of treatment effect (within 1-2 weeks )for the majorit y of patients, with significant improvement relative to placebo being demonstrated for itch, hives and associated CSU symptoms. There were no reported deaths, and few serious adverse events. Omalizumab was well-tolerated in all the clinical studies and the observed adverse events were broadl y similar across each treatment g roup. Overall no new safet y concerns were raised when these data are compared with the adverse reactions (AR) listed in the current prescribing information for omalizumab. The safet y profile for omalizumab in CSU is consistent with the profile previously reported for the allergic asthma indication. There were no deaths or major organ toxicity in any SOC and a similar incidence of AEs and SAEs among the treatment groups with no age specific safet y concerns. However, small imbalances were observed in some SOC s, as listed below with the event (s) that contributed to the imbalance bracketed: General disorders and administration site disorders (injection site reactions), Infections and infestations ( upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection ), Musc uloskeletal and connective tissue disorders (arthralgia ), Nervous system disorders (headache ), and Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders (coughing, bronchospasm )were reported more frequently in the omalizumab treatment groups than in the placebo group. The preferred terms noted above are not necessarily the same events identified as advers e reactions (ARs). These were identified from candidate events where the incidence on any omalizumab dose was â¥2% higher than in the placebo group. The events noted as ARs in the pooled CSU safet y database are nasophary ngitis, viral upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, arthralgia, and headache. Apart from a few specific preferred terms, the other relativel y small imbalances observed were in line with the well characterized safet y profile of omalizumab in the severe allergic asthma indication, and with events listed in the adverse reaction (AR)table in the SmPC. Among the more commonly reported AEs, headache was the only notable event that was reported more frequently relative to placebo in the omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg dose groups. Most events seen were mild to moderate in severity , and no meaningful difference between treatment groups was seen for severe events during the treatment periods. The perce ntage of patients with AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to study drug was slightly higher in the omalizumab groups (range 7.5% to 9.2%) compared to placebo (5.8%). The small imbalance with omalizumab 300 mg was partly due to preferred terms headache, and injection site reactions. The incidence of SAEs, discontinuations from study due to an AE, and withdrawals from treatment were similar or lower with omalizumab treatment compared to placebo, so do not present an incremental risk to patients."
22,page_22,"Novartis Confidential Page 23 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 Among a range of AEs of special interest examined, hypersensitivity , injection site reaction, and hematopoietic cy topenia were reported at higher rates with omalizumab 300 mg treatment, and were consistent with previous clinical experience with omalizumab. There were no clinically relevant differences observed between treatment groups for hematology or vital signs, and no meaningful differences between treatment groups were observed for new abnormalities. During the follow -up period, imbalances were seen in the omalizumab groups compared to placebo in the SOCs of infections and infestations (150 mg and 300 mg omalizumab groups ), and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (all omalizumab groups ). An increase in skin and subcutaneous events was likely due to the re-emergence of symptoms present at baseline, while the imbalance in infections was similar or lower to the difference seen under active treatment, and showed no clear dose -dependence. The safet y profi le is subject to regular review (PSUR 21, Feb 2016) and updates to the existing risk management plan omalizumab for allergic asthma and CSU. No new risks were identified in the latest version of the risk management plan ( Core RMP 11, April 2016 ), Other treatment alternatives to omalizumab for patients that have failed the standard treatment paradigm of H1 antihistamines at approved, or multiple doses include immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, or repeated exposure to oral glucocorticoids. Ther e are significant potential adverse effects associated with both of these alternatives and due to safet y concerns can onl y be administered over short periods of time. Therefore, the benefit of treatment with omalizumab is that it could improve itch, hives and associated CSU symptoms in a patient population that is refractory to current standard of care. The risks for patients participating in this study include the potential for known safet y issues associated with omalizumab, which includes anaphy laxis, with an estimated incidence of at least 0.2%, as well as the potential for additional risks outlined in the Investigatorâs Brochure. Based on the proposed mechanism of action of omalizumab, there is no clear scientific rationale to suspect a decrease in immun ity to tuberculosis (TB)associated with its use, nor clinical data suggesting relapse or worsening of TB in patients treated with omalizumab. Nevertheless, given the high incidence of TB in China that is up to 20 -fold as high as those in EU and US (WHO 2015 ), TB screening will be performed in the study . Patients screened with latent TB will need to receive tuberculosis prophy laxis for at least 4 weeks prior to study drugs (for details, see Section 6.2.1 ). 4 Population A total of approximately 600 patients from a pproximately 30sites in China mainland, aged 18 to 75 years old who have been diagnosed with refractory CSU and who remain symptomatic despite conventional H1AH treatment will be screened to allow 420 patients to be randomized into this study . This accounts for approximately 30% screening failures. If the maximum earl y discontinuation rate of 10% is assumed for this study , then approximately 375 subjects are expected to be able to complete the 12 -week randomized- treatment epoch with primary efficacy data available at the endpoint."

Also, the unblinded authorized staff will contact the IRT at Visits 102 and 103. The blinded staffs must not contact the IRT at the above visits. The IRT will assign a randomi zation number to the patient, which will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the first package of study drug to be dispensed to the patient. The randomization number will not be communicated to anyof the site staff. The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients/subjects and investigator staff. A patient randomization list will be produced by the IRT provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of patient numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medic ation list will be produced by or under the"
27,page_27,"Novartis Confidential Page 28 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 responsibility of Novartis Drug Suppl y Management using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the investigational drug (s). Randomization will be strati fied b y latent TB at baseline (Yes/No ). The randomization scheme for patients/subjects will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Randomization Group. 5.4 Treatment blinding All data up to final database lock will be collected with the Novartis clinical trial team, investigator / site personnel evaluating subjects, and subjects blinded to treatment allocation. The Novartis clinical team will be blinded during the study until the final database is locked, and all site personnel including the assessor performing the study assessments, will also remain blinded to individual treatment allocation until after final database lock. This excludes the unblinded pharmacist and unblinded health care professional who will dispense and / or administer the study drug and not be involved in the study assessments. An unbli nded pharmacist and an unblinded health care professional are required because they will be able to determine whether the study drug is active or not from the appearance of vial and the viscosit y of the d rug. Blinding will be maintained using the following methods: 1.Randomization data will be kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the study with the following exceptions: ï·Drug Supply Management (DSM ), Drug Safet y & Epidemiology (DS&E )and specific vendors whose role in trial conduct requires their unblinding ï·Unblinded pharmacist and unblinded health care professional at each site ï·Unblinded monitor 2. P lacebo and active treatment will be dispensed by an unblinded pharmacist (or other authorized unblinded staff)who is independent of those involved in the assessment of study subjects. In addition, the unblinded pharmacist (or other authorized unblinded staff)will store study medication and keep medication records containing unblinded information in a secure area where blinded staff would not have access. 3.Study treatments will be administered by an unblinded suitably authorized individual (health care professional) who is not responsible for any aspect of subject assessment or follow-up. 4.The procedural details relating to treatment blinding and unblinded drug administration will be described in the Pharmacist Manual which will be provided separately . Inthe event that the packaging of a study treatment has a broken seal, this information will be documented in the IRT, along with a reason (if applicable )and the medication number so that the vial will not be available to dispense to another subject."
28,page_28,"Novartis Confidential Page 29 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 Unblinding will only occur in the case of subject emergencies (seeSection 5.5.9 )and at the conclusion of the study . The appropriate personnel from the study site and Novartis will assess whether the study treatment should be discontinued for any subject whose treatment code has been broken inadvertentl y for any reason. Study treatment must be discontinued after emergency unblinding. 5.5 Treating the patient Sponsor qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. 5.5.1 Patient number ing, Each patient is uniquely identified by a Subject Number which is composed by the site number assigned by Novartis and a sequential number assigned by the investigator. Once assigned to a patient, the Subject Number will not be reused. Upon signing the informed consent form, the patient is assigned the next sequential number by the investigator. The investigator or his/her staff will contact the IRT and provide the requested identify ing information for the patient to register them into the IRT. The site must select the CRF book with a matching Subject Number from the EDC sy stem to enter data. If the patient fails to be treated for any reason, the IRT must be notified within 2 day s that the patient was not treated. The reason for not being treated will be entered on the Screening epoch Study Disposition CRF. 5.5.2 Dispensing the study drug Each stud y site will be supplied with open -label study drug. The study drug packaging has a 2-part label. A unique medication number is printed on each part of this label which corresponds to one of the omalizumab 150mg or placebo . Unblinded site personnel will identify the investigational treatment package (s)todispense to the patient by matching medication numbers obtained from IRT. Immediatel ybefore dispensing the package to the patient, unblinded site personnel will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the Investigational Product accountability log source document (Drug Label Form ) for that patientâs unique subject number. The stud y drugs will be dispensed by the unblinded pharmacist (or other unblinded authorized site personnel )appointed at the study site. 5.5.3 Handling of study and additional treatment 5.5.3.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safel y and properl y, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and"
29,page_29,"Novartis Confidential Page 30 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 designees have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels. The study drugs should be received by unblinded staff only. The blinded team should not have access to storage location or should not be involved in receipt of IP.Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complai nts are to be reported to the respective Novartis CPO Quality Assurance. Medication labels will include Chinese and comply with the legal requirements of China . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the patient except for the medication number . The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountabili ty log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors during site visits or remotel y and at the completion of the trial At the conclusion of the study , and as appropriate during the course of the study , the investigator will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at each site. 5.5.3.2 Handling of additional treatment The background treatme nt H1AH will be provided by the study site.For the use of H1AH please refer to Section 5.5.7 . 5.5.4 Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment Active or placebo omalizumab will be administered bysubcutaneous injection. The first administration of drug will take place at Visit 101 once all eligibility criteria have been confirmed and all other assessments performed. The lyophilized product takes 15-20 minutes to dissolve. The fully reconstituted product will appear clear or slightl y opalescent and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial. Detailed instructions on how to reconstitute omalizumab vials can be found in the separate Pharmacist Manual. Reconstituted omalizumab vials should be protected from direct sunlight. Administration Study medication will be administered by an unblinded suitably authorized individual (qualified health care professional )who is not responsible for any aspect of subject assessment or follow -up. This individual will be identified at site as the âindependent study drug administratorâ. The independent study drug administrator will administer the study treatment to the corresponding subject by s.c. injection during the study visit without engaging in any unnecessary interactions that may have the potential to unblind the subject or any of the site study personnel. Study drug is administered to the patient using a disposable 25-gauge needle and a disposable plastic tuberculin -type syringe. The injecti ons are administered in the deltoid region on the right arm and/or left arm, avoiding urticarial lesions. Alternatively , the injections can be administered in the thigh if reasons preclude administration in the deltoid region. The injections are administer ed subcutaneously after aspiration of the plunger of the syringe. If"
30,page_30,"Novartis Confidential Page 31 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 blood is withdrawn, the needle is removed without administration of the dose and the injection site is changed. All kits of study treatment assigned by the IRTwill be recorded/databased in the I RT. The investigator must promote compliance by instructing the patient to take the study treatment exactl y as prescribed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the patientâs safet y and the validity of the study . The patient must also be instructed to contact the investigator if he/she is unable for any reason to take the study treatment ( omalizuamb, placebo, background H1AH or diphenh ydramine )as prescribed . 5.5.5 Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment Investigational drug dose adjustments and/or interruptions are not permitted. If a dose (omalizumab or placebo )was dispensed by IRT but not administered to a subject at a visit at which the subject attended, this deviation event must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record eCRF. 5.5.6 Rescue medication Diphenhy dramine 10 mg or 25 mg tablet will be provided and used on an as-needed basis (up to a maximum of 75 mg/day )during the screening, randomized -treatment, and post-treatment follow -up epochs. Use of rescue medicatio n must be recorded on the Concomitant medications form in the CRF. 5.5.7 Concomitant medication The investigator must instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications he/she takes after the patient was enrolled into the study . All medicati ons, procedures and significant non-drug therapies (including physical therapy and blood transfusions ) administered after the patient was enrolled into the study must be recorded in the concomitant medications / significant non-drug therapies eCRF. Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited medication. If in doubt the investigator should contact the Novartis medical monitor before randomizing a patient or allowing a new medication to be started. Permitted c oncomitant medications (for CSU) Subjects should remain on a stable non-sedating H1AH treatment regimen throughout the study . During the post-treatment follow -up epoch (after Week 12visit)subjects are permitted to add up to one additional approved non-sedating H1AH or to up-dose the non-sedating H1AH within approved dose levels if multiple doses are available and a lower dose was used as a background therap y. Dosage and administration should follow local regulations."

The investigator or authorized site staff must instruct the subject to notify them about any new treatments he/she takes after enrollment. All prohibited treatments taken after enrollment must be recorded in eCRF. If a prohi bited treatment listed in Table 5-1 was used during the study , the subject should discontinue use of the prohibited treatment. At the discretion of the investigator or authorized site staff, if the subjectâs use during the study of a prohibited treatment listed in Table 5-1 presents undue safety risk for the subject, the subject should be discontinued from study treatment as per Section 5.5.9. Table 5-1 Prohibited medication Medication Wash out period Anti-IgE therapy No prior use allowed Routine (daily or ever y other day during 5 or more consecutive days )doses of sy stemic corticosteroids 30 days Routine (daily or ever y other day during 5 or more consecutive days )doses of hydroxychloroquine30 days Routine (daily or ever y other day during 5 or more consecutive days )doses of immunosuppression (e.g. methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclopho sphamide, or triperygium wilfordii Hook )30 days Intravenous immunoglobulin G 30 days Plasmapheresis 30 days Regular (daily or every other day )doxepin (oral) 14 days Any H2antihistamine 7 days Any leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA ) 7 days Any H1antihistamine at greater than approved doses 3 days vaccination with inactivated pathogen 48 hours prior to visit s101, 102, and 103 Oral Chinese traditional medicine prescribed for CSU * 30 days Subjects taking either LTRAs or H2 antihistamine for disease other than CSU (e.g., asthma or gastroesophageal reflux disease, respectively )will be permitted to continue their use during the study. These diseases must be recorded as part of the medical history collected during the screening epoch. Inhaled asthma controllers, including corticosteroids, are also permitted during the study . *Subject receiving oral Chines traditional medicine for another indication and for at least 2 months will be allowed to continue this treatment. 5.5.9 Emergency breaking of assigned treatment code Emergency code breaks must only be undertaken when it is required to in order to treat the patient safel y. Most often, study treatment discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study patient who presents with an emergency"
32,page_32,"Novartis Confidential Page 33 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 condition. Emergency treatment code breaks are performed using the IRT. When the investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a patient, he/she must provide the requested patient identify ing information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the patient. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified patient and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the Novart is monitor for the site and the Study Team that the code has been broken. It is the investigatorâs responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT/code break cards at any time in case of emergency . The investigator will provide: ï·protocol number ï·study drug name (if available ) ï·patient number In addition, oral and written information to the subject must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency , or when he/she is unavailable, to ens ure that unblinding can be performed at an y time. 5.6 Stud y completion and discontinuation 5.6.1 Study completion and post- study treatment A patient will be considered to have completed the study when the patient has completed the last visit planned in the protoc ol. Continuing care should be provided by investigator and/or referring physician based on patient availability for follow -up. 5.6.2 Discontinuation of study treatment Discontinuation of study treatment for a patient occurs when study drug is stopped earlier th an the protocol planned duration, and can be initiated by either the patient or the investigator. The investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given patient if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation would negativel y impact the risk/bene fit of trial participation. Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances: ï·Patient wish ï·Pregnancy (see Section 6.5.6 and Section 7.6 ) ï·Use of prohibited treatment as per recommendations in Table 5 -1 ï·Any situation in which study participation might result in a safet y risk to the patient ï·Individual serum creatinine increase â¥ 50% compared to baseline, unless the event is not drug related, related to disease progression, or if the benefit / risk assessment supports continuing study treatment. ï·Emergence of the following adverse events: adverse events that in the judgment of the investigator, taking into account the subjectâs overall status, prevent the subject from continuing participation in the study (for example, sepsis)"
33,page_33,"Novartis Confidential Page 34 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 ï·Any laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator, taking into consideration the subjectâs overall status, prevents the subject from continuing participation in the study . If discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the patient should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study . The patient should return to the clinic as soon as possi ble, after discontinuation of study drug, for a study treatment discontinuation visit. Treatment discontinuation visit assessments detailed in the âunscheduled treatment discontinuation visitâ (UNS )in Table 6-1should be completed and recorded in the eCRF. The investigator must determine the primary reason for the patientâs premature discontinuation of study treatment and record this information on the Dosage Administration eCRF. After study treatment discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone visits: ï·new / concomitant treatments ï·adverse events / serious adverse events If the patient cannot or is unwilling to attend any visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular telephone contact with the patient, or with a person pre-designated by the patient. This telephone contact should preferabl y be done according to the study visit schedule. The investigator must also contact the IRT to register the patientâs discontinuation from study treatment. If study drug discontinuation occurs because treatment code has been broken, please refer to Section 5.5.9 . 5.6.3 Withdrawal of informed consent Patients/subjects may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at an y time. Withdrawal of consent from the stud y is defined as when a patient: ï·Does not want to participate in the study anymore and ï·Does not want an y further visits or assessments and ï·Does not want an y further study related contacts and ï·Does not allow anal ysis of already obtained biologic material In this situation, the investigator must make every effort (e.g., telephone, e-mail, letter )to determine t he primary reason for the patientâs decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be consi dered missing. Further attempts to contact the patient are not allowed unless safety findings require communicating or follow -up."
34,page_34,"Novartis Confidential Page 35 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the patie ntâs study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the assessment table below. 5.6.4 Loss to follow -up For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the investigator should show âdue diligenceâ by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A patient cannot be considered as lost to follow -up until the time point of his/her scheduled end of study visit has passed. 5.6.5 Early study termination by the sponsor The study can be terminated by Novartis at any time for any reason. This may include reasons related to the benefit risk assessment of participating in the study , practical reasons, or for regulatory or medical reasons (including slow enrolment ). Should this be necessary , the patient must be seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematurel y withdrawn patient. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patientâs interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRBs/IECs )of the early termination of the trial. 6 Visit schedule and assessments Table 6-1lists all of the assessments and indicates with an âxâ when the visits are performed , an âsâindicates the data remain in the source documents only . Patients/subjects must be seen for all visits on the designated day,or as close to it as possible. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Patients/subjects who prematurel y discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the final visit will be performed. At this final visit, all dispensed investigational product should be reconciled and the adverse event and concomitant medications reconciled on the CRF. Patients/subjects will be contacted for safet y evaluations during the 30 days following the last administration of study treatment."

Adverse events that are not SAEs will be followed by the investigator and collected onl y in the source data. 6.2 Patient demographics/other baseline characteristics Patient demographic and baseline characteristic data to be collected on all patients include date of birth, age, sex, race, ethnicit y. Relevant medical history /current medical condition present before signing the informed consent will be captured. Where possible, diagnoses, and not symptoms, will be recorded. In addition, data on patientâs family history on malignancie s is collected on the respective CRF page to assess possible risk factors related to any malignancies. 6.2.1 Tuberculosis screening and management 6.2.1.1 QuantiFERON TB -Gold In -tube assay A QFT to screen a population for latent tuberculosis infection (Dohert y et al 2008) will be used at screening to evaluate the subjectsâ eligibility for the study . This blood -based assay is specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is not influenced by pr evious Bacillus Calmette - GuÃ©rin vaccination or by exposure to other Mycobacteria species. Furthermore, this test, in contrast to the purified protein derivative (PPD)skin test, is also insensitive to a booster effect since the subject is not exposed to the vaccine. The assay measures the production of interferon -gamma and presents it relative to a negative and a positive control sample (Manuel and Kumar 2008) . The QFT kit will be supplied by the central laboratory . Details on the collection, shipment of samples and reporting of results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the study -specific laboratory manual. 6.2.1.2 Chest X -ray For patients with a positive QFT, a chest X-ray is required; no new chest X-ray is needed in subjects with chest X-ray, chest CT scan and/or chest MRI performed within 12 weeks of screening. If the chest X-ray, chest CT scan, and/or chest MRI evaluated by a qualified health care professional reveals past or present active TB, the subject will not be enrolled into the study . 6.2.1.3 Protocol for tuberculosis screening Screening for TB will be performed according toFigure 6-1, below.

This action is at the discretion of the investigator. If a TB workup was conducted prior to the screening the subject, results of the workup can be used to assess eligibility if the workup was conducted within 12 weeks prio r to randomization. oIf the second test is negative , the subject may be randomized. oIf the second test is positive or indeterminate , the investigator should perform further evaluation to rule out active TB, as per local guidelines. Subject positive for latent TB per workup may be randomized to the trial if treatment for latent TB has been performed for 4 weeks prior to randomization and subject agrees to continuous treatment according to local guidelines. Subjects positive for active TB per workup arenot eligible for the study . ï·If eligibility is being assessed with only 1 test result and a TB workup (i.e., no second TB test will be performed ), the TB test to assess eligibility must have been done via the central laboratory for the study within the screening epoch (within 4 weeks prior to randomization) and TB workup will only be considered if it was completed within 12 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects positive for latent TB per workup may be randomized to the trial if sufficient treatment has been initiated according to local routine clinical practice for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization and will be maintained for the prescribed duration. Subjects positive for active TB per workup are not eligible for the study . Subjects negative for TB per workup (no signs of latent or active TB)may be randomized to the trial. 6.2.1.4 Treatment of latent TB and safety monitoring In case of latent TB, patients who elect to remain in the trial will receive TB proph ylaxis treatment according to local guidelines. T he following recommendations are based on WHO guidelines and are considered guidance, unless local regulations suggest different approaches. If a 6 month 5 mg/kg/per day INH TB proph ylaxis is prescribed according WHO guidelines used in China (WHO 2015) , patients are required to undergo monthly LFT monitoring. The INH treatment will be continued for 6 months. The INH treatment should be halted in the following situations: ï·ALT â¥ 5 x ULN ï·ALT â¥ 3 x ULN and presence of symptoms (e.g. general malaise, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting )"

If regimens that donât include INH are chosen to treat latent TB, then monitoring of LFTs will be necessary in the case of regimens including rifam ycins (e.g., rifampicin, rifapentine, or rifabutine ), pyrazinamide, or their analogs; in such cases, management of abnormal LFTs should be performed using the example for INH, above. 6.2.2 Other baseline characteristics Baseline characteristic data to be collected on all subjects include (all laboratory results are central except where indicated ): ECG, vital signs; hematology ; clinical chemistry ; local urinaly sis; local stool ova and parasite evaluation; serum pregnancy test; medical history of anaph ylactic; history of contraindications to diphenhydramine ; immunogenicity ; in clinic UAS; DL QI. 6.3 Treatment exposure and compliance All doses of study treatment administration will be recorded on the appropriate Dosage Administration Record eCRF page. Compliance will be assessed by unblinded field monitor at each visit using vials (omal izumab and omalizumab placebo) counts and information provided by the unblinded pharmacist or unblinded authorized site staff responsible for treatment dispensation and preparation. 6.4 Efficacy A number of efficacy variables will be assessed during the study . During each visit, the assessment will be started with patient reported outcomes (PRO) (DLQI )and then move to other assessments and laboratory assessment. 6.4.1 eDiary assessments 6.4.1.1 Number of hives, intensity of itch, and Urticaria A ctivity Score ( UAS) The numb er of hives, and intensity of itch score will be recorded by the patient twice daily (morning and evening )in their eDiary, on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe) ( see Table 6-2). The UAS is a composite score of the number of wheals (hives ) (Hives Severit y Scores, HSS ); and the severity of the itch (Itch Severity Scores, ISS ). Table 6-2 Urticaria A ctivity Score (UAS) Score Wheals ( Hives ) Pruritu s (Itch) 0 None None 1 Mild (1- 6 hives/12 hours ) Mild ( minimal awareness, easily tolerated ) 2 Moderate (7-12/12 hours ) Moderate (definite awareness, bothersome but tolerable ) 3 Severe (> 12 hives/12 hours ) Severe ( difficult to tolerate )"
42,page_42,"Nova rtis Confidential Page 43 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 6.4.1.1.1 Hives Severity Score ( HSS) The wheals (hives )severity score (HSS), defined by number of hives, will be recorded by the patient twice daily in their eDiary , on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe ) (see Table 6 -2). Aweekl y score (HSS7 )is derived by adding up the average daily scores of the 7 days preceding the visit. The possible range of the weekly score is therefore 0 â 21. Complete hives response is defined as HSS7 = 0. When either the morning or evening score is missing, the non-missing score for that day (morning or evening )will be used as the daily score. When one or more of the daily scores are missing, the following principles will be applied to handle the mis sing data: If a patient has at least 4 non-missing daily scores within the 7 days prior to the study visit, theweekl y score is calculated as the sum of the available eDiary scores in that week, divided bythe number of days that have a non-missing diary score, multiplied by 7. If there are less than 4 non-missing daily scores within the prior 7 day s, then the weekly score is missing for the week. 6.4.1.1.2 Itch Severity Score (ISS) The severity of the itch will be recorded by the patient twice daily in their eDiary , on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe) ( see Table 6-2). A weekl y score (ISS7 )is derived by adding up the average daily scores of the 7 day s preceding the visit. The possible range of the weekly score is therefore 0 â21. Partially missing diary entries will be handled in the same way as described for the hives severity score. Complete itch response is defined as ISS7 = 0. Weekly itch severit y score MID response is defined as a reduction from basel ine in weekly itch severit y score of at least 5 points. Time to weekly itch severity score MID response is the time (in weeks )from the date of the first dose to the date where weekly itch severit y score MID response is first achieved. 6.4.1.1.3 The weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7 ) The UAS7 is the sum of the HSS7 score and the ISS7 score. The possible range of the weekly UAS7 score is 0 â 42. Complete UAS7 response is defined as UAS7 = 0. UAS7 MID response is defined as a reduction from baseline in UAS7 of at least 11 points. Time to UAS7 MID response is the time (in weeks) from the date of the first dose to the date where UAS7 MID response is first achieved. Week 12 responders are defined as patients who achieve an absolute UAS7 less than or equal to 6 at Week 12."

Patients rate their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives. An overall score will be calculated as well as separate scores for the following domains: Symptoms and Feelings, Daily Activities, Leisure, Work and School, Personal Relationships, Treatment. The minimally important difference of the overall DLQI score for patients with CSU has been estimated to be 2.24â3.10 (Shikiar et al 2005) .DLQI questionnaire will be provided in Chinese language, and be assessed at the site; The questionnaire will be completed by the patients unobserved. 6.4.3 Appropriateness of efficacy assessments Efficacy will be determined using the primary endpoint of change from baseline in the weekl y itch severit y score at Week 12. Assessment of itch is the symptom of greatest concern to patients, with greatest impact on their qualit y of life (Mathias et al 2010) . Because the chief CSU symptoms are hives and intense itch, it is appropriate to evaluate clinical response through use of the UAS, a composite endpoint that measures both of these symptoms. UAS7 is therefore incorporated as a secondary endpoint. Time to onset of the clinical effect (ISS7 MID and UAS7 MID )of treatment with omalizumab will be evaluated during the treatment epoch. Time to onset of clinical effect is important to establish so that guidance can be given to patients regarding when a response should be expected. Disease recurrence after study drug is withdrawn will be measured during this study . For all patients, symptom scores will be measured during both the treatment and post-treatment follow -up epochs. This important information will be used along with data from other studies to provide guidance for the duration of therap y. 6.5 Safet y 6.5.1 Physical examination A complete physical examination will include the examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid) , eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, vascular and neurological. If indicated based on medical history and/or sy mptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, and pelvic exams will be performed. A short physical exam will include the examination of general appearance and vital signs (blood pressure [SBP and DBP] and pulse ). A short phy sical exam will be at all visits starting from visit 3 except where a complete ph ysical examination is required (see above )."
45,page_45,"Nova rtis Confidential Page 46 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 Information for all phy sical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the study site. Clinically relevant findings that are present prior to signing informed consent must be included in the Medical History part of the CRF. Significant findings made after first administration of investigational drug which meet the definition of an Adverse Event must be recorded on the Adverse Event section of the CRF. 6.5.2 Vital signs Vital signs include BP and pulse measurements. After the patient has been sitting for five minutes, with back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured using an automated validated device, e.g., OMRON, with an appropriatel y sized cuff. In case the cuff sizes available are not large enough for the patientâs arm circumference, a sphygmomanometer with an appropriatel y sized cuff may be used. Clinically notable vital signs are defined in Appendix 1 . 6.5.3 Height and weight Height in centimeters (cm)and body weight (to the nearest 0.1 kilogram (kg)in indoor clothing, but without shoes ) will be measured. 6.5.4 Laboratory evaluations A central laboratory will be used for analy sis of all specimens collected. Details on the collections, shipment of samples and reporting of results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the laboratory manual. Clinically notable laboratory findings are defined in Appendix 1 . 6.5.4.1 Hematology Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential counts, and platelet count will be measured. 6.5.4.2 Clinical chemistry Sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonates, glucose, BUN, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, ALT, AST, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine phosphokinase, and uric acid will be measured. 6.5.4.3 Urinaly sis A midstream urine sample (approximately 30 ml) will be obtained, in order to avoid contamination with epithelial cells and sediments, and allow proper assessments. Semi quantitative 'dipstick' evaluation for the following parameters will be performed. Specific gravity , pH, glucose, protein, bilirubin, ketones, nitrite, leucocy te and blood. 6.5.4.4 Anti-omalizumab antibodies At Visit 101 an anti-omalizumab antibody level will be measured on all patients prior to first dosing. Patients are also instructed to return to the clinic for an anti-omalizumab antibody blood sample 12 weeks after their last administration (Visit 299 ). The 12-week waiting period"

The preferred sequence of cardiovascul ar data collection during study visits is ECG collection first, followed by vital signs, and blood samplin g. The Fridericia QT correction formula (QTcF )should be used for clinical decisions. Single 12 lead ECGs are collected. The original ECGs and a certified copy on non- heat sensitive paper, appropriately signed, must be collected and archived at the study site. Each ECG tracing must be labeled with study number, subject initials, subject number, date and time, and filed in the study site source documents. For any ECGs with subject safet y concerns, two additional ECGs must be performed to confirm the safet y finding. Clinicall y significant ECG findings at baseline must be discussed with the sponsor before administration of study treatment. Clinically significant abnormalities must be recorded on the relevant section of the medical history /Current medical conditions/AE CRF / e (CRF )page as appropriate. 6.5.6 Pregnancy and assessments All pre-menopausal women who are not surgically sterile will have pregnancy testing. Additional pregnancy testing might be performed if requested by local requirement s. Any females with a confirmed serum positive pregnancy test during screening are not eligible for randomization. All pre-menopausal females who are not sterile at screening will also have a urine pregnanc y test performed locall y at Visits 101, 102, 103, 199 and 299. A positive urine pregnancy test during the treatment epoch of the study requires immediate interruption of study treatment until serum Î²-hCG is performed and found to be negative. If the serum Î²-hCG test is positive, study treatment must be discontinued, as described in Section 5.5.9. 6.5.7 Appropriateness of safety measurements The safet y assessments selected in this study are reliable and standard measured for a biologic immunomodulating agent in adult and adolescent subjects with CSU."

Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational )product. In addition, all reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered an adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non-directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study . Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the patient during or between visits or through physical examina tion findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: ï·they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms, ï·they are considered clinically significant, ï·they require therapy . Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non-typical in patient with underly ing disease. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual patient and identify ing adverse events. Alert ranges for labor atory and other test abnormalities are included in Appendix 1. Adverse events must be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by the following information: ï·the severit y grade ï·mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities ï·moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities ï·severe: prevents normal activities ï·its relationship to the study treatment ï·Yes ï·No ï·its duration ( start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported."

Information about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safet y profile of the medicinal product that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an Investigator Notification (IN) or an Aggregate Safet y Finding. New informatio n might require an update to the informed consent and has then to be discussed with the patient. The investigator must also instruct each patient to report any new adverse event (beyond the protocol observation period )that the patient, or the patientâs personal physician, believes might reasonabl y be related to study treatment. This information must be recorded in the investigatorâs source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported to Novartis. 7.2 Serious adverse events 7.2.1 Definition of SA E An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing )] undesirable sign(s), symptom (s)or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following criteria: ï·is fatal or life -threatening ï·results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity ï·constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect ï·requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for:"

All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under âmedically significantâ if other seriousness criteria are not met. Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (please refer to Annex I V, ICH -E2D Guideline ). Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse ( please refer to Annex I V, ICH-E2D Guideline ). Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. 7.2.2 SAE reporting To ensure patient safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days after the last study visitmust be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. A ny SAEs experienced after the 30 day period after the last study visit should only be reported to Novartis if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered comp letely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE omalizumab and complete the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form within 24 hours to Novartis. Detailed instructions regarding the submissio n process and requirements for signature are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site."
50,page_50,"Nova rtis Confidential Page 51 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 Follow -up information is submitted as instructed in the investigator folder. Each re- occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient conti nued or withdrew from study participation. If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigatorâs Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence )and is thought to be related to the study treatment a Drug Safet y and Epidemiology Department associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN)to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in particip ating countries. 7.3 Liver safety monitoring As omalizumab is not associated with hepatotoxic potential no specific liver safet y monitoring is needed in this trial in patients who do not require treatment for latent TB. 7.4 Renal safety monitoring As omalizumab is not associated with kidney toxicity potential no specific renal safet y monitoring is needed in this trial. 7.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administrat ion or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient or consumer ( EMA definition). Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriatel y used not in accordance with the protocol. Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, which is accompanied by harmful ph ysical or psy chological effects. Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in thedose administration record (DAR )eCRF irrespective of whether or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to Safety only if associated with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the safety database irrespective ofit being associated with an AE/SAE."

The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy must be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the local Novartis Drug Safet y and Epidemiology Department. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment. Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form. 8 Data revie w and database management 8.1 Site monitoring Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigatorâs meeting, a Novartis representative will review the protocol and CRFs with t he investigators and their staff. During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality /integrity of the sitesâ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the (e)CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personne l must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each siteâs data may be performed by a centralized Novartis CRA organization. Additionally , a central analy tics organization may analyze data, identify risks and trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis Clinical Teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records )containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or"
52,page_52,"Nova rtis Confidential Page 53 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the patient's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by the patient (a signed copy is given to the patient ). The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the CRF entries. Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the patients/subjects will be disclosed. 8.2 Data collection Novartis will suppl y the investigator site with a computer loaded with Electronic Data Capture (EDC )software that has been fully validated and conforms to US CRF 21 Part 11 requirements. Investigator site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained by Novartis personnel. Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the Novartis CRFs using the Novartis -supplied computer. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies in the CRF s and, by generating appropriate error messages, allow the data to be confirmed or corrected by the investigator staff before transfer of the data to Novartis via a secure Virtual Private Network. The investigator must certify that the data entered are complete and accurate by signing a memo generated at the end of the trial that will be sent to him by Novartis personnel. After database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the patient data for archiving at the investigational site. 8.3 Database managem ent and quality control Novartis staff [or CRO working on behalf of Novartis] review the data entered into the CRFs by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy and instruct the site personnel to make any required corrections or additions. Queri es are sent to the investigational site using an electronic data query . Designated investigator site staff is required to respond to the query and confirm or correct the data. If the electronic query system is not used, a paper Data Query Form will be faxe d to the site. Site personnel will complete and sign the faxed copy and fax it back to Novartis staff that will make the correction to the database. The signed copy of the Data Query Form is kept at the investigator site. Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Concomitant procedures, non-drug therapies and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulator y activities (MedDRA )terminology . Laboratory samples will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronicall y to Novartis ( or a designated CRO ). Diary data will be entered into an electronic diary by the patient OR Patients/subjects will fill in their patient reported outcome (PRO )data in a site based tablet. The system will be"
53,page_53,"Nova rtis Confidential Page 54 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 supplied by a vendor (s), who will also manage the database. The databa se will be sent electronically to Novartis personnel ( or designated CRO ) . Randomization codes and data about all study drug(s)dispensed to the patient and all dosage changes will be tracked using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). The system will be supplied by a vendor, who will also manage the database. The database will be sent electronically to Novartis (or a designated CRO ). Each occurrence of a code break via IRT will be reported to the clinical team and monitor. The code break functionality will remain available until study shut down or upon request of Novartis. The occurrence of relevant protocol deviations will be determined. After these actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked and the treatment codes will be unblinded and made available for data analysis. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written agreement by Novartis Development management. 8.4 Data Monitoring Committee Not required. 8.5 Adjudic ation Committee An independent adjudication committee will be used to monitor anaph ylaxis. The events will be reviewed in a blinded manner and adjudicated as they occur during the conduct of the study . Details regarding the adjudication process are availa ble in the relevant Anaph ylaxis Adjudication Committee charter. 9 Data analy sis The analysis will be conducted on all subject data at the time the trial ends. Any data analysis carried out independently by the investigator should be submitted to Novartis before publication or presentation. 9.1 Analysis sets Randomized population (RAN) : The RAN will include all randomized subjects, regardless of whether they took any study medication. Patients in RAN will be analy zed according to the treatment assigned at random ization. Full analysis set (FAS ): The FAS will include all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. Following the intent -to-treat principle, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they are assigned to at randomization. This analysis population will be used for all efficacy analy ses unless otherwise specified. Safety set (SAF ): The SAF consists of all subjects in the FAS who take at least one dose of study medication. Subjects will be analy zed according to the actual treatment received during the randomized treatment epoch, as follows:"

Significant surgery and medical procedures will be summarized by primary system organ class and MedDRA preferred term. 9.4 Analysis of the primary variable (s) Analy ses will be based on the patients in FAS, unless otherwise specified. 9.4.1 Variable (s) The primary efficacy variable is change from baseline in weekly itch severity score (ISS7, a component of the UAS7, see Section 6.4.1.1) at Week 12. The daily itch score is the average of the morning and evening itch severit y scores. The baseline ISS7 is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over the 7 days prior to the randomization Day 1 visit, and the ISS7 at Week 12 is the sum of daily itch scores over the 7 days prior to the Week 12 visit. The same principles of calculating baseline and Week 12 weekl y scores will be applied to each weekl y outcome unless otherwise stated . 9.4.2 Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analy sis Amixed -effect linear model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to obtain the least squares mean (LSM )estimate for each treatment group for change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 12 (the primary endpoint ). The MMRM model will include terms of treatment group, week (1 to 12), baseline score, baseline score -by- week interaction, and treatment -by-week interaction as fixed effects. Treatment group and week will be fitted as categorical variables, and baseline score as a continuous covariate . The within -patient correlation will be modeled using the unstructured covariance matrix (Mallinc krodt et al 2001). If the model does not converge, the compound symmetry covariance structure will be used. The occurrence of missing data will be assumed to be missing at random ( MAR ). The difference in LSM estimates between treatment groups, together with a 95% CI, will be presented. A multiplicity adjustment for two primary efficacy comparisons based on above model will be made according to the overall study testing strategy provided in Section 9.5.1 . The statistical analyses will test the null hypothesis of no difference between the placebo and each omalizumab dose group."

Patients who have at least one post-baseline are included in the MMRM analysis. This includes not only the patients who have completed 12 weeks of treatment (with a complete 12-week longitudinal data) , but also those who discontinue from study treatment early (although only able to contribute to a partial time profile ). This is under the assumption that dropouts would follow the similar data pattern like other patients who complete the treatment period in the same treatment group, as if they had not discontinued from the study treatment. Patients who discontinue from study treatment early will remain in the study and follow the procedures described in Section 5.5.9. Nevertheless, the data on and post the date of the last treatment + 4 weeks will be treated as missing in the pr imary anal ysis. The ISS7 is the sum of the average daily itch scores over 7 days each week. The daily itch scores are calculated based on daily eDiary entries for itch. The daily itch score is then calculated as the average of the morning and evening itch scores. When either the morning or evening score is missing, the non-missing itch score for that day (morning or evening )will be used as the daily score. When one or more of the daily itch scores are missing, the following principles will be applied to h andle the missing data: ï·If a patient has at least 4 non -missing daily itch scores within the 7 days prior to the study visit, the ISS7 score is calculated as the sum of the available eDiary itch scores in that week, divided by the number of days that have a non-missing diary itch score, multiplied by 7. ï·If there are less than 4 non -missing daily itch scores within the prior 7 days, then the ISS7 score is missing for the week. 9.4.4 Sensitivity analy ses The impact of missing data on the primary analysis results will be assessed by repeating the analysis using different missing data assumptions to handle missing data. The supportive analyses may include, but are not limited to: ï·An analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) model with missing Week 12 itch scores imputed by carrying forward the patientsâ baseline scores (BOCF ). The ANCOVA model would include treatment group asafactor, and baseline score as a covariate. ï·An ANCOVA model with m issing Week 12 itch scores imputed by carry ing forward the patientsâ last non -missing weekl y score (LOCF ).The ANCOVA model would include treatment group as factor s, and baseline score as a covariate. ï·Jump -to-Reference (J2R) multiple imputation approach 9.5 Analysis of secondary variables 9.5.1 Efficacy variables All of the secondary efficacy variab les will be analy zed using the FAS unless otherwise specified."
57,page_57,"Nova rtis Confidential Page 58 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 Testing strategy The following primary and secondary hypotheses will be included in the testing strategy . To ensure the famil y-wise type I error rate (Î±)is kept at an overall level of less than 5%, a flexible gate-keeping procedure (Bretz et al 2009) will be employ ed as described below. The procedure allows the type-one error rate associated with a rejected hypothesis to be reallocated among the remaining ( un-rejected )hypothesis tests according to a set of pre- specified rules. The hypotheses are organized to describe the order in which different sets of hypotheses will be tested. Primary objectives (as described in Section 9.4): H1: Omalizumab 300mg is not different to placebo with respect to change from baseline in ISS7 (weekly itch severity score )at Week 12 H2: O malizumab 150mg is not different to placebo with respect to change from baseline in ISS7 (weekly itch sever ity score )at Week 12 Secondary objectives: H3: O malizumab 300mg is not different to placebo with respect to change from baseline in UAS7 (weekl y urticaria activity score )at Week 12 H4: O malizumab 150mg is not different to placebo with respect to change from baseline in UAS7 (weekl y urticaria activity score )at Week 12 H5: O malizumab 300mg is not different to placebo with respect to change from baseline in NHS7 (weekl y number of hives score )at Week 12 H6: O malizumab 150mg is not different to placebo with respect to change from baseline in NHS7 (weekl y number of hives score )at Week 12 H7: O malizumab 300mg is not different to placebo with respect to the percentage of patients with UAS7 â¤6 response at Week 12 H8: O maliz umab 150mg is not different to placebo with respect to the percentage of patients with UAS7 â¤6 response at Week 12 H9: Omalizumab 300mg is not different to placebo with respect to the percentage of patients with UAS7 =0 response at Week 12 H10: Omalizu mab 150mg is not different to placebo with respect to the percentage of patients with UAS7 =0 response at Week 12 H11: Omalizumab 300mg is not different to placebo with respect to the percentage of patients with ISS7 MID response at Week 12 H12: Omalizumab 150mg is not different to placebo with respect to the percentage of patients with I SS7 MID response at Week 12 H13: Omalizumab 300mg is not different to placebo with respect to change from baseline in overall DLQI score at Week 12 H14: Omalizumab 150mg is not different to placebo with respect to change from baseline in overall DLQI score at Week 12"

59,page_59,"Nova rtis Confidential Page 60 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 The family -wise error rate will be set to Î± =5% (2-sided )and will be controlled using the proposed hierar chical testing strategy as illustrated in Figure 9 -1. First, each of the hypotheses ( H1and H2)for the primary objective (based on change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 12)for omalizumab 300mg and 150mg versus placebo will be tested simultaneously at Î±/2. If at least one of H1and/or H2isrejected, then H3and/or H 4, respectivel y, will be tested at Î±/2. If at least one of H3and/or H4isrejected, then H5and/or H6, will be tested, respectivel y. A similar process applies until H15and H16. Once all hypotheses for anomalizumab dose are rejected, then the respective Î±/2 can be passed on to the other doseâs hypotheses, if they are not alread y rejected at Î±/2. In the description above, rejection of a hypo thesis refers to rejection of the two-sided hypothesis; however the significance level of a rejected hypothesis is only passed on according to the graphical procedure for the test of another hy pothesis if the treatment effect is in favor of omalizumab . Change from baseline in weekly urticarial activity score ( UAS7)at Week 12 The urticaria activity score (UAS )is a composite score (itch severit y score and number of hives score )described inSection 6.4.1.1. For each of the morning and evening UAS score, it is calculated as the sum of the itch severit y score and number of hives score according to eDiary entries. The daily UASis the average of the morning and evening UAS scores , and UAS7 is the sum of daily UAS scores over 7 day s. The missing data will be handled in the same way as described in Section 9.4.3 . Treatment comparisons of 300mg vs placebo ( H3)and 150mg vs placebo ( H4)in change from baseline to Week 12 in the UAS7 will be made using an MMRM model with similar terms as the primary analy sis but baseline UAS7 as a covariate (Refer to Section 9.4.2 ). Change from baseline in weekly number of hives score (NHS7 )at Week 12 The weekl y number of hives score (NHS7 )will be handled using the same principles as described for the primary endpoint in Section 9.4.1 and Section 9.4.3. Treatment comparisons of 300mg vs placebo ( H5)and 150mg vs placebo (H 6)in change from baseline to Week 12 in the NHS7 will be made using an MMRM model with similar terms as the primary analy sis but baseline NHS7 as a covariate (Refer to Section 9.4.2 ). Percentage of patients with UA S7â¤6 at Week 12 Treatment comparisons of 300mg vs placebo ( H7)and 150mg vs placebo (H 8)in the percentage of patients with UAS7 â¤ 6 at Week 12 will be made using a logistic regression model with tr eatment group as a factor and baseline UAS7 as a covariate.

66,page_66,"Nova rtis Confidential Page 67 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CIGE025E2305 The below power evaluation for the planned hypothesis tests is based on a sample size of 375 (2:2:1 ) patients who complete 12 weeks of treatment duration. The powers are examined according to the hierarchy order of the multiplicity type I error control plan with the overall alpha level controlled at 0.05 (2- sided )as outlined in Figure 9-1. It is assumed Study E2305 will repeat the performance of the previous pivotal studies (Q4881g, Q4882g, and E2306 ). Except for ethnicit y, these 3 studies have a similar patient population with consistent results for the prim ary and secondary endpoints. There is no statistical evidence suggesting heterogeneity among the studies. A meta -analy sis with fixed -effects model was performed based on summary data from these studies to combine the estimates of the treatment effect and standard deviation (SD). The obtained pooled estimates on the treatment effect size and SD are then used as the assumed values for the alternative hypotheses to evaluate the power for each endpoint. To understand the impact of the strength of dependency bet ween endpoints on the power, the power was evaluated under 3 scenarios of correlation (0, 0.5, 0.9 ), i.e. completely independency , moderate dependency , and strong dependency . The results are summarized in Table 9 -1. For theprimary endpoint (change from baseline weekl y itch score at Week 12), the study will offer ï·a power of > 99.9% to detect a difference of 4.73 between 300 mg and placebo with the assumed SD of 5.28 ï·a power of > 93% to detect a difference of 2.73 between 150 mg and placebo with the assumed SD of 5.55 The power was evaluated for the primary and secondary endpoints as a whole according to the testing strategy defined in Section 9.5.1 (Figure 9-1) using the gMCP package in the R software. According to Table 9 -1, the power evaluation is summarized as follows. ï·The power for 300 mg is maintained at nearly 95% and above for all testing hypotheses regar dless of the strength of dependency between endpoints. ï·The power for 150 mg is at least 80% for the testing hypotheses up to the endpoint of percentage of patients with UAS7 â¤ 6 at Week 12. The power for the rest of endpoints is decreased to 65% and below , and can be as low as 18% if the dependency between endpoints is none. By reviewing and using clinical data from previous studies in the power assessment for the targeted hypothesis tests for the current study , the total sample size of 420 (including 10% dropout )with 2:2:1 assignment ratio is considered appropriate to allow sufficient power to achieve the primary objective and all the first four secondary objectives for both 300 mg and 150 mg. The study also has high power to achieve the last four second ary objectives for 300 mg, although the power is < 65% and below for 150mg.
